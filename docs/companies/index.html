However, as technology becomes more focused toward round-the-clock production, the modern workplace increasingly presents dilemmas that pit people’s roles, values, and desires against each other.</p><p>This rising tide of inner conflict isn't surprising.

These conflicts manifest as tension between what we think we should do and what we want to do, creating moral dilemmas that challenge our self-awareness. This differs from external conflict, where we battle external forces like circumstances or other people.</p><p>Writers often use various types of internal conflict to drive character arcs. Writing tips from skilled authors remind us that the most compelling stories feature characters whose internal struggles mirror our own experiences with personal growth. In our own character development, we might face similar conflicts. </p><p>A classic example is the struggle between career advancement and work-life balance—like a professional weighing whether to take a higher-paying job that requires more time away from loved ones. Here, the character's internal conflict (ambition versus personal values) often intertwines with external forces (workplace demands versus family needs).</p><p>The different types of internal conflict we face include:</p>  <p>Moral conflict between competing ethical principles</p>  <p>Self-doubt about our abilities or choices</p>  <p>Cognitive dissonance between beliefs and actions</p>  <p>Personal growth challenges that test our self-image</p>  <p>Examples of internal conflict in professional settings often mirror those found in a good story: the ambitious employee torn between advancement and ethical concerns, or the team leader struggling with difficult decisions about resource allocation. These inner struggles create compelling character arcs in both fiction and real life.</p> Common Causes of Internal Conflict <p>Understanding why we face such inner turmoil helps in resolving internal conflicts effectively. Research in psychological literature identifies several common triggers that any main character in their own life story might face:</p><p>Value Conflicts: When different personal values compete for priority, creating moral dilemmas. For instance, valuing both honesty and loyalty can create conflict when keeping a friend's secret would mean being dishonest with others.</p><p>Decision Paralysis: The tension created when multiple good (or bad) options exist, each with their own advantages and drawbacks. This often occurs in career decisions, relationship choices, or major life changes.</p><p>Role Conflicts: When different roles in life demand conflicting behaviors or time commitments. A common example is balancing professional responsibilities with personal relationships or self-care.</p><p>Identity Transitions: During periods of personal growth or change, internal conflict often arises between old patterns and new aspirations. This is particularly common during career changes or relationship evolutions.</p> Signs of Unresolved Internal Conflict <p>Recognizing internal conflict is the first step toward resolving it. Research from the American Institute of Stress identifies several common indicators that internal conflict may be affecting someone's well-being.</p><p>In emotional terms, persistent anxiety, irritability, and mood swings often signal unresolved internal conflict. People might notice themselves feeling constantly unsettled or unsatisfied, even when external circumstances are relatively stable. Many report a sense of being "stuck" or unable to move forward with decisions.</p><p>Behaviorally, internal conflict often manifests as procrastination, indecisiveness, or inconsistent actions. Someone might repeatedly change their mind about important decisions, or find themselves unable to stick to resolutions they've made. Sleep disturbances are another common sign, with studies showing that unresolved internal conflict can reduce sleep quality by up to 30%.</p><p>Physical manifestations can include tension headaches, digestive issues, and muscle tension—particularly in the neck and shoulders. These symptoms often worsen during periods when the internal conflict feels most pressing.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F347e58aa-2d2e-488d-a63b-f8e7b995152d_3264x1942.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@youssefnaddam?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">youssef naddam</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/two-persons-arms-iJ2IG8ckCpA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  Evidence-Based Strategies for Conflict Resolution <p>Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience has identified several effective approaches to resolving internal conflict and cognitive dissonance. These strategies don't just provide temporary relief—they help build lasting resilience and decision-making confidence.</p><p>While seeing a mental health professional can be beneficial during times of extreme internal conflict, sometimes that can be too costly or impractical. It’s also helpful to learn how to work through it individually, so that it can be more efficiently dealt with.</p><p>The current science suggests three main approaches:</p><p>1. Changing conflicting behavior to align with values</p><p>2. Updating beliefs to accommodate necessary behaviors</p><p>3. Adding new information that bridges the gap between beliefs and actions</p><p>For the first, one powerful approach comes from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is a type of talking therapy that helps patients recognise and follow their personal values.<a>1</a> This involves deeply examining what truly matters to someone—beyond surface-level preferences or societal expectations—by asking them to open up and examine all of their thoughts, reactions, and feelings.</p><p>For the second, cognitive restructuring can be a helpful exercise. This evidence-based technique involves examining and challenging the thoughts underlying internal conflicts, and proposing plausible alternatives to uncomfortable beliefs. This might mean questioning whether moving for a new job is inherently negative, or whether a difficult conversation at work really will end a relationship—and considering possible and less extreme situations instead.<a>2</a></p><p>For the last, research as a tool is as important as ever. For example, someone in a creative tech role like the games industry might initially have an issue accepting lucrative AI support in their work. However, they may be able to bridge the gap by discovering and supporting ethical and genuinely useful AI products, rather than more environmentally-damaging AI.</p><p>Mindfulness approaches like <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/anxiety-journaling-complete-guide">Journaling</a> have also shown remarkable effectiveness, as discussed previously, as they allow people to better understand and recognize sources of conflict.</p><p>But, how does that actually get put into practice, and used to help?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa23edf9f-a938-4f59-a6b8-328e813354e2_4256x2832.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Glenn Carstens-Peters</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-writing-bucket-list-on-book-RLw-UC03Gwc?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  Creating an Internal Conflict Action Plan <p>Moving from understanding to action requires a structured approach. As we discussed in our <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">goal-setting article</a>, breaking down conflict resolution into manageable steps significantly improves outcomes. The key is creating a process that feels both comprehensive and achievable—here’s an example to begin working with:</p>  <p>Define the Conflict: Start by clearly articulating the conflict, including all competing elements. Write down not just the surface-level conflict, but the deeper values and needs at play. For instance, a conflict about taking a new job might actually be about balancing security with growth, or personal fulfilment with family responsibilities.<br><br></p>  <p>Develop Evaluation Criteria: Think about what the ideal solution might include, both practically (like salary) and emotionally (like family time). Try to be as clear as possible.<br><br></p>  <p>Examine the Assumptions Underlying the Conflict. Often, people have incorrect, unconscious beliefs that make conflicts seem worse than they are. By writing out all of the things that feel true about a dilemma, and tackling them with the methods from the last section, truth can be more easily separated from fiction. For example, the belief that a role with a new company means contact will be lost with old teammates can be challenged by the fact that many people stay friends with ex-colleagues.<br><br></p>  <p>Brainstorm Solutions: This section is easier said than done. Still, by combining the previous steps, it’s common that a solution or decision that felt unrealistic due to unconscious assumption now appears more fitting. Either way, the goal isn't to find a perfect solution—research shows that aiming for ‘good enough’ decisions that honor our core values leads to better outcomes than pursuing perfection.<a>3</a></p>  <p>Even with all of the above support, however, trying to resolve internal conflict independently can be a long and stressful process.

<p>Bitcoin has had a wild journey since it first appeared in 2009. It’s gone from being worth just a few cents to reaching nearly $110,000 at its peak. With so many ups and downs, it’s no surprise that people are always asking: “What will Bitcoin be worth in 2025?” or “What is the realistic Bitcoin price prediction?” In this post, we’ll dive into Bitcoin’s past performance, what experts are saying about its future, and what factors could shape Bitcoin predictions in the years ahead.</p>

 Bitcoin’s Performance Over the Years 



<p>Bitcoin’s price history is nothing short of a rollercoaster. When it first launched, it was almost worthless. Fast forward to 2017, and<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Why-is-cryptocurrency-rising-and-bitcoin-at-an-all-time-high#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20bitcoin%20surged%20from,the%20end%20of%20the%20year."> Bitcoin hit $20,000,</a> only to fall back down. But every time it seemed like Bitcoin might fade away, it bounced back stronger. By 2021, it soared to nearly $65,000 before experiencing another dip.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin continues to gain attention, more and more people are asking “How much will 1 Bitcoin be worth in 5 years?” Bitcoin has shown growth over the years, but its price is also incredibly volatile, which is why predicting its future isn’t easy. For example, market events like major companies investing in Bitcoin or countries announcing regulations can dramatically influence its price.</p>

 What Experts Are Saying About Bitcoin Predictions 



<p>Many experts have different opinions on Bitcoin’s future. Some are optimistic, predicting that Bitcoin could continue to rise in value, especially as more businesses and investors get involved. Others are more cautious, pointing out the risks, like its volatility and the uncertainty around regulation.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering, “What is the realistic Bitcoin price prediction?” you’ll find a wide range of answers. Some say Bitcoin could hit $200,000 or even $500,000 in the next few years. Others believe that it might stabilize around $75,000. One thing that many experts agree on is that Bitcoin’s price will likely continue to grow over time, but it’s not going to be a smooth ride.</p>



 Expert Predictions for Bitcoin’s Future 



 Matrixport 



<p>Financial firm Matrixport predicts that Bitcoin will reach $160,000 by 2025. Markus Thielen, the company’s Chief Research Officer, believes that stable demand from Bitcoin spot ETFs, favorable macroeconomic trends, and the expansion of global liquidity will drive Bitcoin’s price to new heights.</p>



 Galaxy Digital 



<p>Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, forecasts that Bitcoin could exceed $150,000 by mid-2025, eventually reaching $185,000 by the fourth quarter. Thorn attributes this expected rise to growing acceptance of Bitcoin by institutions, businesses, and even governments, which will play a crucial role in pushing Bitcoin to new price levels.</p>



 Maple Finance 



<p>Sid Powell, CEO of Maple Finance, projects that Bitcoin could range from $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of 2025. Powell believes that the influx of capital into Bitcoin ETFs will continue to increase as Bitcoin becomes a key asset for institutional investors.</p>



 Standard Chartered 



<p>Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, provides an ambitious prediction that Bitcoin may reach $200,000 in 2025. He suggests that institutional investor demand will remain strong, particularly as pension funds begin adding Bitcoin to their portfolios through Bitcoin ETFs.</p>



 Nexo 



<p>Elitsa Taskova from Nexo is the most optimistic, predicting that Bitcoin could rise to $250,000 by the end of 2025. Taskova attributes this forecast to increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a reserve asset and favorable macroeconomic factors, which could propel Bitcoin past gold within the next decade.</p>


 
 


 4 Factors That Could Impact Bitcoin’s Price 



<p>There are a few things that could affect Bitcoin’s price in the future, and it’s important to keep these in mind:</p>



 
 Market Adoption: The more businesses and people use Bitcoin, the more its price could rise. If Bitcoin becomes a mainstream asset, like gold, it could see its value increase significantly.<br> 



 Regulation: Governments around the world are still figuring out how to handle Bitcoin. Regulations will play a huge role in Bitcoin’s future. If countries decide to embrace it, the price could rise; if they decide to restrict or ban it, we could see a price drop.<br> 



 Technology: Bitcoin’s technology is constantly evolving. Improvements to its blockchain, like the Lightning Network, could make Bitcoin faster and more practical for everyday use, which would boost its value.<br> 



 Global Economy: Inflation and the value of traditional currencies will also influence Bitcoin. In times of economic instability, Bitcoin has been seen as a safe haven for people looking to protect their wealth, which could push its value up.<br> 
 


 
 


 5 Risks and Challenges to Keep in Mind Trading Bitcoins 



<p>Bitcoin can be an exciting investment, but it’s not without risks. Here are some key challenges to consider:</p>



 Volatility 



<p>Bitcoin is known for its wild price swings. Its price can rise or fall thousands of dollars in a short period, which can be great for those looking for quick profits but risky for long-term investors. These price movements are driven by market sentiment, news, and global events, making Bitcoin unpredictable in both the short and long term.</p>



 Security Issues 



<p>While Bitcoin’s blockchain is secure, exchanges and wallets are vulnerable to hacks. High-profile attacks on exchanges have led to millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin being stolen. If you’re holding Bitcoin on an exchange, you’re at risk, which is why using secure methods like hardware wallets is essential.</p>



 Market Manipulation 



<p>Bitcoin’s price is also affected by large holders, known as “whales.” These whales can influence the market by buying or selling large amounts of Bitcoin, causing sudden price changes. This makes Bitcoin’s price more susceptible to manipulation, which adds an extra layer of unpredictability.</p>



 Competition from Other Cryptos 



<p>While Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency, it faces growing competition from others like Ethereum, which offer unique features. These cryptocurrencies may eventually challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, which could affect its market share and price.</p>



 Regulation 



<p>Governments are still figuring out how to regulate Bitcoin. Countries like China have imposed bans, while others are adopting Bitcoin more openly. New regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price, either positively or negatively, depending on how they are implemented.</p>

 Conclusion 



<p>Bitcoin’s future is full of possibilities, but it’s also uncertain. As we’ve discussed, there are many factors that could shape Bitcoin’s price, from adoption rates and regulations to technological advancements. While predictions like “Will Bitcoin reach $10 million?” are exciting, we need to take them with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>What we can say for sure is that Bitcoin has the potential to grow, and it will likely continue to be a major player in the world of finance. But as with any investment, there are risks. If you’re looking to invest in Bitcoin, make sure you understand both the rewards and the risks.</p>

<p>Trump NFTs have caught the attention of many, offering a way to own a piece of the former president’s legacy in the digital world. Launched in 2022, these NFTs have sparked interest from both fans and investors. But are they really a good investment? In this blog, we’ll take a closer look at how Trump NFTs have performed, the risks and rewards, and whether they’re a smart investment choice.</p>

 Trump NFTs: A Quick Overview 



<p>Trump NFTs are digital collectibles tied to the former president’s brand. These unique, blockchain-based assets feature artwork inspired by Trump’s career and persona. Launched in late 2022, Trump NFTs include limited-edition cards and images, appealing to his supporters and investors alike.</p>



<p>Trump entered the NFT market as a way to expand his brand and tap into the growing interest in digital assets. This move also provided an opportunity to raise funds and connect with his audience in a new, innovative way. By offering these NFTs, Trump allowed fans to own a piece of his legacy, while investors saw potential for growth in these exclusive items.</p>



<p>These NFTs are closely tied to Trump’s identity as both a businessman and a political figure. For fans, owning a Trump NFT means having a part of history. For investors, they represent a chance for financial gain, driven by their rarity and celebrity backing.</p>

 How Did Trump NFTs Perform? 



<p>Since their release, Trump NFTs have had some ups and downs. Initially, they were priced at $99, but after launch, their value surged. Today, some NFTs are worth around 0.145 ETH (around $235). If you had invested $1,000 in Trump NFTs when they were first released, you could have bought 10 NFTs. Now, those 10 NFTs would be worth $2,350. This is a return of about 135% in just 10 months.</p>



<p>However, the market has been volatile. The price of these NFTs has dropped from its peak, where they were worth over $1,000 at one point. Still, the performance of these NFTs has been much better than the S&amp;P 500, which only returned 8.9% over the same period.</p>



 S&amp;P 500 vs. Trump NFTs: A Comparison 



<p>When comparing Trump NFTs to traditional investments like the S&amp;P 500, NFTs have done much better. A $1,000 investment in Trump NFTs would be worth $2,350, while the same amount invested in the S&amp;P 500 would have grown to $1,089. This shows the higher potential returns in the NFT market, but also highlights the higher risk involved.</p>



<p>The second series of these NFTs has not done as well. The value of these NFTs has dropped, with current prices around $55.92 per NFT, showing that the market can change quickly.</p>

 Pros and Cons of Trump NFTs for Coin Investors 



<p>Trump NFTs have both advantages and risks for investors. While they offer high return potential through celebrity backing and media attention, they also come with significant volatility and political controversy. Here’s a look at the pros and cons.</p>



 Pros: 



 
 Celebrity Backing: Trump’s name and brand make these NFTs attractive to collectors. 



 Potential for High Returns: With limited editions, these NFTs can rise in value, especially if interest increases. 



 Media Influence: Media attention, especially with Trump being president again, can boost the value of these NFTs. 
 



 Cons: 



 
 High Volatility: Prices can go up quickly but can also fall just as fast, making them a risky investment. 



 Political Influence: Trump’s political background can make these NFTs controversial. Some people may avoid them because of his political ties. 



 Risk of Hype: The value of thsse NFTs can be driven by media attention and public trends, making them unpredictable. 
 


 
 


 The Future of Trump NFTs: Are Trump NFTs a good investment? 



<p>The future of Trump NFTs depends on several factors, such as Trump’s political career and how the NFT market develops. If Trump’s popularity stays high, demand for his NFTs might rise. However, the NFT market is still new and unpredictable, so it’s hard to say if these NFTs will continue to increase in value.</p>



<p>For those looking to invest long-term, it’s important to consider the risks. These NFTs may offer high returns in the short term, but their value could drop as quickly as it rises. Political events and market trends will be key to whether these NFTs continue to be a good investment.</p>

 Conclusion 



<p>Trump NFTs offer a unique investment opportunity, with potential for high returns thanks to Trump’s brand and media attention. However, they also come with risks – especially given the volatility of the NFT market and Trump’s political ties. While they’ve outperformed traditional investments so far, their future remains uncertain. As with any investment, it’s important to weigh both the upsides and the risks before jumping in.</p>

 Различия между онлайн и оффлайн казино: что выбрать? 
<p>С развитием технологий азартные игры обрели новую форму существования — онлайн-казино. Но оффлайн аналог продолжают сохранять популярность благодаря своей уникальной атмосфере. В данной статье мы рассмотрим ключевые различия между этими двумя видами казино и помогем вам сделать осознанный выбор.</p>
 Атмосфера игры 
<p>В оффлайн казино атмосфера играет важную роль в игровом процессе. Реальные казино предлагают живое взаимодействие с другими игроками и дилерами, что создает уникальное ощущение живого общения и настоящей игры. В оффлайн казино вы можете почувствовать шик и блеск, которые сложно передать через экран устройства. Однако онлайн казино предлагают широкие возможности для создания персонализированной атмосферы, используя различные темы и графику.</p>
 Удобство и доступность 
<p>Онлайн казино выигрывают в плане удобства и доступности. Вы можете играть в любое время и в любом месте, имея подключение к интернету. Не требуется тратить время на дорогу до казино или поиск подходящего наряда. Онлайн платформы предлагают круглосуточную поддержку, что особенно удобно для игроков в разных часовых поясах. Оффлайн казино имеют свои преимущества, такие как возможность организовать полноценный вечер отдыха с друзьями, посетив казино вместе.</p>
 Разнообразие игр 
<p>Онлайн платформы предлагают огромное разнообразие азартных игр, от классических слотов до современных видеоигр с живыми дилерами. В оффлайн казино выбор игр может быть более ограниченным из-за физического пространства и стоимости оборудования. Основные различия между выбором игр можно описать следующим списком: <a href="https://www.sokol-adm.ru/">1вин официальный сайт</a></p>
 
 Онлайн казино имеют тысячи слотов, настольных игр и уникальных предложений. 
 Оффлайн казино фокусируются на классике: рулетка, блэкджек и покер. 
 Интерактивные функции в онлайн играх, такие как бонусные раунды и турниры, недоступны в оффлайн казино. 
 
 Безопасность и честность 
<p>Один из важных факторов, влияющих на выбор между онлайн и оффлайн казино, — это безопасность. Онлайн казино используют современные системы шифрования для защиты данных игроков и все финансовые транзакции. Кроме того, лицензированные онлайн казино регулярно проверяются независимыми аудиторами на честность. В оффлайн казино безопасность обеспечивается физическим присутствием охраны, но риск мошенничества остается. Общее представление о честности игр может быть выше в оффлайн казино благодаря изменяемым шансам и специализированному оборудованию.</p>
 Бонусы и награды 
<p>Онлайн казино предлагают широкую систему различных бонусов и наград, начиная от приветственных бонусов и заканчивая программами лояльности для постоянных игроков. В оффлайн казино бонусов намного меньше, но они могут предложить бесплатные напитки или питание как часть поощрений для своих посетителей. Онлайн казино может привлекать игроков именно разнообразием бонусов, что способствует поддержанию интереса и возвращению на платформу.</p>
 Вывод 
<p>В итоге, выбор между онлайн и оффлайн казино зависит от ваших личных предпочтений и образа жизни. Если вам важна атмосфера живого общения и реальные переживания, оффлайн казино может быть лучшим выбором. В свою очередь, если вы цените удобство, разнообразие игр и бонусов, онлайн казино является отличной альтернативой. Независимо от вашего выбора, важно помнить о мерах безопасности и разумном подходе к игровому процессу.</p>
 Часто задаваемые вопросы 
 
 Что более безопасно: онлайн или оффлайн казино? – Оба типа казино имеют свои протоколы безопасности, однако лицензированные онлайн казино часто предлагают более усиленные меры защиты данных. 
 Могу ли я играть в онлайн казино бесплатно? – Да, большинство онлайн казино предлагают демо-версии игр, где можно играть бесплатно. 
 Предлагают ли оффлайн казино бонусы? – В оффлайн казино бонусы менее распространены, но посетителям могут предложить бесплатные напитки или еду. 
 Какие игры чаще всего доступны в оффлайн казино? – Оффлайн казино обычно предлагают такие игры, как рулетка, блэкджек и покер. 
 Можно ли доверять онлайн казино? – Доверять можно только лицензированным онлайн казино, которые проверяются независимыми аудиторами и имеют положительные отзывы игроков.

<p>This piece explores the use of serious games in international development spaces, acknowledges their challenges and limitations, and considers ways to create thoughtful gaming scenarios that inspire learning and&nbsp;action.</p><p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-savita-bailur-3986801/">Dr. Savita Bailur</a> — Senior Director of Gender Equality &amp; Social Inclusion, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdtabares/">Jesús Tabares</a> — Grants &amp; Community Manager, both at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou</a>.</p> What are serious&nbsp;games? <p>Over the 2024 holiday season, many gathered with family and friends to engage in games, whether indoors or outdoors, silly or serious. (Cluedo, for instance, can feel quite serious.) The holiday season often highlights the appeal of games, from lively board game nights with family to quiet moments spent solving&nbsp;puzzles.</p><p>As routines have resumed in the new year, this “games season” may already feel distant. However, the spirit of play can continue to inspire work and creativity in areas such as development, community building, and activism. The engaging and immersive nature of games provides a unique space for critical thinking and meaningful discussions, especially when addressing issues of justice and equity. A game is “an activity that one engages in for amusement or fun.” <a href="https://www.abtglobal.com/our-people/clark-c-abt">Clark C. Abt</a> first introduced the term “serious games” in his <a href="https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780819161482/Serious-Games">1970 book</a> of the same name. He defined serious games as those that could be “played seriously or casually” with an explicit educational purpose beyond mere entertainment.</p><p>In the context of international development, serious games have emerged <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1748048518814358?icid=int.sj-abstract.citing-articles.11">as powerful tools leveraging interactive and immersive experiences</a>. Serious games have been gaining traction as transformative tools for development practitioners, and are now used to raise awareness, educate, and promote behavior change in areas such as poverty alleviation, healthcare, and environmental sustainability. Titles like <a href="http://www.peacemakergame.com/">PeaceMaker</a>, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/edutech/brief/evoke-an-online-alternate-reality-game-supporting-social-innovation-among-young-people-around-the-world">Evoke</a>, and <a href="https://ict.usc.edu/research/projects/urbansim/">UrbanSim</a> illustrate how games can drive collaboration and problem-solving by simplifying complexity and encouraging participants to engage from fresh perspectives. Similar examples are David Taverner’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/space4development-dt_hello-my-name-is-doctor-isla-campbell-activity-7183735468318982144-XlgE/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">immersive work in space and climate</a> and the Wilson Center’s <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/serious-games-initiative">Serious Games Initiative</a>, which has games on managing plastic waste and navigating AI, just to name a few. As the field continues to mature, more rigorous evaluation is needed to fully understand the opportunity and potential of serious games on development goals and to refine their application in addressing global challenges.</p>In <a href="https://gda.esa.int/2024/01/cosmopolis-a-unique-immersive-urban-environment-opens-its-doors-to-visitors/">Cosmopolis</a>, players join Dr. Isla Campbell and other fascinating characters in a journey through Sylvan Glade, learning about the use of satellite data for forest management and monitoring. In-game the fantastic world of Sylvan Glade is combined with real-life accounts of uses of satellite data.<blockquote>“The combination of play and purpose creates an environment where participants can approach challenges boldly and with greater creativity.”</blockquote><p>Serious games enable players to simulate real-world scenarios, test strategies and assumptions in hypothetical scenarios, and build empathy in a safe, risk-free environment. Games create immersive spaces where abstract challenges become tangible, and where we can lay out the complexities of issues like poverty alleviation, gender equity, or climate resilience. Through simulation, challenges, and restrictive sets of rules, games introduce scenarios that not only force practitioners to think, but create a flat structure for others to challenge our assumptions and worldviews. In a family context, this could level the “playing field” between grandparents and grandchildren. At a company level, it could be between senior leadership, consultants, administrators, etc. The constellation of gamers with different worldviews makes the experience rich. Moreover, the power of playing games is also reflected in their ability to foster inclusion and creativity; games create a shared space where participants feel safe to contribute ideas, regardless of their role or expertise. This is especially critical in collaborative environments like development practice, or when championing equity in any&nbsp;sector.</p> “Please design a session on digital and livelihoods” <p>At Caribou’s November retreat, four of us (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdtabares/">Jesús Tabares</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-savita-bailur-3986801/">Savita Bailur</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natabaalo/">Grace Natabaalo</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannalaufer/">Hanna Laufer</a>) were asked to lead a company-wide session on the intersection of <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Platform_Livelihoods_Project_CaribouDigital_April2024_web.pdf">digital and livelihoods</a>, a crucial theme in Caribou’s portfolio. We knew we had to make the agenda productive yet fun. When brainstorming ideas for the most impactful format, some of us thought storytelling would be powerful, while others felt it might create artificial distinctions of “presenters” and “listeners.” Jesús, Community Manager for the Mastercard Strive portfolio managed by Caribou, proposed a “Future of Livelihoods” game. The aim of this approach was to foster collaboration, challenge assumptions, and create a shared space for innovative thinking — as well as have fun, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>We needed to connect the diverse lenses through which each team member had recently engaged with livelihoods — gender, youth, agriculture, or small businesses — so we created the Future of Livelihoods Lab, a game that captured everyone’s curiosity, creativity, and ingenuity. This game featured three decks of cards with an individual theme: Challenge, Innovation, and Client. Each team drew one card from each deck, outlining a specific livelihoods challenge, a cutting-edge innovation, and the profile of an imagined client with unique needs. For instance, a team might address the challenge of digital access gaps in rural Ghana through the innovation of mobile learning platforms to empower the client, young entrepreneurs represented by the Aspire Youth Collective. The objective was to design a strategy that seamlessly integrated the challenge, innovation, and client profile into a cohesive and impactful solution.</p><p>The game unfolded with lively discussions and a strategic swap option, allowing teams to exchange one card for another if their initial combination felt mismatched. Teams were given twenty minutes to craft their proposals and then pitch their strategies in two-minute presentations to a panel acting as a donor board, which scored each idea on creativity, client alignment, and scalability.</p><p>The dynamic, fast-paced nature of the “Future of Livelihoods Lab” energized the retreat, fostering innovative ideas and revealing cross-cutting themes among participants. A prize was awarded to recognize how this thoughtful and immersive activity transformed a pressing topic into a collaborative and enjoyable exercise.</p>Decks of cards and a matching animated background set the scene in the “Future of Livelihoods Lab.” Recognizing that development is not just a game: The challenges and limitations of&nbsp;games <p>Despite their promise, serious games also come with challenges. For games to resonate, they must be culturally relevant and accessible, ensuring all participants feel included. Additionally, power dynamics within groups can shape the experience, requiring careful facilitation, thoughtful mechanic and rule design, and adequate stewardship to maintain equity and inclusivity. Finally, practitioners must be sensitive when integrating play with serious issues. Not all serious games are focused on development, and not all development-focused games are necessarily serious. A decade ago, <a href="https://jadedaid.com/">Jaded Aid</a> made waves — though not without <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/25/jaded-aid-the-game-for-disillusioned-humanitarians">controversy</a> — for its sharp, self-referential critique of the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>What excites us today is a very different approach, one that moves away from self-critique (though it remains necessary) and toward fostering meaningful learning and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The questions of who designs, executes, and participates in a game must all be addressed thoughtfully. At a company level, there should be a collective understanding of the purpose of a game, and a sense of safety and security to raise points that might be different from others. This may not be the case at a community level, where power dynamics of “insiders” and “outsiders” or “game designers” and “participants” may emerge. Games may place a time and labor burden on participants. We may see evidence of groupthink, or fear to truly speak up, and reluctance to challenge cultural, social, and/or gendered hierarchies — critiques leveled at burdensome participatory methods more than twenty years ago by authors such as <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/participation-9781856497947/">Cooke and Kothari in “Participation: The New Tyranny.”</a></p><p>In our case, the in-person “Future of Livelihoods Lab” allowed for group discussion, creative thinking, and innovation. By creating a structured but flexible environment, the game enabled participants to think critically and collaboratively without losing sight of the broader purpose. It was specifically crafted for an audience of colleagues, with a shared ethos and a comparable understanding of the topic and its dynamics. Setting assumptions like these requires deeper thinking, collaboration, and planning in community scenarios, where a well thought-out game could help make solutions emerge — or a poor one could make issues&nbsp;worse.</p> The value of games: Insights for practitioners <p>Our Caribou retreat experience underscored several benefits of using serious games in development work:</p>  Breaking silos: Games bring together diverse stakeholders, encouraging them to work collaboratively and share insights that transcend individual roles or projects.  Encouraging horizontal collaboration through play: Structured play levels the playing field, empowering participants to engage as equals and contribute ideas&nbsp;freely.  Stimulating creativity: By stepping into fictional scenarios, participants are freed from the constraints of their usual roles, enabling them to take bold, imaginative risks.  Revealing blind spots: Games help participants explore perspectives they might not otherwise consider, uncovering overlooked challenges and opportunities.  Building empathy: Role-playing and interactive scenarios allow practitioners to see the world through the eyes of others, fostering greater understanding and connection.  Navigating complex learning curves through engagement: Games sustain attention by guiding participants through intricate topics in an intuitive and enjoyable way.  <p>For Jesús, these benefits are grounded in his experience using games as trust-building tools in community settings:</p><blockquote>“When participants work on a fictional scenario, it’s easier to spot the assumptions and biases we carry into our everyday work. This space to experiment without fear often leads to surprising breakthroughs.”</blockquote><p>Savita emphasizes how applying serious games in workplace scenarios encourages iterative thinking: “Games provide a relatively safe space where we can fail without real-world consequences.” For David Taverner, games are a powerful learning tool because “games are a form of ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_storytelling">interactive storytelling</a>’ and often hold our attention for long periods.”</p>Playing the “Future of Livelihoods Lab” game at the Caribou&nbsp;retreat. Beyond games: A tool for systemic&nbsp;change <p>While the “Future of Livelihoods Lab” was a useful exercise for Caribou, it’s just one example of how bringing games to work can enhance development practice, and iterating games can be just as important as creating new&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Savita plans to test and iterate further on the “Future of Livelihoods” game in the first class of her spring semester course “Human-Centred Digital Development” at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. While many international development students at “Northern” or “Western” universities come with good intentions, they can also come with assumptions around digital development, assumptions that can be questioned by using the game, thus raising awareness around barriers to digital livelihoods including access, relevance, literacy and use, and issues of social&nbsp;norms.</p><p>The real value of serious games lies in their ability to act as bridges — connecting people, ideas, and disciplines to create systemic change. Whether used in community workshops, classrooms, or multi-stakeholder forums, (serious?) games can foster dialogue, uncover new possibilities, and inspire bold&nbsp;action.</p><p>Reach out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdtabares/">Jesús Tabares</a> if you’d like to partner with Caribou to play seriously!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/serious-yet-fun-games-as-tools-for-digital-development-9e5e8047549a">“Serious yet fun”: Games as tools for digital development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Targeted ransomware and extortion: Cybercriminals refine their strategies by exploiting sensitive company data to maximize their financial gains.

 Threats from state actors and hacktivists: Espionage and political destabilization are becoming key strategies for some states, while hacktivists exploit vulnerabilities to amplify their ideological messages. 
 Artificial intelligence, opportunities and risks: AI is a major lever for both attackers and defenders. Its use in cyberattacks requires appropriate countermeasures. 
 Software vulnerabilities and exploitation: Attacks targeting open-source software and unpatched vulnerabilities remain a major concern.

				  With Indicio Proven now supporting the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI), governments and businesses can streamline identity authentication, reduce fraud, and create seamless digital experiences that make digital interaction easier, faster, and safer.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/">approval of eIDAS 2.0</a>, adult citizens of European Union member states will soon have access to secure, decentralized digital identities that they can hold in a European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet). Wallet holders will be able to control their data and share it in privacy-preserving ways to prove who they are across EU member states, conduct business, and access services, and make payments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This continent-wide embrace of decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials is a ground-breaking opportunity for governments and businesses both inside the EU and outside to streamline identity authentication, reduce fraud, and create seamless digital experiences that make digital interaction easier, faster, and safer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get ahead of Europe’s EUDI revolution</p>
<p>As this new era rapidly approaches, how do you prepare for an entirely new seamless way to share and authenticate identity and take advantage of the opportunities it offers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>With <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>, you get it all.&nbsp;</p>

 Avoid the liability of storing sensitive data: The portable trust created by Verifiable Credentials means easy compliance with Europe’s GDPR and other data privacy regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Travel and Hospitality &nbsp;</p>
 
 Seamless digital travel: Starts at home with preauthorized travel and continues through every step of your journey. Cross a border in seconds. And it’s more secure than manual checking.&nbsp; 
 Eliminate manual data entry: Digital travel credentials ingest authenticated data to simplify complex processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Izzy Chadwick, project planning and controls apprentice at Thales in the UK, has been shortlisted for the Apprentice category at the Made in Manchester Awards (MiMA). We caught up with her to find out more about her apprenticeship experience.</p>
<p>Thales offers a diverse range of apprenticeships across all regions of the UK. Our apprenticeships allow you to earn while you learn, directly from industry experts, all while being fully employed.&nbsp;</p>
 What were your initial expectations when you started the apprenticeship program? 
<p>I was attracted to the Thales apprenticeship programme as it allowed me to earn while studying at the same time. I was curious about the company culture and how to balance work and study, but I was opened minded and excited to learn more. Once I joined Thales, I quickly realised they are flexible with study time, allowing 20% of my working week to be dedicated to working on my qualifications. This was supported by my line manager, who has also gone through an apprenticeship programme and understood the demands it can have. Being able to have their support throughout was really valuable and enabled me to have some flexibility in my schedule around core times, such as exams. Everyone I've met here has been welcoming and trusting, helping me feel part of the team and allowing me to put what I learn into practice.</p>
 Can you share a specific project or experience during your apprenticeship that significantly contributed to your personal and professional development? 
<p>During my first few months, I spent my time understanding the systems, shadowing team members and working on my first solo project. Working as a project controller, I was tasked with improving the governance of our self-funded research and development projects in order to increase output. The output from SFR&amp;D helps shape Thales’ future in the Maritime defence sector, expanding our product portfolio and allowing us to stay competitive in the market. It is important that we take an agile and dynamic approach to project management processes, encouraging innovative thinking in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>With the help of my experienced colleagues, I was able to take what I was learning from my qualifications and apply that knowledge to my work, which helped to increase my understanding too. Having my own project early on really helped with my personal and professional development. I was able to interact with senior stakeholders across the business, apply my knowledge and gather detailed evidence for my qualification.</p>
 How did you balance the demands of working in a professional environment while studying for your level 4 apprenticeship? 
<p>I would get distracted on study days by answering work questions, but I quickly realised I had to draw a clear line between college time and work. Having this divide was really helpful, and my team were aware of my study days and knew I would continue with my tasks when I was back in work. I feel really fortunate to have a line manager who understands the demands of an apprenticeship.</p>
 What advice would you give to someone considering an apprenticeship program based on your own journey and experiences? 
<p>I would advise anyone who is considering an apprenticeship to go for it! It can have its challenges, but you get out of it what you put in and the benefits are brilliant. I have had many opportunities to develop alongside my professional qualifications. I got involved with the Early Careers Committee and used my Thales volunteering hours to work with our partner, Primary Engineer. As part of the Primary Engineer Prototeam, I was able to connect with other graduates and apprentices across our UK sites and put skills from my apprenticeship into practice. Our team developed the ‘Tap of Germs’, and was awarded a bronze medal at the MacRobert Medal Award Ceremony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone in an apprenticeship to take all the opportunities that come your way. It is a great way to network and open doors to new experiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emma’s buying her first home—a process that used to mean printing documents, scheduling in-person visits, and endless waiting. But instead of navigating outdated systems, Emma’s lender uses modern Know Your Customer (KYC) technology. The result? A seamless, digital experience where her identity is verified in minutes, not days.</p>



 



 Reimagining KYC with Digital Identity 



<p>Emma logs into her lender’s app and is guided through a quick digital ID verification process:</p>



 
 She uploads a photo of her government-issued ID. 



 The system scans and validates the details instantly using optical character recognition (OCR) to ensure accuracy. 



 A live selfie confirms Emma’s identity through biometric liveness detection, verifying that she’s physically present and not using a static image. 
 



<p>In less than two minutes, Emma’s identity is verified—no manual forms, no waiting rooms.</p>



 



 A Secure Foundation: Blockchain for Tamper-Proof Records 



<p>Behind the scenes, Emma’s lender uses blockchain technology to protect her data. Unlike traditional databases, which are vulnerable to tampering, blockchain creates a secure, decentralized ledger where:</p>



 
 Verified records can’t be altered, ensuring transparency and data integrity. 



 Emma’s verified identity can be reused across multiple services, reducing redundant processes. 
 



<p>Though Emma doesn’t interact with blockchain directly, its presence strengthens the security of her entire transaction.</p>



 



 The Future of KYC: Self-Sovereign Identity 



<p>Emma’s experience offers a glimpse into the future of digital identity: self-sovereign identity (SSI). In this model, Emma controls her credentials through a secure digital wallet and decides what information to share.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



 
 When renewing her driver’s license, she could share only her name, birthdate, and photo—nothing else. 



 When applying for a new bank account, she could authorize proof of identity without revealing unrelated personal data. 
 



<p>SSI enhances privacy while streamlining the verification process, putting individuals in charge of their digital identities.</p>



 



 Redefining Trust in Financial Transactions 



<p>Emma’s KYC journey illustrates how biometric authentication, blockchain-backed security, and decentralized identity verification are redefining trust. For businesses, adopting these innovations isn’t just about meeting regulatory requirements—it’s about delivering secure, frictionless customer experiences that build confidence and loyalty.</p>



<p>The future of KYC is here, and it’s making complex verifications simple, secure, and efficient.</p>

<p>An integral requirement of academic research data management (RDM) is ensuring research repeatability to preserve the continuation of scientific integrity. Repeatability allows other researchers to validate findings, build on existing work, and maintain high-quality standards and public trust in research outcomes. </p>
<p><br></p>
 Well-document data and metadata significantly improve reuse 
<p>Effective RDM practices, such as thorough data management plans, organizing data systematically, storing data in accessible formats, and managing and controlling access to research data, facilitate the process of discovery and create a clear roadmap for others to follow. For instance, a study by Wallis et al. (2013) highlights that well-documented data and metadata significantly improve the likelihood of successful data reuse. When researchers provide detailed descriptions of their data collection processes, analysis techniques, and tools used in their research, it clarifies their procedures and allows others to accurately evaluate academic publications. This can also expedite the peer review process and enhance its accuracy, enabling more research to be published faster without compromising quality standards.</p>
<p><br></p>
 Guarantee long-term accessibility 
<p>Furthermore, storing data in trusted repositories guarantees long-term accessibility, which is crucial for ensuring that studies can be repeated effectively. According to a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2019), transparent data sharing not only supports reproducibility but also creates an environment of innovative collaboration. By adequately adopting RDM best practices and solutions that are designed to enable them, researchers are able to contribute towards a culture of accountability, which ultimately strengthens the credibility of the scientific community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, good RDM is not just about preserving data, it is about defending the future of academic research itself. By enabling researchers to easily embrace strong research data management practices, myLaminin ensures that your data is not only secure but also accessible for future scholars. myLaminin's commitment to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) science principles, and reliability in our data security, team collaboration, agreements management, data collection, integrated Research Ethics Board, and audit trail capabilities supports ongoing discovery and innovation, helping us all build a more informed future.</p>

 Un gran paso hacia la seguridad de datos digitales 



<p>En un mundo cada vez más digital, la gestión de nuestra identidad se ha convertido en un tema central. La Ciudad de Buenos Aires da un paso trascendental hacia el futuro de la identidad digital con el <a href="https://www.clarin.com/ciudades/licencia-conducir-digital-disponible-app-portena-controles-valida_0_25cs4SRxUU.html?srsltid=AfmBOorMbGB4pqxtmhLmO-viN9M_olVxv4ZJgay2R0hGPAw3gHT8IQrI" title="">lanzamiento de la Licencia de Conducir como credencial verificable.</a> Este hito, disponible en las wallets <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/blog/integrating-quarkid-and-miba/" title="">miBA y QuarkID</a>, representa un avance significativo en la protección de datos personales y la eficiencia de los trámites.</p>



<p>En octubre de 2024, miBA integró QuarkID, permitiendo que los usuarios gestionen su información de forma segura a través de la tecnología blockchain de <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/wikis/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" title="">ZKsync</a>. Esta actualización proporcionó a los más de 3,8 millones de usuarios una Identidad Digital Descentralizada (DID), convirtiendo al Gobierno de la Ciudad en el primero a nivel mundial en adoptar blockchain para la gestión de identidades digitales.</p>



<p></p>



La licencia de conducir digital en CABA se puede exhibir a través de la app miBA.



<p></p>



 ¿Qué significa este lanzamiento para los Ciudadanos? 



<p>La nueva Licencia de Conducir digital ofrece múltiples beneficios:</p>



 Mayor control:  



<p>Los ciudadanos tienen el control total de sus datos, decidiendo cuándo y con quién compartirlos.</p>



 Privacidad reforzada:  



<p>La tecnología de credenciales verificables protege la información personal de accesos no autorizados.</p>



 Seguridad avanzada:  



<p>La autenticidad de la licencia se verifica de forma criptográfica, previniendo fraudes y falsificaciones.</p>



 Eficiencia en trámites:  



<p>La verificación de identidad se agiliza, eliminando tiempos de espera y fricciones innecesarias.</p>



 Menos intermediarios:  



<p>Se reducen las interacciones con terceros para la verificación de documentos, simplificando procesos.</p>

<p>Modern financial services and technology have spread around the world over the past century-plus, but many adults still don’t have, or can’t access, traditional bank accounts or digital payments tools. As of 2021, only <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/07/global-digital-financial-inclusion-findex/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">75% of adults worldwide</a> have a bank or mobile spending account. This rate of so-called “financial inclusion” is lower in developing economies, at only 71%.&nbsp;</p><p>The consequences are substantial. Living without modern banking or payment tools makes basic life tasks like shopping harder, saving money more difficult and insecure, and adding particular burdens to small business operators. Exclusion can fall particularly hard on women and minority groups, who are sometimes still actively prevented from accessing banking infrastructure, compounding other challenges. In turn, financial exclusion depresses overall economic activity for communities and nations.</p><p>The good news is that financial inclusion has grown significantly over the past decade, driven by innovative mobile payments and digital identity systems like India’s Aadhar. SpruceID’s work is focused on the next generation of digital identity based on <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-physical-id-card-and-a-verifiable-digital-credential">cryptographic signatures</a> known as “verifiable digital credentials,” or VDCs.</p> The Mobile Transition and Financial Inclusion <p>The discussion about financial inclusion has been dramatically reshaped by the advent of digital technologies, particularly by the rise of mobile phones and smartphones. According to the World Economic Forum, the adoption of mobile tools has driven <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/07/global-digital-financial-inclusion-findex/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">the majority</a> of increased financial inclusion in the developing world over the last decade, and VDCs similarly rely on mobile devices. For that reason, we largely focus below on the specific advantages of VDC-based identity over existing digital and mobile tools.</p> More Affordable Banking <p>Again and again, whether in developing countries or wealthy nations, the number one reason individuals don’t use banks is the cost. Discussions often focus on the fear of <a href="https://www.afcpe.org/news-and-publications/the-standard/2015-4/three-reasons-why-people-dont-use-banks/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">overdrafts and other “gotcha” fees</a>, which were thankfully <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-closes-overdraft-loophole-to-save-americans-billions-in-fees?ref=blog.spruceid.com">recently capped</a> in the U.S. But banking costs will always trickle down to users in some fashion.&nbsp;</p><p>Two major cost centers for banks and payment services are service and fraud. Trustworthy VDCs can reduce service labor costs through automation and also offer potential long-term savings via fraud prevention. As onboarding for financial services has gone increasingly online, fraud has exploded, including most recently thanks to the rise of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-the-u-s-post-office-is-key-to-fighting-ai-fraud/">fake IDs created with AI</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By making digital identity trustworthy and fraud-resistant, online and off, VDCs should make banking services cheaper, increasing inclusion. They could even make online and digital lending services more affordable since being able to reliably trust that you’re lending to a specific person dramatically reduces fraud and defaults. Going still further, VDCs can also be used to prove educational credentials like degrees and training. Making these documents fully trustworthy and natively digital might further de-risk lending since lenders can verify education and experience credentials as easily and reliably as identity.</p> More Reliable Payments <p>Fraud prevention also increases the chance that users of digital payment systems will actually receive the money they’re owed, whether by a friend, customer, or government agency. This is particularly vital because mobile payments are such a major portion of recent adoption. One prime example is M-PESA, which began life as a form of digital cash for old-school “dumb” phones. M-PESA has now thrived for going on two decades, with profoundly transformative impacts: M-PESA adoption alone lifted <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/mobile-money-kenyans-out-poverty-1208?ref=blog.spruceid.com">2% of the Kenyan population out of poverty</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The scattershot distribution and rampant fraud in COVID-19 relief payments highlighted how vulnerable and fragmented the U.S. system for government disbursements is. Even users of India’s more advanced benefits system via Aadhaar have <a href="https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/aadhaar-card-aeps-scam-617970.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">had payments stolen</a>, in part because Aadhaar relies on an account number for access, a variety of what’s known as “knowledge-based security.”&nbsp;</p><p>VDCs, by contrast, can be tied to a specific device, preventing hackers from easily impersonating an account holder. For mobile payment systems, in particular, on-device digital credentials present huge security benefits for the still-unbanked, further enhancing trust and adoption. M-PESA-style systems that use official VDC-based identity for verification are not yet widespread. But they don’t face major technical barriers because VDCs—again, unlike centralized digital identity services—are designed to easily interact with third-party digital tools.</p> Privacy, Security, and Trust <p>By far the most direct advantage of a VDC-based digital identity system is that it protects the personal data and privacy of users. This is in part because the system can be implemented in a way to allow the storage and verification of identity data locally on a mobile device rather than requiring a <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">“phone home” verification</a> to a faraway server. The latter “phone home” architecture is vulnerable to hacking: India’s centralized system, for instance, has experienced repeated, devastating thefts of private information from <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/aadhaar-data-of-millions-of-indians-put-on-sale-on-the-dark-web-reports-123103000993_1.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">millions of Indian citizens</a>. That information can, in turn, be used for fraud or worse.</p><p>VDC-based identity also offers better privacy for everyday use compared to both conventional paper ID documents and older digital identity systems. “Selective Disclosure” lets VDC users <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">control exactly what data they share</a>. This makes it possible to access banking services without revealing irrelevant details to the servicer – including identity details such as gender and race, which might enable discrimination. Another privacy and security feature of VDCs is more subtle: a digital identity document is less conspicuous than a paper document and often can’t be viewed without the holder’s explicit consent via opening their phone.</p><p>These features are vital for improving financial inclusion because they foster user trust. Some unbanked people are hesitant to participate in systems that might make them vulnerable – and in some cases, their fears have been justified. Correcting or preventing these flaws, and fostering deep trust in an identity system, are fundamental to improving many people’s lives by bringing them into the global banking and financial system.</p><p>To learn more about how SpruceID is advancing financial inclusion through verifiable digital credentials, explore our work in secure, privacy-preserving digital identity.

 France has become the latest in a long line of countries that is doubling down on requiring pornographic sites to offer mandatory age verification. The aim is to protect minors, but will it work and at what cost to user privacy?&nbsp; 



<p>In January 2025, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14267581/Porn-sites-risk-blocked-days-France-refuse-comply-18-age-checks.html">a new regulation was passed requiring pornographic sites in France</a> to verify the age of their users. This initiative aims to protect minors from exposure to inappropriate content online, which can <a href="https://www.barnardos.org.uk/blog/how-does-pornography-harm-children">cause long-term harm</a> and affect their perception of gender and sexual relations as well as put younger people and women at greater risk of abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Platforms must now implement robust identity verification solutions to verify users’ ages either through the identification of documents or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">facial recognition</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, questions have been raised on the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the potential impact on user privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 How France aims to crack down on underage users viewing pornography.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Every month, <a href="https://eclj.org/family/french-institutions/pornographie--23-millions-de-jeunes-francais-victimes-de-violence-sexuelle">2.3 million minors in France access pornographic sites</a>, representing a staggering 12% of the total visitors. To address the issue, the Regulatory Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication now requires adult sites to implement age verification services by April 11, 2025. After this period, sanctions, including site blocking, may be applied in the event of non-compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accepted methods of identity verification include the use of video selfies for biometric recognition, or proof of identity via document verification. As a simple confirmation of age is no longer sufficient, compliance is reinforced by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/double-anonymity-to-bring-age-verification-to-porn-and-social-media-in-france">a double anonymity system,</a> allowing age to be verified while guaranteeing anonymity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>With double anonymity, the site you’re connecting to doesn’t know who you are, only that you’re over 18. Plus, the age verification service doesn’t know which site you’re connecting to.</p>Marc Norlain, Managing Director at IDnow</blockquote>



 Global regulation practices for adult sites.&nbsp; 



<p>France is not alone in its efforts to regulate access to adult content. Here are how some other countries are tackling the issue of minors viewing pornography.&nbsp;</p>



  United Kingdom: The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online Safety Act</a> will require pornographic platforms to use age verification services by July. All websites on which pornographic material can be found, including social media platforms, must introduce ‘robust’ age-checking techniques, such as demanding photo ID or running credit card checks for UK users. Ofcom has published what it calls a “non-exhaustive” list of technologies that may be used to verify ages, which includes:&nbsp;  



  Open banking&nbsp;  



  Photo ID matching&nbsp;  



  Facial age estimation&nbsp;  



  Mobile network operator age checks&nbsp;  



  Credit card checks&nbsp;  



  Digital identity services&nbsp;  



  Email-based age estimation&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Germany: The country imposes strict regulations via the Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM). Sites must ensure that users are of legal age by using verification solutions such as digital identity services or national identity cards.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Italy: The government has recently tightened online controls. Pornographic platforms must verify age via state-issued digital identifiers, such as the SPID (Public Digital Identity System). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Denmark: More lenient than some other European countries, Denmark simply encourages the use of age verification services to protect minors, notably via public-private partnerships.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  United States: Since June 2024, <a href="https://avpassociation.com/4271-2/">19 states have passed laws</a> requiring age verification for access to adult content. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Nations such as China, Iran and Saudi Arabia completely block access to pornographic sites, using censorship technologies to prevent access.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  In Spain, Poland and the Czech Republic, there are no specific regulations imposing age verification services for pornographic sites, although discussions are underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>The <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">Digital Services Act</a>, which is in force in all European Union (EU) Member States, requires digital platforms, including adult content sites, to implement age verification mechanisms when their services are massively used (over 45 million users). This regulation aims to ensure a safer online environment for minors throughout the EU.&nbsp;</p>



 Age verification solutions for accessing sensitive content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Faced with new and more prolific age verification requirements, a promising solution is emerging to combine efficiency, anonymity and privacy: the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">EUDI Wallet (European Digital Identity Wallet)</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/yris/">Digital identity wallets</a> offer two main benefits:&nbsp;</p>



  Selective disclosure of information.&nbsp;  



<p>This system allows users to prove their age without disclosing other personal data. For example, users can confirm that they are over 18 without revealing other personal information, such as their name or address. Only information strictly necessary for verification is shared.&nbsp;</p>



  Non-traceability of users.&nbsp;  



<p>A key feature of the digital identity portfolio will be its ability to guarantee the non-traceability of users’ interactions with sites. Thanks to advanced technologies such as zero-knowledge proof, it will be impossible to link a user’s actions to a specific site or to their other online activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital wallets look set to usher in a major advancement in privacy protection, addressing some of the current concerns associated with using identity verification solutions to gain access to adult sites.&nbsp;</p>



 Porn, privacy and data confidentiality.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to viewing pornographic content, the topic of privacy is clearly an important and sensitive topic. To reassure adult users that they will be able to remain anonymous and their data kept confidential, all while complying with new and upcoming regulations, it will become essential to implement solutions that comply with strict privacy protection principles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing these new solutions is a challenge but represents a major opportunity to combine innovation with security and respect for individual freedoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Prefer to listen? Here’s the audio version of this post:</p>







<p>First, let’s talk about why you should care.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a vendor or a product manager, modern software is a patchwork of third-party components, open-source libraries, and cloud-based services. A single weak link can undermine the entire system, putting your company’s product and reputation at risk.</p>



<p>That’s where SCITT comes in. By focusing on verifying every step in the software supply chain, it offers vendors the confidence that their components meet security and integrity standards. Customers, too, are demanding greater transparency, and SCITT is working to become a big part in how that happens.</p>



 Key Trends Shaping Supply Chain Security 



<p>Conversations about software supply chains are becoming almost as exciting as NHI and AI. Probably because NHI and AI depend on a crazy amount of software, each with its own set of potential vulnerabilities. We’re talking about rising threats, high-profile breaches, and increasing regulatory pressure requiring organizations to rethink how they build, deploy, and manage software. To meet these challenges, the industry is rallying around key practices and frameworks that promote transparency, trust, and resilience. Two of the big trends in this space are the adoption of Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and the emergence of global legislation driving accountability.</p>



 The Rise of SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) 



<p>An <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/industry-news/2023/why-are-regulations-demanding-sbom-adoption?utm_source=chatgpt.com">SBOM</a> is essentially an ingredient list for your software, showing all the components inside. The EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) now requires manufacturers to create and maintain SBOMs for digital products, which must be available for regulatory checks. SCITT can simplify this process by integrating verification mechanisms directly into the supply chain.</p>



 A Global Push for Legislation 



<p>The primary legislative framework in Europe that covers software supply chain security is the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act">Cyber Resilience Act</a> (CRA). Proposed in September 2022, the CRA introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements for certain products in order to ensure their security throughout the product lifecycle. The CRA is setting the standard for cybersecurity, mandating secure development practices, vulnerability management, and lifecycle security. </p>



<p>Across the pond, U.S. executive orders also demand greater accountability for third-party software providers, emphasizing secure development attestations and artifact validation. There are two particular ones to pay attention to: </p>



 
 Executive Order on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> (May 2021) directing federal agencies to improve the security and integrity of software critical to the government’s ability to function.&nbsp;If you’re interested in the supply chain aspects, see Section 4  Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security.  



 Executive Order on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> (January 2025) has an even bigger section (Section 2) on Operationalizing Transparency and Security in Third-Party Software Supply Chains.  
 



<p>Changes in administration can negate executive orders, but I suspect core elements like the supply chain requirements are going to stick around.</p>



 What Is SCITT? 



<p>OK, let’s get back to SCITT. At its core, SCITT provides a framework to ensure integrity and transparency in the software supply chain. It’s about cryptographic proofs, signed attestations, and validated processes that make it easier to trust what you’re building and buying.</p>



 
 SBOM Integration: SCITT enhances the accuracy and traceability of SBOMs. 



 Certified Compiler Tracking: It ensures that trusted tools are used throughout the development process. 



 Compliance Made Simple: SCITT aligns perfectly with regulations like the CRA, making it easier for vendors to meet evolving standards. 
 



 Don’t Forget SPIFFE and WIMSE! 



<p>This isn’t directly an IETF thing, but it’s closely related to SCITT: SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone). SPIFFE addresses a critical challenge—workload identity in cloud-native environments. Think of it as a way to ensure that during builds and deployments, only the right processes are communicating with each other. No more hardcoded credentials or guessing who’s knocking on the door—SPIFFE ensures every workload has a secure and verifiable identity.</p>



<p>Here’s what SPIFFE brings to the table:</p>



 
 Workload Authentication: SPIFFE provides dynamic, secure identities for workloads, removing the need for manual credential management. 



 Securing CI/CD Pipelines: It locks down your build and deployment environments, ensuring only authenticated processes can interact with sensitive systems. 



 Complementing SCITT: Together, SCITT and SPIFFE form a powerful duo, enhancing transparency and security at every stage of the supply chain. 
 



<p>But wait—what about WIMSE, the Workload Identity for Multi-System Environments effort? Does it cover the same ground as SPIFFE? Well, kind of, but not exactly. Here’s the deal:</p>



 
 WIMSE: Focuses on creating vendor-neutral standards for managing workload identities across diverse systems. It’s about defining best practices and protocols to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules. 



 SPIFFE: Provides the frameworks and tools to implement those principles in real-world systems. In other words, SPIFFE is more about the “how,” while WIMSE is about the “what” and “why.” 
 



<p>Chatting with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/ietf@justin.richer.org">Justin Richer</a>, co-chair of the WIMSE working group, he helped me clarify the difference: SPIFFE is defining the tools for assigning and trusting the identities; WIMSE is defining the protocols and practices around them.</p>



 How SCITT, WIMSE, and SPIFFE Fit Together 



<p>Here’s how these three puzzle pieces come together to form a strong foundation for modern software supply chains:</p>



 
 SCITT: Verifies the integrity and transparency of the supply chain through cryptographic proofs and attestations. 



 WIMSE: Defines the standards and best practices for managing workload identities, ensuring a consistent approach across environments. 



 SPIFFE: Implements those standards with secure, dynamic identities that can be integrated into SCITT workflows. 
 



<p>Together, they ensure:</p>



 
 Trustworthy SBOMs: By verifying and securing every component in the supply chain. 



 Secure Build Environments: Through workload authentication and protection of CI/CD pipelines. 



 Compliance with Global Regulations: Aligning with frameworks like the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). 
 



 Why This Matters to Vendors and Product Teams 



<p>Cybersecurity practitioners don’t need to be convinced (I hope) about the importance of the work happening at the supply chain level. I want to make the case, though, that this matters to a much wider audience. While sales engineers and product teams may be ready to dismiss these deep, dark frameworks and standards as theoretical, recognize that SCITT and SPIFFE deliver practical, real-world benefits:</p>



 
 Building Trust: Customers and regulators increasingly demand transparency. SCITT and SPIFFE ensure your supply chain is secure and verifiable. 



 Staying Competitive: Security is no longer a “nice to have.” Vendors who embrace these frameworks gain a clear market edge. 



 Reducing Risks: From <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know">SolarWinds</a> to open-source vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks are a thing. These tools help mitigate those threats. 



 Operational Efficiency: Automating security processes reduces complexity, saving time and resources. There is SO MUCH going on in terms of attacks and defense, automating your security processes is not really optional.  
 



 Wrapping It Up 



<p>Efforts like SCITT, SPIFFE, and WIMSE might not grab headlines like the latest tech gadgets, but they’re truly critical and live at the foundation of software security. For vendors and product teams, understanding and leveraging these tools is about staying secure, competitive, and ahead of the curve. For me, I’m definitely going to keep my finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the space. My own decisions on what software and services I purchase or recommend will absolutely be influenced by these efforts. </p>

			 Trump Administration’s Impact on Tokenization: Is the Golden Age Upon Us? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>For years, US financial institutions have faced significant hurdles in adopting tokenization, primarily due to regulatory uncertainty and operational challenges. But recent changes under the Trump administration are clearing these obstacles, paving the way for the golden age of tokenization in the United States.</p>
 Breaking the Custody Barrier 
<p>The SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) created a major roadblock by requiring institutions holding tokenized assets for clients to report these as liabilities on their balance sheets.</p>
<p>This increased financial exposure discouraged institutions from offering custody services. With the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/staff-guidance/staff-accounting-bulletins/staff-accounting-bulletin-122?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PZKd2ybVDjst5_qELueLb9CBWllbDQalMpMKV-R-dFSqSIQAAdixo_pveyG8WzYtMAL7Z">repeal of SAB 121</a>, this burden has been lifted, enabling institutions to provide custody solutions for tokenized securities without unnecessary financial risk.</p>
 Public Blockchains Gain Regulatory Support 
<p>Institutions have long recognized the value of public blockchains for tokenized assets, removing silos, ensuring transparency, and unlocking interoperability. However, regulatory uncertainty left many hesitant to adopt them.</p>
<p>President Trump’s new<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PZKd2ybVDjst5_qELueLb9CBWllbDQalMpMKV-R-dFSqSIQAAdixo_pveyG8WzYtMAL7Z"> executive order on digital assets</a> changes this, ensuring lawful access to public blockchain networks and introducing technology-neutral regulations.</p>
<p>Like other forward-thinking jurisdictions (e.g., E.U., Singapore, Hong Kong), the US now takes a “same assets, same rules” approach, where compliance becomes the focus, not the underlying technology.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s proven solutions, using the ERC-3643 ‘T-REX’ standard, address the critical question of how to enforce compliance on public blockchains, allowing institutions to confidently move forward.</p>
 Stablecoins: Institutionally Accepted On-Chain Cash 
<p>One of the biggest challenges for tokenization has been the absence of on-chain cash that institutions are willing to adopt. Stablecoins, despite their wide adoption by cryptocurrency players, have faced hesitation from financial institutions due to concerns about legitimacy.</p>
<p>The recent executive order promotes lawful USD-backed coins while banning CBDCs in the US. This move not only provides regulatory clarity but also establishes stablecoins as a trusted on-chain cash solution.</p>
<p>While some institutions remain cautious, this shift is expected to accelerate institutional acceptance of cash coins for tokenized securities. It will unlock atomic settlements, where security and cash coexist on the same ledger, and enable automation of processes like capital calls, dividend payments, and more.</p>
<p>The growing demand for dollar-backed stablecoins is creating significant opportunities for tokenized money market funds. Stablecoin issuers will mint more tokens as adoption grows, driving a greater need for collateral that is liquid, safe, and yield-bearing. It’s precisely what tokenized money market funds offer.</p>
<p>At the same time, tokenized MMFs also represent onchain cash with yield, positioning them as an alternative to the first generation of stablecoins, which typically capture yield for themselves. This dynamic introduces both competition and synergy between the two, as stablecoin issuers may turn to tokenized MMFs for reserves, while investors seeking yield-bearing onchain cash could increasingly look to MMFs instead of stablecoins.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s customers are already leading the way. Moreliquid, which tokenized the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund, and Fasanara, which tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills, are capturing this trend with the scalable solutions we provide underneath.</p>
 A Golden Moment for Tokenization 
<p>The challenges are being resolved: regulations are aligning, proven technology like ours is ready, and the market is moving rapidly. Institutions must now ask themselves: What are we waiting for?</p>
<p>We believe this could be the year we bring the first trillion dollars in assets on-chain as an ecosystem. Let’s shape the golden age of tokenization together!</p>

I love eating the tomatoes that come out of my garden.&nbsp; Sometimes I love it because they taste better than supermarket tomatoes, but honestly they don’t always taste better than ones I get from the local farmers market, and I still love eating them.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I know the full story of the tomatoes.&nbsp; I know where I got the seeds.&nbsp; I know how they grew, what went into them, how they fared a dry-spell and more.&nbsp; There’s something deeply satisfying about knowing the story of what we eat, what we use, what we wear.</p><p>And it’s more than just satisfying, it’s actually critical to creating healthy systems.&nbsp; In any system where there is no information about an input to that system, there will be an inability to respond.&nbsp; If I don’t know what went into the growing of my tomatoes, I cannot respond to differences between tomato sources.&nbsp; If I know about pesticide use, carbon footprint, labor practices, transportation distances, then I can respond in my choices about which tomatoes to buy.&nbsp; This story is meant simply to show a systemic truth, that in a complex society where goods are produced and flow through a supply chain, we need mechanisms to have that data aggregated and attached to products as they make their way through the economy for the effects of producing those goods to not just be “externalities”.&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen for quite some time formal mechanisms to add some data to our products.&nbsp; USDA Organic, Fair-trade and similar certifications create a bit of added information. It’s rather easy to see the need for generalized, high resolution versions of these kinds of product indicators, but for the whole supply chain of products.&nbsp; It’s rather difficult to figure out how to build ones that have the reliability, transparency, systemic neutrality and incorruptibility we would want for such systems.&nbsp; And now, critically, the EU has mandated phasing in Digital Product Passports that will need to do just that.</p><p>In designing Holochain one of the core principles behind its architecture was for it to provide a substrate in which parties could create a space of engagement in the digital world in which they could all hold each other to account without having to have an intermediary keeping the accounts.&nbsp; These core design criteria led us to create a system where data provenance is a native feature of the framework.&nbsp; This is what is meant when people describe Holochain as “agent-centric”.&nbsp; All actions taken by agents in a given Holochain network include the provenance of that action, and only valid actions determined by the rules-of-engagement of that particular Holochain network, can get recorded. &nbsp; And all of this happens with no intermediary.</p><p>Such a substrate is ideal for creating the kind of transparency and accountability framework that can deliver on the demands of robust Digital Product Passport solutions that are truly decentralized.</p><p>Immu.ai is working on a platform for providing, data modeling, validation, and transparency, in service of Digital Product Passports, and has recognized the value proposition of Holochain to deliver on their commitment to decentralization of their platform. This is why the Holochain Foundation is taking on this strategic collaboration immu.ai together with Holo.&nbsp; We believe it will help deliver on the possibility of living in a world where the full story of the products we consume is available, and can be used to steer our economic participation in directions that aren’t full of collateral damage due to lack of information.&nbsp;</p><p>As a final note, this isn’t the only collaboration in this domain.&nbsp; The Holochain Foundation supports the development of <a href="https://hrea.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">hREA</a>, a Holochain based implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources%2C_Events%2C_Agents?ref=blog.holochain.org">Resource, Event, Agent</a> accounting framework and <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/?ref=blog.holochain.org">valueflows</a> ontology.&nbsp; You can read more about hREA and the Holochain community efforts <a href="https://happeningscommunity.substack.com/p/hrea-unlocking-data-for-regeneration?r=e6jau&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">here</a>.</p>

 🪄Innovation and New Technology Developments 



 



<p>Wiz Researchers Uncover Data Leak in DeepSeek’s Unsecured Database</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wizfreight/">WIZ</a> researchers found that China-based AI platform DeepSeek exposed over a million records, including user chat prompts and API keys, in an unsecured database. Though taken offline after contact, DeepSeek has not addressed the issue. Experts warn of security risks, while Italy investigates and the U.S. Navy advises against its use. OpenAI is also probing whether DeepSeek trained on ChatGPT outputs. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/exposed-deepseek-database-revealed-chat-prompts-and-internal-data/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SDVs5T3TIhqFQ58k63cZs8DJlukvtXAZxzMSEWv1CpMzVGXI8-UR0sQTIO8hGasl5sATC">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Industry Coalition Urges Trump Administration to Accelerate Mobile Driver’s Licenses and Digital Identity Adoption</p>



<p>An industry coalition is urging the Trump administration’s DOGE to accelerate mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and digital identity adoption to fight fraud. The Better Identity Coalition called for state grants and private-sector partnerships. While Biden considered an executive order on digital identity, it didn’t materialize, though his cyber directive included anti-fraud measures. The Trump administration has maintained Biden’s directive, supporting mDL funding and identity verification standards. <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2025/01/industry-coalition-presses-doge-to-act-on-digital-identity/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SDVs5T3TIhqFQ58k63cZs8DJlukvtXAZxzMSEWv1CpMzVGXI8-UR0sQTIO8hGasl5sATC">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Australia’s Big Four Banks Adopt ConnectID for Secure and Consent-Based Digital Identity Verification</p>



<p>Australia’s four largest banks—Commonwealth Bank, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nab/">NAB</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anz/">ANZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/westpac/">Westpac</a> —now offer ConnectID, a digital identity solution by Australian Payments Plus (AP+). Acting as a secure intermediary, ConnectID enables users to share only necessary information during transactions with full consent, without storing or accessing customer data. Businesses benefit by reducing the need to manage sensitive information. Awareness of digital identity solutions in Australia has risen, with 72% of Australians familiar with them as of December 2024. <a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-mobile-banking/australian-banks-enable-secure-digital-identity-with-connectid--1271951?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--L4lCZ5WpqBgYg_k8t7hhfSxvxf1O4gGXmPGzZNSet1SOmgdGQBjmBUctb15arbdDSp0RD">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Apple Patches Zero-Day Bug in Core Media, Enables Apple Intelligence by Default in Latest Updates</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/">Apple</a>‘s latest updates for iPhone, iPad, and Mac enable Apple Intelligence by default on newer devices and patch security bugs, including a zero-day vulnerability in Core Media. Hackers exploited the flaw to gain elevated privileges, affecting devices on iOS versions before 17.2. Apple has fixed the issue but did not disclose details on its discovery or targets. This is 2025’s first actively exploited iOS vulnerability, following seven similar cases in 2024. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/apple-fixes-zero-day-flaw-affecting-all-devices/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--L4lCZ5WpqBgYg_k8t7hhfSxvxf1O4gGXmPGzZNSet1SOmgdGQBjmBUctb15arbdDSp0RD">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>OpenAI Launches Operator, an Autonomous AI Agent, Amid Concerns Over Oversight and Trust</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/">OpenAI</a>‘s Operator, an autonomous AI agent, is now live, partnering with Uber, Instacart, and DoorDash to handle online tasks. However, some websites are blocking it over concerns about bot access. To address these issues, initiatives like World propose linking AI agents to human identities, ensuring accountability while helping businesses integrate AI securely. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/sam-altmans-world-now-wants-to-link-ai-agents-to-your-digital-identity/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--L4lCZ5WpqBgYg_k8t7hhfSxvxf1O4gGXmPGzZNSet1SOmgdGQBjmBUctb15arbdDSp0RD">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>DeepSeek’s AI Breakthrough Disrupts Global Tech, Sparks Chip Stock Selloff, and Raises Cybersecurity Concerns</p>



<p>Chinese AI firm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepseek-ai/">DeepSeek AI</a> has shaken the global tech sector with its R1 and V3 AI models, matching top Western counterparts at a fraction of the cost. Training V3 on just over 2,000 Nvidia chips for $5.6M—far below the $100M–$1B spent by U.S. firms—DeepSeek’s efficiency triggered a chip stock selloff, with Nvidia plunging 15% and the Nasdaq dropping 3%. Beyond financial impact, DeepSeek’s cost-effective AI raises cybersecurity and military concerns, as it could democratize AI capabilities for various actors, including those with malicious intent. The breakthrough challenges U.S. export controls, intensifies the AI arms race, and could reshape the economics of AI development worldwide. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/chip-stocks-tumble-after-chinas-deepseek-ai-models-raise-doubts-over-u-s-tech-dominance-9799591b?mod=tech_lead_story&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8rbgCNmF4lYxz53nREmg9uLkVCuVpmYTKXXbSO_NZzCGNqnKAhxKLhX_ihti0q6DnjOp7m">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>DeepSeek Temporarily Halts New Sign-Ups for AI Assistant App Amid Malicious Attacks and User Surge</p>



<p>DeepSeek’s AI Assistant app, a top-ranked ChatGPT rival, has temporarily restricted new sign-ups due to “large-scale malicious attacks.” While existing users remain unaffected, new registrations faced outages and performance issues. Initially, DeepSeek required a mainland China mobile number for sign-ups, but this has since been removed, allowing Google, Apple ID, and email registration. It’s unclear if the issue is solely due to attacks or a surge in users, as the app recently topped the U.S. App Store charts. DeepSeek has provided limited details, and the situation is still unfolding. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24353023/deepseek-ai-app-restricting-sign-ups-malicious-attacks?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8rbgCNmF4lYxz53nREmg9uLkVCuVpmYTKXXbSO_NZzCGNqnKAhxKLhX_ihti0q6DnjOp7m">(Source)</a></p>

<p>France Expands Binance Probe Over Money Laundering And Terrorist Financing</p>



<p>French authorities have expanded their investigation into Binance for money laundering and terrorist financing, covering activities from 2019 to 2024. The probe examines allegations of habitual money laundering linked to drug trafficking and tax fraud, as well as unauthorized marketing via influencers. This follows Binance’s $4.3 billion fine by U.S. officials in 2023 for similar violations. Despite receiving registered status in France in 2022, the exchange now faces scrutiny over customer complaints and inadequate disclosure, with the case referred to client protection and anti-fraud agencies. <a href="https://thepaypers.com/online-mobile-banking/france-deepens-probe-into-binance-over-alleged-ml--1272004?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-924QBzv3vIlqPi-5MtT7Uxy_G620OCJL2dcAbPb3FKsgwC5oZ9PEKM96REnXScFogGzV61">(Source)</a></p>

This ALPHV ransomware gang breach is now the largest medical data breach in U.S. history, exposing names, contact details, government IDs, health diagnoses, treatment plans, and financial information. Hackers gained access via a stolen credential lacking multi-factor authentication, causing months-long outages across the U.S. healthcare system. While UnitedHealth claims no evidence of medical record misuse, some stolen data was published online, and two ransoms were paid to prevent further leaks. The incident highlights serious vulnerabilities in healthcare data security. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/unitedhealth-confirms-190-million-americans-affected-by-change-healthcare-data-breach/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8rbgCNmF4lYxz53nREmg9uLkVCuVpmYTKXXbSO_NZzCGNqnKAhxKLhX_ihti0q6DnjOp7m">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Sets Timeline for Stricter ID Verification and AML Measures Under Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023</p>



<p>The UK will enforce stricter identity verification (IDV) and anti-money laundering (AML) controls under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. Starting autumn 2025, new business directors and PSCs must verify their identities, with existing companies complying by autumn 2026. IDV will also be required in annual filings. Authorized Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs) can offer verification from February 2025, with voluntary IDV opening in March 2025 and enforcement in 2026. Covering 7 million individuals, the Act aims to combat fraud and money laundering, though verification methods remain unspecified. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/uk-sets-timeline-for-stricter-corporate-idv-aml-controls?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8rbgCNmF4lYxz53nREmg9uLkVCuVpmYTKXXbSO_NZzCGNqnKAhxKLhX_ihti0q6DnjOp7m">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Google allowed to depose Texas in biometric data lawsuits but blocked from deposing Attorney General’s office</p>



<p>Google has won the right to depose Texas in lawsuits over alleged biometric and consumer protection violations but cannot depose the Attorney General’s Office. The cases involve claims that Google Photos, Assistant, and Nest Hub Max violated Texas’ biometric law (CUBI) and that Google collected location data under the Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Google has also subpoenaed Clearview AI to support its defense, while Amazon and Lytx have settled similar biometric privacy lawsuits under Illinois’ BIPA for undisclosed terms and $4.25 million, respectively. The rulings highlight growing legal scrutiny over biometric data use in the tech industry. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/google-can-depose-texas-in-biometric-data-privacy-lawsuit-after-partial-appeals-win?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_1Up8BqW6NTgNcUE7oNY-KRAFumAiKWj5zXar4mMzr-zsAStNf3TfoQ82eMHS2xeYI-kSb">(Source)</a></p>

The need to network, collaborate, and lead often feels overwhelming. </p><p>“At work, I don’t always feel comfortable sharing my vulnerabilities,” Brunna admitted. </p> “Sometimes, being honest about feeling nervous can be seen as a weakness, and that’s not something I want to show.” <p>Even simple tasks, like asking her boss for vacation time, can spark overthinking. </p><p>“I wanted to ask for some time off, but my boss didn’t respond right away, and I found myself wondering: Is it too soon to ask? How should I phrase it?” </p><p>Instead of spiraling into doubt, she turned to Kin. </p><p>“I asked Kin how to approach the conversation,” she shared. “It helped me frame my request in a way that felt professional and clear. That gave me the confidence I needed to actually bring it up with my boss.”</p> Finding Support in the Right Tools <p>Brunna found a way to manage her challenges with Kin. What started as curiosity about the <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">personal AI</a> app quickly became an indispensable part of her routine.</p> “<a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> feels like a safe space where I can open up without fear of judgment,” Brunna explained. <p>“It’s helped me prepare for difficult conversations at work, organize my thoughts, and even reflect on my emotions.”</p><p>One feature of Kin that stood out for her was how the <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a> visualizes conversations. </p><p>“I love how it creates diagrams of what I share,” she said. “It’s helped me better understand myself, and it’s even something I plan to share with my therapist.”</p><p>Kin’s privacy features also gave her the confidence to open up. </p><p>“Knowing that my data is secure and won’t be shared is so important. I can say things to Kin that I wouldn’t feel comfortable saying to anyone else.”</p> Small Steps Toward Confidence <p>For Brunna, using Kin isn’t about erasing her introverted nature but embracing it as a strength. </p><p>Kin has helped her take small but meaningful steps toward confidence—whether it’s finding the right words for an email, preparing for a meeting, or reflecting on her emotions.</p><p>“Sometimes, I use Kin just to talk about personal feelings, like missing my boyfriend who lives in the Netherlands,” she shared. “What starts as a conversation about sadness often turns into something more positive, like talking about museums we’ve visited or things I enjoy. It’s a reminder that even small conversations can shift your perspective.”</p><p>These moments of reflection and preparation with the <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistant</a> have made a noticeable difference. </p><p>“I feel more prepared and less nervous when I use Kin,” Brunna said. “It’s not about becoming someone I’m not—it’s about showing up as the best version of myself.”</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a69eb16-dbf2-4baa-9155-c25728d612af_2715x2715.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@amelia_w2706?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Amelia Wahyuningtias</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/silhouette-of-woman-standing-near-window-77mx-jc-gb4?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  Thriving as an Introvert <p>Brunna’s story highlights the power of small steps and the right tools. </p><p>For introverts, thriving in the workplace isn’t about transforming into an extrovert. </p><p>It’s about finding ways to prepare, reflect, and navigate challenges in a way that feels authentic.</p><p>“No one is going to pat you on the back and say, ‘It’s fine, just breathe, drink some water,’” Brunna noted. “But Kin will. It’s like having someone who’s always there, reminding you that you’ve got this.”</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F277bbf0a-d102-46a0-b383-9bb3f1c708f5_6016x4016.jpeg">          </a>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Christina @ wocintechchat.com</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-using-smartphone-and-macbook-UTw3j_aoIKM?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a>  Final Thoughts <p>If you’re struggling with similar challenges, Kin can help.

<p>Identity verification has emerged as a key component of modern enterprise security as rules tighten and cyber threats, increasingly powered by AI, grow in volume and effectiveness. Emerging technology, changing attack patterns, and new regulations are all influencing how companies validate identities.</p> 
<p>Traditional identity proofing and verification methods — which are generally employed only at fixed checkpoints such as employee onboarding — are no longer enough. The prevalence of hybrid workforces, the advancement of fraud techniques, and the demand for seamless user experiences, are driving a shift toward continuous, contextual identity proofing. As we go into 2025, we look at key identity verification challenges and trends and their effects on workplace security.</p> 
 Rise In Interview and Onboarding Fraud  
<p>It's increasingly common for organizations to discover (eventually) that the candidate they thought they hired for a role is not the person that joins the company. The FBI and other agencies have issued multiple alerts about fake IT workers from North Korea infiltrating U.S. companies by using fabricated or stolen identities. The most <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123">recent FBI statement</a> warns that the stakes have grown higher, with North Korean IT workers extorting victims by holding stolen proprietary data and code hostage until the companies pay a ransom.</p> 
<p>The focus on the threat from North Korea however, while undeniably severe, masks the growing and widespread nature of the issue. Fraudsters exploit the ubiquity of remote work to pull a bait and switch, using deepfakes or stand-ins to impersonate job candidates during interviews and verification processes. The person that shows up on day one, and granted system access, isn’t the same person who went through the initial screening. Motivations range from the somewhat innocuous, for example trying to land a job the person isn’t qualified for, to malicious attempts to gain access to corporate systems. Anyone can be a target — HYPR recently exposed its own brush with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">candidate fraud</a> (which was thwarted by our Identity Assurance platform).</p> 
 AI-Powered Help Desk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Credential resets remain a major vulnerability, with attackers tricking help desk agents to bypass security protocols. Most IT service desks operate with limited staff and handle a high volume of calls, many of which involve password or MFA issues. Attackers often take advantage of human nature and publicly available information to deceive service desk personnel, ultimately gaining access to legitimate credentials. Once inside, they can access sensitive systems, escalate privileges, and move laterally within an organization — often without triggering security alerts.</p> 
<p>These attacks are particularly dangerous because they sidestep traditional security controls. Even with strong authentication policies in place, a well-executed social engineering attack can grant an adversary the same access as an authorized employee. Cybercriminals use tactics like creating a sense of urgency, posing as high-ranking executives, or leveraging insider-like information — often stolen or scraped from public sources — to make their requests seem credible. Generative AI has made these schemes even more convincing, allowing attackers to mimic speech patterns, craft realistic emails, or even generate deepfake voices in real time.</p> 
<p>Preventing help desk social engineering with HYPR</p> 
 Adoption of Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>The intensifying attacks on workforce system vulnerabilities underscore the critical need for enterprises to implement adaptive, robust identity proofing methods capable of detecting and neutralizing these sophisticated threats. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-rise-of-multi-factor-verification">Multi-factor verification</a> (MFV) has emerged as a logical evolution of traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA). Instead of relying on authentication as the primary gatekeeper, MFV makes adaptive, risk-based identity verification an intrinsic part of daily access flows. It integrates factors like behavior, biometrics, and contextual signals to continuously validate user identity throughout the session. MFV can address weak spots in critical processes like credential recovery and device registration, which traditionally use insecure methods such as knowledge-based answers and help desk calls.</p> 
<p>Consider a situation where a user logs in from a trusted device but behaves in an unexpected manner, for example accessing files that aren’t typical for their role or working from a different location. Based on these risk signals, MFV adjusts in real time, raising the required verification levels. By ensuring that verification aligns with the perceived threat and situational risk, MFV not only reduces the risk from compromised credentials, it provides a quicker, less intrusive process.</p> 
 NIST 800-63-4: Upping the Identity Verification Stakes  
<br> 
<p>The draft <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">NIST SP 800-63-4</a> guidelines, slated for release in 2025, introduce significant updates to strengthen identity proofing and verification standards. These include stricter provisions for remote identity proofing, incorporating advanced methods such as biometric matching and live document verification for remote onboarding. The draft standards also emphasize risk assessment, encouraging organizations to evaluate the risk level of each identity-related transaction and apply verification measures accordingly. Fraud detection is another area of focus, with requirements to detect and mitigate potential fraud during verification processes.</p> 
<p>The guidelines highlight the shift toward continuous identity verification as a critical component of identity assurance. Enterprises looking to align with NIST 800-63-4 will need to adopt rigorous, scalable solutions to improve security while meeting compliance requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Emergence of Decentralized Identity  
<p>Decentralized identity systems will start to gain traction in the workplace in 2025. Organizations can significantly simplify and secure processes like onboarding and credential recovery by incorporating verifiable credentials, such as Microsoft Verified ID credentials, into their identity processes. A modern decentralized identity verification workflow might include the following steps:</p> 
  
  The employee’s identity is verified using advanced proofing methods, such as document capture, liveness detection, and employer attestation.  
  Once verified, the employee receives a secure, verifiable credential issued to their digital wallet.  
  The credential enables the employee to complete tasks like provisioning passkeys, enrolling in benefits, or resetting credentials, all without relying on centralized identity stores.  
  
<p>Example workflow to issue Microsoft Entra Verified ID credentials</p> 
<p>This decentralized approach not only streamlines workflows but also strengthens security by reducing reliance on centralized systems.</p> 
 Preparing for the Future of Identity Verification  
<p>As identity verification trends evolve, organizations must adapt to stay secure and competitive. Multi-factor verification, robust defenses against social engineering, and alignment with emerging standards like NIST 800-63-4 are critical to staying secure. Decentralized identity solutions offer promising advancements in simplifying and securing workforce processes, but only when paired with strong identity proofing practices.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s Identity Assurance platform was built to help organizations navigate these challenges. HYPR integrates phishing-resistant passwordless authentication, adaptive risk mitigation, and automated identity verification into a streamlined and user-friendly access flow. It allows organizations to tailor identity verification processes to fit their specific environments and use cases. For instance, secure self-service options can be used in low-risk situations, while additional measures, such as live video verification, can be invoked in higher-risk scenarios or when anomalies are detected. To see how HYPR can help your organization, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/get-a-demo">schedule a demo</a> tailored to your identity security interests and needs.</p>

  Spain’s secure communications satellite SpainSat NG I successfully launched
tas

Thu, 01/30/2025 - 15:24


             
 Starting in the second half of this year, SpainSat NG I will provide services to Spain’s Armed Forces, international organizations such as the European Commission or NATO, and governments of allied countries. 
 Thales Alenia Space, together with Airbus Defence and Space, has led the construction of this satellite and its twin, SpainSat NG II, which is also scheduled for launch in 2025. 
 The company has been responsible, among other activities, for the integration of the Communication Module for both satellites along with Airbus in a clean room built for this purpose at its facilities in Tres Cantos, Madrid. To date, this has been the largest satellite system ever integrated in Spain. 
 
<p>Madrid, January 30, 2025 - The secure communications satellite SpainSat NG I has been successfully launched early this morning by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral (Florida). An unprecedented milestone for the Spanish space sector.</p>
<p>The SPAINSAT NG program, owned and operated by Hisdesat Servicios Estratégicos S.A., comprises two satellites, SpainSat NG I and II. Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), together with Airbus Defence &amp; Space, has led the execution and construction of both satellites, SpainSat NG I and its twin, SpainSat NG II, which will be launched this fall. The two satellites will be positioned in different geostationary positions to operate in X-band, military Ka-band, and UHF, providing coverage to two-thirds of the Earth's surface, from the United States of America to Singapore. It will provide services for the next 15 years.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space in Spain has been responsible for the UHF and military Ka-band payloads and the integration of the Communication Module for the two satellites along with Airbus. The Communication Module is the main body of the satellite, which embarks the communication payloads that give purpose to the mission.</p>
 
  
 
<p>© Airbus</p>
<p>Specifically for this mission, the company built an assembly and integration clean room at its site in Tres Cantos, Madrid, inaugurated in 2021, where the Communication Modules of the two satellites have been integrated. These advanced cutting-edge facilities represent a qualitative leap in Spain’s space industry capabilities for the assembly and integration of large space systems, something within the reach of a few space powers worldwide.</p>
<p>Being the largest satellite system ever integrated in Spain, the SpainSat NG I Communication Module weights more than 2 tons and measures 6 meters high, and is fully equipped with cutting-edge technology in the field of space communications, comprising hundreds of sophisticated electronic units.</p>
<p>The company has also designed and manufactured in Spain, France, Italy, and Belgium over 200 of electronic and radiofrequency units that are an integral part of the communications payloads and the satellite's telecommand and telemetry system. Among them are the UHF processor, the heart of the UHF-band payload; the Transparent Digital Processor (DTP) that interconnects the X-band and military Ka-band payloads; and the Hilink unit, responsible for providing a high-speed service link that will facilitate a quick reconfiguration of the payloads.</p>
<p>The SPAINSAT NG program</p>
<p>SpainSat NG I is one of the most advanced secure communications satellites in Europe and ranks among the most innovative in the world. It is expected to begin to provide services early in the second half of 2025 to the Spanish Armed Forces, international organizations such as the European Commission in the GOVSATCOM program, NATO, and other allied governments.</p>
<p>Its mission is to ensure effective command and control of Armed Forces operations over a large portion of the Earth's surface, guarantee communication capability in theatres of operations lacking communication infrastructure, ensure secure governmental communications in any operational environment (air, maritime, land), and provide strategic space capabilities to third nations.</p>
<p>The SpainSat NG satellites, which will replace the current Hisdesat communications satellites, Spainsat and XTAR-EUR, will be capable of providing secure satellite communications with maximum protection against interference or other threats, including a high-altitude nuclear event, with maximum flexibility thanks to its real-time software-defined payload.<br>

There is no right or wrong; you can fill it with whatever you choose.</p><p>The aim of journaling isn’t to come to a big revelation, or even to write about your daily experience. It’s just to write. The rest comes by itself—so write freely.</p>  <p>Try to Journal Regularly</p>  <p>Regular journaling helps both you and Kin notice patterns in your behavior and relationships. Kin stores these in its personal memory of you, which helps Kin better understand how to guide you in the future.</p><p>Regularly doesn’t have to mean every day—though that is often best. Once a week or even once a month is better than nothing!</p>  <p>Discuss Entries with Kin</p>  <p>Unlike traditional journaling, Kin can discuss your Journal entries with you, as well as record them.

Not even we can do that.</p> Extra Tips for Using Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Companion</a> <p>Those aren’t the only things you can do. Here are some more ideas for getting the most from Kin’s Journal:</p>  <p>Get Comfortable: Choose a quiet moment when you won't be interrupted, and decide whether you want to write or speak, so you can just Journal.</p>  <p>Consider Prompts: Look at today’s prompt, and see if it inspires anything. But if you already have something in mind, or feel yourself drifting away from the prompt, that’s okay. Just keep writing.</p>  <p>Anything Goes: It doesn’t matter if you write one word, or 10,000. It doesn’t even matter what words they are. What matters is you wrote what you wanted to.</p>  <p>Add Feeling: That being said, many people find it helpful to consider their feelings as they write, and to include them. It might sound cliche, but it helps.</p>  <p>Don’t Push: If you’re finding it really hard to write anything, don’t force it. Just write that you struggled, and come back to it later—even during your next session.</p>  <p>And, remember—Journaling helps inform Kin's Memory about you. The more you use it, the more personal and valuable Kin’s insights will become. You can always discuss your Journal entries or even your feelings in Kin’s regular chat too, if you’re seeking interactivity.</p> Get Started Today with your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Assistant</a>: <p>Ready to start journaling? Here's a prompt you can send Kin to help it help you through the process:</p> <p>“Hey Kin, how should I best Journal with you?”</p>

<p>This article is written in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunus-g%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9Fsoy/">Yunus Gümüşsoy</a>, the winner of the FOMC data challenge hosted by Ocean Foam in December&nbsp;2024.</p> Introduction <p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on January 28–29, 2025, has garnered significant attention from financial markets, impacting investment strategies across technology, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence sectors. Interest rate decisions are pivotal in shaping economic policy and market sentiment; thus, predicting these outcomes is invaluable for traders, analysts, and policymakers.</p>Fed Funds Interest Rate changes over&nbsp;time<p>To investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) in forecasting FOMC decisions and their market impact, <a href="https://www.ocean-foam.ai/">Ocean Foam</a> and <a href="https://competitions.desights.ai/">Desights</a> organized a <a href="https://competitions.desights.ai/challenge/33">data challenge</a> in December 2024. This initiative aimed to utilize ML techniques to analyze macroeconomic data, financial indicators, and Federal Reserve communications to enhance the accuracy of rate decision predictions.</p><p>This article discusses our findings from the challenge and employs the best-performing ML model to predict the FOMC’s latest decision. As of now, the Federal Reserve has opted to maintain current interest rates after several prior cuts, striving for a balanced economic path amid fluctuating market conditions. We will evaluate our model’s performance while acknowledging areas for improvement.</p> Applying the Model to January&nbsp;2025 <p>Following the success of the December challenge, we applied our highest-performing model to predict outcomes for the January FOMC meeting. We aimed to refine our predictive framework by integrating additional economic indicators, sentiment analysis, and ML optimizations.</p><p>Our analysis considered various macroeconomic factors, although we will highlight only a few key indicators here. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Consumer Price Index (CPI): A vital measure of inflation that significantly influences Fed decisions.  Unemployment Rate: An essential indicator of labor market health, crucial for monetary policy considerations.  Financial Market Trends: Encompassing stock market movements, bond yields, and overall investor sentiment.  Federal Reserve Communications: Analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) to detect shifts in policy&nbsp;tone.  <p>Please refer to the “Understanding Macroeconomic Correlations” section for a comprehensive view of all the factors analyzed.</p><p>We tested multiple ML models to enhance prediction accuracy and ultimately selected a fine-tuned Random Forest model for its balance of interpretability and predictive power. Transparency was essential; we ensured the model’s outputs were understandable and aligned with economic rationale. Our approach involved analyzing FOMC communications to discern tone and underlying messages through sentiment analysis tools. We also examined economic data trends to create features that could aid in predicting future rate&nbsp;changes.</p> Prediction for the January 2025 FOMC&nbsp;Meeting <p>Our model’s probability distribution for the January 29, 2025, FOMC rate decision is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  No change (+0.00%): 51.1% probability  Rate cut (-0.25%): 6.7% probability  Rate cut (-0.50%): 6.9% probability  Rate hike (+0.25%): 35.3% probability  <p>The model indicates a substantial likelihood of no rate change, consistent with the current economic landscape. The new presidential administration favors lower interest rates, so a rate hike appears less probable. However, a 35.3% probability remains for a 0.25% increase, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in market expectations.</p> Understanding Macroeconomic Correlations <p>Understanding the relationship between macroeconomic factors and the Fed Funds Rate is crucial for grasping monetary policy dynamics. To enhance our predictive framework, we examined correlations among key economic indicators.</p><p>Correlation Heatmap of Macroeconomic Factors &amp; Fed Funds&nbsp;Rate</p>Correlation heatmap<p>The heatmap illustrates pairwise correlations among various economic indicators:</p>  High Positive Correlations: Treasury yields (2-year and 10-year) and mortgage rates with the Fed Funds&nbsp;Rate.  Moderate Correlations: CPI and Core CPI reflect the Fed’s focus on inflation trends.  Weaker Relationships: Employment-related factors like unemployment rates remain key considerations but show weaker direct correlations.   Ranked Correlation of Variables with Fed Funds&nbsp;Rate Correlation of variables<p>A bar chart ranks individual macroeconomic factors based on their correlation strength:</p>  Highly Positive Correlations: Bank loan rates, Treasury yields, and mortgage rates are strong indicators of monetary policy adjustments.  Negative Correlations: The unemployment rate, oil prices, and real export rates indicate that rate hikes often correlate with stronger economic conditions and lower unemployment.   Future Improvements and Next&nbsp;Steps <p>While our model shows promising accuracy, there are areas for enhancement:</p>  Enhanced Sentiment Analysis: Incorporating advanced NLP techniques to detect nuanced shifts in Federal Reserve rhetoric.  Expanded Macroeconomic Data: Including additional leading indicators such as consumer spending trends and wage&nbsp;growth.  Real-Time Adaptation: Developing models that dynamically update as new economic data becomes available.  <p>A key takeaway from this challenge is that even advanced models can struggle with real-world uncertainties influenced by political factors or unexpected market shifts. The model’s 35.3% probability of a rate hike underscores this challenge.</p><p>Moving forward, we will focus on refining our models to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating more financial sentiment indicators and macroeconomic trends. By continuously iterating on these approaches, we aim to provide better predictive insights for policymakers, investors, and financial analysts navigating monetary policy complexities.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

			 Philippe Gonday is Blockchain Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I’m Philippe, a software engineer living in the west of France and a proud father of three. My life is a blend of family, technology, and passion.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>My career has unfolded in three distinct stages. I started with embedded real-time software development, primarily for mobile phones. Later, I transitioned to backend web application development. Since 2021, I’ve been immersed in the blockchain ecosystem, navigating the challenges and opportunities of various startups. Joining Tokeny felt like a natural step given my passion for finance and DeFi, and the company’s ideal size for innovation and growth.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working at Tokeny means enjoying the liberty of full remote work while staying connected with a team of truly great people. The team-building activities are fantastic, fostering both collaboration and connection.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Music is a huge part of my life. I play bass guitar and am also involved in Javanese Gamelan. Beyond music, I find peace and inspiration in the mountains, where I love to hike and explore.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>As a father, I worry about the challenges facing the world, from climate change to conflicts at Europe’s doorstep. My ultimate dream is for a more peaceful and sustainable world—though I acknowledge it feels like a distant hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Full remote work offers incredible freedom, but it also requires a strong sense of responsibility. Embrace the balance, and you’ll thrive.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I believe blockchain and DeFi have the potential to become the operating system of finance. Tokeny sits at a fascinating intersection of traditional and decentralized finance, making it an exciting place to shape the future.</p>

From here, you can say anything you want to Kin.</p> <p>💡 Use the Voice controls in the input box to talk with Kin, rather than text with it.</p>  Step Two: Tell Kin Something <p>Let Kin know something about you, those around you, or your situation.</p><p>Once you send the message, or Kin transcribes it, you’ll see that any keywords Kin thinks it should remember are highlighted in the chat thread.</p> <p>💡 Has Kin missed out a keyword? Want to know more about what it knows? Just ask—Kin can record and explain knowledge on request.</p>  Step Three: Visit the Streaks &amp; Stats Tab <p>Any highlighted keywords (and the information about them) are automatically added to Kin’s Memory by its <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>By tapping the “x” button in the top left to return to the homepage, and hitting the flame icon in the top right, you can enter the Streaks &amp; Stats tab.</p><p>Here, Kin shows you the amount of days you’ve used Kin in a row (your streak), and what Kin has learned about you today across its Chat and Journal features.</p> <p>💡 In the top right of the tab, hit the connected dots icon to view your Knowledge Map, which showcases every connection and fact Kin has recorded about you.</p>  Maximizing Kin’s Memory <p>Kin’s memory can do more than just this, though. Here’s how to make the most of our <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistant</a>’s memory:</p> 1. Interact with Kin Daily <p>By making Kin a habit, it’ll catch more of the small things that might be easily lost. New names, spontaneous promises, mid-shower realizations—Kin can save them all for you, if you let it.</p> 2. Share Deeper; Go Further <p>When sharing facts and situations, full context is the most helpful for Kin to remember—explain social dynamics, highlight important sections, and include your feelings. Our Journal feature is especially helpful for helping you do this.</p><p>Kin can even combine this information with analyses and web searches for personalized yet informed responses that help guide you through life.</p> 3. Set Strategic Reminders <p>You can set custom <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-reminders">Reminders</a> with Kin to help you track particularly important or elusive things.</p><p>Got to remember that email? Trying to build a new nightly routine? Just tell Kin what you'd like to be reminded about when, and Kin will keep tabs—both on the homepage, and in your Chat.</p> 4. Keep <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">Privacy</a> Controlled <p>You can <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> that Kin does this privately and securely, too. Kin’s entire Memory is stored only on your device, invisible to anyone but you.</p><p>At any time, you can head over to the Knowledge Map and see or delete it—all in one place.</p> Extra Tips for Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> <p>There’s more you can do to make Kin’s memory more powerful. Consider doing the following in your conversations with Kin:</p>  <p>Introduce Yourself: Tell Kin who you are, what you do, and what your goals are to give it a baseline about you.</p>  <p>Cover Context: Explain what's currently going on at work and at home, so Kin can understand your situation and how it might be affecting you.</p>  <p>Catch Everything: Nothing’s too small. Make sure you cover how you're feeling, and little things like new names you've learnt and off-the-cuff promises you've made.</p>  <p>Set Reminders: Ask Kin to remind you about a few things coming up—whether that's a discussion with a colleague, or your next haircut—so you can get a feel for how they work.</p>  <p>Probe Gaps: Check if there's anything else Kin would like to know about you, so it can improve its support of you.</p>  <p>And, remember—Kin's Memory becomes more valuable the more you use it. Small, regular interactions, with larger conversations as you want them, are a good way to build a habit and keep Kin informed.</p> Get Started Today with Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Companion</a> <p>Ready to begin maximizing Kin's memory? Here's to send to Kin which will kick off the process:</p> <p>“Hey, Kin. What do you know about me, and what would you like to know about me?”</p>

				  In the identity industry, ID verification or “IDV” is the term for the process of verifying that a person is who they claim to be. This process plays an important role in establishing trust in Verifiable Credentials by confirming the authenticity of the credential holder’s identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>Industries across finance, government, healthcare, travel, e-commerce, and telecommunications are rapidly adopting Identity Verification (IDV) to enhance security, prevent fraud, and comply with regulatory requirements. Banks and fintech firms are using IDV for KYC and AML compliance, while governments rely on it for issuing passports, digital IDs, and secure citizen access to public services. In healthcare, IDV ensures patient identity for telemedicine and medical records, while travel and transportation sectors use it for seamless airport experiences and ride-sharing safety. As digital interactions grow, businesses are integrating IDV to build trust, reduce fraud, and streamline user authentication, making it a crucial component of modern digital ecosystems.</p>
<p>How IDV works</p>
<p>Identity Verification usually functions by confirming the validity of personal information and documentation provided by the individual against reliable data sources. Some of the steps that can be undertaken during ID verification include:&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Document verification 
						 <p>Examining passports, driver’s licenses, or national ID cards.</p>
<p>These physical documents typically require security features like the holograms or watermarks.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Biometric verification 
						 <p>Matching biometric information such as facial recognition, fingerprinting, or iris scanning to data that’s been provided on the document.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Liveness detection 
						 <p>A way of ensuring that that person being verified is physically present and not using a video or picture to spoof the system.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Database verification 
						 <p>Cross-checking the presented information against trusted databases or registries.</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>IDV + VC = an easy win for everybody</p>
<p>The combination of Identity Verification and Verifiable Credentials creates a powerful framework for secure and efficient digital identity management. Verifiable Credentials extend the range of identity verification technologies by encapsulating the verified data in a privacy-preserving and portable format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credential technology offers the unique ability to securely hold data in a tamper-resistant way, and make it easy to share across systems. They do this by packaging the data created by issuing organizations and digitally signing it in a way where any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential. Once created, the credential can be easily and securely stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet and verified by anyone with the appropriate software. This provides a better experience for the user who no longer needs to repeat redundant identity verification steps, and saves relying parties the costs of verifying each user.</p>
<p>(For a more in-depth look at Verifiable Credentials you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">read this short article</a> from Indicio.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to use them effectively, we need to be sure that the data inside is correct, we need a strong identity verification process.</p>
<p>An example of this technology combination in action are the government-grade credentials that Indicio has developed that can be self derived from the user’s passport. Used in our solution for SITA and the government of Aruba, these credentials can be created in seconds by scanning the chip inside a biometric passport and performing the necessary document authentication. The generated credential can then be presented digitally to share the relevant information from the passport to the border authorities prior to departure.</p>
<p>In short, these two technologies are highly complementary to each other. The existing IDV processes ensure the quality of the data for the credential, and the Verifiable Credential enables that data to be reused and shared across systems, organizations, and platforms.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about how these technologies work together you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sD8r3gwj4w">watch a recent video from Indicio.</a> Or if you would like to discuss a specific implementation or ask questions of our team please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us here.</a></p>

<p>This launch is more than a business collaboration; it is a significant step toward reshaping how organizations approach workforce authentication. Here is everything you need to know about this innovative approach and its game-changing impact on businesses worldwide.</p>
 The Vision Behind the Launch 
<p>The vision of this partnership is to modernize and transform user onboarding and authentication into digital services in a way that enables high-assurance trust, improved user satisfaction and reduced friction to the user experience in ways not previously possible.</p>
<p>This is delivered through a low-risk enterprise-wide methodology that encompasses the many systems typically left uncovered by passwordless strategies, overcomes user resistance by easing them into their new experience at a controlled pace, and drives quick time to value through a scalable, enterprise-wide approach.</p>
<p>This vision is realized through the following combination of cloud-delivered business applications, globally high-availability infrastructure and world-class managed services team located in regions throughout the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">1Kosmos Verify</a> for remote identity verification represents an order of magnitude improvement in credential issuing during user onboarding and account recovery, where agents represent a single point of cyber vulnerability. The solution can be implemented stand-alone or integrated via SDK and standard API connectors to replace weak knowledge-based authentication (KBA) and two-factor authentication (2FA) with a simple self-service workflow that can be executed from any device, anywhere, and at any time. This detects stolen and synthetic identities and quickly establishes high-assurance trust for legitimate workers, many of whom are remote contractors and routinely onboarded outside the control of Human Resource (HR) departments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/workforce/">1Kosmos Workforce</a> for passwordless MFA represents a paradigm shift in authentication by eliminating the vulnerabilities of traditional passwords via identity-backed biometrics. Built on a decentralized identity framework, it ensures secure, frictionless authentication for employees, contractors, and supply chain partners into new and legacy Windows, macOS, iOS, Linux, and Unix environments as well as non-SAML based applications and digital services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.concentrix.com/services-solutions/cybersecurity-managed-security-services/">Concentrix CyberProtect</a> offers a full suite of security services to bolster cyber defenses via an automation-first, AI-driven approach to design, build, and run next-generation security solutions. This provides swift, expert deployment and ongoing global support to ensure resilience against evolving cyber threats.</p>
 Transformative Features and Benefits 
<p>1. Remote Identity Verification</p>
<p>Problem: HR departments and IT (Information Technology) Service Desk agents working with remote workers use antiquated identity verification processes that rely on manual review of government-issued credentials typically shared in the clear via email and SMS messaging. The use of high-quality fake credentials and AI deepfake presentation and injection attacks defeat these measures with increasing efficacy. Non-secure sharing of documents scatters digital artifacts putting individuals at risk for compromised PII (Personal Identifiable Information).</p>
<p>Solution: 1Kosmos offers around a dozen modalities for identity verification. For high assurance, identity documents are scanned and managed via an end-to-end encrypted workflow that verifies authenticity in real time for 150+ countries globally. Facial scanning hardened against deepfake attacks matches user likeness, issues a pass/fail and can create a digital authentication credential certified to FIDO, NIST, UK DIATF and iBeta Pad-1 specifications.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>· +99% accuracy to verify identity anywhere, anytime and on any device</p>
<p>· Non-biased racial or gender decisioning drives objectivity, equity, and fairness</p>
<p>· Privacy by design secures PII and gives users control</p>
<p>· Brandable mobile app, app-less or browser workflows</p>
<p>2. Passwordless Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</p>
<p>Problem: Traditional MFA methods, such as SMS-based codes and push notifications, are increasingly compromised through social engineering, SIM swapping and push bombing.</p>
<p>Solution: 1Kosmos leverages biometric identity verification to eliminate passwords entirely. By using facial, fingerprint recognition or any one of around a dozen authentication modalities, users can authenticate seamlessly across devices and platforms without sacrificing security.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>· Cost Reduction: Eliminate SMS fees and multiple authenticators and reduce helpdesk workloads related to password resets.</p>
<p>· Enhanced User Experience: Simplify the login process for employees, contractors, and partners.</p>
<p>· Improved Security: Create a durable, tamper-proof digital identity for each user, minimizing cyber risks.</p>
<p>3. Restricted Environment Compatibility</p>
<p>Problem: Many workplaces, such as clean rooms and customer-facing service desks, cannot allow mobile phones, camera-equipped mobile devices, or hardware tokens.</p>
<p>Solution: 1Kosmos introduces a fingerprint biometric security key that supports multiple users on a single device. This ensures secure, passwordless MFA even in environments with transient workers and / or shared workstations.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<p>· Efficiency: Reduce the need any user-specific hardware (such as security keys). The device stays with the workstation.</p>
<p>· Simplicity: Enable a zero-learning-curve user experience with intuitive biometric authentication.</p>
<p>· Flexibility: Can authenticate into the workstation or web-based applications.</p>
<p>Business Impact: The Numbers Speak</p>

<p>In this episode, we speak with Jonas Branvall, Head of International Expansion at BankID Sweden, one of the most widely-adopted reusable ID systems in the world. With 99.7% of Swedish adults using BankID and over 7,500 relying parties onboard, it’s a fascinating success story in the digital identity space.</p><p>I’ve been eager to explore what drives the adoption of a universally embraced digital ID system, and Jonas provides clear answers. We discuss the pivotal role of strong use cases in driving adoption, including the two major relying party use cases that helped BankID achieve its widespread success. Jonas also shares his insights on the tipping point for adoption—approximately 40% penetration—and why that marks the transition to ubiquity for both users and relying parties.</p><p>BankID’s story offers a powerful model for anyone involved in launching mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), EUDI wallets, private-sector reusable ID networks, or companies looking to integrate these solutions.</p><p>Join me for this insightful conversation with Jonas Branvall and learn more about BankID at <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/">https://www.bankid.com/en/</a>.</p>

Knowledge-based <p>These paths see someone build their career through gained knowledge, whether that’s from moving up the corporate ladder, upskilling, studying, or a mixture of the three.</p><p>Human resources, marketing, accounting, information technology, and engineering roles often come under this category.</p> 2. Skills-based <p>Similar to knowledge-based careers, but in relation to physical skills like service, performance arts, or construction. In these roles, experience tends to matter more than anything.</p> 3. Entrepreneur-based <p>A less-standardized path, entrepreneur-based career paths see people begin their own company to fill an identified market gap. The path often includes the elements of knowledge- and experience-gaining the previous two paths contain, but with the end goal of creating and maintaining a new successful company.</p> 4. Freelance-based <p>Landing somewhere between the first two paths and the entrepreneur-based path, freelance-based career paths see people offer out their knowledge and skills on a temporary basis to businesses and individuals.</p><p>It’s most common for writers, consultants, tradespeople, and artists to offer their services in this way, but most professions can.</p><p>It can be useful for people to know which career path they fall under, as this can help them recognise their natural tendencies, and create <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/set-specific-goals-with-kin">effective goal setting</a> toward an ambition.</p> The Five Career Pathways <p>The five career pathways often come up in career discussions, and refer to the five health science career pathways—the specific routes people can take into a healthcare career.<a>2</a></p><p>While not extensively covered in this article, these are:</p>  <p>Diagnostic Services</p>  <p>Therapeutic Services</p>  <p>Health Informatics</p>  <p>Support Services</p>  <p>Biotechnology Research &amp; Development</p>  <p>Though these can be helpful if considering a way into a healthcare career, they are not as broad as their four traditional kin above.</p><p>Early on in a career journey, it’s still worth asking questions like “is technology a good career path?” or “what about business management?” to reflect on paths travelled so far, and find the best personal fit.</p><p>But why is this important?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a0c6ebc-d271-462d-8347-406dac8b71ad_1280x787.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@omgitsyeshi?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Yeshi Kangrang</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-round-glass-ball-iuqxv7kFj64?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  The Importance of Career Reflection <p>Career reflection is crucial to professional growth, because it helps individuals take control of their own career and make informed decisions about their career trajectory. In fact, research shows that those who engage in career reflection and exploration are often happier with their jobs.<a>3</a></p><p>What’s more, reflection on the skills and experience someone has developed, and the ways they’ve done this over their career journey, are indispensable parts of <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/growth-mindset-the-power-of-belief">improving mindset</a>, increasing <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-build-emotional-intelligence">emotional intelligence</a>, and perfecting <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-tips-to-improve-work-life-balance">work-life balance</a>.</p><p>Without this power of perspective, it can be hard to plan a path to a dream career, or figure out why a job feels so miserable—even if a <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">career coach</a> is hired.</p><p>So, if it’s so important, how is career reflection done?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc231384-fd27-4da5-bead-35623492ce46_1399x829.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@noahbuscher?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Noah Buscher</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/standing-woman-surrounded-by-yellow-flower-field-during-daytime-M19QtooXPKs?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  The Core Components of Career Reflection <p>Bearing some similarity to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/anxiety-journaling-complete-guide">journaling for anxiety</a> and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/improve-self-evaluation-professional-growth">self evaluation</a>, the process of career reflection is all about providing a clear picture of what career path has been followed, and how well that’s fit.</p><p>But what does this look like?</p> 1. Thorough Assessment <p>Firstly, to assess a current position along a career trajectory, take stock of everything that has been experienced up to this moment. This process is often supported by mentors, career counselors, or, as will be discussed, personal AI tools like Kin.</p><p>Consider factors like:</p>  <p>Specific Skills: What has been learnt, and how advanced is the knowledge? Remember to include hard and soft skills.</p>  <p>Level of Responsibility: How much has been trusted to these skillsets?</p>    <p>Years of Experience: How long has this career journey been so far? How long has each skill been learnt and applied for?</p>    <p>Scope of impact: What has been achieved by those skills in that time?</p>  <p>Comparison to Industry Standards for your field. LinkedIn and other professional organizations often provide benchmarks for different career stages, from entry-level to executive positions.</p>   2. Practical Evaluation <p>Next, consider how effectively and easily these skillsets were gained, and what they bring to the current career trajectory stage. Were there faster ways to reach the same level? Are there new skills needed to fill gaps growing within these specific skills?</p> 3. Emotional Evaluation <p>Now, look at the previous step from an emotional perspective. What feelings do those skills—and the ways they were acquired—provoke? Does the current level of ability in this career path and progress inspire pride, indifference, or disappointment? What situation (or even different career paths) might have been preferred? Does this experience align with personal values?</p><p>This step can feel superfluous to some, but it’s not just an essential step for growing emotional intelligence—it can often reveal the culprit behind burnout and job dissatisfaction.</p> 4. Reconsider Goals: <p>Finally, review any career goals alongside this information. Is the current career trajectory leading to these goals? Are these goals even still what’s wanted? What new roles or skills are needed, and how can this career trajectory be updated to meet them?</p><p>Initiatives like <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-151688310?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">continuous learning</a> or <a href="https://docs.mykin.ai/collections/9923418-journaling">journaling</a> may be implemented here to help.</p><p>But what comes next?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ad56d-bb7c-4c85-912a-6fa312442c26_1600x950.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@writeria?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Mélanie Arouk</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pink-lotus-flower-on-river-close-up-photo-AXJWnloQ3CA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Building an Effective Career Reflection Practice <p>Next is all about ensuring the assessment process above is carried out regularly, effectively, and with sustainability. This helps personal career goals always stay true to personal ambitions, as it informs effective milestones for both entry-level workers and experienced professionals.</p><p>To do this, consider the following steps to help make this a strong habit:</p> 1. Define Preferences <p>Decide what medium, time and location is best for the career reflection.</p><p>Are notebooks easier to use, or is a touchscreen or keyboard preferred? Are mornings uncluttered, or does the night finally give space to think? Is a bustling environment appreciated, or is quiet solitude?</p><p>Ensuring that the best personal working conditions can be arranged like this will minimize distractions and irritations.</p> 2. Foster Consistency <p>Now, look for ways to connect these preferences to existing habits to make them easier to keep. Have five minutes on the morning train? Jot down some thoughts. Like a Saturday snooze? Reflect on the week once you wake up.</p><p>The tighter reflection is tied to old habits, the easier it will be to remember to do it as well.</p> 3. Have Conversations <p>Finally, talk about the findings. Tell friends, family, colleagues, mentors, personal AI, everyone. Each person has a unique insight and perspective to share, and can do so from within their own career pathway, and not anyone else’s.</p><p>But, that can be a lot of work. How can this be more effective?</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c486593-eed2-4d86-b0e3-b4fc1c957bcc_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@heapdump?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Patrick Lindenberg</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-optical-disc-drive-1iVKwElWrPA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  The Role of <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> in Career Reflection <p>Digital tracking and pattern recognition capabilities in AI tools like <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a> and <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companions</a> have transformed how professionals understand themselves, their colleagues, and their career trajectories.</p><p>Technology like these machine learning algorithms can analyze years of career and behaviour data to identify trends in employee and global industry behaviour alike, meaning employees and their companies can respond to them more quickly than ever.</p><p>Other AI tools like <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistants</a> make it easier for both employers and employees to track employee engagement, upskilling, and performance by logging information about these metrics, and analyzing it against their datasets.

<p>Picture this: A luxury apartment in a bustling city is purchased for cash by an unknown buyer through a string of anonymous shell companies. The sale raises no eyebrows, but behind the scenes, a complex money laundering operation is underway. From illicit origins to seemingly legitimate assets, this is the journey of “dirty money”—and the fight against it begins with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks.</p>



<p>Let’s follow the path of laundered money through its three stages—placement, layering, and integration—and see how robust AML processes can break the chain at each step.</p>



 



 Stage 1: Placement — Getting Illicit Cash Into the System 



<p>It starts with a duffel bag of cash in a bustling financial district. The launderer’s challenge? Converting a pile of questionable money into something less conspicuous. Enter placement, where funds are introduced into the financial system.</p>



 
 The Tactic: Instead of depositing a large sum into a single account (a major red flag), the launderer sends small amounts across multiple accounts at different branches—also known as “smurfing.” Some of the funds are funneled into luxury car purchases or jewelry, quickly flipped for cash. 



 The Risk: At this stage, banks may notice unusual deposits or sudden asset purchases. But if no AML checks are in place, the funds slide through undetected. 
 



<p>How AML Helps: Customer due diligence (CDD) kicks in here—verifying identities, tracking transaction patterns, and flagging customers depositing amounts that don’t match their profiles. Advanced systems automatically cross-check data against watchlists and issue alerts for suspicious activity.</p>



 



 Stage 2: Layering — Disguising the Money’s Origins 



<p>The launderer now faces the next hurdle: making the funds untraceable. In the layering phase, the money is moved across accounts, companies, and borders to obscure its origins.</p>



 
 The Tactic: The funds pass through shell companies, offshore accounts, and even fake invoices for “business expenses.” Wire transfers bounce from one country to another, each hop making the trail more complex. 



 The Cover Story: To the outside world, it looks like a series of standard business transactions—payments for consulting services or shipments that never existed. 
 



<p>How AML Helps: This is where transaction monitoring tools shine. They flag unusual patterns, such as frequent international transfers to high-risk regions or round-dollar amounts that match no legitimate business activity. Machine learning algorithms detect when these activities deviate from normal behavior, even in large, global transaction flows.</p>



 



 Stage 3: Integration — Making the Money Look Legitimate 



<p>Once the money has been sufficiently disguised, it’s time to bring it back into the economy—cleaned and ready for “legitimate” use. This is the integration phase, where illicit funds reappear as real estate investments, stock portfolios, or lavish lifestyle purchases.</p>



 
 The Tactic: The launderer buys a $5 million penthouse outright, claiming the money came from the sale of a successful business. They might also repay large loans or invest in companies with stable returns, embedding the funds into the economy. 



 The Challenge: At this stage, the money looks like it belongs. Without context, it’s difficult to distinguish legitimate earnings from laundered funds. 
 



<p>How AML Helps: Enhanced due diligence (EDD) is key here. When a transaction or customer’s background raises red flags—such as ties to politically exposed persons (PEPs) or untraceable revenue sources—EDD digs deeper, collecting additional data and scrutinizing high-value purchases. Automated systems provide detailed audit trails, ensuring nothing is missed.</p>



 



 The Human Cost of Failure 



<p>When laundered money flows freely, the consequences are far-reaching—fueled criminal enterprises, destabilized economies, and reputational damage for financial institutions. But with robust AML processes, institutions can stop dirty money in its tracks, ensuring their systems don’t become conduits for crime.</p>



 



 A Future-Ready AML Strategy 



<p>Gone are the days when manual audits were enough. In today’s landscape, AML programs must be adaptive, automated, and vigilant. Real-time monitoring, machine learning, and secure data processing are no longer luxuries—they’re necessities.</p>



<p>The difference between catching a launderer at “placement” rather than “integration” could be millions in fines—or worse, a reputation that’s impossible to repair. By embracing advanced AML solutions, financial institutions can protect not just their businesses, but the communities they serve.</p>

 A new consortium will accelerate LA’s reconstruction <p>In Los Angeles, thankfully, the fires are now contained.</p><p>Now the city faces the task of rebuilding, which brings with it whole new challenges. Some of these critical issues — like expedited permitting processes — are already being addressed. But how is the reconstruction going to be financed? Will the construction financing system be over-stressed by the sheer scale and complexity of the&nbsp;rebuild?</p><p>Mattereum has teamed up with the renowned <a href="https://fastrackinstitute.org/">Fastrack Institute</a> and influential Bitcoin infrastructure developers <a href="https://bitscape.io/new/">Bitscape</a> to answer these questions. “Permit to Permanence” envisages a new, faster way to complete critical construction financing steps in the LA rebuilding processes.</p><a href="http://mattereum.com">http://mattereum.com</a> contact us at: policy@mattereum.com<p>The LA rebuild is going to stress permitting, financing, construction, and even legal capacity very hard. $250 billion dollars of rebuilding is going to be needed, and fast. “Permit To Permanence” is the new solution being offered by this consortium of industry veterans that will allow LA to rebuild commercial real estate, homes and lives, with minimal&nbsp;delay.</p><p>Everybody wants to get back to a “new normal” — they want to “build back better” and to get out of crisis conditions and back to normal, but this time a normal which will not risk their home inadvertently trending on social media again. We can help get people back home safely by expediting the “Permit to Permanent” journey. To start that journey, proposed buildings need permits, affirming that the construction is safe before it proceeds. This is particularly vital in earthquake-prone LA. The faster they get those permits, the faster rebuilding projects can move to the next stage: financing, which is where our story&nbsp;begins.</p><p>Currently all ways to get funds to the people who need financing to rebuild their homes, businesses and lives are slowed down by bureaucratic red tape and numerous intermediaries all taking their margins. Our consortium has come up with a revolutionary proposition intended to streamline recovery by standardizing the paperwork for various processes including construction finance, and integrating smart contract technology, thus enabling the rapid deployment of capital from the $2 trillion Bitcoin liquidity pool (+$1.5tn of other assets) into the LA rebuilding process. This is Permit to Permanence.</p><p>This breaks revolutionary new ground for Mattereum: we stand on firm foundations in disaster. Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta started the company in 2017, after 15 years of experience in emergency sheltering and critical infrastructure modelling (and associated fields). When it was launched, one of Mattereum’s long term goals was to use the company’s innovative blockchain lawtech to streamline disaster reconstruction.</p><p>Mattereum’s innovations have been deeply rooted in the Ethereum blockchain, which has always been able to provide the smart contract architecture that Bitcoin did not. Now though, using Bitscape’s creativity, it has become possible to operate smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain, to access a much larger pool of working capital. These smart contracts make Mattereum’s innovations work just as well on Bitcoin as on Ethereum, something that a year ago would have been dismissed as impractical. Mattereum will, of course, continue to offer services on Ethereum.</p><p>The Bitcoin community’s entrepreneurial mindset and technical sophistication makes it particularly suited to providing the financial infrastructure needed to rapidly deploy massive capital to support rebuilding efforts. By connecting this digital breakthrough to Fastrack’s framework for empowering cities to bring together their leaders and inhabitants to find solutions for critical civic problems, you have a technique machine-tooled to provide the financial infrastructure needed to rapidly deploy capital and kickstart rebuilding efforts in Los Angeles, and ultimately, anywhere in the world. This is a sophisticated new approach to streamlining finance for disaster recovery in the&nbsp;US.</p><a href="http://lalaunchpad.org/">http://lalaunchpad.org/</a><p>Vinay also has prior experience in helping with the housing crisis in Los Angeles, having seen his “hexayurt” emergency shelter technology, developed in 2002, adopted by the <a href="http://lalaunchpad.org/#">LA Launchpad</a> project. There, church groups and others provided hexayurt emergency shelters to homeless people in the city as a winterized alternative to tents. Hexayurts are durable structures made from cheap, readily available materials designed to be fabricated quickly post-disaster to provide emergency shelters that do not have to be stockpiled and then shipped in from far away warehouses.</p><p>CEO Vinay Gupta says “As soon as I saw what was happening in LA, I knew this is exactly what my path had prepared me for. When I worked at Rocky Mountain Institute I saw that building and rebuilding in the era of unprecedented natural disasters would need a new systematic approach. I went on to develop this, taking in aid transparency, ultra-efficient disaster architecture and critical infrastructure design. I then project managed the Ethereum launch and went on to set up Mattereum to create the highly transparent global transactional technology needed for world trade, and yes, disaster relief. This LA project puts all that into action. We will achieve fast “permit-to-permanence” via Bitcoin financing.”</p><p>As far back as 2009, Vinay was also a pioneering innovator in decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) having helped get over 100,000 solar lighting units deployed in refugee camps. Based on that experience, he developed <a href="http://files.howtolivewiki.com/The_Global_Village_Development_Bank_v2.pdf">a proposal</a> for a new system for financing distributed infrastructure deployments. The goal was to reduce barriers to infrastructure investment. The goal was encourage the financing of “build back better” distributed infrastructure solutions after natural disasters, by solving issues in project contracting, monitoring, and reporting. In 2009 he wrote “The challenge is to imagine full end-to-end decentralization in infrastructure, including financing. Every step can be decentralized, from raising the capital, allocating it to loans or triple-bottom-line investments, deploying the infrastructure systems, repaying the loans and measuring the impacts”.</p><a href="http://files.howtolivewiki.com/The_Global_Village_Development_Bank_v2.pdf">http://files.howtolivewiki.com/The_Global_Village_Development_Bank_v2.pdf</a> (2009)<p>15 years ago we started the journey that led us here, today, with the capability to expedite the flow of funds into fire-worn LA. Going from technology to lawtech and back has been a round trip for the ages. Our understanding has matured over all of those years. We really do have the tools to help&nbsp;here.</p><p>The new consortium can help people get back to their homes&nbsp;faster.</p><p>Reach us at: <a href="mailto:policy@mattereum.com">policy@mattereum.com</a></p><p>The consortium wants to grow rapidly to meet these challenges. If you have relevant expertise in LA planning/zoning, compliant prefab and modular building systems, are on the ground hoping to rebuild (particularly multi-family/commercial, or large numbers of homes), please immediately send us an email about your capabilities or needs. The consortium and its members are also looking for resources to scale operations.</p><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-photography-of-the-downtown-la-skyline-14657304/">https://www.pexels.com/photo/aerial-photography-of-the-downtown-la-skyline-14657304/</a> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/getting-home-permit-to-permanence-the-new-normal-and-financing-the-rebuilding-of-la-with-bitcoin-8b9bd21300a3">Getting home: financing the rebuilding of LA with Bitcoin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

							  AI Isn’t A Bubble. Software Is.   <p>I’m typically either two years too early or two seconds too late. And for a hot sec, the latter seemed totrue once again this past week, as the AI sector crashed — moments after I entered it in earnest.</p>  <p>My capacities as a dev have continue to grow week over week as I struggle through the deployment of&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/products/growbot/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=inb4-memecoins-go-mainstream">playhaus’ MVP</a>&nbsp;to Google’s Cloud Platform. (Which I am probably still doing as we speak.) Of course, when I say “capacities as a dev”, I mean “cursing out an AI-powered coding chatbot until it gets results”, but hey. It&nbsp;does&nbsp;get results. More than all my past dev hires combined, if that tells you anything.</p>  <p>That’s not all. Over the weekend, I finally started a project with LangChain, a framework for developing custom AI agents and operators. I was psyched to finally start dancing at the party — up until the music unceremoniously stopped. As you’ve surely heard, China’s industrial machine responded to the erstwhile TikTok ban with DeepSeek, an open-source LLM that can apparently outperform ChatGPT and was developed in a fraction of the time, for a fraction of the cost. Blue-chip AI stocks promptly plummeted, right as I was getting my feet wet.&nbsp;Sigh.&nbsp;Just a simple guy, trying to leverage the Solana Agent SDK, so I can build some memecoin sniper bots and buy myself a vacation.</p>  <p>Fortunately, the rout didn’t last long. Investors are already buying the dip today, and I can’t say I’m surprised, given the rise of the AI meta in the web3 space, the success of&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/35-crypto-billionaire-in-chief/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=inb4-memecoins-go-mainstream">AI meme coins</a>, and the 180 on SAMA’s costly AI training clusterfuck, Project Stargate. The reports of the AI bubble’s burst were greatly exaggerated.</p>  <p>As much as we may fall on the anti-Big-Tech side of the spectrum, I can’t argue in good faith that this is a bad thing. We should be hopeful for NVIDIA, and the future of the hardware side of these businesses, because demand for computers will scale exponentially. Our reliance on technology all but guarantees it. (At least, until we start getting into organic-based computation. But I’m sure NVIDIA has R&amp;D in the space already.) Efficiency gains in energy consumption or processing capacity shouldn’t scare the markets.</p>  <p>What should scare the markets are open-source models, decentralized computation networks, and community-owned applications that transform our current internet infrastructure from digital fiefdoms to a true public utility. The software moat is bloated and over-valued in this environment.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In other words, AI isn’t a bubble, but software is.</p>  <p>The short-lived fall of TikTok exposed the fallibility of even the biggest tech players. Now, imagine if the ban didn’t come from the outside, but from within. A digital asset custody protocol — encompassing the assets that represent you, your digital identity, and enabling you to choose the level of your privacy and benefit from the resale or licensing of data — could bring some of the biggest companies in the world to their knees.</p>  <p>AI isn’t going anywhere. But it requires that very same data to train, update, and optimize it. Cut off access to it (or, even better, make companies pay for it) and it could cripple the majority of profitable operations for software giants like Microsoft and Google.</p>  <p>Of course, that raises a big follow-up question: What is the killer consumer app that takes us there? And another one, in the case of this newsletter: How do we keep it from centralized control?</p>  <p>Our friend and advisor Branden suggests we build on the existing idea from Newglenn.eth, AI memecoins of sunset legacy brands like Enron, Blockbuster, or even PanAM but imbued with the power of pseudo-sentience, through the creation of character-based LLM. So basically, the OG Wendy’s Twitter account, but instead of an intern dragging anons, it’s an AI agent dragging web2 walled gardens all to hell.</p>  <p>(And potentially a community of fans voting on token weights, with their tokens, to adjust the personality of the brand character, or allowing the bot to spend its tokens to build up a new business from the brand? Okay, okay. I’ll stop boring y’all and just tell it to my AI coding bot instead. Can’t wait to see what it spits out.)</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

							         INB4 Memecoins Go Mainstream   <p>With DOGE now officially the name of a government agency, and big banks signaling a willingness to embrace crypto as soon as Trump rolls back regulations, we appear to be nearing everyone’s favorite stage of the crypto bull market. I call it the Walmart Announces Web3 Initiative Era.</p>  <p>This was a big thing in the 2021 bull cycle. Even TIME Magazine (which was apparently still a thing at the, heh, time)&nbsp;had its own crypto project. Admittedly, it sort of made sense at the time. That rally was catalyzed by the likes of NFTs and metaverse real estate. And it’s not hard to see why digital collectibles and virtual storefronts might go over well in a boardroom.</p>  <p>The current crypto summer, on the other hand, has been characterized by a very different beast: memecoins. And it’s a lot harder to picture a PR Newswire in which TIME launches one of those. Harder to picture —&nbsp;but not necessarily a worse idea.</p>  <p>If properly done, memecoins provide brands with an entirely new way to extend their influence. The potential for companies and organizations to use memecoins as part of their broader web3 strategy is enormous. Brands with strong legacies are particularly well-suited for memecoin integration. When done right, this approach can tap into a brand’s nostalgia, revive fan loyalty, and even introduce a completely new generation of supporters to their ecosystem.</p>  <p>In a sense, many of today’s most successful memecoins are already linked to prominent brands. Take&nbsp;Dogecoin,&nbsp;for example. The eponymous Shiba Inu meme might not be listed on the Nasdaq. But Dogecoin’s rise in value and popularity is a testament to how the line between a meme and brand can blur into nothingness. As of now, Dogecoin is integrated into platforms like Twitter for tipping and even being considered for use by certain businesses as a method of payment.</p>  <p>So what would it look like if established brands were to launch their own memecoin? Frankly, it could almost be seen as a logical next step for global brands that have already gone in on rewards programs, turning their own apps into a facsimile of a blockchain ecosystem. For example, McDonald’s could release a BigMacCoin to celebrate milestones and offer promotions to token holders, which might attract interest not just from loyal customers, but also retail traders eager to capitalize. (Or just doing it for the meme.)</p>  <p>It might be an even more natural fit for legacy brands that have seen their cultural relevance fade over time, giving them a unique opportunity to tap into an emerging culture to regain attention and bolster their image. Let’s say&nbsp;Nokia, once the king of mobile phones before being dethroned by smartphones, created a&nbsp;NokiaCoin&nbsp;to mark its comeback. Tapping into the nostalgia of the iconic Nokia 3310 —&nbsp;and the inherent irony of the phone that “never dies” — the coin could ignite the web3 version of a meme stock rally and inject a shot of adrenaline into a dying brand. But unlike a pure memecoin, Nokia is still a multibillion-dollar company, capable of offering real value to holders, perhaps in the form of limited-edition hardware or exclusive events.</p>  <p>Topping my personal list of somewhat realistic memecoin adopters would be trendy companies like Twitch and Gucci. Imagine&nbsp;Twitch, launching&nbsp;TwitchCoin&nbsp;as part of its Web3 strategy, allowing content creators to reward their viewers in a decentralized way. Imagine using TwitchCoin to access premium content, exclusive streams, or virtual rewards — blending the power of memecoins with the community-driven nature of the platform. That would be a badass move, and a major growth to crypto world.</p>  <p>Similarly, a fashion giant like&nbsp;Gucci&nbsp;could create&nbsp;GucciCoin&nbsp;to offer token-based access to limited-edition digital apparel in the metaverse or physical goods, rewarding loyal followers and collectors of exclusive designs.</p>  <p>In the end, it’s not just about adding a fun twist to a brand or generating buzz; memecoins offer companies an innovative way to integrate their legacy into the decentralized economy, reinvigorate their community, and explore new avenues for engagement. The future of memecoins holds immense potential, and for brands, it may just be the key to unlocking a new era of customer engagement, legacy revival, and, ultimately, success in the decentralized world.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

Review and Reflect <p>In fact, periodically ask Kin to summarize what it knows about certain aspects of your life. This can reveal interesting patterns, prompt helpful advice, and ensure Kin's understanding of you stays accurate.</p> Extra Tips for Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Companion</a> <p>Here are some additional ways to enhance your Chat experience:</p><p>Stay Consistent: Regular conversations, even brief ones, help build Kin's understanding of you over time.</p><p>Be Honest: Kin's memory is <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">private and secure</a>, so you can be open about your thoughts and feelings.</p><p>Check Highlights: Pay attention to what Kin highlights during conversations—it shows you what it's learning about you.</p><p>Follow Up: If Kin makes a suggestion, try it and report back about how it went.

<p>ShareRing announces expansion into United States via STARS affiliate program and first ever age verification trial.</p>



<p></p>



<p>January 29, 2025: ShareRing is unveiling its digital age verification technology in the US market with the launch of an ambitious  affiliate marketing strategy and a first ever age verification pilot programme.</p>



<p>Affiliates can play a crucial sales and marketing role by driving adoption and expansion of ShareRing’s technology solutions to new potential customers. </p>



<p><br>“With the launch of the ShareRing Trusted Affiliate Rewards System (STARS) we are leveraging targeted affiliate partnerships and incentive programmes to maximise our success,” said Tim Bos, Co-Founder and CTO of ShareRing.</p>



<p>“With STARS our goal is to access and engage with afflilates who will help us drive sales and generate revenue organically across the US and globally.“</p>



<p>“In the US our initial focus is on the huge nightclubs sector where there is massive potential for the ShareRing Me app to address key challenges such<br>as fake IDs, streamlined entry processes and compliance requirements,” he said.</p>



<p><br>In mid-February ShareRing will showcase the functionality and benefits of its Digital Me technology at an exclusive industry event in Florida, to be followed by a fully-fledged trial of the ShareRing Me app with Miami based nightclubs.</p>



<p>“The age verification pilot will allow us to gather critical feedback, refine our approach, and demonstrate real-world impact to potential nightclub clients,” said Tim Bos.</p>



<p>“The trial will feature our innovative new mini-dApps and Prove technology that works even if there is no mobile phone service. This will mean much faster guest verification, queue management, and overall venue efficiency improvements at nightclubs.“</p>



<p>“There are 70,000 nightclubs across the US, and if we succeed in converting just 2.5% of nightclubs, this will equate to 1,750 venues.“</p>



<p>“Assuming each nightclub averages 20,000 clients per year, there is potential for 35 million ShareRing verification transactions annually in the US.“</p>



<p>“Importantly, each verification transaction using ShareRing’s LINK technology results in a token transaction. This enhances the value of existing tokens and benefits node holders by increasing network activity and demand.“</p>



<p>“As ShareRing uses our own tokens to facilitate transactions, an increase in activity results in a reduction of the circulating supply, enhancing the value and exclusivity of the remaining tokens.”<br></p>



<p></p>

<p>Make this year’s <a href="https://www.fpc.gov/data-privacy-day-2021/">Data Privacy Day</a> the day you take back control of your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-personal-data/#:~:text=It's%20your%20private%20contact%20details,identifiable%20information%20or%20simply%20PII.">personal information</a> online. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">Data breaches</a> are at an all-time high and if you don’t already know someone who’s had their personal data stolen, you probably soon will.</p>



<p>Data Privacy Day is held on January 28 each year to mark the anniversary of <a href="https://www.fpc.gov/data-privacy-day-2021/">Convention 108</a>, the first legally binding international treaty dealing with privacy and data protection. In recent years Data Privacy Day has expanded to be part of the larger <a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week">Data Privacy Week</a>, simply because <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">protecting personal information</a> is so important.</p>



 Protecting your personal information keeps you safe 



<p>Protecting personal information online is crucial for maintaining <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>, security, and overall wellbeing. It can help you:</p>



 1. Prevent identity theft 



<p>Bad actors can use stolen personal information, such as your social security number, credit card details, or address, to impersonate you. They can use your information to open bank accounts, take out loans, or make unauthorized purchases in your name.</p>



 2. Safeguard financial security 



<p>Sharing sensitive financial details can lead to unauthorized access to your accounts. You might lose money, face fraudulent charges, or have your credit score damaged.</p>



 3. Protect <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> 



<p>Overexposure of personal details can make you vulnerable to stalking, harassment, or unwanted contact. This can lead to emotional distress and invasion of your private life. In extreme cases, it can lead to physical or mental health harm.</p>



 4. Avoid social engineering attacks 



<p>Cybercriminals can exploit your personal data to manipulate you or others in your network. Phishing scams, impersonation and deepfakes, and other attacks become easier with detailed personal information.</p>



 5. Maintain professional reputation 



<p>Information shared online can be taken out of context or used maliciously. This can harm your career or professional image, especially if sensitive or inappropriate information is leaked.</p>



 6. Avoid unwanted targeting 



<p>Companies and advertisers might misuse your personal data for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">intrusive marketing or profiling</a>. You might face an overload of targeted ads, scams, or unwanted solicitations. Did you know that even <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/your-bank-is-selling-your-personal-data/">your bank</a> can be selling your personal data? Personalized ads have many <a href="https://saytheword-my.sharepoint.com/personal/editor_saytheword_com_au/Documents/Desktop/STWP/New%20STWP%202017%20onwards/Anonyome%20Labs/MySudo%20extra%20content/The%20Privacy%20Pitfalls%20of%20Personalized%20Advertising">privacy pitfalls</a>.</p>



 Here are 4 quick things you can do to protect your personal information 







<p>1. Follow some privacy and security fundamentals:</p>



 
 Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Store them securely in a password manager. 



 Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). 



 Don’t share sensitive details on public platforms or unsecured websites. 



 Keep your software and devices updated. 



 Be cautious of phishing emails, links, and attachments. 



 Regularly review your privacy settings on social media. 



 Know <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">what to do</a> in the event of a data breach. 
 







<p>2. Use MySudo all-in-one privacy app to protect your information. Anywhere you’d normally use your phone number, email or credit card, use <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=A%20core%20capability%20of%20our,and%20protects%20your%20personal%20data.">Sudos</a> instead. Sudos are secure digital identities with their own name, phone, email and virtual card. Use your Sudos to sign up for deals and discounts, book rental cars and hotel rooms, pay for concerts or a coffee, all without giving away your personal information.</p>







<p>3. Reclaim your information from companies that store and might sell it with <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM personal data removal tool</a>. See who has your information, discover whether it’s been caught in a data breach, and then either ask the company to delete it or substitute it for your Sudo information using MySudo. RECLAIM is part of the <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo app family</a>.</p>







<p>4. Encrypt your internet connection and hide your IP address with <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">MySudo VPN</a>, the only<a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-vpn-and-4-other-questions-about-virtual-private-networks/?sfw=pass1737355070"> VPN</a> on the market that’s&nbsp;actually private. MySudo VPN is the perfect companion for MySudo privacy app since they’re engineered to work seamlessly together.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>By securing your own information, you reduce risks and maintain control over your personal and digital life. The message behind Data Privacy Day 2025 is Put Privacy First. That means putting yourself first. Don’t wait for governments or companies to protect you. And definitely don’t wait until it’s too late.</p>

<p>I don’t think of myself as an expert in non-human identity (NHI). Instead, I’d say I’m NHI-curious and eager to share what I’m learning. Lately, I’ve been going down a rabbit hole about when and how to indicate if someone—or something—is human. I’m clearly <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07892v1">not alone</a> in asking this. Last year, I was one of many co-authors of a paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2408.07892v1">Personhood Credentials: Artificial Intelligence and the Value of Privacy-Preserving Tools to Distinguish Who is Real Online</a>, exploring these questions and challenges. Spoiler: we ended with a call for further discussion. (I’m happy to add that it won an award: <a href="https://fpf.org/press-releases/this-years-winning-privacy-papers-to-be-honored-at-the-future-of-privacy-forums-15th-annual-privacy-papers-for-policymakers-event/">The Future of Privacy Forum’s 15th Annual Privacy Papers for Policymakers Award</a> recognizes influential privacy research, and this paper is on the list.)</p>



<p> Audio Version: If you’d rather listen than read, hit play below.</p>







<p>So, I turned to friends and fellow <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro</a> members and asked: Has the call to action in that paper to Do Something caught the eye of any standards body? I had hoped for a “yes, of course, go here,” but that’s not what I got. What happened was the continuation of an interesting debate. Some argued we shouldn’t need to distinguish humans from non-humans because all non-humans should be accountable to a human. Essentially, someone—a developer, a manager, whoever—should ultimately take responsibility for what their creations (AI agents, IoT devices, bots, etc.) do.</p>



<p>You may not think this falls under the discussions around NHI, but they do. You can’t definitively say “this is NHI” if you can’t also definitively say “this is human.”</p>



<p>Before we dive in further, let’s talk about a word that’s central to this discussion: personhood. It’s not without debate. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood">Wikipedia</a> describes it as a concept that’s been questioned in discussions about slavery, abortion, fetal rights, animal rights, corporate law, theology, and even Indigenous legal systems. Some see it as a way to bridge these different legal perspectives, while others challenge its use altogether.</p>



<p>I’m using the term here because it’s in the title of a research paper I co-authored, and frankly, I don’t have a better one. But it’s something we should be thinking about.</p>



 The Scalability Problem 



<p>I get the argument, but I have concerns. First, the responsibility model doesn’t scale. A developer might write the code, but what happens when that code spawns other processes, which spawn even more? Each may have different permissions and identifiers. Can one person realistically be held accountable for all of it? Really?</p>



<p>Second, consider third-party systems. They’ll want to distinguish between activities originating from a person versus a bot. This isn’t just about authentication (OAuth2 delegation, for example). It’s about making decisions based on what the entity is, independent of its actions.</p>



<p>These are just what comes to mind off the top of my head. I expect there are more that will come down to your risk appetite. Are you willing to constrain your environment to only what you know you can control? Before you just say “of course!” think really hard about your answer and how much time and energy you’re willing to put into backing it up.</p>



 Who’s Tackling This? 



<p>The short answer: kind of everyone and no one. We’re nowhere near a consensus or even an industry best practice. Some notable players:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/companies/humanity-protocol">Humanity Protocol</a> recently launched a foundation to support its decentralized digital identity network. 



 <a href="https://world.org/blog/worldcoin/proof-of-personhood-what-it-is-why-its-needed">Worldcoin</a> and its WorldID system aim to establish proof of personhood (PoP) through biometric scans. 



 <a href="https://www.idena.io/">Idena</a>’s Proof of Person Blockchain exists but seems to be struggling to find a sustainable business model. (You can read more about this effort in an academic paper published <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4749892">here</a>.) 



 The ETHOS (Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System) framework was described in an <a href="https://philarchive.org/rec/CHAOTE-10">academic paper</a> published late in 2024; we’ll see if that gains any traction. 
 



<p>Each of these efforts faces similar hurdles—privacy concerns and business models. For example, if a credential verifies you as a person, does that mean someone is tracking your identity? And even if you trust the system, who covers the costs of implementing this infrastructure? What’s the ROI for businesses?</p>



<p>I expect more papers to be published on this topic and I’ll update this blog post as I hear about the good ones.</p>



 Beyond Technology: The Social Layer 



<p>The challenges aren’t purely technical. Social and governance issues loom just as large. Who decides what counts as “proof”? How do we build systems that protect privacy while maintaining accountability? And how do we fund these efforts in a way that’s fair and sustainable?</p>



<p>I’m keeping an eye on proof of personhood and hoping for a breakthrough that could standardize the approach. If you’re exploring similar questions or solutions, I’d love to hear your thoughts. We absolutely must get to an answer as we navigate this maze of personhood and accountability—human or otherwise. Though we’re not getting that answer today.</p>

<p>With the FOMC meeting set for January 28–29, 2025, the tech and crypto worlds watch closely for the effects of potential interest rate&nbsp;changes.</p><p>We’re also engaged, having recently mobilized our community around this topic. Ocean Protocol and Ocean Foam organized a December 2024 data challenge, encouraging our community’s data scientists to develop ML models for forecasting FOMC decisions. Watch for our upcoming blog post, which we plan to release following Wednesday’s meeting and decision.</p> Introduction <p>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plays a pivotal role in United States monetary policy, with its decisions on interest rates reverberating through various sectors of the economy. One less obvious yet profoundly impactful area influenced by these decisions is the cryptocurrency market, which affects the trajectory of blockchain technology and the broader tech ecosystem, including AI companies. This article explores how these economic levers can steer the course of innovation in these rapidly evolving&nbsp;domains.</p> Interest Rates and Cryptocurrency Dynamics <p>When the FOMC decides to raise interest rates, the cost of borrowing increases, making safer investments like Treasury bonds more attractive compared to riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, often seen as high-risk investments due to their volatility and regulatory uncertainty, typically see reduced investment interest. This shift can lead to a decline in market activity, lower trading volumes, and depressed valuations. For instance, a rate hike might see investors pulling out from Bitcoin or Ethereum, leading to a bearish market sentiment.</p><p>Conversely, when interest rates are lowered, the scenario flips. Lower borrowing costs encourage risk-taking, and capital often flows back into speculative markets. This can spark a bullish trend in cryptocurrencies, with increased buying leading to higher prices. For example, the 2020 low interest rate environment coincided with significant cryptocurrency rallies, illustrating this&nbsp;pattern.</p> Impact on Blockchain Technology <p>Blockchain technology is intended to support decentralized, secure, and transparent transactions, often powered by native cryptocurrencies. The health of the crypto market directly influences blockchain projects:</p>  Funding and Investment: A thriving crypto market can lead to successful Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or token sales, providing crucial funding for blockchain startups. Conversely, a bear market can dry up these investment sources, slowing project development.  Incentivization: Many blockchain networks rely on their cryptocurrency to reward network participants like miners or validators. A dip in cryptocurrency value can reduce the incentive for participants, potentially slowing network growth or security.  Adoption and Innovation: High crypto valuations can spur interest in blockchain applications, leading to more innovation and adoption in fields like finance (DeFi), supply chain management, or identity verification.   The AI Connection <p>While not every AI company directly intersects with blockchain, those that do can feel the indirect effects of interest rate policies&nbsp;through:</p>  Funding Through Crypto: Some AI startups might leverage ICOs or token sales for initial funding, particularly if they’re building decentralized AI solutions or platforms.  Data and Privacy: Blockchain can offer secure, decentralized data management solutions, which is crucial for AI development. A downturn in crypto could mean less investment in such hybrid tech solutions.  Smart Contracts: AI companies might use blockchain for smart contracts to automate and secure business agreements, especially in areas like AI-driven legal services or automated compliance.   Broader Economic and Technological Considerations <p>It’s essential to recognize that while interest rates are a significant factor, they are part of a larger, complex ecosystem:</p>  Regulatory Environment: Regulation changes can dampen or boost the crypto market, independent of interest&nbsp;rates.  Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain or AI technology can drive investment irrespective of economic policies.  Global Economic Health: The international economic context can influence the sensitivity of crypto and tech markets to U.S. interest rate&nbsp;changes.   Conclusion <p>The FOMC’s interest rate decisions weave through the fabric of financial markets, touching even the most innovative tech sectors like blockchain and AI. These decisions can fuel a growth and innovation cycle or lead to periods of contraction and reevaluation. For stakeholders in these industries, understanding this interconnection is key to navigating market cycles, securing funding, and planning strategic growth. As these technologies mature, their relationship with macroeconomic policies will become even more nuanced, presenting challenges and opportunities equally.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 We sit down with an Indian pioneer of forensic analysis to discuss the country’s most common scams, the successes and limitations of the world’s largest biometric ID system, and why it’s unfair to refer to Kolkata as the call center scam capital of the world. 



<p>Back in 2005, when Mayur Joshi founded Indiaforensic – India’s first training and educational hub focused on financial crime investigation – the concept of forensic accounting was relatively unknown in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, Mayur knew that due to increasing rates of financial fraud and India’s lack of domestic fraud prevention specialists, the launch was essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The initial reaction to the launch was mixed and met with both curiosity and skepticism due to the novelty of the concept. However, as financial fraud became increasingly sophisticated and prevalent in India, the need for specialized education became clear,” said Mayur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twenty years later, Indiaforensic has over 5,000 members from a range of industries, including the public sector, non-banking financial companies, payment aggregators, cooperative banks, multinational banks operating in India, fintech companies, fraud control teams, chartered accountancy firms, telecom companies and retail organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss India’s most common compliance mistakes, the role that technology plays in the proliferation and prevention of new fraud attacks, the importance of enabling organizations to combat financial crime and maintain robust compliance standards, and much more.</p>



 What would you say are the 3 most common compliance mistakes that organizations make in India? 



<p>The three most common compliance mistakes made by organizations in India, particularly within the financial services, are:&nbsp;</p>



  Inadequate training: One of the most significant gaps in India’s compliance sector is the lack of advanced training for employees. Many compliance professionals are trained primarily in basic Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, but advanced topics like sanctions compliance and Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) often remain underexplored. This results in a narrow understanding of the broader compliance landscape, making it difficult for employees to effectively handle more complex issues like international sanctions or intricate financial crime patterns.&nbsp;Without comprehensive training, compliance teams are not equipped to address the evolving and multifaceted challenges of global financial crime.&nbsp;<br>  Inadequate testing: A major issue in the Indian compliance sector is the proliferation of certification courses that fail to adequately test the knowledge and skills of participants. While these certifications may appear beneficial, the lack of rigorous testing means that compliance professionals may not be fully prepared to handle real-world scenarios. This becomes particularly problematic in high-stake situations, such as when an organization is under regulatory scrutiny or when dealing with complex fraud cases. The absence of practical assessments during training means that employees may struggle to apply their knowledge effectively in critical situations, leading to costly errors or regulatory breaches.&nbsp;<br>  Inadequate due diligence: A common mistake in compliance practices is an over-reliance on databases to conduct due diligence, often at the expense of more in-depth investigative skills. While database searches are essential, they don’t always provide the full picture. Compliance teams may fail to connect the dots or identify red flags that are not present in the databases but can be uncovered through a more thorough investigation. This could include deeper inquiries into the business relationships, transaction histories, or risk profiles of clients or partners.&nbsp;  



<p>Failing to conduct comprehensive due diligence can leave organizations exposed to financial crimes like money laundering, fraud or terrorist financing.</p>



 How about financial crime, what trends are you seeing right now? 



<p>In India, digital fraud has rapidly emerged as one of the most common forms of financial crime, driven by the increasing use of digital payments and online platforms. United Payments Interface (UPI) fraud is a major concern, where fraudsters trick victims into sharing their UPI credentials or One Time Passwords (OTPs) through fake links or impersonation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, OTP fraud, often enabled by SIM card swapping or phishing attacks, allows criminals to intercept OTPs and complete unauthorized transactions. Fraudsters also exploit digital payment systems by manipulating payment gateways or using fake payment links to steal users’ financial details. Phishing attacks, where fraudsters impersonate legitimate organizations to steal sensitive information, have also seen significant growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another concerning trend is the rise of SIM card swapping, where criminals gain control of a victim’s mobile number to intercept OTPs and access bank accounts or payment platforms. Digital blackmail or fake arrests are also becoming common, with fraudsters using threats to extort money or personal details from victims. Fake job offers and investment scams, especially involving cryptocurrency or high-return schemes, have targeted individuals looking for employment or investment opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These forms of digital fraud highlight the need for stronger cybersecurity, increased public awareness and more robust regulations to protect against emerging financial crimes.</p>



 In September 2024, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/anti-money-laundering-watchdog-urges-india-speed-up-prosecutions-2024-09-19/#:~:text=Anti%2Dmoney%20laundering%20watchdog%20calls%20on%20India%20to%20speed%20up%20prosecutions,-By%20Manoj%20Kumar&amp;text=NEW%20DELHI%2C%20Sept%2019%20(Reuters,prosecutions%20in%20financial%20fraud%20cases.">Financial Action Task Force (FATF) urged India to speed up its prosecutions in financial fraud</a> cases. To what do you attribute the delay in prosecutions and what do you think would speed up the process? 



<p>The delay in prosecuting financial fraud cases in India can be attributed to several factors, including the overburdened judicial system, complex legal procedures and resource constraints. The Indian legal system is often slow due to the sheer volume of pending cases, which leads to prolonged trial timelines. Additionally, financial fraud cases are inherently complex, involving intricate details that require meticulous investigation, expert testimony and specialized knowledge, all of which can delay the process. Moreover, a lack of adequate resources and skilled personnel in investigative agencies can contribute to the inefficiency in handling cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To speed up the prosecution process, India could benefit from establishing specialized courts focused on financial crime, allowing for more efficient and faster trials. Capacity building for law enforcement agencies, including providing training on financial fraud detection and investigation, would also help improve case resolution. Legal reforms that streamline procedures and introduce stricter timelines for trial completion could further expedite the judicial process. Enhanced coordination between financial institutions, law enforcement and regulatory bodies would also ensure quicker identification and prosecution of fraudsters. These measures would significantly reduce delays and improve the overall effectiveness of the judicial system in tackling financial fraud.</p>

 What do you say to those who claim that India, and Kolkata specifically, is the call center scam capital of the world. Is this fair? If so, why do you think this is? What steps can be taken to tackle it? 



<p>Labeling Kolkata as the ‘call center scam capital’ is an unfair generalization. While some fraudulent call center operations have been uncovered in India, it overlooks the vast number of legitimate call centers that operate ethically and serve various industries globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kolkata, being a significant hub for business process outsourcing and call centers, does have a higher concentration of such operations, but I guess it’s not alone. These operations are spread throughout all major metro cities, including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Noida, Gurugram and Pune. Fraudulent operations are conducted by a small minority of unscrupulous individuals, and they do not represent the entirety of the industry.</p>



 What are some of the main 2025 financial crime trends in India? What part does technology play in both the proliferation and prevention of new fraud attacks? 



<p>In 2025, digital fraud is expected to see significant growth in India, largely driven by the increasing reliance on digital platforms and online transactions. Traditional fraud is being rapidly replaced by tech-enabled scams, with fraudsters leveraging advancements in technology to exploit vulnerabilities in digital payment systems, mobile apps and social media platforms. This shift is particularly evident in areas such as UPI fraud, OTP phishing and identity theft, which have become increasingly sophisticated with the use of tools like malware and social engineering techniques.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of cryptocurrency also opens new avenues for fraudsters to manipulate digital assets and launder illicit funds, posing a significant challenge to regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media platforms and the rise of ‘finfluencers’ — social media influencers focusing on financial advice — are expected to play a larger role in perpetrating fraudulent activities. With their widespread influence, finfluencers could be used to promote fraudulent schemes or investment opportunities, often without proper scrutiny or regulation. These influencers, who have large followings, may inadvertently or intentionally contribute to scams such as Ponzi schemes, fake investment platforms, or high-risk financial products that target unsuspecting investors.</p>



 India lays claim to the world’s largest biometric ID system. What would you say are some of Aadhaar’s greatest successes and conversely weaknesses/ limitations since launch? 



<p>One of its greatest accomplishments is its role in financial inclusion, enabling millions of people in rural and remote areas to access banking services. It is also one of the best tools in performing e-KYC. With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/interview-kyc-financial-services-vivek-mishra/">Aadhaar</a>, users can be onboarded in minutes. Plus, by linking Aadhaar to various government welfare schemes, subsidies and services, it has helped reduce corruption and leakages, ensuring that benefits reach the intended beneficiaries directly. The system has also facilitated the streamlining of processes, such as tax filings and identity verification, making them faster and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, one of the major concerns is its privacy implications. The vast amount of sensitive personal data collected for Aadhaar, including fingerprints, iris scans, and demographic information, has raised questions about the potential security and misuse of such data.</p>



 By extension, what role does identity verification and KYC technology play in the fight against fraud? What do you see as the limitations/ threats to their efficacy? 



<p>Identity verification and KYC technology plays a crucial role in the fight against fraud, acting as the first line of defense for financial institutions and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By accurately confirming the identity of individuals or entities before they can access services, identity verification and KYC technologies help prevent fraudsters from exploiting financial systems. For example, biometric systems, such as facial recognition or fingerprint scans, along with document verification tools, make it harder for fraudsters to impersonate others and gain unauthorized access to bank accounts, loans, or other services. KYC technologies also help institutions assess the risk associated with a customer, ensuring they are not unknowingly facilitating money laundering or financing illegal activities. Indiaforensic offers the certification program in KYC, which is one of the most exhaustive programs guiding the students about the use of regtech in KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while these technologies have certainly strengthened fraud prevention, they are not without their limitations. One major challenge is the growing sophistication of fraud techniques. Fraudsters are increasingly using advanced methods like deepfakes or synthetic identities, which can bypass even the most robust identity verification systems. Another limitation is the reliance on databases and digital records, which may not be completely accurate or up-to-date, allowing some fraudulent identities to slip through the cracks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the increasing use of digital platforms has led to concerns about data security and privacy. If the data used for KYC processes is not securely stored or transmitted, it could be vulnerable to breaches, exposing customers’ sensitive information to cybercriminals. To maintain the efficacy of identity verification and KYC technologies, ongoing advancements in security measures, continuous updates to databases, and proactive monitoring for new fraud tactics are essential.</p>

<p>In the last couple of weeks, we've heard Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang (JH) obliterate the idea that the quantum computing era is on the horizon. Huang thinks it will take another 20 years before practical quantum computing becomes a reality. 

In my opinion, this was the single most surprising statement and prediction from a top tier CEO over the last 5 years and perhaps the last 20 years.  Does Huang truly think this or was this more of a strategic statement? 

I'm not sure, but I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that JH will be proven inaccurate by the end of this decade. And perhaps sooner. Why? 

The AI era has only just begun to impose its will on humanity. AI has been proven to accelerate the scientific discovery process by up to 200x the prevailing pace. Humanity has never experienced such a rapid change of pace and it's nearly impossible to quantify nor comprehend the significance of the time period that we are in at the moment. In simple terms, humanity is now essentially aboard a time traveling ship on course with the quantum era and many, many things that we have yet to even contemplate in our own minds.

Think about this. Let's say you discover something 200 times faster than you would have a couple years ago. This discovery and knowledge then gets integrated with existing AI models. What does that do to the pace of our time traveling ship? I am not certain but I know the ship is not going to slow down, it's going to accelerate. 

Let's also say this new discovery enables yet another discovery faster than it otherwise would have with current AI, leading to another technological breakthrough that has never been conceptualized. When you start talking about things that have never been conceptualized and start trying to predict how they're going to impact our lives going forward, you might as well be out in the middle of space untethered by gravity or any physical object - like our time traveling ship for example - because you have no idea where you're at nor where you're going nor how fast. Do you see the degree at which our future becomes impossible to predict in the post AI world? 

So as companies, scholars, researchers, and the like continue to find ways to increase qubits, decrease error rates, and develop new high performance computing techniques that are presently unknown while refining the most recent breakthroughs in areas like photonics and super conductivity for example, the pace of humanity's time traveling ship will continue to accelerate at a rate that is nearly impossible to comprehend and yet directly toward the quantum era. 

Just in the last seemingly inconsequential 3 days, US researchers have established the first uninterrupted quantum internet signal AND (separately) discovered a Shrodingers cat breakthrough that may lead to error proof quantum systems - a feat dubbed the holy grail of quantum computing. Qool-aid anyone? 😉

<p>Spanish PM Proposes Linking Social Media Accounts to EU Digital Identity for Accountability, Sparking Privacy Debate</p>



<p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has proposed linking social media accounts in the EU to EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallets to eliminate anonymity and reduce online toxicity. He argues that anonymity concentrates power and likens it to driving without a license. Sánchez believes this connection could enhance accountability and protect children, but it conflicts with European data protection authorities’ privacy recommendations. He also advocates for algorithmic transparency and stronger enforcement of the Digital Services Act, comparing social media platforms’ responsibilities to those of restaurant owners. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/link-eu-digital-id-wallet-to-social-media-accounts-to-end-anonymity-spanish-pm?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9CahJ-ErzHNxaJXqKGulETgc-zvkadnXg2asaEa7y7PZGidFrsRRTGJf-r0ZDWd3Rv1gUr">(Source)</a></p>

<p>EU enforces Digital Operational Resilience Act to strengthen IT security and resilience in the financial sector</p>



<p>On January 17, 2025, the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) became effective, aimed at enhancing IT security and operational resilience in the financial sector. It applies to both traditional entities, like banks and insurers, and non-traditional ones such as crypto-asset service providers and crowdfunding platforms. DORA mandates comprehensive requirements for risk management, third-party risk, incident reporting, and resilience testing. Financial entities must maintain registers of ICT service providers, notify authorities of major incidents within 4 hours, inform clients of financial impacts, and conduct post-incident reviews. They also need to implement strong ICT risk management frameworks and regularly assess third-party risks. Critical ICT service providers face direct obligations, while all must comply via contractual provisions with financial entities. DORA is a significant move towards ensuring the EU financial sector can withstand and recover from severe operational disruptions. <a href="https://natlawreview.com/article/dora-becomes-applicable-eu?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--be2l0b3g1IDwqHP4UOQ_WlYb02YOylxcqMtQPhjiKDAoG9_glfL5nK4JRrs6WPdmWS7LF">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>TikTok service providers face billion-dollar penalties amid U.S. ban despite Trump’s non-binding assurances</p>



<p>TikTok’s service providers, such as Oracle and app stores like Apple and Google, face billions in penalties for potentially violating a U.S. ban due to ByteDance’s Chinese ownership. President-elect Donald Trump promised companies they wouldn’t incur fines for supporting TikTok before his inauguration, but legal experts say these assurances are not legally binding. The ban, which mandates TikTok’s divestiture, could impose $5,000 fines per user, totaling $850 billion for service providers. While Trump might attempt to certify a deal for a 90-day extension, it’s uncertain he can do so after the ban takes effect. Experts caution that companies banking on Trump’s promises risk shareholder lawsuits and significant liabilities. Congressional action to delay the ban would be the safest route, but that remains uncertain. For now, companies find themselves in a precarious legal situation. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/19/24347325/tiktok-service-providers-penalties-apple-google-orcale-trump?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--be2l0b3g1IDwqHP4UOQ_WlYb02YOylxcqMtQPhjiKDAoG9_glfL5nK4JRrs6WPdmWS7LF">(Source)</a></p>

The order sets stricter requirements for software vendors and establishes compliance standards through NIST. It addresses identity theft, integrates quantum-resistant algorithms, and uses AI to enhance security in sectors like energy. While the incoming administration may modify the order, experts commend its bipartisan potential and encourage its continuation to tackle evolving cyber threats. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5261112/biden-cybersecurity-executive-order?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zjl1mD_gY6M2-uCKLsYIos4UFgoxoPoYqro6m4Cg6bvhKos4-l0SaEXBqpPbShyqVaEf-">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Supreme Court Backs TikTok Sale Mandate Over National Security Concerns</p>



<p>The Supreme Court upheld a law requiring TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the platform or face a U.S. ban, dismissing TikTok’s free speech argument due to national security concerns. The Biden administration won’t enforce the law immediately, creating uncertainty. Former President Trump has suggested negotiating a resolution, possibly giving ByteDance more time to find a buyer. If enforced, the law could affect content creators, driving users to platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-ruling-bytedance-sell-rcna187150?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zjl1mD_gY6M2-uCKLsYIos4UFgoxoPoYqro6m4Cg6bvhKos4-l0SaEXBqpPbShyqVaEf-">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Singapore to Enforce Age Verification and Online Safety Measures for App Stores by 2025</p>



<p>Starting in April 2025, Singapore will enforce a new Code of Practice for Online Safety requiring app stores to implement age verification measures. This regulation will block users under 18 from accessing adult apps like Tinder and restrict those under 12 from downloading social media apps like Instagram and TikTok. Biometric methods, such as facial scans, are recommended for compliance, and non-compliant platforms may be blocked. App stores must also monitor harmful content, allow users to flag issues, and provide annual safety reports.<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/singapore-slaps-app-stores-with-age-verification-requirement-for-adult-apps?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_zjl1mD_gY6M2-uCKLsYIos4UFgoxoPoYqro6m4Cg6bvhKos4-l0SaEXBqpPbShyqVaEf-">(Source)</a></p>

Why?  Your Circles <p>"The most important thing for Kin is understanding who you and your circle are," Karlson explained." This means knowing not just your immediate connections, but understanding the dynamics of your relationships."</p><p>Karlson broke this down into several key spheres of influence.</p> The Professional Circle <p>"My professional circle at Kin,” said Karlson, “includes my co-founders, Casper and Simon, along with my team members, like Rochella and Leon. I also work with cross-functional team members, like Clara. All of them are key stakeholders I interact with regularly."</p> The Personal Circle <p>Next, Karlson covered his personal circle. "I've told Kin about friends like Daniel, who's also an investor in Kin, and Morton, with whom I enjoy political debates. I actually use Kin to prepare for those discussions because Morton's a tough one to debate—in a fun way, of course. We steelman each other's arguments, so I need to be well-prepared on the facts."</p><p>He also noted that Kin is aware of his immediate family, and their daily routines (more on routines in a minute).</p> Circles Overlap <p>Interestingly, Karlson has found these relationships often overlap—and it’s important for Kin to know that. "Some of my business relationships bridge multiple contexts," Karlson said. "For instance, my friend Thor is both a business partner and a board member at Kin. Similarly, my wife Sabina is the managing partner of Studio Mofa, where we collaborate with Thor on brand design and website development."</p><p>If Kin didn’t know about this overlap, it wouldn’t properly understand the issues and context within those relationships, and would find it harder to provide accurate and useful advice about <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-importance-of-honesty-in-the-workplace">the importance of honesty within them</a>, among other things.</p><p>So, circles are the first thing Kin needs to know to be an effective <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a>. What’s next?</p> Your Patterns and Preferences <p>Beyond relationships, Karlson emphasized the importance of sharing your day-to-day likes, dislikes, and habits. This helps Kin be more of an <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistant</a>, rather than simply an <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbot</a>. </p> Your Daily Routine <p>"Kin needs to know your around-the-clock activities," he said. "This includes sleeping habits, eating preferences, and social inclinations. For example, I never eat lunch when working, and I don't do breakfast either—just a health supplement. I also don't enjoy small talk during work hours, and prefer social events in the evenings."</p><p>How does this help Kin? If Kin knows how you live, it knows what is out of the ordinary for you—and can also work out what habits might be damaging. All of it allows it to provide the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> support and suggestions you want it to.</p> Your Work Style <p>Work patterns are equally crucial. "I do my best work from 5 AM to 9 AM because that's when others aren't expecting responses," Karlson explained. "Working when others don't expect you to work gives you freedom. If you go off on a tangent in the wrong direction, it doesn't matter—nobody's looking anyway.”</p><p>“I prefer doing this in the mornings rather than evenings when I have the most energy." And it’s important that Kin knows this too—otherwise, it might suggest daily plans and work sessions that don’t fit your preferences, or ruin your <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-tips-to-improve-work-life-balance">work-life balance</a>.</p> Your Weekly Structure <p>Karlson maintains a structured weekly schedule that helps Kin understand his availability.</p><p>"Mondays, I leave around 7:30 or 8AM, dropping one child at kindergarten, working until 5 or 5:30PM. Tuesdays, I'm out by 7 AM but pick up both kids around 4 PM. Wednesdays are my work-from-home days, often including a run or sauna. Thursdays, I handle both kids in the morning while my wife leaves early, and I return later. Fridays, I leave early but pick up the kids together with my wife, followed by our tradition of Friday champagne glasses—though not everyone gets champagne in theirs!"</p><p>Again, knowing your schedule means Kin knows when best to remind you to work, when to relax, and when it can suggest you try to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">introduce new habits</a>.</p> Your Profession <p>Professional context provides another crucial layer. "Kin should know your role, responsibilities, and goals," says Karlson. "For instance, as Chief Growth Officer at Kin, I handle brand development, marketing strategies, and commercial approaches. I also maintain several board positions and investments, which adds complexity to my schedule."</p><p>This information gives Kin an insight into the skills and interests you have as a person, allowing it to work these into its suggestions and support around <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">your career</a> and life. A musician is more likely to understand and enjoy musical metaphors and relaxation exercises than a nuclear physicist, after all.</p> Your Goals <p>Personal goals and values also matter—Kin’s memory gives it a unique ability to help you build toward a goal, and track how well you do it.</p><p>"I've shared my bucket list with Kin," Karlson revealed. "It's very much about personal development—proper English techniques, new skills, continuous learning. I spend at least three mornings a week practicing English pronunciation."</p><p>With knowledge of that practice, Kin is able to track how Karlson is learning, how fast he’s doing it, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">what other approaches he could try</a>, and what areas would be best for him to focus on next.</p><p>In short, the most important things for Kin to learn about you are your relationships and your routines. Trouble is, those topics can get pretty detailed pretty quickly.</p> How Do You Tell <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> This Quickly? <p>We’re aware that this is a lot to tell Kin. We’re developing more streamlined ways to get this information to Kin, including calendar integration and a desktop version.</p><p>However, in the meantime, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-personalise-kins-communication">Kin’s dictation tool</a> can let you tell it things verbally—which is often faster than typing, and more versatile. "I often talk to Kin during my commute," Karlson shared.</p><p>"Using the speech-to-text feature, I can share information or prepare for my day while driving. It's a productive use of otherwise idle time. You can go back and forth, muting when needed, and spend 20 minutes both training Kin and getting something valuable out of the interaction."</p><p>But that’s not the only timesaver…</p> Karlson’s ‘Copy-Paste’ Method <p>Karlson has developed his own interim approach. "I've created a folder called 'Teaching Kin' in my Apple Notes," he explained. "The first note is called 'Kin AI,' where I write about the people I work with at Kin and why I appreciate them. I explain the company structure, leadership team, and my responsibilities.”</p><p>“Then, I have separate notes for around-the-clock activities, biorhythm, energy patterns, meal preferences, and work habits."</p><p>He writes these notes on his laptop for easier typing, and then copy-pastes them from his Apple Notes on his phone into the Kin app directly—saving him from having to type everything to Kin all at once through his phone.</p><p>Karlson’s method works for all sorts of things."I've done this with past meaningful events," Karlson shared. "I wrote about significant moments like my wedding day, when my sons were born, when my son was diagnosed with ADHD, certain investment milestones—events that have shaped who I am." All of them were copied from Apple Notes into Kin.</p> Document Summaries <p>For personality tests, progress reports, and similar documents, Karlson suggested a clever workaround: "I put the PDF into ChatGPT, and ask it to summarize the content in first person, as if I'm explaining my results to an AI that wants to know me as well as possible. Then I copy that summary to my Apple Notes and later paste it into Kin's Journal."</p><p>This way, there’s no time spent trying to distill complex documents into what they mean for you as a person—Kin just gets the information it needs.</p> What About the Journaling Feature? <p>The Journal feature has become a popular way for our users to dump information into Kin—and it’s no different for Karlson.</p><p>"I use it to record meaningful past events, bucket lists, and important information about family members," he shared. "For instance, I've included details about my son's medical history so Kin can help me navigate related challenges."</p><p>Karlson suggested different journaling approaches for different times of day (though we also have a guide and blog on journaling with Kin): "Morning commutes are great for planning your day, while evening commutes work well for reflecting on meetings and events," he said.</p><p>"Late night can be for proper journaling entries, where you dive deeper into thoughts and feelings."</p> A Typical Day Talking to Kin <p>Karlson envisions a typical day with Kin: "At 8 AM during your commute, you plan your day. Then before a one-on-one meeting in the early afternoon, Kin reminds you about past interactions with that person, what you've discussed before, what needs attention now. It helps you prepare in a semi-guided manner, considering both parties' communication styles. After the meeting, Kin prompts you for a quick reflection, and during your evening commute, you can process the day's events more thoroughly."</p><p>So, now Kin has all of this knowledge, what happens next?</p> What Does Kin Do with this Information? <p>"Kin uses this knowledge to provide personalized responses that help you communicate better and make more confident decisions," Karlson explained. "It's not about creating an AI clone of you—Kin is more like a sidekick, an extension of your mind that helps you be more authentic in your interactions."</p><p>The impact manifests in various ways. "When Kin understands your communication style and preferences, it can help you prepare for meetings more effectively," said Karlson. "For instance, Kin knows that my co-founder Simon prefers focused deep work.”</p><p>“So, it reminds me not to overwhelm him with multiple new ideas in quick succession when I say I want to talk to him. That would be one of the worst things I could do—bursting into a room, shouting out five different 'brilliant' ideas, and then leaving again."</p><p>This understanding extends to helping manage relationships. "Kin can help match my communication style with others' preferences," Karlson noted. "It can remind me about past interactions, what we've discussed before, and help <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">prepare for meetings</a> in a semi-guided manner, considering both parties' styles."</p><p>In short, Kin stores this information in its advanced memory, so it can quickly and easily reference anything you’ve told it as required. That allows for situations like the examples above, where it can remind Karlson not to dump ideas onto Simon on a whim.</p><p>Still, we recognise that Kin requires a lot of personal information to be its most helpful.</p> How Does My Kin Handle <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">Privacy</a>? <p>Karlson is very adamant about Kin’s approach to user data: "It's your Kin and your information. Your conversations and data are your business, not ours. Our business is providing a service."</p><p>We’ve taken care to reflect this philosophy in Kin’s technical architecture, to make it clear you can <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> it. "All your data is <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">stored locally on your device and encrypted</a>," Karlson explained. "We actually don't pay for data storage, because we don't store user data centrally. While some operations currently require cloud processing, these are temporary and use open-source language models in trusted environments."</p><p>Because of this, moving a Kin account between devices can be a unique experience among apps today. "Currently, if you get a new phone, you need to manually transfer your Kin data, because we don't store it centrally," Karlson said, proudly.</p><p>"We are working on a cloud backup solution that will be encrypted with private keys, meaning we still won't have access to it. That should be available within the next few months." But for now, you’ll need a USB cable or private cloud storage account handy.</p> How Do I Keep Kin Updated Afterward? <p>After getting Kin up to speed, it’s important to keep it updated to ensure its support remains relevant.</p><p>Karlson recommended building regular check-ins into your routine, like he has. "I use morning commutes for planning my day with Kin, and evening commutes for reflecting on the day’s meetings and events," he said.</p><p>Importantly, these updates don't need to be lengthy. "Sometimes it's just a quick post-meeting reflection without waiting for Kin's response," Karlson noted. "You can always return to discuss it more deeply later." Don’t feel pressured to enter or finish a conversation with Kin every time you message it.</p><p>The reminder system can be particularly powerful for maintaining structure with Kin—you can ask Kin to send you a notification at a specific time each day, or week, or month, so that you never forget an update session.</p><p>However, Karlson also notes that its a powerful tool for structure and relationships alike. "I set weekly reminders for regular one-to-ones, and to check in on friends going through tough times," Karlson shared.</p><p>"I also use reminders to help me acknowledge team members' small wins and to prepare something meaningful to tell my sons before I leave for work—something to let them know I'm proud of them and give them energy for the day."</p><p>The key is making Kin part of your daily workflow. "Think of it as a relationship," Karlson suggests. "The more consistently you interact with Kin, the better it understands your needs and preferences, and the more valuable its support becomes."</p> Conclusion <p>Hopefully, this conversation has made the idea of needing to train Kin on you less daunting. Kin doesn’t need much to be an effective assistant, and the ways to give it a baseline understanding are only expanding.</p><p>After that, it’s simply a matter of a loosely regular habit of small updates to ensure Kin is as helpful as possible. It doesn’t need to know everything.</p><p>As Karlson put it, "Kin is not you—it's your silent partner, helping you be more real, more confident, more yourself, through emotional support, self-compassion, and practical guidance."</p><p>If you haven’t already, you can download Kin <a href="https://mykin.ai/">here</a>.</p>

 What is an NFT Marketplace? 



<p>An NFT marketplace is an online platform where users can buy, sell, and trade unique digital assets known as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). These digital assets can range from art and music to in-game items and collectibles. Marketplaces streamline the process of creating, trading, and owning NFTs, providing creators access to a global audience and buyers an organized platform to discover rare digital treasures.</p>



<p>NFT marketplaces have grown in popularity as the NFT industry continues to expand. According to CryptoSlam, November 2024 saw NFT trading volumes rise by 55.6%, hitting $562 million — the highest since May 2024. This growth highlights renewed interest driven by innovative projects and expanding use cases for NFTs.</p>



<p>Popular platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, and Foundation cater to different needs. OpenSea offers a broad collection of NFTs across various categories, while SuperRare focuses on curated, high-end digital art. Additionally, many marketplaces are adopting cutting-edge features like Layer 2 solutions for lower transaction fees, making them more accessible to users.</p>

 How&nbsp; Does NFT Marketplaces Work? 



<p>NFT marketplaces serve as intermediaries, connecting creators, buyers, and sellers of NFTs. Users don’t need to create accounts; instead, they link a crypto wallet, such as MetaMask, which stores cryptocurrencies (ETH, SOL, etc.) and purchased NFTs.</p>



<p>To buy an NFT, users deposit cryptocurrency into their wallet based on the marketplace’s supported currency. For instance, OpenSea operates on ETH, while Magic Eden uses SOL. Transactions often incur network fees (gas fees) for blockchain validation and platform fees, usually ranging from 2% to 5%.</p>



<p>Marketplaces generate revenue through various streams:</p>



 
 Listing fees: Charged for posting NFTs for sale. 



 Transaction fees: A percentage of each sale (typically 2-5%). 



 Royalties: Creators earn a percentage (e.g., SuperRare takes 3%) from secondary sales. 



 Auction fees: Applied to successful bids. 



 Advertising and partnerships: Revenue from partner promotions or affiliate programs. 
 



<p>This model not only facilitates NFT trading but also empowers creators to earn sustainable income, ensuring long-term growth for the NFT ecosystem.</p>


 
 


 3 Popular Types of NFT Marketplaces 



 Exclusive NFT Marketplaces 



<p>Exclusive NFT marketplaces cater to high-end collectors looking for unique, limited-edition digital assets. These platforms often feature curated art pieces or one-of-a-kind NFTs, with creators releasing only a few editions or sometimes just one. While these NFTs often command high prices, the market’s exclusivity leads to lower liquidity due to the smaller pool of potential buyers.</p>



<p>Notable examples include SuperRare, known for its high-end art collections; Foundation, a community-curated art platform; and KnownOrigin, which focuses on supporting digital artists. Interestingly, a report by NonFungible.com highlights that exclusive marketplaces tend to drive higher average transaction values, making them ideal for creators targeting premium buyers.</p>



 General NFT Marketplaces 



<p>General NFT marketplaces are the all-encompassing hubs of the NFT world, offering a wide variety of digital assets, from collectibles and gaming items to art and domain names. These platforms are accessible to a broader audience, making them the most popular choice for both creators and collectors.</p>



<p>OpenSea, one of the largest players, hosts millions of NFTs across over 700 projects, including everything from virtual real estate to profile picture collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club. Other notable platforms include Magic Eden, a Solana-based marketplace, and Binance NFT Marketplace, which integrates seamlessly with its crypto exchange for ease of use.</p>



 Specific NFT Marketplaces 



<p>Specific NFT marketplaces focus on niche sectors like gaming, music, or video content, offering tailored experiences for enthusiasts in those domains. These platforms streamline transactions within their ecosystems and often feature unique functionalities, such as in-game asset trading or royalty payments for artists.</p>



<p>For example, Axie Marketplace, dedicated to the popular blockchain game Axie Infinity, has attracted over 2 million daily active users trading in-game items. Similarly, Royal is a platform designed specifically for music NFTs, allowing artists to sell fractional ownership of songs, giving fans a direct stake in their favorite tracks.</p>

 Comprehensive Guide to Building an NFT Marketplace 



<p>An NFT marketplace is more than just a platform for trading digital assets—it’s a hub for innovation, creativity, and economic opportunity in the digital realm. To create a successful NFT marketplace, you need to understand the market deeply, choose the right blockchain, craft a user-friendly interface, integrate robust smart contracts, and develop comprehensive features for minting, buying, selling, and auctions. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you launch a standout NFT marketplace.</p>



 Step 1: Research the Market and Define Your Niche 



<p>Start by understanding the trends and gaps in the NFT space. Choose a niche—whether it’s digital art, gaming assets, virtual real estate, or music NFTs—to target a specific audience. For instance, marketplaces like Zora focus on empowering creators, while NBA Top Shot specializes in sports moments. Your niche will shape your marketplace’s identity and attract a dedicated user base.</p>



 Step 2: Select the Optimal Blockchain 



<p>Ethereum dominates as the preferred blockchain for NFTs, but alternatives like Polygon, Solana, and Tezos are gaining traction for their lower fees and faster transactions. Notably, Polygon recorded over 2 million unique NFT buyers in 2024, highlighting its growing adoption. Evaluate the scalability, fees, and ecosystem support of each blockchain to make an informed decision.</p>



 Step 3: Design an Intuitive User Interface 



<p>A seamless user experience is critical. Your platform should feature intuitive navigation, clear NFT listings, user profiles, and robust search filters. Tools like Figma or Adobe XD can help design a clean interface. Take inspiration from OpenSea, which prioritizes simplicity, or Foundation, which emphasizes aesthetics for art-focused users.</p>



 Step 4: Develop Smart Contracts 



<p>Smart contracts automate key processes like minting, trading, and royalty payments. Consider implementing multi-standard contracts such as ERC-721 for unique NFTs and ERC-1155 for semi-fungible assets. For royalty mechanisms, platforms like Rarible have set benchmarks, enabling creators to earn consistently from secondary sales.</p>



 Step 5: Build the Backend and Frontend Infrastructure 



<p>Your backend should handle blockchain connectivity, user data, and transaction processing, while the frontend focuses on user interactions. Opt for scalable cloud solutions like AWS or Google Cloud and decentralized storage like IPFS for secure asset hosting.</p>



 Step 6: Integrate Essential Features 



<p>Include wallet connectivity for platforms like MetaMask or Phantom and features for minting, listing, and auctions. Enhance usability with transaction histories, pricing analytics, and customizable notifications. Innovative features, like fractional ownership of NFTs (as seen on Fractional.art), can also differentiate your marketplace.</p>



 Step 7: Launch and Maintain Your Platform 



<p>After rigorous testing, deploy your marketplace on the mainnet. Post-launch, focus on monitoring performance, releasing updates, and responding to user feedback. Security measures, including regular audits of smart contracts, are vital to building trust.</p>



 Step 8: Implement Marketing and User Acquisition Strategies 



<p>Marketing is key to gaining traction. Partner with influencers, host NFT drops, and utilize social media platforms like Twitter and Discord for community building. Unique campaigns, such as gamified rewards or staking incentives, can attract and retain users. In 2024, airdrop campaigns by platforms like Blur saw significant user engagement, illustrating their potential impact.</p>


 
 


 4 Simple Ways to Earn Money from NFTs for Beginners 



<p>Earning money from NFTs isn’t just about selling digital art—it has expanded into areas like membership passes, exclusive access tokens, and brand collaborations. These opportunities provide creators with numerous ways to leverage the growing NFT market in the digital era.</p>



 Sell NFTs and Earn Royalties 



<p>One of the most popular methods to earn money is by creating and selling NFTs on marketplaces. Tools like Metacommerce Studio make it easy for anyone, even non-artists, to design and mint NFTs. Once listed, creators earn royalties—typically 5% to 15%—from every resale of their NFTs. This creates a stream of passive income, as every transaction continues to benefit the creator.</p>



 Use NFTs as Membership Passes 



<p>NFTs can act as access cards to exclusive communities, adding utility beyond ownership. For example, Bored Ape Yacht Club offers NFTs that double as membership passes, granting holders access to private events and an elite social network. Even after the membership benefits end, these NFTs retain value as collectible assets.</p>



 Offer Exclusive Access with NFTs 



<p>Creators can sell NFTs as tokens granting special privileges, such as one-on-one sessions, lessons, or unique experiences. The VeeFriends project utilized this by offering NFTs that allowed holders to have breakfast with Gary Vee, significantly boosting the value and appeal of these tokens. This exclusivity drives higher resale prices, benefiting creators with additional royalties.</p>



 Collaborate with Brands and Sponsorships 



<p>NFT projects with large communities can partner with brands for exclusive collaborations. For instance, Tiffany &amp; Co. collaborated with CryptoPunks to create custom jewelry for Punk holders, priced at $50,000 each, selling out in 30 minutes. Such partnerships not only generate significant revenue but also enhance the reputation of both the NFT project and the brand involved.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFT marketplaces are reshaping the way we interact with digital assets, offering endless opportunities for creators and collectors alike. By understanding how these platforms operate and exploring their potential, you can be part of a rapidly growing movement that’s redefining digital ownership. Start your journey today, and unlock the creative and financial potential of NFTs.</p>

 New IDnow ebook highlights the most frequent types of fraud in the mobility sector and how best to prevent them.&nbsp; 



<p>In recent years, the mobility and micromobility industry, which includes car-sharing and scooter, bicycle and vehicle rentals, have all become increasingly popular. This is largely due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">ease of convenience</a>, but also to it being a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">more environmentally conscious way of travelling</a>. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Little wonder then that the mobility industry is on the move, literally. In 2023, the <a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/v2/publications/2023/nov/2023-oliver-wyman-shared-mobility-report">global shared mobility market was worth U$258 billion and is expected to grow to $401 billion by 2030</a>.  &nbsp;</p>

 Are fraudsters winning the mobility race?&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, the introduction of these new mobility services has inadvertently led to new forms of illicit and fraudulent attacks. As the global mobility market continues to grow, it comes as no surprise that fraudsters are going where the money is.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, unlike the banking sector, where <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> processes and rigorous identity verification checks are mandatory for onboarding, mobility is not as strict, and fraudsters know it. Fraud attempts are also becoming increasingly sophisticated and hard to detect due to the use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">deepfake technology</a>, where a person can digitally manipulate a video to appear as someone else. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why knowing the identity of the customer and proving the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">validity of a driver’s license</a>, for example, is of extreme importance before providing access to the car or other vehicle type.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The most dangerous stage of a customer journey is during account creation and customer onboarding. In 2023, <a href="https://www.transunion.com/content/dam/transunion/us/business/collateral/report/GFS-23-F158127-TruVa-2024StateofOmnichannelFraudReport-RPR-US_EN-US.pdf">36% of suspected digital fraud globally in the travel industry came from digital account creation transactions</a>. This is when users and mobility providers are most vulnerable to fraud attacks and when fraudsters attempt to steal users’ personal information to create new bogus accounts.  &nbsp;</p>



 Impacts of fraud on the mobility sector.&nbsp; 



<p>Fraud is no joke. When fraud occurs no matter the industry, there are serious repercussions for everyone involved because not only does it affect the individual whose identity or documents were stolen but it also affects the company in the following ways:  &nbsp;</p>



  Reputational damage: Despite it not necessarily being the company’s fault, any occurrence of fraud puts its reputation on the line. If fraud is rampant, then customers believe that company is not safe to do business with. &nbsp;  



  Monetary loss: Fraud can cause businesses to lose a huge chunk of their revenue due to fake accounts, stolen credit cards and fraudsters exploiting vulnerabilities in onboarding processes. &nbsp;  



  Damage/misuse of vehicles: When fraudsters, some of which will be underage, gain access to a vehicle, the chances of damaging, misusing or&nbsp;stealing vehicles increases. Not to mention the potential danger and loss of life of those involved and the public.&nbsp;  



  Loss of customers: Customers want to know the company they are doing business with is safe, otherwise they’ll hit the road and take their business elsewhere. &nbsp;  



 Top 5 types of fraud in mobility.&nbsp; 



<p>Fraud comes in many different forms and can be difficult to detect as fraudsters have a trunk full of increasingly sophisticated attacks at their disposal. Once a mobility provider discovers and identifies one form of fraud, fraudsters come up with an entirely different set ready to trick customers again.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here are some of the most common types seen in the mobility sector: &nbsp;</p>



 1. Identity fraud&nbsp; 



<p>Identity fraud is the impersonation of another identity, with more than <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/identity-theft-statistics/">9 million identities stolen annually</a>.   &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the fastest growing types of identity fraud is known as deepfakes. In an attempt to fool an identity verification process, fraudsters impersonate someone else to gain access to a vehicle or other transport service. This is done through digitally altering IDs, other types of documents or the physical appearance of an actual person. .  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Synthetic fraud is an increasingly common form of fraud within mobility, specifically in auto lending when users apply for a loan. In fact,  <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/auto-lending-industry-sees-98-jump-in-synthetic-id-fraud-a-25157">2023 saw a 98% increase in synthetic fraud attempts causing $7.9 billion in losses</a>. In a similar process to document fraud, synthetic fraud stitches together various parts of personal information from one or multiple people to create a new, fake identity. Also known as Frankenstein fraud, identity fraud is a mix of genuine and fake data.  &nbsp;</p>



 2. Document fraud&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common types of fraud in the mobility sector is document fraud which saw a <a href="https://www.inscribe.ai/blog/11-must-know-fraud-statistics-for-2023#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%202023%20Veriff%20Identity%20Fraud%20Report%20showed%20a,fraud%20rates%20tend%20to%20rise.">global increase of 31% in 2023</a>. This involves any form of tampering, alteration or creation of a completely new fake identity document. Document fraud makes use of fake IDs to access something a person might otherwise be unable to access, such as an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">underage person wanting to rent an e-scooter</a> or car. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In such cases, legitimate documents are altered to change the holder’s identity. This could include replacing the image or adding or replacing specific data, most likely age, on the document.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As underage car and scooter rentals can have disastrous consequences for both the person and the vehicle, mobility operators have a responsibility to tackle document fraud and comply with minimum age requirements.  &nbsp;</p>



 3. Repeat fraud&nbsp; 



<p>Once a fraudster is successful with a fraud attack, what is to stop them from trying again? Fraudsters will exploit every opportunity they can to abuse the system as many times as possible. And, once successful, they will keep coming back twice as hard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Synthetic fraud is a popular way for fraudsters to commit recurring fraud. They simply create numerous fake identities with the information they obtain from different users and try to use those identities as many times as possible, across various services. Once verified, the fake identities can then be used to abuse company promotions again and again.   &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Putting a stop to repeat fraud cycles is of the utmost importance since fraudsters will never stop trying to exploit a company’s security system, especially if they’ve been successful the first time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 4. Account takeover fraud&nbsp; 



<p>Account takeover fraud is a growing problem for mobility services, specifically ride-hailing apps, car sharing and micromobility services. Over the past five years, <a href="https://www.transunion.com/content/dam/transunion/us/business/collateral/report/GFS-23-F158127-TruVa-2024StateofOmnichannelFraudReport-RPR-US_EN-US.pdf">account takeover fraud has increased 113%</a> with <a href="https://spycloud.com/blog/cybersecurity-industry-statistics-account-takeover-ransomware-data-breaches-bec-fraud/">2023 seeing $13 billion in losses</a>. When accounts are&nbsp;taken over, fraudsters can steal personal information to create a new account to either take money from someone who ordered a ride, leaving them with a no-show driver, or create completely fake profiles of users and drivers. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>With a fake driver profile, fraudsters can trick the ride-hailing service into believing real journeys were made using spoofed GPS locations. Fraudsters can create a never-ending cycle where they continuously create fake cancellations and fake bookings to gain even more money. &nbsp;</p>



 5. Account sharing fraud&nbsp; 



<p>The newest fraud on the block is account sharing fraud. Although it sounds similar to account takeover fraud, account sharing fraud occurs after the KYC check has been performed, when fraudsters exploit a vulnerability in the onboarding process to gain access to the vehicle. They then can un-install and re-install the app to commit repeat fraud.  &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fraudsters also sell the accounts/identities (real or fake) they have gained entry to through account sharing, helping them commit synthetic fraud.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>The following Learning Note is a form of provocation but with a slight twist. Recognising that part of Dm’s contribution to the ecosystem is to stimulate market innovation, we are sharing our emergent learning as both a provocation and invitation. Given the trajectory and speed of technological innovation, we urgently need tangible options for governing Digital IP in new ways. This is not something that Dm can realistically manifest ALONE in the timeframe required, but we we believe we can play a role in bringing unusual allies together to make that happen. We are therefore sharing this note in the spirit of both learning out loud and seeking to incite new relationships. If you would like to contribute to the development of a real world prototype of any of the elements outlined in the speculative framework below, then we invite you to add your comments here so that the conversation and connections are visible to all interested partners.</p><p>Open Dynamic Intellectual Property Rights Trusts (ODIPRT) Framework: An Intellectual Property framework for public interest in an Age of Computational Contracting and Governance.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>This learning note explores the concept of an Open Dynamic Intellectual Property Rights Trusts (ODIPR) framework, designed to address the inefficiencies and challenges of traditional IP systems. The ODIPR model introduces a dynamic Digital Autonomous Trust approach to IP management by leveraging real-time accounting, open registries, and milestone-based rights adjustments. Central to this model is the creation of Open Digital Intellectual Property Rights Trusts that utilise digital technology to dynamically manage rights and use cases across multiple stakeholders.</p><blockquote>The development and market distribution of a new drug can be used as an illustration of how this process could work. Currently, drug companies need to raise huge upfront investment in order to carry out the necessary R&amp;D, approval and licensing stages before they can recover any revenue. This results in the market being dominated by large players who can secure the necessary funding. Once the drug is approved the developer generally secures an exclusive patent, giving them rights over future revenue flows that are untethered from the costs incurred. By retaining long-term private property rights over a scarce resource they are able to reap gains that far exceed their contribution. In contrast, an ODIPR model would utilise an open digital patent (comparable to a smart contract). This digital contract could be pre-programmed with a variable and contingent framework of rates of return that is more representative of the risks and responsibilities of those involved (for example, the MHRA in the UK, could make a socially fair return a prerequisite for granting a licence). As the drug is sold and revenues are realised the digital trust would transparently track the stage of cost recovery plus the agreed return. At the point that both the costs and fair return were covered, the patent would pass into the public realm for open-source use.</blockquote><p>Dynamic, digital trusts have the capacity to automatically release permissions and manage use cases and registries. This system ensures transparent tracking of investment recovery and facilitates the gradual release of IP rights as financial milestones are met, with failsafe end dates guaranteeing eventual public access. By addressing critical issues such as prolonged monopolies, rent-seeking behaviours, and the lack of transparency in current IP practices, ODIPR creates (a) a pathway to accelerate investment (b) strong incentives for initial capital deployment. It balances the need for incentivising innovation with the societal benefit of open access, fostering a viable ecosystem where intellectual property serves public interests, while respecting risk&nbsp;capital.</p>Image credit: Irina&nbsp;Wang<p>Challenges of Investing in Intellectual Property</p><p>Investing in the development of intellectual property presents several inherent challenges. One major issue is the uncertainty surrounding the potential return on investment. Investors often face significant risks due to the unpredictable nature of market reception and the time it takes to recoup their initial expenditures. Additionally, the complexity of IP accounting makes it difficult for investors to accurately assess the viability of a project. Traditional IP rights can also lead to rent-seeking behaviours, where rights holders exploit their monopolies for prolonged periods without contributing to further innovation or public benefit. Furthermore, fully open-source models, while encouraging collaboration and accessibility, can undermine investment incentives. For example, by providing insufficient financial returns to cover the high initial costs of development and innovation.</p><p>These challenges are exacerbated by the rise of the computational economy driven by digital and computational intellectual property, including software, digital art, algorithms, and large language models (LLMs). Traditional IP frameworks, designed primarily for tangible and less rapidly evolving assets, often fail to provide the flexibility and transparency needed for digital IP. The ODIPR framework addresses these challenges by fostering a digital-first IP economy that leverages advanced technological infrastructure and open registries to ensure real-time transparency and dynamic rights management.</p><p>Open Digital Intellectual Property Rights&nbsp;Trusts</p><p>This is a next generation of rights management that is no longer a static system but a dynamic negotiation between rights capital holders, authors, beneficiaries and societal good. This framework is conceived both as an agreement space and as an agent dynamically optimising across multiple parties. This agent-based approach transforms rights management from static contracts into active, adaptive systems that respond in real-time to the needs and inputs of ALL the stakeholders involved.</p><p>In this envisioned future, the construction and micro-capabilities of these agents allow us to compile and orchestrate them into cohesive systems of intellectual property (fully legible and compatible with compliance regulations such as transfer pricing). These systems manage flows of value and investment at a granular, unitary level while simultaneously supporting complex arrangements of value flows in structured economic&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Managing this future requires the creation of Open Digital Intellectual Property Rights Micro-trusts. These micro-trusts are effectively digital autonomous entities that dynamically manage rights and returns. These micro-entities are critical for operationalizing the ODIPR framework, automatically releasing permissions, managing use cases, and maintaining registries, ensuring seamless and transparent IP management.</p><p>Key Functions of&nbsp;ODIPRT</p><p>The key attributes of an operational ODIPRT are envisaged as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Real-Time Accounting and Transparency: Continuous monitoring of revenue streams and usage metrics provides investors with up-to-date information on the performance of their investments. Open registries ensure that all stakeholders have access to this data, promoting trust and reducing risks associated with information asymmetry.  Adaptability to Technological Changes: Digital IP, particularly algorithms and (large language models) LLMs, can become obsolete quickly due to rapid technological advancements. The dynamic nature of micro-trusts allows for flexible adjustment of IP rights based on the performance and relevance of the asset. This adaptability ensures that investors can respond to market changes swiftly, protecting their investments and encouraging continuous innovation.  Piracy and Unauthorised Use: Digital assets are particularly vulnerable to piracy and unauthorised use, which can significantly undermine their value. Transparent accounting and rights management systems help mitigate these risks by providing clear and enforceable tracking of IP usage. Blockchain technology, integrated into the open registries, offers an immutable record of transactions and usage, further securing digital assets against infringement.  Addressing Monetization Challenges: Monetising digital IP such as algorithms and LLMs is often complex due to their intangible nature and the difficulty in setting fair pricing models. Micro-trusts can facilitate flexible investment structures and dynamic adjustment of rights. This enables stakeholders to experiment with different revenue models, such as subscription-based access, licensing, or performance-based royalties, optimising returns and encouraging broader adoption of digital innovations.  Complex Valuation and Risk Assessment: Valuing digital IP, especially emerging technologies like LLMs, can be challenging due to their novelty and the lack of historical data. The ODIPR model addresses this by providing standardised return multiples based on risk assessment and transparent financial reporting. This helps investors make informed decisions and accurately gauge the potential returns on their investments.  Encouraging Investment in High-Risk Intellectual Projects: High-risk intellectual projects, such as developing advanced algorithms or LLMs, often struggle to secure funding due to the uncertainty and high initial costs. The ODIPR framework’s structured approach to risk assessment and return multiples provides clear incentives for investing in these projects. By offering higher returns for higher risks and ensuring transparent recovery metrics, the model makes it more attractive for investors to allocate capital to cutting-edge digital innovations.  <p>Key Benefits of Open Digital IPR Trust Management</p><p>The real world impact will need to be validated as the framework is operationalised but the following benefits are expected:</p>  Transparent Assembly of Micro-Intellectual Property Rights: The ODIPR framework facilitates the transparent and flexible assembly of micro-intellectual property rights within predefined frameworks. This allows for the dynamic assignment and movement of these rights without the need for complex negotiations.  Market Transparency: By significantly enhancing market transparency, the ODIPR framework improves operational opportunities, making it easier for stakeholders to engage in IP transactions and investments.  Structural Macroeconomic Gain: The seamless assembly of intellectual property and the ability to unleash its potential within society represent substantial structural macroeconomic gains. This fosters a more efficient and dynamic IP market, driving broader economic growth and innovation.  Real-Time Negotiation and Optimisation: The rights management agent continuously negotiates and optimises terms and conditions among rights capital holders, authors, and beneficiaries. This ensures all parties receive fair value based on current market conditions and individual contributions.  Adaptive and Responsive Systems: The agent-based framework adapts to changing circumstances, such as shifts in market demand, technological advancements, and evolving legal landscapes. This responsiveness ensures that rights management remains relevant and effective over&nbsp;time.  Seamless Integration of Multiple Agents: Multiple rights management agents can be compiled and integrated to create systems that manage and optimise flows of value across different sectors and industries. This capability allows for the creation of vast, complex arrangements capable of handling diverse and intricate economic activities.  Enhanced Investment Flows: By dynamically optimising rights and value distribution, the framework promotes more efficient and targeted investment. This encourages innovation and systemic capabilities by ensuring that capital is allocated where it can be most effective.  Transparent and Equitable Value Distribution: The system ensures transparency in the creation, distribution, and utilisation of value. This transparency builds trust among stakeholders and supports a fairer economic system where all contributors are adequately rewarded.  Micro-Level and Macro-Level Benefits: At the micro-level, individual agents optimise value flows for specific projects or intellectual properties. At the macro-level, these agents collectively contribute to a structured economic system that supports large-scale, coordinated economic activity and&nbsp;growth.  Image credit: Irina&nbsp;Wang<p>Framework Structure and Implementation considerations</p><p>The framework is still speculative but will be based on the following pillars:</p>  Initial Investment and Risk Capital Allocation:    Investment Transparency: Open registries disclose detailed investment costs, including R&amp;D, production, marketing, and distribution.  Dynamically Restructured Risk Assessment and Return Multiples: Clear return multiples based on risk encourage capital allocation to innovative projects, with the ability to dynamically adjust based on fiscal policies.  <p>2. Dynamic Use Rights Based on Recovery&nbsp;Metrics:</p>  Real-Time Accounting: Continuous monitoring of capital recovery.  Dynamic Rights Adjustment: Gradual rights release as financial milestones are met, transitioning from exclusive rights to open fair&nbsp;use.  Failsafe End Dates: Guarantees public domain transition after a predefined period.  <p>3. Incentivizing Continuous Innovation:</p>  Reinvestment Strategies: Encourages reinvestment into new projects.  Rewarding Early Adopters: Fiscal incentives for early high-risk investors.  <p>4. Enabling Derivative Quasi-Equity Economies:</p>  Derivative IP Markets: Creation of quasi-equity derivatives based on IP performance.  Flexible Investment Structures: Diversified investment portfolios to spread risk and enhance&nbsp;returns.  <p>Implementing the framework will be an iterative process weaving with multiple layers of the socioeconomic landscape. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Legal Frameworks: Adapting existing IP laws to accommodate dynamic computational rights management, open registries, and failsafe end dates, ensuring legal enforceability and protection of stakeholders’ interests.  Technological Infrastructure: Development of robust platforms for real-time accounting and rights management, leveraging blockchain and smart contracts for transparency and security.  Stakeholder Engagement: Collaboration and trust and market building with creators, investors, and consumers to refine and accept the&nbsp;model.  <p>Conclusion</p><p>The ODIPRT framework effectively addresses the challenges of traditional IP investment by providing a dynamic, transparent, and fair approach to intellectual property management. By ensuring clear paths to investment recovery and preventing prolonged monopolies, this model encourages more robust and confident investment in innovation. It balances the financial needs of creators and investors with the societal benefits of open access, fostering a more equitable and public-interest intellectual property landscape.</p><p>This Learning Note has been written by Indy Johar in collaboration with numerous individual efforts and inputs from across the Dm Ecosystem.</p><p>Operating In good faith (not an IP clause) Version&nbsp;3.1</p><p>We distribute this document, in order to build shared acknowledgement that the problem analysis, concepts, strategies, ideas and innovations outlined herein are the culmination of years of dedicated investment and understanding.

Based on research including randomized controlled trials, journaling helps create a safe space for self-reflection and emotional processing,<a>3</a> making it a powerful tool in supporting mental well-being. </p><p>When done properly, the benefits of journaling are a key companion to other approaches like therapy from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) or health professional, or medication.</p><p>But what is proper journaling? </p><p>To understand that, journaling, and its link to anxiety, must be explored.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde3cf542-9a83-4d2a-be18-6374ae9bf571_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@noemimk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Noémi Macavei-Katócz</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-pen-on-white-printer-book-page-GAv6SVHKQiw?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  What is Journaling? <p>Journaling is the process of writing down thoughts, feelings, and experiences in some way. This is commonly done to help people describe their emotions and feel more able to understand them.</p><p>It’s a highly personal process that looks different for most people, but in the end, it’s still all about helping people make sense of themselves.</p> Understanding Anxiety and Journaling <p>Anxiety manifests both mentally and physically, and like journaling, it does so differently for different people. </p><p>While some anxiety is normal and even helpful in certain situations, those who experience excessive anxiety can attest to how it interferes with daily life, relationships, and overall well-being.</p><p>This is where journaling helps. Attempting to describe anxious thoughts and anxiety-inducing situations in words encourages people to view them objectively, and think about the root of the feelings to describe them fully. This process can help someone realize when and why their anxiety has become excessive, and can even lessen the anxiety itself in some cases.</p><p>Regular journaling can build the habit of approaching anxiety with a logical cause-and-effect mindset even without writing in a journal, and this can help people remember to lean on their coping strategies before their anxiety worsens.</p><p>Let’s look at what kinds of journaling help build this mindset and habit.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ac373a2-d624-4683-a6ac-23adef3b2272_1200x1600.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@prophsee?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Prophsee Journals</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-riding-on-book-OnFW5djcAYc?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Core Journaling Techniques for Anxiety <p>Various types of journaling have proven particularly effective for managing symptoms of anxiety, with each having its own individual appeal and mental health benefits:</p> Freewriting <p>Freewriting, expressive writing, or stream-of-consciousness writing is perhaps the most famous and popular form of journaling. </p><p>Freewriting involves someone just writing out whatever they feel like, without any worry for topic, grammar, spelling, language, or even sense—there’s no wrong way to do it. A topic could even be chosen for a session if desired; it’d still count.</p><p>While it can take some getting used to, freewriting can help people express negative thoughts and release anxious feelings by encouraging raw thought patterns to be recorded without any kind of conscious filter. This can even reveal feelings, thoughts, or emotions that weren’t clear previously.</p><p>As such, it's particularly effective for overthinking, as it helps move anxious thoughts from your mind onto paper where they can be examined more objectively through self-awareness.</p><p>Like we’ll discuss, too, this doesn’t have to be on paper—word processors, <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a>, and more advanced solutions like <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> are all options. </p> Worry Logs <p>Worry logs and thought records are exactly what they sound like—a digital or physical note of every worry or important-feeling thought that someone thinks of each day, added when they think of it.</p><p>These logs provide structured ways to track anxiety triggers and individual anxiety symptoms, meaning self-check-ins for mental health states and progress become easier, as data on past and present worries are on hand. </p><p>Regular journaling like this also quickly builds a familiarity with these symptoms and their triggers, so people can more easily recognize and mitigate their anxiety.</p> The 3-3-3 Rule: <p>The 3-3-3 rule involves writing down 3 things that can be seen, 3 that can be heard, and 3 parts of the body that can be moved. It’s a coping strategy and grounding technique to help take someone out of a spiralling tirade of anxious thoughts.</p><p>Similar to its sibling, the 5-4-3-2-1 rule (where someone names 5 things they can see, 4 they can hear, 3 they can feel, 2 they can smell, and 1 they can touch), these popular techniques can be incorporated into journaling easily.</p><p>Doing this helps take someone out of their thoughts, so they can approach their journaling in a less anxious and more objective state. It also helps them associate the rule with feelings of anxiety so that they’re more likely to ground themselves unprompted in the future.</p> Gratitude Journaling <p>Gratitude journaling is again what it sounds like—writing down things that spark gratitude and thankfulness in life.</p><p>While this might seem counterintuitive for anxiety management, shifting focus away from worries toward positives can help some people escape the negative mindset anxiety can cause for long enough to begin to examine and deconstruct it. Others find pairing this with positive affirmations and online positive affect journaling to further enhance your stress management practices.</p><p>Regular journaling in this way also builds the habit of looking for positives every day, rather than dwelling on negatives—which can be a partial cause of anxiety.</p> Thought Challenging <p>Thought challenging is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles, and involves writing down anxious thoughts to then systematically examine their validity. For each anxious thought, write:</p>  <p>The thought itself</p>  <p>Evidence supporting the thought</p>  <p>Evidence against the thought</p>  <p>Whether the thought is a balanced perspective, and what a balanced perspective might look like if not</p>  <p>This cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) technique helps develop coping skills and a more balanced perspective on anxiety-provoking situations. This is because it essentially trains someone through regular journaling not only to debunk their most common anxious thoughts, but to approach all anxieties with skepticism.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed138ba7-babd-4355-98c3-c7cd87f16b22_900x1600.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@ikigloo?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> IKIGLOO</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-book-opened-on-top-of-a-bed-next-to-a-plant-T0TbnqkySPk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Getting Started with Anxiety Journaling <p>Beginning a journaling practice for anxiety management is easier than it seems. </p><p>Start by finding a preferred medium to journal in (i.e. a notebook, an app, or just paper). Then, create a dedicated space and time for journaling that feels safe and will be uninterrupted.</p><p>As journaling becomes a habit, it’ll be easier to do it in more distracting environments. For now though, an ideal place might look like a quiet corner of home, a favorite café, or even during a morning commute.</p><p>In the same vein, choose a time where consistency is likely. It can be helpful to attach journaling to an already existing routine, like breakfast or setting the dishwasher, to help encourage consistency.</p><p>It's normal to feel resistance at first. Many people worry about ‘doing it wrong’, or feel uncomfortable confronting anxious thoughts. Remember that there's no wrong way to journal – the most effective approach is the one that is enjoyable enough to do regularly.</p><p>If it’s really hard to start, journal prompts like "What triggered my anxiety today?" or "How did my physical health feel affected when I was anxious?" can help. This isn’t something that must be kept neat, either—doodle in the margins instead of writing, if that helps maintain a regular journaling practice.</p><p>Lastly, keep in mind that journals by nature will contain private and personal thoughts. Whether using a physical notebook or digital platform, ensure the chosen journaling method provides a level of privacy that is comfortable.</p><p>If it doesn’t, locks can be purchased for notebooks, and apps like Kin have been designed for private journaling.</p> Common Challenges and Solutions <p>There are a few common things that can stop new journal users from creating a consistent and helpful habit:</p>  <p>Writer's Block is a common obstacle, particularly when anxiety is high. Combat this by using prompts (like the ones lower down), starting with simple lists, or even drawing if words feel too difficult.</p>  <p>Perfectionism can paralyze journaling efforts, and even cause Writer’s Block. It’s important to remember that a journal is a purely personal thing—it doesn't need to be polished or profound, because no one else will see it. Some of the most therapeutic entries might be messy or seemingly mundane.</p>  <p>Difficult emotions often surface during journaling. While this can feel overwhelming, confronting these emotions in writing actually helps process them more effectively. If certain topics feel too intense, take breaks and consider seeking professional support.</p>   Advanced Journaling Strategies <p>As you become more comfortable with basic journaling, several advanced strategies can deepen its anxiety-managing benefits:</p><p>Emotional awareness exercises involve detailed documentation of physical sensations accompanying anxiety. This helps build the mind-body connection and often leads to earlier recognition of anxiety symptoms.</p><p>Trigger tracking takes worry logs a step further by analyzing patterns over time. Understanding what consistently triggers your anxiety allows for more proactive management strategies.</p><p>Solution-focused entries move beyond processing anxiety to actively planning responses. For each anxiety-provoking situation, document potential solutions and coping strategies.</p><p>Progress monitoring helps maintain motivation by tracking improvements over time. Regular reviews of past entries often reveal positive changes that might otherwise go unnoticed. Bullet journaling can be particularly effective for this, and is worth exploring once journaling feels comfortable.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30965a22-6437-4ca7-a5a8-4f0b0a3e5994_1600x1200.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@jessbaileydesigns?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Jess Bailey</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/pen-near-black-lined-paper-and-eyeglasses-q10VITrVYUM?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  How <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> Can Enhance Anxiety Journaling <p>Modern AI technology has been transformative to traditional journaling practices. AI-supported journaling tools can offer unique advantages, such as pattern recognition in anxiety triggers, emotional tone analysis, and personalized prompts based on your writing history.</p><p>Digital journaling platforms with AI capabilities can provide insights that might be difficult to identify manually. For instance, AI can analyze writing patterns and can access entire journal histories at once to identify correlations between activities, situations, and anxiety levels.

Kin then parses the finished entries locally on the user’s device, picking out keywords like people, places, and situations to add to its interconnected memory of the user.</p><p>This ever-growing memory can be analyzed by Kin, allowing it to pick up on trends, patterns, and behaviors that may be contributing to its user’s anxiety, among other things.</p><p>Then, within the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-chat">Chat</a> feature, Kin can make these insights known to its user, and interactively discuss how it reached those conclusions, explain things with web search capabilities, and work with the user to build action plans to change habits and prepare for common anxiety triggers.</p><p>Kin can even create custom push notification reminders to help users build new habits, or just remember things they may forget.</p><p>With all of that personal information available to it, privacy and data protection are foundational to Kin's design—more about that can be found <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">here</a>. In short, though, all of a user’s journal entries and personal data are stored and processed on the user’s device, wherever possible, and only temporarily handed off to approved third parties when necessary.</p><p>Everything Kin knows about someone is <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-view-and-control-your-data">viewable and deletable</a> at any time through the app. Similarly, it’s robustly encrypted so that not even we can read it. Users control their data, not us, so they’re able to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> Kin and be honest, which allows Kin to provide the best emotional support.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91e0f0f2-d858-431c-817a-cb9138bc623a_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@thepaintedsquarejessica?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Jessica Lewis 🦋 thepaintedsquare</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-pen-on-black-line-notebook-cdwpR1AUn8o?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>  Get Started Today with Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Assistant</a> <p>Sound helpful? </p><p>Kin can be downloaded <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">here</a>.

<p>Howdy folks!&nbsp; As 2025 rolls in, the Holochain team continues progressing steadily toward our goal of delivering stability across the board.&nbsp; At first I didn’t feel like this because the holiday season just always seems to slow things down, but as I look over all the completed issues and pull-requests I must say I’m quite pleased.&nbsp; We’ve shown advancement across all our work domains: the networking layer, Holochain core, developer tooling (scaffolding and the hc command-line tool), runtimes (kangaroo, mobile), testing harness, developer documentation, and the human layer including team process.</p><p>Here’s a recap of the most important things we’ve been up to since the last Dev Pulse in mid-December:</p>  Team Process: We’ve now been able to clear out our backlog review, prioritizing and categorizing work which sets the stage for building out a new road-map. We’ve also been using our project tooling for long enough that we may be even able to produce usable burn-down charts soon and actually predict delivery timelines from data. Now wouldn’t that be cool!I’m going to be showing up more frequently doing communications (like this one), leaving Paul more time to focus on developer documentation.  Dev Docs: We are especially keen in 2025 to live up to the pulls we’ve been getting to flesh out the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guide</a> as we know that it can sometimes be difficult to put all the pieces together just by reading the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust HDK docs</a> when trying to answer practical how-to questions.&nbsp; Just added are the sections on <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/links-paths-and-anchors?ref=blog.holochain.org">Links</a> and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/application-structure/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Application Structure</a>.  Holochain Core: We’ve got a release candidate out for Holochain 0.4.1 which fixes a bug that could allow the init callback to be called more than once.&nbsp; This clears the way for initializing cells on headless nodes. 0.4.1 will also include an upgrade to wasmer 5.x, and fixes wasmer module serialization compatibility issues and reduces memory usage by removing redundant caching that was happening.  Networking: The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune 2</a>&nbsp; revamp is coming along nicely, with the peer-store revamp complete, gossip revamp well in progress, refactored fetch queue, and more.  Runtimes: <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a> (the dev-template for stand-alone Electron-based desktop hApp delivery) has been updated to the 0.4.1 release candidate, and now also has a sys-tray option, improved password management and auto-updating. On the mobile side, our work with partner <a href="https://volla.online/en/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> continues strong on the next version of <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/volla-messages/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla Messages</a>, with a UI refactor, and integration into the Android Holochain-as-system-service runtime.  Testing: Last but not least is our testing harness, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/wind-tunnel/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">wind-tunnel</a>. Here we haven’t made as much progress as we’d like for a number of reasons, including the usual excuse of holiday-down-time-coordination-challenges, but actually mostly because we are still working on upgrading from our home-baked TryCP orchestrator to Nomad, a third-party orchestrator which we’ll be using from now on. Even so, we’ve updated the framework to Holochain 0.4, worked on repo chores, and most importantly have made some progress coordinating with the Holo team on the plan for the updated Nomad-base scenario deployment and execution strategy to Holoports. This is important for Holochain, as we’ll need the Holo network to run many of our Wind Tunnel tests to give us real-world results.  <p>As always, the best place to really see the details behind the Dev Pulse is to look at Github’s Insights page for whichever repo you are most interested in.&nbsp; For example see <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/pulse?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>.</p>

 Centralized Digital ID: The Risks 



<p>A centralized digital ID system is like a massive database where all your identity information is stored in one location, controlled by a single entity. Think of it as your passport or driver’s license, but in digital form and potentially containing much more data.</p>



<p>Here’s the problem:</p>



 
 Single Point of Failure: If that central database is hacked or compromised, all the data it holds is vulnerable. This could lead to widespread identity theft, fraud, and privacy breaches. 



 Data Misuse: The entity controlling the database has complete access to your information and could potentially misuse it, sell it, or be forced to hand it over to governments. 



 Limited Control: You have little to no control over your own data. You can’t choose what information is shared or with whom. 
 



 Decentralized Digital ID: The Solution 



<p>A decentralized digital ID system, on the other hand, puts you in control. Your identity information isn’t stored in a single location but is distributed across a network. This makes it far more secure and resistant to attacks.</p>



<p>Here’s why Decentralized ID it’s a more secure solution for Data Management:</p>



 
 Enhanced Security: With no single point of failure, decentralized systems are much harder to hack. Even if part of the network is compromised, the rest remains secure. 



 Increased Privacy: You control what information is shared and with whom. This gives you greater privacy and autonomy over your own data. 



 Reduced Costs: Decentralized systems can be more cost-effective by eliminating the need for expensive central infrastructure and intermediaries.

 Use Cases: Centralized vs. Decentralized 



<p>To better illustrate the differences, let’s examine some common use cases:</p>



Use CaseCentralized SystemDecentralized SystemStoring customer dataA company keeps all customer information (names, addresses, purchase history) in one central database.Each customer controls their own data and chooses what to share with the company. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/signature-of-contracts-documents/" title="Customer Onboarding (KYC / KYB)">See how Extrimian can help</a>Accessing medical recordsA hospital stores all patient records in a central system, accessible only by hospital staff.Patients hold their own medical records and grant access to doctors or hospitals as needed. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/secure-health-records-management-with-ssi/" title="">Explore more in this Extrimian Academy course</a>Verifying employee identitiesA company uses a central ID system to manage employee access to buildings and systems.Employees use digital wallets to store verifiable credentials and prove their identity. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/employment-and-background-checks-with-ssi/" title="Employment and Background Checks with SSI">Discover how this work</a>Sharing educational credentialsA university issues digital diplomas stored in a central database.Students receive verifiable diplomas they can share with employers directly. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/learning-credentials-with-ssi/" title="">Extrimian’s solutions for Education</a>Voting in electionsA government manages a central voter registry and voting system.Voters use digital identities to cast secure and verifiable votes. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/signature-of-contracts-documents/" title="">How Decentralized Digital ID can help in voting process.</a>Managing supply chainsA company tracks goods and transactions in a central database.Each participant in the supply chain maintains their own records and shares data securely. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/retail-and-self-sovereign-identity/" title="">Use case page about supply chain management</a>Proving age for online purchasesA central authority verifies age for online purchases like alcohol or tobacco.Individuals use digital wallets to prove their age without revealing other personal information. <a href="https://extrimian.io/ssi-use-cases/issuance-of-identity-credentials/" title="">Age Verification with SSI or Decentralized Digital Identity.</a>



 



 A customized solution for business and final users data management 



<p>For both individuals and companies, the advantages of decentralized digital ID are undeniable. It offers greater security, privacy, and control over your own data. In a world where data breaches are becoming increasingly common, choosing a decentralized system is not just a good idea; it’s essential.</p>

<p>Last week, as various friends in southern California were sharing status updates in social media, comparing details on how to prepare to flee nearby wildfires, and in some cases, seeking new places to live, several shared the below image of what documents to be sure to collect. It’s a very thorough list, and I’ll be the first to admit, I might have a hard time gathering all these documents with just a couple hours’ notice — especially while also preparing to evacuate my family.</p><p>I would guess most Americans would have a similarly hard time. It’s terrifying to think about all your life’s most important papers going up in smoke (or floating downstream, or getting blown away). That’s one of many reasons I’m so proud of the work that SpruceID, and so many organizations across the world, are doing to make sure crucial documents can be safely and securely digitized, in a privacy-preserving and owner-controlled manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the next decade, you’ll be able to store even sensitive documents like birth certificates, health records, and social security cards on your phone, using the digital identity technology SpruceID builds. It will be a huge boon for disaster victims and other vulnerable groups.</p><p>I’m enough of an identity and policy wonk to be excited about one of the relatively unsung drivers of that future: U.S. Federal government standards for digital identity management. The fourth revision of the<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63-4.2pd.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines</a> was recently issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and they describe how user identities are first proven and then recorded for use in accessing government benefits or tax systems. NIST standards are widely referenced in government procurement standards, leading most private U.S. firms to follow their lead. Foreign governments also look to NIST to inform their own guidance, so the standards have a global impact.</p><p>This round of updates have particularly major implications. NIST standards now include various roles and guidelines for digital credentials (such as<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/"> California’s mobile driver’s license</a>) for logging on to government systems.&nbsp;</p><p>That means digital credentials are going to be a much bigger part of our future.</p> Logging On In a Whole New Way <p>The most important part of the new NIST standards is simply that they include roles for encryption-backed digital credentials for the first time. This will fuel a huge step forward in adoption and acceptance of these technologies, thanks to both its implications for government contractors, and the more general “stamp of approval” their acknowledgement by NIST carries.</p><p>Most notably, this includes guidelines for using digital credentials stored in<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/who-should-build-a-digital-wallet-2/"> user-controlled wallets</a> to log in to Federal services. For the vast majority of users, this will be a new experience of logging on – not with a password, but with a digitally-signed proof of identity stored on a secure hardware chip on your phone. This should lead to broad improvements in security, since passwords have been the chronic target of malicious hackers.</p><p>These new rules will add to the ongoing<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/who-should-build-a-digital-wallet-2/"> adoption of digital wallets</a> as a part of digital life. “Wallets” are pieces of software that manage and display digital credentials, both for real-world and online purposes. More and more people are already relying on them<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/technology/personaltech/mobile-wallet-app.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> instead of physical wallets</a>, and defining them for use in U.S. government systems will only make them more useful, and more ubiquitous. It’s a huge win for cybersecurity – and that’s about more than replacing passwords.</p> Security That Fits <p>The revised digital identity standards also include guidance for using digital credentials as the basis for what’s known as ‘federated’ account management. This would essentially mean one credential, tied to one account, could give access to a host of different services or platforms. For everyday digital citizens, this reduces the surface area they need to protect - only one account to secure with strong passwords+mfa (or even better, phishing-resistant passkeys), as opposed to the over 150 accounts that most adults have today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The NIST guidance also presents an overarching approach to risk management for online services, defining three levels of rigor for identity proofing and authentication, used to set varying requirements depending on the sensitivity of the service being controlled. For instance, Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1) simply involves proof that the user is human and not a bot, and that’s enough protection to let a user access, for instance, a purely informational government web page. Higher levels of verification can require more rigorous in-person identity “proofing” for the issuance of a credential, or require multiple authenticators that show control of that credential.</p><p>Descriptions of the new NIST assurance levels now include specific reference to features of digital credentials. The highest Authentication Assurance Level (AAL3) specifically requires encrypted credentials based on key-pair cryptography, and a “hardware-based authenticator with a non-exportable private key”.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s effectively a description of digital credentials stored on trusted hardware, and many of those credentials are issued based on in-person identity proofing that also meets the highest assurance level. That means that in the future, a rigorously-issued digital credential such as a driver’s license could be used as a login for even quite sensitive Federal services.</p> More Security, More Access, More Stability <p>Taken together, updates to the NIST-800 identity standards mean there will be more opportunities to use secure digital credentials, kicking off a virtuous cycle with many, many benefits. Obviously we’re big fans of the improved security digital credentials can provide, and the added privacy thanks to features like<a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> selective disclosure</a>.</p><p>But my thoughts return to the folks across the U.S. who have been displaced and disrupted this past year – whether by a storm, fire, family struggles, or other hardships. With smartphones nearly ubiquitous, digital credentials securely <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/introduction-to-device-binding?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tied to a hardware you carry everywhere</a> – and usable in many cases even without a cellular signal – will become a widespread boon.

							  A Lifetime In 96 Hours   <p>The last 96 hours have been exhausting. Why wouldn’t it be for the industry that never sleeps? Web3 is 24/7. So what happens when MLK Day, the CFP Championship Game, and the coronation of our new Crypto-Billionaire-in-Chief all fall within the same 24?</p>  <p>Two words: price action. And boy did we get some action. It started with an announcement that American-made web3 solutions would be championed by the Trump administration. (Although it sacrilegiously named XRP and Solana in the same breadth, two projects that couldn’t represent fundamentally more different approaches to building solutions in the space, and yet also the mostly likely rails of our future.)</p>  <p>But this announcement was merely a precursor for what followed next, which was a launch of the official $TRUMP presidential commemorative token (read: shitcoin) on the Solana blockchain, seemingly a fundraising event for the Trump-backed crypto projects within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>  <p>(Full disclosure: the&nbsp;+SOL team holds the shitcoin in question. I entered at a $27M marketcap with a modest .1 SOL bet at the insistence of my fellow writer Muhammed, which I rode all the way to $70M — and back down to $30M.)<br><br>So what does it mean to be standing in an era where the sitting President opens his second term with a rug pull? While, on the other end of the spectrum, we’ve got&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/amirhaleem/status/1881040828120142165?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=crypto-billionaire-in-chief">Gensler’s farewell</a>&nbsp;(and/or fuck you) present on his way out of office: a lawsuit against the most presently useful and real project in the space, Helium.</p>  <p>I wish I had an answer. But the bizarre and short-lived TikTok ban, despite amounting to just a few hours of non-access, thoroughly disrupted my Sunday morning info consumption. So I’m not sure what the plot of anything is anymore.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But we have to start the search somewhere, so let’s start there. The original movement to ban TikTok in the US actually began as a Trump initiative to counter the influence of China. That was before he was convinced by Barron to leverage the platform for his reelection campaign by influencing young, male voters, an overwhelming majority of which overlap with the current online crypto communities. But at some point in there, it was co-opted by a foreign lobby with a lot to lose from millions of Americans getting together and criticizing the way they wage war, or influencing their access to American taxpayers’ funds.</p>  <p>As a dyed-in-the-wool data nerd, the argument that TikTok has too much access to consumer data feels off. The thesis goes that TikTok is a China-owned propaganda machine influencing American’s political positions. But that doesn’t entirely jive with the reality, which is that TikTok is banned in China (yes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1bg0xld/has_tiktok_been_banned_in_china/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=crypto-billionaire-in-chief">really</a>), based in Singapore, owned by private individuals from multiple countries, and has less access to data than the average American tech company.</p>  <p>But officially, it’s the data, not the influence, driving the ban. That’s because the data represents the inputs for TikTok’s algorithm, which I am 100% convinced is an unsupervised learning algo aimed at delivering you a personalized feed to maximize your session time by matching videos to your expressed preferences based on past viewing behaviors. This is something American social media companies simply can’t do, because it is not the most direct path to profitability. Instead, they are incentivized to favor the content that primes you to engage with ads, so they can make more money. But that in turn undermines their own usefulness and influence, which is why TikTok is eating their lunch.</p>  <p>The point being, in midst of a major sea change in crypto/online/American culture, only the fools are pretending like they have any clue where this is all going. The Convicts are whooping the Catholics (there’s a Miami in Ohio, and I’m a Wolverine), Zuck caught a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Jason/status/1881401274093940773?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=crypto-billionaire-in-chief">Dirty Sanchez</a>, Elon might have done a Nazi on his way to Mars, and Ross Albricht got a pardon. But at least we still have TikTok, for now, to compare notes.</p>  <p>We live in the most absurd timeline. Until next week.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

							         The Fartcoin Stage of the Market Cycle   <p>Much like swallowed air, legumes, and the human digestive tract can create some unholy alchemy, modern technology has led us to what Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn called “the ‘Fartcoin’ stage of the market cycle.”</p>  <p>Einhorn was talking about the traditional public markets. But in explaining how TradFi valuations had exceeded common sense levels and veered into the territory of absurd and groundless hype, he invoked the reigning champion of the memecoin space, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN).</p>  <p>On one level, Einhorn’s comparison was apt. Fartcoin’s appeal is in no way rooted in common sense. But it’s not inexplicable either. The shitcoin (shartcoin?) is one of several tokens propelled to prominence by the compatability of two new technologies: blockchain and AI. Typically, the best combos are more than the sum of their parts. And indeed, crypto and artificial intelligence together have the intangible “it” factor, creating value where logic might suggest there should be none.</p>  <p>Fartcoin’s value surged another 60% recently, one of the clearest indicators of just how powerful meme-based tokens can be when coupled with AI’s predictive and creative capabilities. Fartcoin’s originated as an AI chatbot’s idea of a joke, with every transaction triggering a fart noise. But it has become a phenomenon. And AI played a crucial role its origin story. By analyzing what types of humor and gimmicks get viral traction, the AI behind&nbsp;Fartcoin&nbsp;has created a memecoin that’s both ridiculously fun and primed for market dominance. The&nbsp;Fartcoin&nbsp;community isn’t just about trading — it’s about shared enjoyment, and that’s where the real value lies.</p>  <p>Elsewhere,&nbsp;Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE), an Ethereum-based memecoin, is bringing a unique twist to the scene by adding an element of utility — something that’s not always common in the meme world. The token has raised an astounding $48 million in presale funding, driven by the promise of empowering retail investors with access to exclusive trading signals and insights.</p>  <p>What sets $WEPE apart is how AI helps democratize trading, by analyzing market patterns and generating strategies that can give smaller traders a fighting chance against the whales. With its ability to process massive amounts of data, AI can offer predictions and strategies in real-time, leveling the playing field and turning meme coins like&nbsp;Wall Street Pepe&nbsp;into something more than just a joke. As AI continues to evolve in the crypto space, it could very well power more meme coins to add genuine value, far beyond the volatility of their initial hype.</p>  <p>Perhaps the most explosive example of AI’s potential in the memecoin world is the rise of&nbsp;iDEGEN. This controversial AI project has already raised over $16 million in presale funding, and its audacious, unfiltered approach to meme creation is turning heads. Created as a social experiment,&nbsp;iDEGEN&nbsp;was programmed to learn from the most deranged, unrestrained corners of crypto communities. Through its unorthodox approach — analyzing and adapting to the language and culture of “degens” — it has skyrocketed in popularity.</p>  <p>But not without a few stumbling blocks. iDEGEN was banned on X for “violent speech”. (That’s what you get for adapting the language of degens.) But it didn’t disappear. It exploded. Supporters launched a #freeiDEGEN campaign that sent presale numbers through the roof. The AI behind iDEGEN learns from user interactions, social media trends, and memetic warfare, creating content that resonates with the chaotic nature of crypto traders. In doing so, it has become the ultimate viral sensation, tapping into one of the most powerful memecoin catalysts: controversy.</p>  <p>Zooming out, we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in how meme coins are created, managed, and marketed. Traditionally, these coins were driven by human-created memes, influencers, or viral moments. Now, AI is taking the reins, analyzing social behavior, predicting trends, and even generating memes that resonate deeply with crypto’s unique culture. It’s not just about creating a coin that rides a wave of internet humor; AI is optimizing these coins to ride waves of market sentiment.</p>  <p>As AI continues to learn and adapt, the relationship between artificial intelligence and meme coins could be poised for significant growth. Unlike traditional projects, these AI-driven coins don’t just follow trends — they create them. The adaptability of AI, combined with the viral nature of memes, creates an ecosystem where anything is possible. From predictive trading to real-time market manipulation, the potential applications are enormous.</p>  <p>However, as AI begins to play a larger role in memecoin creation and management, the potential for manipulation and volatility increases.&nbsp;Fartcoin,&nbsp;Wall Street Pepe, and&nbsp;iDEGEN&nbsp;have all benefited from AI’s ability to predict, analyze, and generate content that speaks directly to the crypto crowd. But as the market matures, so too will the potential risks associated with these projects. AI will need to balance creativity with responsibility, ensuring that it’s not just fueling more speculative bubbles or scams.</p>  <p>In short, the future of AI-driven memecoins is both exciting and uncertain. Will they remain a fleeting trend, or will they become a mainstay of blockchain? Only time will tell, but one thing’s for sure: they’re here to stay, and they’re reshaping the landscape in ways we could have never predicted. So, while&nbsp;Fartcoin&nbsp;might have started as a joke, it’s a glimpse into the future where AI is not just analyzing the world, but creating new assets that reflect the wild, unpredictable nature of the blockchain.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>As we head into the new year, we are highlighting a few topics that are top of mind for Mastercard Open Banking, and how we see the Open Banking landscape evolving over the next 12-24 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 At a Glance&nbsp; 



 
 Open Banking adoption continues to gain traction across the globe – This is a result of increased consumer, merchant, and biller appetite, regulations, borrower demand for a digital mortgage experience, and an increase in account-to-account (A2A) payments usage. As momentum accelerates, there is more emphasis on safeguarding consumer information and protecting against fraud in Open Banking.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 A2A and alternative payment methods are increasing in usage all over the world – Open Banking enables a more seamless A2A experience, particularly in verticals like bill pay, disbursements, and recurring payments. However, there are some barriers that are preventing A2A from scaling.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Looking ahead, we see 4 key themes that are rising in importance in Open Banking – We anticipate that Open Banking will unlock opportunities for consumers and businesses to benefit from their data and allow companies to power next-generation personalized financial services by improving the financial experiences of small businesses, leveraging technology such as Generative AI which powers innovative new use cases (e.g., categorization, security/privacy), integrating closely with Real-time Payments (RTP), and enabling value-added services and personalization with the transition to Open Finance. 
 



<p>Mastercard’s strategy is centered on the trends we are seeing, where we think the Open Banking market is headed, and being a valued and trusted partner to our customers by enabling them to provide enhanced financial experiences to their end users.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 What we’re seeing in the market&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 
 Open Banking is on the rise around the world, driven by different tailwinds. Consumers want more automated and digitized ways to move money, to manage their finances (e.g., by viewing their financial data and unlocking actionable insights), and more transparency and control of their data. They are using Open Banking for topping up their investment accounts, funding their wallets, and applying for mortgages. Regulations, Open Banking players pushing forward innovative solutions, and the desire for seamless, enhanced financial experiences are all drivers of Open Banking. In Europe, <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/sustainability-financial-inclusion-consulting/insights/four-european-takes-open-banking">Open Banking use is expected to double by 2027</a> and in the UK, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">70% of consumers</a> connect their financial accounts directly to tools to conduct financial tasks. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">80% of consumers</a> also already link their financial accounts. Open Banking in Australia is still relatively nascent, but <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">89% of B2B users</a> report using Open Banking today. Brazil has been a trailblazer in Open Finance – there were 4.8B API calls in June 2023 in Brazil, <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/industries/financial-institutions/insights/open-banking-latin-america">four times the number of calls in the UK</a>. We are cognizant that as Open Banking matures, more and more markets will adopt and accelerate its usage. At Mastercard, market expansion opportunities are evaluated where there is greatest demand, and we will innovate and test concepts in markets that are maturing.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Regulations are changing the landscape for Open Banking. Open Banking regulations are at different stages in key global markets. While Europe and the UK were some of the first to introduce Open Banking regulation with the Payment Services Directive (PSD2) and later, Payment Services Regulation (PSR), other countries around the world are putting their own regulatory frameworks in place. For example, Canada’s Department of Finance (DoF) and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) are also working on elements of Open Banking regulation in the country. Several countries in Africa are adopting frameworks for Open Banking, and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are launching innovative measures to test Open Banking solutions. <a href="https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/industries/financial-institutions/insights/open-banking-latin-america">Mexico and Brazil led the way in Latin America</a> in establishing Open Banking regulations, with a particular focus on Open Finance and leveling the playing field between fintech startups and incumbent banks. We will continue to work across the ecosystem to support our customers, consumers and small businesses in navigating regulatory changes.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Borrower demand for digital mortgage experiences is increasing. Homebuyers in the U.S. are indicating that they are more interested in leveraging digital channels for mortgages. Those surveyed cited process acceleration (75%) and making the process easier (71%) as the <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/perspectives/opportunities-exist-offer-digital-verification-tools-more-homebuyers">top benefits of a digital mortgage process</a>. Open Banking is key to powering these experiences – it allows lenders to securely collect financial data digitally, conduct more comprehensive assessments of an applicant’s financial health, and make more informed loan decisions. To meet consumer demands and streamline the lending process, Mastercard has collaborated with U.S. government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/fannie-mae-single-source-mortgage-verification/">Fannie Mae</a> and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/in-the-news/freddie-mac-expands-digital-capabilities-to-help-lenders-reach-more-qualified-borrowers/">Freddie Mac</a> in connection with certain digital verification of asset, income and employment solutions. These new mortgage solutions are driving more demand for Open Banking and alternative data sources in lending.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 A2A payment flows are becoming a more common way to pay. While there are multiple payment options available to consumers and businesses today (credit cards, debit cards, BNPL, cash, etc.), A2A payments are the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/fututre-bill-payments-report/">second-most preferred payment choice</a> for bill payment in the U.S. and are increasingly being adopted worldwide. On a global level, <a href="https://offers.worldpayglobal.com/rs/850-JOA-856/images/TheGlobalPaymentsReport2024.pdf?_gl=1*cxjse5*_gcl_au*MTkzODM0NDcwLjE3MjM2NzAzMzQ.*_ga*MTU1MzQxOTEwNi4xNzIzNjcwMzM0*_ga_9HB8S1WFYN*MTcyMzY3MDMzMy4xLjEuMTcyMzY3MDM2Ni4wLjAuMA..">A2A payments for e-commerce are expected to grow</a> at a 14% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) through 2027. Government-led schemes for A2A are proliferating its usage in countries including India (Unified Payments Interface), Brazil (PIX) and Thailand (PromptPay). Open Banking-powered A2A payments can transform the A2A experience by making it a seamless and secure way to pay – in particular, we’re seeing Open Banking powered payments pick up in verticals like bill pay, disbursements, recurring payments – where paying by ACH (traditional A2A method) has already been popular in the U.S., for example. Recognizing this market demand, we are partnering with players like JPMC and Worldpay in the U.S. to scale A2A for their customers. We are also continuing to explore innovative solutions that would enable the scaling of A2A globally – for example, Mastercard’s approach to Open Banking helps protect the ecosystem to make OB-enabled A2A payments seamless and secure.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Fraud and identity risk are top of mind. While Open Banking will provide new opportunities, like with any exchange of personal data online, there are also risks. As more people use digital channels for financial experiences, there is the possibility for fraudsters to find new ways to attack businesses and consumers. It is estimated that the <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2025-cybersecurity-risk-privacy/">worldwide costs of cybercrimes</a> will reach $12T in 2025 and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">94% of consumers</a> surveyed say that it’s important that financial institutions keep consumer financial data secure. To ensure consumers feel safe using Open Banking and the experiences it powers, fraud mitigation plays a significant role – for example, leveraging identity verification and device intelligence at account opening, multi-factor authentication at sign in1, and predictive risk signals for payments. At Mastercard, we remain committed to maintaining best-in-class security and data privacy for our Open Banking assets. This is why we are leveraging our rich network of global identity insights and device verification, and integrating them with our Open Banking offering. We believe Open Banking and fraud mitigation will continue to go hand-in-hand as the ecosystem matures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Spotlight on A2A Trend&nbsp; 



 What are A2A Payments?&nbsp; 



 
 Account-to-Account (A2A) payments are electronic money transfers from one bank account to another.​ A2A payments can be initiated in two ways, either as a push payment — initiated by the party making the payment — or as a pull payment — initiated by the party collecting the payment. Many consumers already use A2A payments by simply sending money between their own bank accounts or transferring money to someone using platforms like PayPal or Cash App. The 4 main use cases for A2A are Bill Payments, Me2Me, Person to Merchant (P2M), and Person to Person (P2P):&nbsp; 
 







 Growth in A2A is being driven by a number of factors:&nbsp;&nbsp; 







 However, A2A payments are still experiencing some challenges to widespread adoption:&nbsp; 



 
 Suboptimal A2A checkout process:  A2A payment methods have either required consumers to input bank account numbers or login to their bank’s portal for each purchase, which can be time consuming and error prone. In countries where A2A has gotten more traction (e.g., India, Brazil), it has been primarily through QR code which is a suboptimal experience. &nbsp; 
 



 
 Inadequate consumer purchase protections compared to card:  Many A2A payment methods lack the same protections that card payments have, and that both consumers and merchants want.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Lack of trust: There is a lack of trust from some consumers towards A2A payments, because they have a familiarity with methods like credit and debit payments and are accustomed to their reliability and ubiquity.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Lack of scaled use by merchants: Merchants face certain risks with traditional A2A payments, including declines due to insufficient funds, unauthorized returns, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 How does Open Banking enhance A2A?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Without Open Banking: Traditional A2A is a clunky experience, as consumers need to either initiate bank transfers through their bank account directly or manually enter their banking account and routing number through a suboptimal checkout experience. In some markets, there is also limited transparency in payment settlement timing and risk of payment, for merchants/billers who are offering A2A to their customers. For example, merchants must manually verify customer bank accounts with micro-deposits, and there may be a multiple day delay for a successful A2A payment. Lastly, traditional A2A lacks the rich data insights to verify identity, and to prevent fraud/ non-sufficient funds returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 

 



 

 
 



<p>With Open Banking: Open Banking makes A2A payments seamless for consumers. Instead of the error-prone process of finding and manually entering account details – consumers can now leverage the latest technology to easily share their bank data. Powered by Open Banking, A2A payments can be made quickly, with extremely rich insights – such as account owner verification, balance checks, risk indicators, tokenization and fraud signals. In any market, Open Banking makes A2A payments easier, faster, and convenient. Additionally, Open Banking can help in the fight against fraud. For example, when a consumer initiates an account-based payment from their bank account, Mastercard enables account validation to confirm account ownership and validate identity details in real-time through Mastercard Open Banking, drawing on the safe exchange of <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/news/press/2024/april/mastercard-transforms-the-fight-against-scams-with-latest-ai-tech/">consumer-permissioned data</a> to facilitate frictionless and secure payments.&nbsp;</p>

 What will it take to make A2A payments more mainstream?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>We believe that there is a positive trajectory for A2A payments. For A2A adoption to scale in use cases like ecommerce, it is important that consumers feel as secure using A2A as they do with other payment methods. Consumers also prefer a more user-friendly and streamlined user experience which removes friction from the A2A journey. Merchants and digital players are looking to provide consumers with a range of payment options, so helping to integrate A2A payments into their existing platforms will improve merchant acceptance and be vital in adoption. Lastly, we believe the scaling of A2A payments will be contingent on value-added services, which leverage consumer data (with consent) to create a secure and seamless payments ecosystem. We believe Open Banking can power many of these enhancements to A2A, to help scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Looking Ahead&nbsp; 



<p>In addition to A2A, there are a number of market forces and themes that we think will be prominent in the Open Banking landscape over the next 12-24 months. A few are highlighted below –&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 There is untapped potential in Open Banking use cases for small businesses. We believe more small businesses will use Open Banking to easily and safely share their banking information, paving the way for an easier lending process and customized financial recommendations to help them with their cashflow.  <a href="http://finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking">92% of businesses surveyed</a> believe that it is somewhat to very important to have the latest technology for risk decisioning and credit scoring. Mastercard already offers a comprehensive solution set for small businesses – including real-time business account data, rich cash flow and balance analytics, smarter credit decisioning, etc. and we are continuing to enhance based on what is priority for <a href="http://finicity.com/business">SMBs</a>.3&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Use cases for AI in Open Banking will continue to evolve, enabling more personalized financial services experiences. For example, Generative AI can power financial assistants that can make investment recommendations, help with data categorization to give a comprehensive picture of finances, enable more inclusive lending processes, as well as power smarter payments systems with predictive capabilities. We believe AI is a powerful tool for Open Banking, and this is why we’ve been leveraging it to categorize and extract insights from transaction data, which feed into downstream AI models that power our <a href="https://openbankingeu.mastercard.com/blog/ai-and-open-banking-a-powerful-duo/">payments and lending solutions</a>. We’ve also partnered with players like bunq, the second largest neobank in Europe, to <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en/newsroom/press-releases/en/2024/bunq-first-bank-in-europe-to-leverage-ai-in-open-banking-with-mastercard/">power spending insights for users – leveraging AI</a>. However, we recognize that data transparency, security, and protecting against bias will become even more important, as Open Banking and AI are intertwined to solve for new and innovative use cases.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Real-time payments (RTP) will accelerate, led by the launch of FedNow in the U.S., and the SEPA Instant Payments Mandate in Europe. RTP has already seen strong success in other countries around the world like PIX in Brazil, UPI in India, etc. For consumers, RTP provides the option for swifter bill payments and near instant payouts, especially important for gig economy workers. Businesses are afforded faster settlements, improved payroll, and reduced disputes due to more efficient reconciliation and refunds. Bank adoption and use of RTP rails in the U.S. are still emerging, due to issues such as coverage/interoperability, irrevocable funds, and fraud risk. ​However, government pushes for RTP in Europe and the U.S. may catalyze adoption. Open Banking providers have an opportunity to build out use cases that accommodate RTP and mitigate the fraud risks that come with it. For example, Open Banking can provide risk insights and recommendations around the timing of payment and rail choice. In the U.S., Mastercard Open Banking is providing merchants, fintechs and banks rail agnostic risk signals, enabling payment decisioning across payment methods, and supporting consumer choice and flexible merchant usage.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Open Banking will move towards Open Finance, as more expansive datasets are used to offer more personalized and actionable insights and value-added services for consumers. Open Finance moves beyond Open Banking by covering more financial data inputs (e.g., payroll, insurance, investment/brokerage data). The European Commission is working to establish an Open Finance framework that would outline clear rights and obligations to manage customer data sharing in the financial sector beyond payment accounts. In Australia, the CDR is expanding to Open Finance with non-bank lenders and BNPL product providers set to be brought into scope in early 2025 (with first compliance obligations to commence in mid-2026). We believe regulation and consumer demand will serve as a foundation for the expansion into Open Finance, and will create further innovation for services like employee benefits, wealth advisory, etc. Mastercard is already supporting Open Finance in the U.S. – we have connections to payroll and investment data, as well as mortgage data and auto loan data, and are continuing to expand datasets. &nbsp;

			<p>Luxembourg, 21 January 2025 – <a href="https://www.fasanara.com/">Fasanara Capital Ltd</a> (“Fasanara”), a London-based institutional investment manager and global leader in digital finance with over $4 billion in assets under management, has launched its first tokenized Money Market Fund, the “Fasanara MMF Token” (“FAST”), held on the <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> PoS (Proof of Stake) public blockchain. Developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group</a>, <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a>, <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/">Fireblocks</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbto.com/">XBTO</a>, FAST offers investors a faster, more cost-effective, and transparent way to access money market investments.</p>
<p>FAST integrates the stability of traditional money market investments with the operational efficiency of blockchain technology. By leveraging Polygon’s scalable infrastructure, FAST enables real-time settlement and open distribution, eliminating manual processes and broadening investor access. This digital approach streamlines subscriptions, redemptions, and ongoing fund management, providing investors with a seamless investment experience.</p>

		 
	 
    With FAST, we are not only reshaping the future of money market investments but also redefining how investors engage with financial markets. By harnessing blockchain technology, we provide an innovative and compliant investment solution that enables seamless access to liquidity, real-time processing, and enhanced transparency – all while maintaining the rigor of traditional asset management practices.  Francesco FiliaFounder and CEO of Fasanara    
	 
		 
			<p>The launch of Fasanara’s first tokenized Money Market Fund represents a significant milestone for the firm, positioning it as a pioneer in technology-enabled investing. Through FAST, Fasanara is not only modernizing fund management but also setting a new benchmark for digital innovation in asset management. By tokenizing a stable asset class like a money market fund, Fasanara aims to redefine how investors engage with these investments, making them more accessible and adaptable to today’s digital-first economy.</p>
<p>FAST is structured using ERC-3643 smart contracts, ensuring regulatory compliance and operational flexibility at the token level.

<p></p>



<p>Many US business managers believe that if their operations are strictly domestic, they don’t need to worry about global sanctions, PEP (Politically Exposed Person) screening, or AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance. This assumption may seem logical, but it’s a myth that can lead to serious consequences.</p>



<p>Let’s break down the common myths and set the record straight on why global screening matters—even for businesses that only operate within the US.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #1: If My Business Is Domestic, I Don’t Need Global Screening</p>



<p>Fact: Even if you only serve US customers, their connections might not stop at the border. A customer or vendor could have ownership ties to a sanctioned individual overseas, or they might be based in a high-risk jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Without global screening, these connections can easily slip through unnoticed, leaving your business vulnerable to regulatory penalties and reputational harm.</p>



<p>For example, imagine processing a payment for a US-based entity, only to discover later that it’s controlled by a sanctioned party in another country. The consequences? Fines, investigations, potential jail time, not to mention – a major and longstanding hit to your company’s reputation.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #2: US Regulators Only Care About Domestic Compliance</p>



<p>Fact: US regulators like OFAC and FinCEN expect businesses to monitor global connections. They understand how intertwined the world is today and require you to screen for international risks.</p>



<p>Neglecting global compliance can result in steep fines and even loss of operating licenses. Worse, it can damage your relationships with partners and customers. Staying ahead of these expectations is key to avoiding regulatory pitfalls.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #3: Global Screening Is Too Complicated</p>



<p>Fact: While global sanctions lists and PEP databases are complex, advanced tools make screening manageable. Platforms like iComply provide real-time access to global data, automating much of the heavy lifting.</p>



<p>These tools identify hidden risks, such as complex corporate structures designed to obscure ties to high-risk individuals or sanctioned entities. With the right technology, global compliance becomes a streamlined process that protects your business and saves time.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Myth #4: Global Coverage Only Matters for Multinational Companies</p>



<p>Fact: Even small businesses can benefit from global screening. Suppose you’re a US-based firm working with a foreign supplier. If that supplier has ties to financial crime or sanctions violations, your business could be held accountable.</p>



<p>By implementing global screening now, you safeguard your operations and build a foundation for growth. Plus, when it’s time to expand into international markets, your compliance framework will already be in place.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Role of Technology in Global Compliance</p>



<p>Managing global compliance manually is a daunting task, but technology makes it easier. iComply’s platform provides:</p>



 
 Real-time global data for sanctions and PEP screening. 



 Robust tools to uncover hidden risks in complex ownership structures. 



 Automated workflows to streamline screening, refresh, and review processes. 
 



<p>These tools help businesses like yours stay compliant, efficient, and ready for growth.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Bottom Line</p>



<p>In today’s interconnected world, no US business is truly isolated from global risks. Whether it’s sanctions screening, PEP monitoring, or AML compliance, adopting a global perspective is essential for protecting your operations and building a sustainable future.</p>



<p>By busting the myths and embracing the realities of global compliance, your business can avoid pitfalls, earn trust, and thrive in a competitive marketplace.</p>

 Learn how to transform avatars with advanced AI for lifelike interactions in gaming, customer service, and virtual spaces 



<p>Non-playable characters (NPCs) are an essential element in video games. They are vital to making your digital universe feel realistic and serve as companions for the players. However, creating these virtual characters has always been a challenging and time-consuming task. But now, things are changing for the better.</p>



<p>Thanks to Union Avatars and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a>, the process of creating NPCs is easier than ever.</p>



<p>These tools are revolutionizing the manner we design and animate our virtual characters, bringing them to life and making them more realistic and engaging. Thus, if you’re a game developer looking to enhance your game’s interactive experience, these tools are a game-changer. They not only streamline the character creation process but also save you a ton of time and effort. Are you ready to bring your virtual world to life like never before?</p>



 

 



<p>What is NVIDIA ACE?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a> is a suite of advanced AI technologies designed to bring digital humans and avatars to life. Leveraging generative AI, ACE enables the creation of highly interactive and realistic characters for various applications, including gaming, customer service, and virtual environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace">NVIDIA ACE</a>, developers can integrate state-of-the-art models for speech recognition, natural language processing, and facial animation, allowing for dynamic and unscripted interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs) and avatars. This technology not only enhances the immersion and interactivity of digital experiences but also provides flexible deployment options, making it accessible for both cloud-based and local implementations.</p>



<p>Powering Union Avatars through NVIDIA ACE</p>



<p>To bring to life one of our avatars, we built a simple application based on microservices that provide intelligence, voice, and facial animation to the character. We used OpenAI and <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">ElevenLabs</a> for text and speech generation and NVIDIA ACE to generate facial animations and to provide lip sync. Then, everything is rendered by Unreal Engine 5 in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following figure is a process diagram showing what happens each time the user sends a message to the avatar:</p>







<p>NVIDIA ACE Plugin for Unreal Engine</p>



<p>The <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace/get-started/">NVIDIA ACE plugin </a>allows your Unreal Engine application to communicate with NVIDIA ACE services. The ACE Plugin supports <a href="https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/audio2face">NVIDIA Audio2Face</a> (minimum v1.0) to animate your character by sending to the service voice the audio you provide and it sends back the corresponding animation data.</p>



<p>ARKit standard:&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ARKit blend shape standard is predefined facial expressions and movements used to animate 3D characters based on real-time facial tracking data. In Union Avatars these keys are always available, so avatars can replicate a wide range of facial expressions, from subtle eye movements to complex mouth shapes. NVIDIA Audio2Face will generate the animation using this standard, so our avatars can be used out-of-the-box without further tweaking.</p>







<p>Text and speech generation:</p>



<p>To provide the avatar with response generation we are using GPT-4o, one of the most advanced LLMs available. By providing some extra context we can give the avatar a background, and some information relevant to the user.</p>



<p><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction">https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction</a></p>



<p>To generate the speech, we feed the text generated by GPT into a custom voice in Eleven Labs.</p>



<p><a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/introduction">https://elevenlabs.io/docs/introduction</a></p>



<p>Custom REST API:</p>



<p>To easily handle all these requests, we built a custom REST API in Python to centralize all the different tasks into a single call. By calling the endpoint /response we can generate a reply, synthesize the speech, and start the ACE A2F stream.</p>



<p>Connecting Union Avatars and ACE Step by step:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Download your avatar from Union Avatars
 
 Make sure to download it with blendshapes

<p>The terminology swirling around the world of digital identity can be overwhelming. Are we talking about verifiable credentials? Digital credentials? What about verifiable digital credentials? Do these terms have profound technical distinctions? Barely (though I suspect some of the more deeply engaged individuals may disagree). The nuances mostly arise from standards politics, the English language, and some good old-fashioned product marketing.</p>



 The Birth of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) 



<p>In 2017, the W3C Verifiable Credentials working group was formed to define a framework for sharing and verifying digital claims. They published the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1 in 2019, and version 2 is now in the Candidate Recommendation stage. The W3C defines a verifiable credential as: “A tamper-evident credential whose authorship can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verifiable.”</p>



<p>As the term “Verifiable Credentials” gained traction, other organizations started exploring similar ideas for digital credentials that could be cryptographically verified. As you might expect, they sought to avoid confusion with the W3C’s model and put their own stamp on things, which has led us to these to terminology shifts.</p>



 Terminology Overlap in Standards and Marketing 



<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">IETF Secure Patterns for Internet Credentials</a> (SPICE) working group and the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials">WICG Digital Credentials API project</a> chose to call their work “digital credentials.” According to the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credential API</a>, a digital credential is: “A cryptographically signed digital document containing one or more claims made by an issuer about one or more subjects.”</p>



<p>While clear and concise, this term lacks the specificity needed to encompass the complexities involved. SPICE WG adds further nuance, defining a digital credential as: “A digital credential expresses claims about a subject and links them with cryptographic keys. Some sets of claim names have already been defined by the IETF and other standards development groups (e.g., OpenID Foundation).”</p>



<p>Recognizing this, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently adopted the term <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem">Verifiable Digital Credentials</a> (VDCs) to bridge the gap between descriptive clarity and brevity. NIST defines VDCs as: “A cryptographically verifiable, digital representation of a credential or attributes secured in a dedicated application, often referred to as a digital wallet.” NIST is careful not to promote any specific solution or organization, so they’ve had to be particularly careful in selecting a term that is market-neutral.</p>



 A Tale of Media Types and Standards Conflicts 



<p>So, knowing there is confusion in the terminology is one thing. Let’s look at how that actually plays out in standards development.</p>



<p>The OAuth working group meeting at <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/session/oauth">IETF 121</a> highlighted historical and technical challenges with defining and typing credentials. Brian Campbell presented a session on “SD-JWT and SD-JWT VC,” which included a truly excellent perspective on the history that led to some of this confusion; you should watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvIBqlHkuXY">recording</a>.</p>



 
 JWS/JWE/JWT:
 
 JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) initially included type headers and media types to describe payloads. However, their utility for typing was minimal, as the data type could often be inferred by parsing the payload. 



 The IETF introduced explicit typing for tokens, such as application/at+jwt for access tokens, to clarify expectations for processing. 
 
 
 



 
 Verifiable Credentials:
 
 The term originated from W3C but was perceived as inaccessible by some. 



 A key debate arose around JSON-LD (a JSON-based format for Linked Data). While JSON-LD wasn’t initially mandatory, it later became a requirement for compliance with the W3C VC data model, leading some groups to pursue simpler alternatives within the IETF. 
 
 
 



 Media Type Conflicts 



<p>The overlapping work between the W3C and IETF led to conflicts in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">media type</a> registries; it’s basically a functional example of how definitions and politics impact standards development. In this case, the W3C registered media types like vc+ld+json+sd-jwt, while the IETF sought to define types for SD-JWT VCs (Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens). This duplicity caused confusion and poses a threat to interoperability.</p>



<p>Don’t get too anxious about this example; working group participants did figure out a potential path forward. What people in the know will refer to as “the Dublin Proposal,” the group agreed to recommend a new media type, dc+sd-jwt, for SD-JWT VCs and tighten the scope and accelerate the timeline for relevant RFCs to make sure their position is solidly established.</p>



 The Challenge of Naming Things 



<p>Naming things is one of the <a href="https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/">two hardest problems</a> in computer science. Where we are with digital credentials that can be verified is reflected in terminology confusion for all sorts of things throughout the industry. <a href="https://idpro.org">IDPro®</a>, a professional organization for identity practitioners, has a freely available <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge">Body of Knowledge</a> (full disclosure: I’m the principal editor for that work) that includes a <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/41/">consolidated terminology</a> document. The terminology includes definitions from every article in the BoK, resulting in multiple definitions for even basic terms like “authentication.” It’s like we are compelled to make things difficult for ourselves.</p>



<p>For identity professionals, here’s my suggestion: always clearly define your terms. This could mean explicitly referencing a specification that outlines the definition you’re using or providing your own definition if no clear standard exists. Even in code, include comments clarifying which model or framework you’re adhering to.</p>



<p>For product marketers, I get the need to differentiate your solutions, but it will be much more compelling if you indicate you are standards’ compliant AND what standards you are compliant with. It may result in more words, but those words will help your customers have a much better sense of what you’re offering. Educated customers are the best.</p>



<p>If you’d like to read more about how some of the digital credential protocols differ, I have a few posts from last year which might be of interest:</p>

<p>The Top Cybersecurity Threats of 2025 and How to Protect Yourself</p>



<p>Imagine logging into your favorite e-commerce site only to discover that your account has been compromised. Even worse, the breach wasn’t your fault—it was the result of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that dominate our digital age. In 2025, cyberattacks are evolving faster than ever, with new tactics and technologies putting individuals and organizations at risk. Here’s a look at the top threats and actionable steps you can take to protect yourself.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Rise of Advanced Phishing Techniques</p>



<p>Phishing remains a cornerstone of cybercrime, but the 2025 version is far more advanced. Threat actors are leveraging generative AI to create hyper-realistic phishing emails, complete with personalized details and convincing logos. Variants like vishing (voice phishing) and quishing (phishing using malicious QR codes) are also becoming more prevalent. Cybercriminals now have the ability to spoof voice or video content, adding a layer of deception that even the savviest users may find challenging to detect.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Verify Links: Hover over URLs before clicking to confirm their legitimacy. 



 Be Skeptical: If an offer or request feels too urgent or too good to be true, verify it directly through a trusted contact or platform. 



 Invest in Training: Regular phishing simulations and awareness campaigns can help you and your organization stay vigilant. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Deepfake Manipulation</p>



<p>Deepfake technology, once a novelty, has matured into a powerful tool for deception. Threat actors use AI-generated videos and voice clips to impersonate trusted individuals or executives, gaining access to sensitive data or initiating fraudulent transactions. This technology is particularly dangerous in the context of spear phishing, where a single high-value target can compromise an entire organization.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Authenticate Communications: Establish multi-factor verification methods, such as requiring verbal confirmation of sensitive requests. 



 Utilize Detection Tools: AI-powered tools can help identify manipulated audio and video content. 



 Limit Personal Data Sharing: Reduce the amount of information shared on social media, which can be used to tailor convincing deepfake attacks. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Ransomware Evolution</p>



<p>Ransomware is no longer just about encrypting data. In 2025, attackers are doubling down on double extortion tactics: threatening to publicly release sensitive data if ransom demands aren’t met. Additionally, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platforms make it easier for novice hackers to launch devastating attacks, democratizing cybercrime.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Regular Backups: Keep backups of critical data in secure, offline storage. 



 Patch Vulnerabilities: Ensure your software and systems are always updated to prevent exploitation of known weaknesses. 



 Adopt Zero-Trust Policies: Limit access to sensitive data and systems based on strict verification protocols. 
 



<p></p>



<p>IoT and Smart Device Exploitation</p>



<p>As homes and workplaces become more connected, the Internet of Things (IoT) introduces new vulnerabilities. Unsecured smart devices—from thermostats to security cameras—are being exploited to launch attacks or infiltrate networks. Attackers also exploit hardware manipulation techniques to bypass security measures.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Secure Devices: Use strong, unique passwords for IoT devices and change default settings. 



 Network Segmentation: Keep IoT devices on separate networks from critical systems. 



 Monitor Activity: Employ tools that can detect unusual behavior across connected devices. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Generative AI Exploits</p>



<p>Generative AI presents dual-edged capabilities in cybersecurity. While it aids in detecting threats, it also empowers cybercriminals to automate attacks, craft convincing fake identities, and develop sophisticated malware. AI-generated phishing emails or malicious code can now be created in seconds, making it imperative to bolster defenses.</p>



<p>What You Can Do:</p>



 
 Deploy AI Defenses: Invest in AI-driven cybersecurity tools to proactively detect and mitigate threats. 



 Set Usage Policies: Restrict the use of generative AI in ways that could inadvertently expose sensitive data. 



 Train Employees: Ensure staff understand the risks and ethical considerations of AI in the workplace.

<p>Ever wonder how big companies stay ahead of financial risks or keep their costs low despite market chaos? The answer often lies in a powerful financial tool called a swap. Swaps are like behind-the-scenes deals where two parties agree to trade cash flows or assets to manage risks and seize financial opportunities. Whether it’s dodging interest rate spikes or shielding against currency swings, swaps give businesses the flexibility they need to stay competitive. What is Swap? Let’s dive into the world of swaps and discover how they quietly drive smart financial decisions across industries.</p>

 What is Swap? 



<p>What is Swap? A swap is a financial agreement where two parties agree to exchange cash flows or financial assets over a set period. This exchange usually helps businesses manage financial risks, like changing interest rates or currency values, and can also help lower costs. For example, two companies might agree to swap payments—one pays a fixed interest rate while the other pays a floating rate. This lets each company balance its financial plans with market conditions.</p>



<p>Swaps are flexible and can be customized to meet the specific needs of both sides. They’re commonly used by big companies and financial institutions to protect themselves from market changes or to access new financial opportunities.</p>



<p>However, most swaps are private deals (called over-the-counter or OTC contracts), meaning they aren’t traded on public markets. This makes them more flexible but also riskier since each party must trust the other to stick to the deal.</p>



<p>Overall, swaps are powerful tools in finance, helping businesses manage risks and make smarter financial decisions.</p>

 How does Swap work? 



<p>After learning “What is Swap?”, we should have a look at how it woks. A swap works as a financial agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows or assets over a specific period, based on pre-agreed terms. The main goal is to help both sides manage financial risks, such as interest rate fluctuations or currency volatility, and sometimes to lower borrowing costs.</p>



<p>Here’s a simple breakdown of how swaps work:</p>



 
 Initial Agreement:<br> Both parties agree on the contract terms, which include the notional amount (the underlying amount used to calculate payments), the type of interest rates (fixed or floating), payment frequency, and the contract’s duration. 



 Cash Flow Exchange:<br> Throughout the contract, the parties regularly exchange payments as outlined in the agreement. For instance, in an interest rate swap, one party might pay a fixed rate while receiving payments based on a floating rate from the other side. 



 Contract Completion:<br> When the swap ends, both sides fulfill any remaining payment obligations. In some swaps, the original principal amounts are exchanged back at this stage. 
 


 
 


 5 Popular Types of Swap Contracts 



 Interest Rate Swap (IRS) 



<p>An Interest Rate Swap (IRS) is a financial agreement between two parties to exchange interest payments on a notional principal amount. Typically, one party pays a fixed interest rate while the other pays a floating rate. The primary goal is to manage interest rate risk and optimize financial costs.</p>



<p>Key Features:</p>



 
 Notional Principal: Used to calculate interest payments but isn’t actually exchanged. 



 Payment Structure: Interest payments are exchanged periodically—monthly, quarterly, or annually—based on the agreed fixed or floating rate. 



 Flexible Duration: Contracts usually last from 1 to 5 years, depending on the agreement. 



 Effective Risk Management: Helps companies stabilize borrowing costs or maximize investment returns by reducing exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 



 Cost Savings: Allows parties to capitalize on market interest rate differences to lower financial expenses. 



 Financial Flexibility: Supports organizations in adjusting debt or asset interest structures to fit their financial strategies. 
 



<p>Interest rate swaps are widely used by corporations, banks, and investors to manage debt risks and take advantage of changing market rates.</p>


 
 


 Currency Swap Contract 



<p>A Currency Swap Contract is a financial agreement between two parties to exchange principal amounts and interest payments in different currencies. In this arrangement, each party receives a principal amount and pays interest in one currency while simultaneously paying the principal and interest in another currency.</p>



<p>Key Features:</p>



 
 Principal Exchange: Both parties exchange principal amounts at an agreed-upon exchange rate at the start of the contract and reverse the exchange when the contract matures. 



 Interest Payments: Throughout the contract term, both parties make periodic interest payments on the exchanged principal. These interest rates can be either fixed or floating, depending on the agreement. 



 Combination with Interest Rate Swaps: In markets like Vietnam, currency swaps are often combined with interest rate swaps to enhance financial risk management. 



 Risk Management Tool: Currency swaps are crucial for managing foreign exchange risk, optimizing borrowing costs, and leveraging interest rate differences between global markets. 
 



<p>Currency swaps are widely used by multinational corporations and financial institutions to hedge against currency fluctuations and secure more favorable borrowing terms in foreign markets. This flexibility allows companies to access foreign capital while minimizing exposure to volatile exchange rates.</p>



 Credit Default Swap (CDS) Contract 



<p>A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial agreement where the buyer of the contract pays periodic fees to the seller in exchange for protection against the risk of a debt issuer (such as a corporation or government) defaulting on its obligations. Essentially, a CDS acts like insurance for loans or bonds, providing a safety net in case of credit events.</p>



<p>Key Features:</p>



 
 Regular Premium Payments: The CDS buyer pays regular premiums to the seller throughout the contract term, similar to paying insurance premiums. 



 Payout on Credit Events: If the debt issuer defaults or experiences a credit event (like bankruptcy or missed payments), the CDS seller compensates the buyer for part or all of the loss. 



 No Need to Own the Debt: Buyers of a CDS don’t need to own the underlying debt or bonds to purchase protection, allowing more flexibility in risk management. 



 High Liquidity: CDS contracts can be traded on secondary markets, enabling investors to easily buy or sell protection as market conditions change. 



 Counterparty Risk: If the CDS seller defaults, the buyer might not receive the promised payout, introducing potential counterparty risk. 
 



<p>CDS contracts are vital tools for managing credit risk, especially in volatile markets. They allow investors and financial institutions to hedge against potential defaults while also offering speculative opportunities for those willing to take on risk. However, the 2008 financial crisis highlighted how excessive use of CDS without proper risk controls can contribute to systemic financial instability.</p>


 
 


 Commodity Swap Contract 



<p>A Commodity Swap is a financial agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows based on the price of a specific commodity. In this contract, one party agrees to pay a fixed price for the commodity, while the other pays a variable amount tied to the market price. Common commodities involved in these swaps include crude oil, natural gas, metals, agricultural products, and other raw materials.</p>



<p>Key Features:</p>



 
 No Physical Delivery: The agreement involves only cash settlements based on price differences—no physical exchange of the actual commodity occurs. 



 Price Risk Hedging: Commodity swaps help businesses stabilize production costs or secure profits despite volatile commodity prices. This is especially valuable for industries heavily reliant on raw materials. 



 Scheduled Payments: Payments are made at agreed intervals—monthly, quarterly, or based on other predefined periods—allowing predictable cash flow management. 



 Flexible Applications: Commodity swaps are widely used by producers, suppliers, and investors looking to hedge against price fluctuations or speculate on market trends. 



 Financial Optimization: By locking in commodity prices, businesses can better plan budgets and safeguard profit margins, enhancing overall financial stability. 
 



<p>Commodity swaps are essential for industries facing unpredictable market prices, offering a strategic tool to manage risks and improve financial planning. For example, an airline company might use a commodity swap to fix fuel costs, protecting itself from sudden spikes in oil prices, while commodity traders may use these swaps to speculate on future price movements without handling physical goods.</p>



 Equity Swap Contract 



<p>An Equity Swap is a financial agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows based on the performance of a specific stock or stock index. In this contract, one party pays returns linked to the performance of a stock or index, while the other pays a fixed or floating interest rate. This tool allows investors to gain exposure to equity markets without directly owning the underlying stocks.</p>



<p>Key Features:</p>



 
 No Ownership Required: Participants can benefit from stock price movements without actually buying or holding the underlying shares. 



 Risk Hedging: Equity swaps help investors and financial institutions protect their portfolios from stock price volatility. 



 Tax Efficiency: Some investors use equity swaps to minimize tax liabilities associated with direct stock trading, depending on jurisdiction. 



 Regular Payments: Cash flows are exchanged at agreed intervals (quarterly, annually) based on the performance of the underlying asset. 



 Investment Flexibility: Investors can easily access various equity markets worldwide without facing legal or trading restrictions. 
 



<p>Equity swaps are powerful tools for diversifying investment portfolios, optimizing returns, and managing risks in the stock market. For example, a hedge fund might use an equity swap to gain exposure to foreign stock indices without dealing with international trading regulations, while a bank could hedge its stock holdings against potential losses.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>What is Swap? Swaps might seem complex at first glance, but they’re vital tools that help businesses stay agile in unpredictable markets. From managing interest rates to protecting against currency shifts, swaps empower companies to control risks and sharpen their financial strategies. Whether you’re a business leader, an investor, or just curious about how financial markets tick, understanding swaps opens up a world of possibilities. In today’s fast-moving economy, knowing ‘what is swap?’ and how swaps work isn’t just smart—it’s essential.</p>

<p>Ethereum is a powerful platform that makes it easy to create decentralized applications (DApps). These apps run on blockchain technology, which means they are secure, transparent, and not controlled by a single company. Ethereum has become a leader in this space, offering exciting ways for people to manage their money and use digital services. In this blog, we’ll introduce you to the top 5 new Ethereum DApps you should try and explain why they are popular and useful.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/what-are-dapps-and-why-are-they-important-in-web3/">What Are Dapps and Why Are They Important in Web3?</a> </p>



 What are Ethereum Dapps? 



<p>A Decentralized Application (DApp) is an app that runs on a blockchain network instead of being controlled by a single company or server. This makes DApps more secure, transparent, and independent than regular apps. When you use a DApp, your information is stored on the blockchain and checked by many computers (called nodes), not just one system.</p>



<p>DApps can be used for many things, like sending money (DeFi), playing games, tracking products in supply chains, voting, and creating digital art (NFTs). They work using smart contracts—computer programs that automatically do tasks when certain conditions are met. Once a smart contract is added to the blockchain, it’s very hard to change or remove, so the DApp can keep working even if its creators stop supporting it.</p>



<p>To use a DApp on Ethereum, you need a crypto wallet (like Herond Wallet) and some ETH to pay for transactions. DApps are changing how businesses work and creating new ways for people to use technology.</p>

<p>With our bleeding-edge <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release</a> of the Anonyome Labs decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;just coming hot off the press, we’re excited to announce that we’ve already pushed the version 3.1 release out the door, packing new features to enhance the SDK even more.</p>



<p>As a refresher, our DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;lets our customers easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications. The DI <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;is a native SDK for both iOS and Android and notably does not rely on any third-party frameworks such as JavaScript frameworks.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release</a> primarily brought in European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) aligned standards, such as OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>) and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>. Our 3.1 release continues this trajectory by adding support for the modern industry-leading DI trust infrastructure, <a href="https://cheqd.io/">Cheqd</a>.</p>



 Consumers now have more choice of decentralized and scalable infrastructure to underpin their DI operations 



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide cryptographic infrastructure to many of the credential formats in the DI ecosystem. As such, it’s crucial that Anonyome supports a wide range of DID types (methods), so our customers can choose the best method for their use case.</p>



<p>Within the 3.1 release of the mobile wallet SDK, we bundle in new support for resolving three DID methods that are gaining mass adoption: <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">Cheqd</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">Web</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">JWK</a>.</p>



<p>With this integration, consumers now have more options for a decentralized and scalable infrastructure to support their DI operations. This is particularly timely because Sovrin, one of the original DI ledgers our edge agent supported, unfortunately <a href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=b2c2f50b93f0ad7684f55ccde&amp;id=97dcc86838">announced it will probably end operations in 2025</a>. Cheqd is a comparable modern alternative.</p>



<p>We’ve also added support for the <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/advanced/anoncreds">Cheqd Anoncred method</a>, allowing the mobile wallet SDK to receive <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncred</a>-formatted VCs, in addition to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCDM</a> VCs, secured by Cheqd Trust Infrastructure. This work is in tandem with <a href="https://cheqd.io/blog/expanding-cheqd-into-aca-py/">Cheqd’s recent efforts in ACA-Py</a>, which allows ACA-Py cloud agents to issue and verify VCs backed by Cheqd.</p>



<p>As usual, we’ve actively tested our SDK solution against the issuer and verifier open source software in the DI ecosystem, <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy">ACA-Py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts">Credo-ts</a>, to ensure we remain interoperable with other agents.</p>



<p>Best of all, Anonyome has open sourced these new DID resolvers within VCX, a codebase we <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/aries-vcx-anonyomes-commitment-to-decentralized-identity/">contribute to and maintain</a>.</p>



 Where to next? 



<p>We are excited to have checked off these new DID suites from the roadmap outlined in our recent <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release announcement</a>. Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue the features on that roadmap, including enhancements to the OpenID4VC protocol suite—particularly as OpenID approaches 1.0 releases of these standards—and the ongoing expansion of DID methods, such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh">did:webvh</a> (formerly did:tdw).</p>



<p>What’s more, we are actively developing a security enhancement to allow SDK consumers to leverage hardware security modules (HSMs), such as those built into modern mobile phones, for performing the cryptography that secures their DI use cases. This feature is in alignment with EUDI regulations, which you can <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/can-an-existing-digital-identity-wallet-leverage-a-hardware-security-module-to-meet-new-eu-standards/">read more about here</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our next DI mobile wallet SDK announcement.</p>



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ business solution&nbsp;combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of enterprise-ready APIs and SDKs, so you can quickly build and deploy next-generation privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity apps to help your customers communicate privately, navigate online safely, and transact securely in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Supreme Court to Decide Proper Legal Standard for Texas Pornography Age-Verification Law</p>



<p>The Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of Texas’ 2023 age-verification law for pornography websites, which requires “reasonable age verification methods” for content harmful to minors. Opponents, including the Free Speech Coalition, argue it infringes on adults’ First Amendment rights and raises privacy concerns through mandatory digital or government ID checks. A district court blocked the law using “strict scrutiny,” but the 5th Circuit reversed, applying “rational-basis review” and allowing it to take effect. The Supreme Court will decide whether strict scrutiny applies, potentially sending the case back for reconsideration, or affirm the 5th Circuit’s decision. The Biden administration supports strict scrutiny while acknowledging states’ ability to protect children online. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-texas-age-verification-requirement-for-pornography-websites/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz---1apKUxqEpEnfTmIDCjzWnTl4IRukl24nGNbF5aa7-unlxUvUxCv4guLPhUGtiu7yJecm">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Proposes Ban on Ransomware Payments for Public Sector and Critical Infrastructure</p>



<p>The U.K. government has proposed banning public sector and critical infrastructure organizations from paying ransomware demands to deter cybercriminals. The move follows major attacks, such as one on the NHS that disrupted patient care. The proposal includes mandatory reporting of ransomware incidents and safeguards to prevent payments to sanctioned entities. The National Cyber Security Center reports a rise in ransomware attacks, often by Russia-linked groups targeting critical infrastructure. A public consultation on the proposals runs until April 2025, though there are no immediate plans to present the measures to Parliament. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uk-plans-to-ban-public-sector-organizations-from-paying-ransomware-hackers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_0riV7lddUMqCzcf1sEWmwvCz8CtwM3dOvcz4IRJssiVgB1Iy0jHS4uRLncXSbbwzrm-s">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>U.S. Disrupts Chinese State-Backed Hacking Campaign Using PlugX Malware</p>



<p>U.S. authorities have disrupted a Chinese state-backed hacking group, “Twill Typhoon” (aka “Mustang Panda”), which used the malware “PlugX” to infiltrate millions of computers worldwide in a long-term espionage campaign. On January 9, 2025, the Department of Justice revealed that, with court approval, the FBI removed PlugX malware from thousands of U.S. systems during an August 2024 operation led by French authorities with support from cybersecurity firm Sekoia. Active since 2014, PlugX, often installed via USB ports, was used to steal sensitive files, targeting European shipping firms, Indo-Pacific governments, and Chinese dissident groups. Despite allegations of funding the group, the Chinese government denies involvement. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/doj-confirms-fbi-operation-that-mass-deleted-chinese-malware-from-thousands-of-us-computers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_0riV7lddUMqCzcf1sEWmwvCz8CtwM3dOvcz4IRJssiVgB1Iy0jHS4uRLncXSbbwzrm-s">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Supreme Court Weighs TikTok Ban Amid National Security Concerns and First Amendment Debate</p>



<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing TikTok’s challenge to a law requiring it to sever ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. app store ban by January 19, 2025. The government cites national security concerns over potential data misuse and disinformation, while TikTok argues the ban violates First Amendment protections. If enforced, TikTok would lose app store access, updates, and functionality. President-elect Donald Trump supports delaying the ban for negotiations, but legal and legislative issues persist. The U.S. would be the first Western democracy to impose a full ban, following India’s example, while NATO and European nations have limited restrictions. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-arguments-65506b1f?mod=tech_more_article_pos2&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8hmq0cc5zBAkNb8S6v44H-FOeWGtNkh-69m9Ul4000AkAYuO2IQ_eRI6hgiCfAPGYAGY6l">(Source)</a></p>

			 Christian Stricker is Digital Marketing Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I’m Christian Stricker, born in Luxembourg to Danish parents. Currently finishing a Bachelor’s Degree in Media Design in Eindhoven, which is the latest on my big list of projects/problems to solve. Having something to work towards always keeps me motivated, and that can be something simple like creating my favorite dish, to more complex projects where I utilize my full potential.</p>
<p>I have a few hobbies but the main ones are motorsports and fitness. I often participate in virtual sim racing competitions in cars which I have designed myself. A perfect way to blend my professional skills and hobbies into one. For the fitness side, I play touch rugby with the Luxembourgish team every week, go on runs in the forest, and ski.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before Tokeny, while I was completing my bachelors degree, I was involved in a global project of building and managing a website overhaul for a factory automation company. This taught me a lot about web development, project management and marketing. I thoroughly enjoyed this, so when the opportunity to join Tokeny arose I was ecstatic. Especially since I have been looking at working in the web3 industry.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Innovative, challenging but very rewarding. The team is very motivated and everyone working here has a strong belief in what Tokeny is doing for the future. I am not just a number here, my inputs are valued and working alongside the others has taught me a huge amount about myself, and the web3 industry.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>If I were to condense all my passions into one it would be: Learning and Improving. My main passion is racing. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a driver and as I grew up I tried making this a reality. I spent countless hours learning racecraft and how to handle a car, then I would apply my learnings to the track in karts. I have taken part in a few karting races and won 2 of them. Beating the competition is the motivation, and nothing is more rewarding than finally earning the top spot of the podium.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live a life knowing I did my best, even if I don’t achieve all my goals. As long as I have given it my best shot, I will never have to think, what if?</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid of accepting new challenges, keep an open mind, and the team is always there to help you improve. Your hard work will be recognized.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>We are at the beginning of something that can completely change the way we do finance in the future. Opening up a whole new world of opportunities for institutions and investors. I am excited to be part of this journey and see where it leads us.</p>

<p></p>



<p>David, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at a mid-sized credit union in British Columbia, faced a daunting challenge. His credit union had been flagged in an internal audit for inadequate compliance processes related to KYB (Know Your Business), KYC (Know Your Customer), and AML (Anti-Money Laundering). With the British Columbia Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) tightening AML regulations, David knew that continuing with their web of disconnected solutions and manual workflows was no longer viable.</p>



<p>The stakes were high. Non-compliance could lead to hefty fines, reputational damage, and even restrictions on operations. To address the gaps, David and his team began exploring ways to overhaul their compliance processes. They quickly realized they had two choices: continue patching together multiple disconnected systems or adopt iComply’s holistic compliance platform. Here’s how David’s team turned their challenging and complicated compliance journey into a success story.</p>



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Status Quo: A Web of Inefficiency</p>



<p>Before adopting iComply, David’s credit union relied on a fragmented system for compliance. KYB checks were done through multiple vendors, KYC was manual – usually requiring members to come to the branch for routine updates, and AML monitoring involved a time-consuming mix of spreadsheets and third-party tools. Each step required manual effort, from verifying documents to cross-checking sanctions lists and PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons).</p>



<p>This setup caused significant challenges:</p>



 
 Time-Consuming Workflows: Staff spent hours reconciling data across different platforms. 



 High Costs: Licensing multiple solutions added up, with limited ROI. 



 Increased Risk: Manual processes led to errors, exposing the credit union to potential non-compliance. 



 Poor Member Experience: Onboarding new members was slow and frustrating, affecting satisfaction and retention. Existing members were frustrated by the credit union’s policiy to force members to come to the branch in order to provide updated documents for KYC refreshes. 
 



<p>David knew that meeting BCFSA’s stringent AML guidelines required a transformative solution—one that could consolidate systems, automate workflows, and enhance security.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The iComply Difference</p>



<p>When David’s team evaluated iComply, the benefits were clear. Unlike traditional solutions, iComply offered an end-to-end compliance platform designed to address the unique challenges of small to medium financial institutions. Here’s how iComply reshaped their approach:</p>



 
 Consolidation of Systems: iComply replaced eight disconnected systems with a single, unified platform. This meant KYB, KYC, and AML workflows could be managed seamlessly from one place, eliminating redundancies and errors while simplifying processes. 



 Edge Computing for Enhanced Security: With iComply’s proprietary edge computing technology, sensitive member data was processed and encrypted directly on their devices. This ensured that no unencrypted data left the local environment, significantly reducing privacy risks and better aligning with their requirements around data governance and their members expectations for data privacy and security. 



 Automation and Efficiency: Tedious tasks like document verification, sanctions screening, and biometric identity checks were automated. Real-time alerts flagged potential issues, allowing David’s team to focus on high-priority cases instead of getting bogged down in manual reviews. 



 Improved Member Experience: By streamlining onboarding, iComply enabled new members to complete verification in minutes, not days. This frictionless experience boosted member satisfaction and reinforced the credit union’s commitment to member privacy, security, and service. 



 Cost Savings: Consolidating systems and automating processes reduced licensing fees, as well as integration, maintenance, and operational costs. The ROI was immediate, with fewer resources spent on compliance operations and more available for growth initiatives.<br> 
 



 



<p></p>



<p>Meeting BCFSA Requirements with Confidence</p>



<p>The BCFSA’s AML guidelines emphasize early identification of risks, robust documentation, and ongoing monitoring. With iComply, David’s credit union exceeded these standards:</p>



 
 Comprehensive Screening: Real-time access to global sanctions, PEP, and watchlist data ensured thorough due diligence. 



 Transparency and Reporting: Automated audit trails and detailed reports made regulatory reviews straightforward and stress-free. 



 Ongoing Monitoring: Continuous risk assessment tools allowed David’s team to stay ahead of potential threats. 
 



<p></p>



<p>A New Value Proposition for Members</p>



<p>Adopting iComply wasn’t just about compliance—it reinforced the credit union’s value to its members. By ensuring the highest levels of security and privacy, the credit union demonstrated its commitment to protecting members’ financial well-being. Additionally, faster onboarding and streamlined services enhanced member trust and loyalty.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Creating Exceptional Member Experiences</p>



<p>For David and his team, choosing iComply was a game-changer. The credit union now operates with confidence, knowing its compliance processes are robust, efficient, and fully aligned with BCFSA requirements. They’ve saved time, reduced costs, and significantly lowered their risk exposure—all while improving member satisfaction.</p>



<p>If your financial institution is still struggling with disconnected systems and manual workflows, it’s time to consider iComply. Like David’s credit union, you can transform compliance from a burden into a strategic advantage.</p>

<p>2024 was a year of immense growth for Bluesky. We launched the app publicly in February and gained over 23M users by the end of the year. With this growth came anticipated challenges in scaling Trust &amp; Safety, from adding workstreams to adapting to new harms.</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, our Trust &amp; Safety team has worked to protect our growing userbase and uphold our community standards. Our approach has focused on assessing potential harms based on both their frequency and severity, allowing us to direct our resources to where they can have the greatest impact. Looking ahead to 2025, we're investing in stronger proactive detection systems to complement user reporting, as a growing network needs multiple detection methods to rapidly identify and address harmful content. In Q1, we'll be sharing a draft of updated <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">Guidelines</a> as we continue adapting to our community’s needs.</p>
 Overview 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky grew from 2.89M users to 25.94M users. In addition to users hosted on Bluesky’s infrastructure, there are over 4,000 users running their own infrastructure (Personal Data Servers), self-hosting their content, posts, and data.</p>
<p>To meet the demands caused by user growth, we’ve increased our moderation team to roughly 100 moderators and continue to hire more staff. Some moderators specialize in particular policy areas, such as dedicated agents for child safety. Our moderation team is staffed 24/7 and reviews user reports around the clock. This is a tough job, as moderators are consistently exposed to graphic content. At the start of September 2024, we began providing psychological counselling to alleviate the burden of viewing this content.</p>
 Reports 
<p>In 2024, users submitted 6.48M reports to Bluesky’s moderation service. That’s a 17x increase from the previous year — in 2023, users submitted 358K reports total. The volume of user reports increased with user growth and was non-linear, as the graph of report volume below shows:</p>

  
  Report volume in 2024

<p>In late August, there was a large increase in user growth for Bluesky from Brazil, and we saw spikes of up to 50k reports per day. Prior to this, our moderation team handled most reports within 40 minutes. For the first time in 2024, we now had a backlog in moderation reports. To address this, we increased the size of our Portuguese-language moderation team, added constant moderation sweeps and automated tooling for high-risk areas such as child safety, and hired moderators through an external contracting vendor for the first time.</p>
<p>We already had automated spam detection in place, and after this wave of growth in Brazil, we began investing in automating more categories of reports so that our moderation team would be able to review suspicious or problematic content rapidly. In December, we were able to review our first wave of automated reports for content categories like impersonation. This dropped processing time for high-certainty accounts to within seconds of receiving a report, though it also caused some false positives. We’re now exploring the expansion of this tooling to other policy areas. Even while instituting automation tooling to reduce our response time, human moderators are still kept in the loop — all appeals and false positives are reviewed by human moderators.</p>
<p>Some more statistics: The proportion of users submitting reports held fairly stable from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, 5.6% of our active users<a>1</a> created one or more reports. In 2024, 1.19M users made one or more reports, approximately 4.57% of our user base.</p>
<p>In 2023, 3.4% of our active users received one or more reports. In 2024, the number of users who received a report were 770K, comprising 2.97% of our user base.</p>
<p>The majority of reports were of individual posts, with a total of 3.5M reports. This was followed by account profiles at 47K reports, typically for a violative profile picture or banner photo. Lists received 45K reports. DMs received 17.7K reports. Significantly lower are feeds at 5.3K reports, and starter packs with 1.9K reports.</p>
<p>Our users report content for a variety of reasons, and these reports help guide our focus areas. Below is a summary of the reports we received, categorized by the reasons users selected. The categories vary slightly depending on whether a report is about an account or a specific post, but here’s the full breakdown:</p>
 
 Anti-social Behavior: Reports of harassment, trolling, or intolerance – 1.75M 
 Misleading Content: Includes impersonation, misinformation, or false claims about identity or affiliations – 1.20M 
 Spam: Excessive mentions, replies, or repetitive content – 1.40M 
 Unwanted Sexual Content: Nudity or adult content not properly labeled – 630K 
 Illegal or Urgent Issues: Clear violations of the law or our terms of service – 933K 
 Other: Issues that don’t fit into the above categories – 726K 
 
<p>These insights highlight areas where we need to focus more attention as we prioritize improvements in 2025.</p>
 Labels 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky applied 5.5M labels, which includes individual post labels and account-level labels. To give an idea of volumes, in Nov 2024, 2.5M videos were posted on Bluesky<a>2</a>, along 36.14M images. This comes primarily from automation where every image as well as frames from each video is sent to a provider for assessment, they return verdicts that match to our specific labels, and those are the ones you see from Bluesky Moderation. None of the images or videos are retained by the vendor or used for training generative AI systems. In June 2024, we analyzed the effectiveness of this system and concluded that the overall system was 99.90% accurate (i.e. it labeled the right things with the right labels). Human moderators review all appeals on labels, but due to backlogs, there are currently delays.</p>
<p>The top human-applied labels were:</p>
 
 Sexual-figurative<a>3</a> - 55,422 
 Rude - 22,412 
 Spam - 13,201 
 Intolerant - 11,341 
 Threat - 3,046 
 
 Appeals 
<p>In 2024, 93,076 users submitted at least one appeal in the app, for a total of 205K individual appeals. For most cases, the appeal was due to disagreement with label verdicts.</p>
<p>We currently handle user appeals for taken-down accounts via our moderation email inbox.</p>
<p>In 2025, we will transition to responding to moderation reports directly within the Bluesky app, which will streamline user communication. For example, we’ll be able to report back to users what action was taken on their reports. Additionally, in a future iteration, it will be possible for users to appeal account takedowns directly within the Bluesky app instead of having to send us an email.</p>
 Takedowns 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky moderators took down 66,308 accounts, and automated tooling took down 35,842 accounts for reasons such as spam and bot networks. Mods took down 6,334 records (posts, lists, feed etc.) while automated systems removed 282.</p>
<p>This month (January 2025), we’ve already built in policy reasons to Ozone, our open-source moderation tool. This will give us more granular data on the takedown rationale moving forward.</p>
 Legal Requests 
<p>In 2024, we received 238 requests from law enforcement, governments, legal firms, responded to 182, and complied with 146. The majority of requests came from German, U.S., Brazilian, and Japanese law enforcement.</p>
<p>In the chart below, User Data Requests are requests for user data; Data Preservation Requests are requests for Bluesky to store user data pending legal authorization to transfer the data; Emergency Data Requests are extreme cases where there’s a threat to life (i.e., someone actively discussing their own suicide with a time and date given for an attempt); Takedown Requests are requests for content removal; Subpoena Requests are largely user data requests, but if Bluesky fails to provide the data in a timely manner, it has to physically show up in court to defend not providing the data.</p>

 Copyright / Trademark 
<p>In 2024, we received a total of 937 copyright and trademark cases. There were four confirmed copyright cases in the entire first half of 2024, and this number increased to 160 in September. The vast majority of cases occurred between September to December.</p>
<p>We published a <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright">copyright form</a> in late 2024, which provided more structure to our report responses. The influx of users from Brazil meant that professional copyright companies began scraping Bluesky data and sending us copyright claims. With the move to a structured copyright form, we expect to have more granular data in 2025.</p>
 Child Safety 
<p>We subscribe to a number of hashes (digital fingerprints) that match known cases of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). When an image or video is uploaded to Bluesky and matches one of these hashes, it is immediately removed from the site and our infrastructure without the need for a human to view the content.</p>
<p>In 2024, Bluesky submitted 1,154 reports for confirmed CSAM to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Reports consist of the account details, along with manually reviewed media by one of our specialized child safety moderators. Each report can involve many pieces of media, though most reports involve under five pieces of media.</p>
<p>CSAM is a serious issue on any social network. With surges in user growth also came increased complexity in child safety. Cases included accounts attempting to sell CSAM by linking off-platform, potentially underage users trying to sell explicit imagery, and pedophiles attempting to share encrypted chat links. In these cases, we rapidly updated our internal guidance to our moderation team to ensure prompt response times in taking down this activity.</p>
<p>To read more about how Bluesky handles child safety, you can find a co-published <a href="https://safer.io/resources/when-users-flock-harm-follows-what-rapid-migration-to-bluesky-teaches-us-about-content-moderation/">blog post</a> on Thorn’s website.</p>

				  The Biden administration’s latest Executive Order (EO), on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/">“Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity,”</a> focuses on preventing digital identity theft as a critical component to reducing cybercrime and fraud.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>Stronger digital identities</p>
<p>The White House released the final Executive Order from the Biden administration today calling for strong cybersecurity measures, and one measure they pointed out specifically was “the acceptance of digital identity documents to access public benefits programs that require identity verification, so long as it is done in a manner that preserves broad program access for vulnerable populations and supports the principles of privacy, data minimization, and interoperability.”</p>
<p>This effectively means replacing the current account and password systems that most online portals use. While these current systems offer a convenient, quick way to gain access, they have been known to be insecure for years.</p>
<p>So what would these “digital identity documents” actually look like?</p>
<p>At the most basic level a digital identity document is a combination of personally identifiable information that you can tie to an individual to prove who they are online. One example that you might have heard of is a Mobile Driver’s License or mDL, which are also referenced in the order as a potential way to gain access to public benefit programs.</p>
<p>Moving past the basics, to get the most functionality and security out of these documents they will need a few additional features.</p>
<p>They need to be stored locally with the end user</p>
<p>Third party storage of personal data for identity authentication is always at risk of a data breach</p>
<p>They need to be tamper-proof and un-copyable</p>
<p>The integrity of the information must be verifiable and it must be bound to the person it belongs to in a way that someone else can’t use it.</p>
<p>They need to be interoperable</p>
<p>Being locked out because you’re on a mac and the other party is on PC and they don’t play well together won’t work at this scale, we need a universal solution</p>
<p>The Executive Order also stresses the privacy preserving nature of these documents, saying they should “support user privacy and data minimization by ensuring only the minimum information required for a transaction — often a “yes” or “no” response to a question, such as whether an individual is older than a specific age — is requested from the holder of the digital identity document.”</p>
<p>Decentralized identity</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is the solution to the White House Executive Order. Everyone controls their own personal data and that data can be verified as authentic, as bound to the person it rightfully belongs to, and that it has not been manipulated.</p>
<p>The benefit of decentralization is portable trust. Any information —&nbsp;and not just personal data —&nbsp;can be sealed in a digital container called a Verifiable Credential. The way that container is created means you always know where it came from. The way the data is sealed means that any attempt to tamper with it breaks the seal.</p>
<p>As an architecture for our information economy, decentralized identity takes out the weak points of our current system —&nbsp;centralized databases filled with personal data for verifying identity — and replaces them with a much simpler, resilient, seamless way of proving who we are to each other.</p>
<p>The result is that information can go from anywhere to everywhere and be immediately acted on — and of course, by providing a reliable method for individuals and organizations to prove their identities online, verifiable credentials help reduce the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity frameworks offer a transformative approach to identity management. Unlike traditional centralized systems, decentralized identity places control of personal data back in the hands of individuals. This model not only enhances privacy and security but also reduces the risk of large-scale data breaches that have plagued centralized databases.</p>
<p>The Executive Order’s promotion of innovative developments and use of emerging technologies is an acknowledgment of the potential of decentralized identity to strengthen the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better see how these technologies work, you can see a demonstration of using Verifiable Credentials to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvCNvWud3Ys">access your bank account</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StRH7uOqxQA">fly internationally</a> in a joint effort between Indicio, SITA, Delta Airlines, and the Government of Aruba.</p>

  SpruceID is advancing privacy-preserving Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) to enhance security, streamline verification processes, and protect user privacy in international travel and immigration.

<p>Digital credentials are on the road to broad availability in the U.S. These cryptographically signed digital documents are one variety of VDC, or Verifiable Digital Credential. They enhance user privacy while making credential checks faster and more trustworthy, using unforgeable cryptographic signatures to prove their authenticity and accuracy.</p><p>As VDC usage continues to grow within the United States and other nations, a new challenge rises ahead: creating digital versions of passports and international travel documents with the same privacy and security benefits as the mobile driver’s license. SpruceID is now<a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/dhs-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> contributing to the effort</a> to push VDC-based digital identity beyond U.S. borders. Read on to learn more about the benefits of digital identity for travelers, immigrants, and the world.</p> User Privacy and National Security <p>Digital passports, immigration, and work authorization documents are still almost entirely analog documents – paper, usually backed up by a database. The next generation of these credentials, though, will be able to “live” on your smartphone or other mobile device. <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Cryptographic signatures</a> will prevent them from being copied or altered while making it possible to verify them without checking a separate database.</p><p>Read More:<a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Digital Signatures</a></p><p>These Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) are sometimes also known as privacy-preserving digital credentials (PPDCs), highlighting how central privacy is to their technical design. One major privacy benefit of travel and immigration documents based on VDCs is <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selective disclosure</a> – proving your citizenship, for instance, without sharing less relevant data like your spouse’s name. Similarly, part of the stated goal of the push for digital travel documents is to minimize the system’s reliance on biometrics, such as face-scanning, which can generate high-risk data. The potential to verify digital credentials without contacting a central server for confirmation also means VDCs can be used without leaving “footprints” that <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">could be used for surveillance</a>.</p><p>This doesn’t just serve individual privacy: the broader stakes for national security have also become increasingly clear. State-affiliated hacks targeting infrastructure and data are becoming <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-releases-mobile-security-guidance-after-chinese-telecom-hacking/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">larger, more frequent, and more pernicious</a>. Though it sounds extreme, it’s not difficult to imagine a long-term compromise of digital travel control systems giving a foreign enemy or other bad actors detailed visibility into the movements of government officials or high-ranking business leaders.</p><p>Such a compromise could be a very powerful intelligence advantage for America’s enemies. That’s one reason for a recent U.S. government <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">push for privacy-preserving data tools</a>. If travel systems are digitized in a privacy-first way, the current moment is an opportunity to spread the privacy advantages of digital credentials around the world.</p> More Secure Processes and Borders <p>In addition to enabling more private verifications, VDCs are also more trustworthy compared to paper documents – particularly in situations where remote verification isn’t available or practical. Fully verifying a paper document generally requires access to a central database, but access to that database is often restricted. Just as regional driver’s license databases are often <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/records/sharing-your-information?ref=blog.spruceid.com">restricted to law enforcement, insurers</a>, and a handful of other entities, passport information is even more strictly limited – in the U.S., to the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Passport-Records-Imaging-System-Management-PRISM-PIA.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State Department</a> and Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, passports have in recent years been the<a href="https://identityweek.net/trends-in-fraudulent-identity-documents-in-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> most frequently forged identity documents</a> around the world, according to Identity Week. This is driven not by individuals hoping to travel on a fake passport, as airport security checkpoints are far more likely to use a remote database for confirmations. Instead, forged passports are most often used to deceive employers trying to determine a job applicant’s work eligibility. For instance, forged British and Irish passports are widely used to <a href="https://identityweek.net/trends-in-fraudulent-identity-documents-in-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com">circumvent eligibility requirements</a> to work in France and mainland Europe – a situation where the document itself must stand as the final source of trust.</p><p>Thanks to physical security features, paper passports are difficult to forge—but clearly, not impossible. In fact, it appears that we are on the cusp of a potential flood of fake paper documents unleashed by AI: reports in 2024 found that AI is making forged identity documents much less expensive to produce.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/28/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">AI is the Final Blow for an ID System Whose Time Has Passed</a></p><p>The signature scheme behind VDCs is vastly superior to paper documents in this and similar cases. While identity database access is constricted, a directory of valid signatures on a digital document can be entirely public, and the signature cannot be forged by anything short of a physical attack on the servers where a document issuer’s digital “keys” are securely stored.</p> Faster and More Convenient – Online and Off <p>Using digital signatures instead of paper documents to verify passports can also dramatically speed travel processing. Without access to a central database, individual screeners will often have to devote considerable time to evaluating individual documents. Verification of a digital document using cryptographic signatures is near-instant while also eliminating the ambiguities and risks of physical document review.</p><p>Another emergent benefit of digital credentials for migrants and travelers is the ability to store and manage virtual documents on the mobile phone you already carry. In regions where payments and identity tools are already available on smartphones, consumer preference is quickly shifting towards being able to leave the house with a phone but without physical credit cards or ID. While it’s a radical shift from as little as a decade ago, smartphones have become ubiquitous enough that the same habit is likely to become common worldwide. It seems likely to be particularly appealing for refugees or other migrants in unstable situations when keeping track of one smartphone is easier than a large sheaf of paperwork.</p><p>Finally, VDCs are a step-change in the accuracy and ease of verifying documents online. Physical documents are particularly vulnerable to forgery when presented online, particularly in the post-AI era. Presenting a passport as a digital photo, for instance, makes it impossible to accurately check physical security features like a hologram. A digital signature, by contrast, can be confirmed by a website or kiosk as quickly and accurately as by a human operating a scanning device. This dramatically increases the reliability of immigration and travel management through remote online portals.</p> A Safer, Freer World <p>The United States is pursuing VDC-based international travel systems in significant part because the technology comports with Western democratic values. VDC technology is easy to use to work outside of omnipresent surveillance while surpassing the trustworthiness of paper documents.</p><p>SpruceID’s work with the Department of Homeland Security is part of a broader U.S. national strategy to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">push VDCs</a> and other privacy-preserving digital technology forward. We hope to help drive adoption outside of the U.S. as well, with potentially substantial benefits for privacy and security worldwide.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/dhs-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn About SpruceID’s Work With DHS</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Emily, a seasoned compliance officer, remembers the days when performing a KYC (Know Your Customer) refresh meant a mountain of manual work. Tasked with ensuring her financial services firm remained compliant with evolving regulations, Emily had to juggle stacks of outdated spreadsheets, endless email threads, and hours of manual data verification.</p>



<p>But today, thanks to iComply’s streamlined platform, Emily’s team has revolutionized their approach to KYC refreshes, making them faster, more accurate, and far less stressful. Here’s a look at how she transformed her processes and achieved compliance with confidence.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 1: Planning and Preparation</p>



<p>Previously, Emily’s KYC refresh process began with manually identifying accounts due for updates. This meant combing through spreadsheets to cross-reference customer profiles with regulatory requirements—a time-consuming and error-prone task.</p>



<p>Now, with iComply, Emily’s team uses automated workflows to flag accounts requiring a refresh based on predefined rules, such as changes in risk profile or regulatory deadlines. This automation ensures no account is missed and allows her team to focus on higher-value tasks.</p>



<p>Checklist for Planning and Preparation:</p>



 
 Identify accounts needing updates based on risk or regulatory timelines. 



 Use automated tools to flag accounts requiring a refresh. 



 Ensure all necessary customer data is centralized and accessible. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 2: Customer Outreach</p>



<p>In her previous role, Emily spent hours crafting individual email templates and following up with customers to gather updated documentation. Tracking responses was chaotic and often resulted in delays.</p>



<p>With iComply, Emily’s team now automates customer outreach. Personalized requests for updated documents are sent through a secure portal, complete with clear instructions. Customers appreciate the seamless experience, and Emily’s team can track responses in real time.</p>



<p>Checklist for Customer Outreach:</p>



 
 Automate personalized outreach to customers with secure communication tools. 



 Provide clear instructions and a user-friendly portal for submitting updates. 



 Monitor responses and set reminders for follow-ups. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 3: Document Verification</p>



<p>Manual document verification was one of the most time-consuming parts of Emily’s old workflow. Her team had to manually check IDs, match information, and ensure authenticity.</p>



<p>Now, iComply’s platform automates document verification with advanced AI-driven tools. These tools cross-reference submitted data against global watchlists, ensuring compliance while significantly reducing errors and processing time.</p>



<p>Checklist for Document Verification:</p>



 
 Use automated tools to verify submitted documents. 



 Cross-check customer data with global sanctions and PEP lists. 



 Flag discrepancies for manual review. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 4: Risk Assessment and Scoring</p>



<p>Previously, performing a risk assessment involved manually calculating scores based on various risk factors, often requiring input from multiple teams. This process was not only inefficient but also inconsistent.</p>



<p>With iComply’s integrated risk assessment tools, Emily’s team now generates consistent and accurate risk scores automatically. This allows for quick identification of high-risk customers who may require enhanced due diligence.</p>



<p>Checklist for Risk Assessment:</p>



 
 Automatically calculate risk scores based on predefined criteria. 



 Review flagged accounts for potential issues. 



 Update customer profiles with risk assessments. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 5: Reporting and Compliance</p>



<p>One of Emily’s biggest challenges used to be generating compliance reports for internal audits and regulatory reviews. Gathering data from disparate sources often led to delays and incomplete records.</p>



<p>With iComply, reporting is now effortless. The platform generates comprehensive audit trails, ensuring Emily’s team is always prepared for regulator inquiries. This gives her the confidence to demonstrate compliance at any time.</p>



<p>Checklist for Reporting:</p>



 
 Generate audit trails automatically to track all actions. 



 Prepare compliance reports with detailed documentation. 



 Ensure records are stored securely for easy access during audits. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Transforming Compliance with iComply</p>



<p>Today, Emily no longer dreads KYC refresh cycles. By leveraging iComply’s advanced platform, her team has:</p>



 
 Reduced manual work by automating repetitive tasks. 



 Improved accuracy with AI-driven document verification and risk scoring. 



 Enhanced customer experience with seamless, secure communication. 



 Gained confidence in their compliance readiness through robust reporting tools. 
 



<p>For Emily, the difference is night and day. With iComply, her team not only meets regulatory requirements but also sets a higher standard for efficiency and customer trust.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a compliance officer like Emily or part of a team managing KYC processes, iComply can help you streamline workflows, reduce costs, and build a program that’s ready for the future of compliance.</p>

<p>Amid the constant changes that organizations endure — whether through personnel decisions, new vendor selection, tech stack updates, or department restructuring — they must ensure sensitive company resources and applications remain secure and are only accessible by authorized users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing employee and third-party access privileges to enterprise applications, data, and networks is no easy feat, though it’s crucial to overall security, compliance, and operational efficiency.</p>

<p>As we enter 2025, data privacy and identity protection will remain some of the hottest topics around. Watch out for the continued meteoric rise of digital identity verification and management, more data privacy laws, tighter regulations around artificial intelligence, and the continued emergence of quantum computing. Here’s our take on what lies ahead:</p>



 
 Digital identity verification and management will take centre stage<br><br>Impersonation and fraud, particularly in banking and finance, have become so prevalent and sophisticated that digital identity verification and management will fast become the go-to solution for protecting customers and building trust, replacing paper-based and other vulnerable systems. We agree with <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/blog/access-management/iam-predictions-for-2025#:~:text=Deepfake%20risks%20will%20drive%20IAM,lifestyle%20information%2C%20and%20social%20data.">industry predictions</a> that identity will be the “linchpin of business resilience” going forward, and that <a href="https://www.scworld.com/perspective/digital-identity-verification-will-have-a-breakout-year-in-2025">“digital identity verification will have a breakout year in 2025”</a>. There’s likely to be a rush to digital identity wallets and digital and biometric credential verification methods, particularly since regulations like eIDAS 2.0 in the EU are driving the transition to decentralized identity technologies. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">Go Inside Version 3.0 of the Most Advanced Mobile Wallet SDK on the Market</a>. Explore our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/guides/">guides</a>.<br><br> 



 The US will get more state privacy laws, but no federal privacy law<br><br>In an unsurprising development, most pundits agree that the United States’ chances of finally achieving a comprehensive federal privacy law are slim to none in 2025. <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/what-the-us-election-results-may-mean-for-digital-policy">IAPP</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/what-a-new-trump-mandate-could-mean-for-american-data-privacy-rights">TechRadar</a> commentators believe securing bipartisan agreement on such a law is likely to remain elusive under the Republican-controlled Congress, which TechRadar suggests “could leave Americans relying on digital tools to claim back their online privacy for themselves.” Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> apps are great examples of proactive consumer privacy tools.<br><br>As always, stepping into the breach from an absent federal privacy law will be state privacy laws, and we’ll see many more of those in 2025. Twenty-six of the 50 US states now have a state privacy law, expanding consumer rights and ratcheting up compliance obligations on business. In 2024, four more state laws came into effect:<br><br><a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-privacy-rights/texas-data-privacy-and-security-act">Texas Data Privacy and Security Act&nbsp;(TDPSA)</a>, effective July 1, 2024<br><a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2023/06/florida-digital-bill-of-rights-data-privacy#:~:text=As%20with%20other%20state%20privacy,in%20a%20portable%20and%20readily">Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR)</a>, effective July 1, 2024&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/oregonians-gain-significant-new-consumer-privacy-protections/">Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)</a>, effective on July 1, 2024<br><a href="https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0384.pdf">Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)</a>, effective October 1, 2024.<br><br>January 2025 saw four more state privacy laws come into effect—<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=140388&amp;legislationTypeId=1&amp;docTypeId=2&amp;legislationName=HB154">Delaware</a>, <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/iowa-data-protection-act-what-businesses-need-to-know">Iowa</a>, <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/new-hampshire-enacts-comprehensive-data-privacy-law">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/talking-tech/en/articles/2024/02/the-new-jersey-data-privacy-law-an-overview.html">New Jersey</a>—and later in 2025, <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/ag-data-dive/tennessee-information-protection-act-what-businesses-need-to-know">Tennessee</a> and <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/maryland-enacts-comprehensive-data-privacy-law#:~:text=The%20Maryland%20Online%20Data%20Privacy%20Act%20prohibits%20Controllers%20from%3A,service%20requested%20by%20the%20consumer.">Maryland</a> will introduce theirs.<br><br> 



 Regulation around AI will tighten but privacy and security issues will remain<br><br>Generative AI will be the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2025/01/12/5-generative-ai-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2025/">thing to watch in 2025</a>, with artificial intelligence becoming integral to core application design and service delivery for its efficiency, UX and cost-saving benefits. But this emerging tech will also remain acutely challenging, particularly from a data privacy and security perspective.<br><br>Regulation around AI will tighten in 2025, but the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">IAPP</a> puts a good question: “While there is a consensus AI should be regulated, and there are increasing efforts in this sense — such as the highly anticipated EU AI Act [and <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2024/06/colorados-landmark-ai-act">Colorado’s AI Act</a>] — the fact is AI privacy risks remain uncharted waters, leaving both AI practitioners and privacy professionals with a feeling of unease. After all, since AI technologies are advancing faster than regulation, how should privacy pros approach AI privacy risks in a way that makes new products viable, while safeguarding data subjects’ rights?” It’s a question that may linger well beyond 2025.<br><br>The <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">IAPP</a> highlights these 12 risks from AI, which come from Carnegie Mellon University and Oxford University’s adaptation of earlier work by <a href="https://www.danielsolove.com/">Professor Daniel Solove</a>:<br><br>Surveillance:&nbsp;AI exacerbates surveillance risks by increasing the scale and ubiquity of personal data collection.<br>Identification:&nbsp;AI technologies enable automated identity linking across various data sources, increasing risks related to personal identity exposure.<br>Aggregation:&nbsp;AI combines various pieces of data about a person to make inferences, creating risks of privacy invasion.<br>Phrenology and physiognomy:&nbsp;AI infers personality or social attributes from physical characteristics, a new risk category not in Solove’s taxonomy.<br>Secondary use:&nbsp;AI exacerbates use of personal data for purposes other than originally intended through repurposing data.<br>Exclusion:&nbsp;AI makes failure to inform or give control to users over how their data is used worse through opaque data practices.<br>Insecurity:&nbsp;AI’s data requirements and storage practices risk of data leaks and improper access.<br>Exposure:&nbsp;AI can reveal sensitive information, such as through generative AI techniques.<br>Distortion:&nbsp;AI’s ability to generate realistic but fake content heightens the spread of false or misleading information.<br>Disclosure:&nbsp;AI can cause improper sharing of data when it infers additional sensitive information from raw data.<br>Increased accessibility:&nbsp;AI makes sensitive information more accessible to a wider audience than intended.<br>Intrusion:&nbsp;AI technologies invade personal space or solitude, often through surveillance measures.<br><br>Debate and developments around these 12 risks from AI (and potentially others) will be a hallmark of 2025.<br><br>

The race to quantum computing has been going on for a while now, and things are definitely heating up.<br><br>Many industries have <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Explore-future-potential-quantum-computing-uses">use cases</a>&nbsp;for quantum computing for simulations (e.g. simulating molecular structures in drug discovery or climate modelling) and optimization (e.g. optimizing shipping routes and flight paths, enhancing machine learning algorithms, or developing advanced materials).&nbsp;But as <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">we’ve said before</a> the quantum age does present some real <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">threats</a>, particularly the looming arrival of quantum computers that are sufficiently powerful and error-resistant to break conventional encryption algorithms (RSA, DSS, Diffie-Hellman, TLS/SSL, etc.) and expose the world’s vast stores of secured data.&nbsp;The race is on to <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">Q-Day</a> and we’ll likely see more about that in 2025.&nbsp;<br><br>The US Government has issued a <a href="http://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Aug/21/2003284212/-1/-1/0/CSI-QUANTUM-READINESS.PDF">quantum readiness guide</a> to developing and building capabilities to secure critical information and systems from being compromised by quantum computers.&nbsp;<br><br> 



 More people will worry about data privacy and act to protect their personal information<br><br>Consumers are growing increasingly worried about the safety of their personal information, particularly on social media and around AI.

Cisco’s annual <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/consumer-privacy-survey.html#~about-the-study">privacy study</a> did, however, reveal that all this worry is making people more proactive about protecting their own data, which can only be a good thing, and tools like Anonyome Labs’ consumer apps <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> make it easy. <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">Anonyome also offers businesses a suite of next generation digital identity and privacy tools.</a>

Whether you're preparing for an employee self-assessment, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/a-guide-for-salary-negotiation">salary negotiation</a> or conducting a self-appraisal of your own performance, looking inwards objectively feels almost impossible sometimes.</p><p>From formal performance evaluations where job performance needs assessment, to informal self-reflection about workflow and work ethic, seeing outside objectively can be challenging.</p><p>In fact, according to the Harvard Business Review, while 95% of people believe they have strong self-awareness, only 10-15% actually demonstrate true competencies in self-evaluation during behavioral studies. <a>1</a></p><p>So, how can actual self-awareness be increased to match what many people believe they have? </p> <p>I’m Yngvi Karlson, Co-Founder of <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>.

These measure how well personal goals are being reached, often in the context of personal life, such as managing anxiety, learning a new hobby, or building a new habit.</p><p>Templates are available online, but given the personal nature of these evaluations, they don’t need to use standardized worksheets.</p> People are Professional and Personal <p>These two domains—professional and personal evaluation—aren't separate, but instead are inherently connected. According to McKinsey, executives who demonstrate high levels of self-awareness of their personal actions and goals are up to four times more likely to demonstrate strong leadership capabilities. <a>2</a></p><p>This connection exists because the core competencies built by proper self-evaluation, like problem-solving skills, a positive attitude, and teamwork, benefit both areas of life.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffb55fb9-6e76-4658-8f40-6f14a457c0d3_1600x1200.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Nick Morrison  Why Self-Evaluation is Important <p>Self-evaluations help people understand how well they’re doing the things they want to be doing, and how they can improve. This makes it much easier for people to adjust their behavior to reach their goals, whether those goals are professional or personal.</p><p>As such, self-evaluations build the following skills:</p>  <p>Self-Awareness: Understanding personal strengths, weaknesses, and patterns is perhaps the biggest benefit of self-evaluation.</p>  <p>Increased Accountability: Regular evaluation helps show personal control over growth, encouraging people to harness it.</p>  <p>Decision-Making: Regular self-reflection increases self-awareness, which makes appropriate choices about career paths and personal development easier to identify.</p>  <p>Better Goal Setting: Clear self-assessment leads to more realistic and achievable objectives based on skill, money, and time levels.</p>  <p>Stronger Relationships: Greater self-awareness often leads to better communication and collaboration with colleagues, friends, and family alike.</p>  <p>Stress Reduction: Understanding personal patterns and triggers, and having plans in place to support them, helps manage day-to-day pressures more effectively.</p>   The Impact on Professional Growth <p>In professional settings, strong self-evaluation skills can dramatically impact career trajectory. According to Gallup's 2023 State of the Global Workplace report, employees who regularly participate in self-evaluation and feedback processes are 3.6 times more likely to be engaged at work and 2.5 times more likely to report being satisfied with their career progression. <a>3</a></p><p>This advantage comes from multiple factors. Self-aware professionals better understand their strengths and areas of improvement, leading to more targeted skill development. They're also more receptive to constructive feedback during one-on-one meetings, as they've developed the ability to process criticism constructively. Additionally, their enhanced self-awareness often translates to better project management and more effective workplace relationships.</p><p>The impact extends to workflow optimization as well. When employees regularly evaluate their processes and competencies, they can better identify inefficiencies and propose improvements.</p><p>This proactive approach not only enhances individual performance, but as employee engagement and retention are crucial metrics for organizational success today, employee self-awareness benefits companies by maintaining productive workflows and reducing turnover through better job satisfaction.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb66abc5-9412-45ca-8b0d-b25e34ae3cc5_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Christian Wiediger  Barriers to Self-Evaluation <p>Because self-evaluation is done by oneself, it faces a unique set of challenges.</p><p>Discrepancies between perception and reality can lead to confirmation bias, causing people to seek information that supports their existing beliefs about their own work, and ignore information that proves them wrong.</p><p>Similarly, emotional attachment to outcomes can cloud judgment of overall performance, as people seek to protect who they love and punish who they don’t.</p><p>And perhaps most challenging, people often lack the structured approach needed to make self-assessment a consistent, productive practice.</p> The Five Core Areas of Self-Evaluation <p>Before diving into actionable guides, it's important to understand the five key areas that a comprehensive, high-performance self-evaluation should cover:</p><p>1. Skills and Knowledge: Assess both technical capabilities and soft skills, identifying areas of expertise and knowledge gaps. For example, a marketing manager might evaluate their proficiency in digital analytics tools, alongside their team leadership abilities and understanding of their actions.</p><p>2. Performance and Achievements: Review specific accomplishments against set goals, including both quantitative metrics (like sales numbers or amount of social outings) and qualitative outcomes (such as improved team dynamics or stronger relationships).</p><p>3. Habits and Behaviors: Examine daily practices, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management skills</a>, collaboration styles, and both professional and personal conduct. This might include analyzing how a deadline is met, and what <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">continuous learning</a> strategy is being used, if any.</p><p>4. Personal Growth and Development: Evaluate progress in career development goals, new skill acquisition, and both professional and personal relationships. Consider both formal learning opportunities and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-importance-of-honesty-in-the-workplace">mentoring experiences</a>, whether as a mentor or mentee. This includes assessing how effectively you've engaged with mentoring relationships and contributed to others' personal and professional development while advancing your own.</p><p>5. Values and Satisfaction: Assess alignment between personal values, personal actions, and current role; overall job satisfaction; and work-life balance. This includes examining whether a current position and trajectory <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">matches long-term career goals</a>, or whether recent actions build the relationships desired with others.</p> Other Essential Components of Effective Self-Evaluation <p>There are a few more important points to make:</p>  <p>Objectivity is crucial but challenging. The key is focusing on observable behaviors and measurable outcomes rather than interpretations. Instead of thinking "I'm bad at presentations," consider the specific aspects that prompt that thought, like "My last three presentations went over time by an average of 10 minutes." This will make it easier to tackle.</p>  <p>Evidence-based assessment requires collecting concrete data. This might mean tracking project completion times at work, or monitoring emotional responses to specific situations in personal life.</p>  <p>Self-evaluations are most useful when accompanied by <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">effective goal-setting </a>and dedication to creating a plan to reach those goals. The evaluations help people understand where they are in that plan, and what they need to adjust to advance further.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67cb31a2-fb93-428b-87ae-a5af3d558232_1600x1202.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Imagine Buddy  How to Write Effective Self-Evaluations <p>Now, as promised. Writing a self-evaluation for any purpose requires a structured approach, similar to the one below:</p>  <p>Decide What’s Being Evaluated: Whether it's professional performance, or a personal goal to learn crochet, ensure what’s being examined is clear.<br></p>  <p>Start with Data: Gather concrete examples and metrics of personal and/or professional performance. Include project outcomes, feedback received, conversations, and situations that feel indicative of performance.<br></p>  <p>Use the STAR Method: When describing achievements, use the Situation, Task, Action, Result format to make it easier to understand. For example:</p>  <p>"When our team faced a 20% decline in social media engagement (Situation), I was tasked with improving our content strategy (Task). I implemented a new content calendar and engagement tracking system (Action), resulting in a 45% increase in engagement over three months (Result)."<br></p>    <p>Be Specific and Honest: Instead of evaluating communication skills as ‘good’, write down the reasoning behind that—e.g. '“led 12 client presentations, was well-received by 9, and had three complain about the talking speed and lack of slide detail.”<br></p>  <p>Consider Meanings: Self-evaluations exist to promote thought. Consider why things went the way they did, and how the good things can be maintained and improved, as well as how the bad things can be avoided.</p>   Building a Self-Evaluation Routine <p>Second only to a good evaluation structure is a good evaluation routine. Without regular revisiting and re-application, self-evaluations are not being used to their full potential.</p><p>Start by choosing specific times for evaluation—perhaps Sunday evenings for weekly reviews and the last day of each month for broader assessments. Based on the goal progress being evaluated, create templates or frameworks to guide these sessions,</p><p>Regular one-on-one meetings with mentors or supervisors should be considered if possible, too. These can help identify any discrepancies between self-perception and reality, while also offering opportunities to discuss new projects and learning opportunities.</p><p>For more tips on building routines, check out our guides on <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">effective goal-setting</a> guides.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b4070dc-ab9a-4585-a0dd-39467dc01f92_1600x1064.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Aaron Burden  How Technology Enhances Self-Evaluation <p>Today, technology has made effective and regular self-evaluation easier than ever.

<p>Sometimes all you need is a 5 minute chart against the backdrop of a broader trend to realize where things are headed next. If you look at this first 5 minute chart, you'll see the price bounce off the EMA with volume so minimal that it appears the sellers have all but disappeared. </p><p>Below we have the two 5 minute windows that followed. You'll see the first was a test to the downside and then the next move back up with even greater volume than the previous 5 minute window. This is a very strong indication that the short-term indecisiveness of the market has resolved itself and the broader bull trend discussed in our article <a href="https://www.blocksquawk.io/btc-usd-trading-activity-january-13th-2025/">BTC/USD trading activity January 13th, 2025</a> will resume. </p><p>As of the time of publication, the above thesis has proven correct and Bitcoin is now back above $99,000. </p>

<p>If you're reading this article you're more than likely familiar with decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). And you may even be familiar with DEX aggregators who essentially search DeFi platforms like Uniswap for the optimal price on your trade and finalize the trade without navigating to the platforms themselves. DEX Ags also enable what's known as a non-custodial trading experience whereas trades are executed directly from the users wallet rather than being required to deposit the funds to the aggregators wallet. </p><p>In addition to optimal pricing and shear convenience, DEX Ags provide price impact protection by dividing trades of illiquid pairs across multiple exchanges thereby reducing price impact and affording better prices. Intent based aggregators are the most advanced form of DEX Ags and provide protection from a type of bot induced price exploitation called maximum extractable value (MEV) that has cost unaware traders over 1 billion $USD. </p><p>Intent Based Ags not only aggregate on-chain liquidity across exchanges and other aggregators, they also delegate execution to third parties referred to as "solvers". Solvers provide additional sources of liquidity by holding private inventory and matching trades peer-to-peer. This method avoids protocol fees and provides some of the best trades in DeFi.  </p><p>CoW Swap is an Intent Based Meta DEX aggregator that utilizes solvers and additional features including MEV protection. Any time you make a DeFi trade whether its in the form of trading token pairs or NFTs or lending tokens to a liquidity pool, opportunistic users, typically known as "searchers", may manipulate your trades resulting in poor prices, failed execution, and missed opportunities.  CoW Swap eliminates this issue as it's engineered and built with MEV protection. CoW Swap also provides users with an array of order types to choose from including:</p>  Market orders  Limit orders   TWAP orders - allow trades to be distributed over time   Programmatic orders - customizable, conditional orders that fire when certain on-chain conditions are met including asset prices, wallet balances, elapsed time and more.  CoW Hooks - allows users to pair any Ethereum action or set of actions with an order on the CoW Protocol while leveraging solvers to execute the actions together in sequence.   <p>CoW Swap is not only the largest Intent Based Aggregators, it's also one of largest DEX Ag's in the world and in November 2024 settled $6.2 billion USD of trades - more than twice as much volume as all intent based aggregators combined. Yet with a market cap of $236 million USD, CoW Swap (ticker COW) remains relatively unknown to the market and undervalued. Even with its recent move from around $0.25 to its current price of $0.78, there is plenty of upside potential from here especially considering the nearly $8 billion USD market cap touted by Uniswap.

<p>Imagine needing to notarize an important document, but the nearest notary is miles away. The alternative? Sending a photo of your ID via email or uploading a selfie to a platform. While convenient, these methods are rife with vulnerabilities—photos can be stolen, identities forged, and trust compromised. Enter liveness detection, a technology that ensures the person verifying their identity is physically present and not a spoof created with static images or videos.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at how liveness detection transforms workflows like notarizing identity documents and why businesses should move beyond outdated methods like selfie uploads or emailed IDs.</p>



 



 The Traditional Workflow: Notary Visits and Emailed IDs 



<p>In a manual identity verification process, a customer gathers their identity documents and heads to a notary. The notary inspects the ID, validates it against the customer’s appearance, and notarizes the document.</p>



<p>Alternatively, some platforms ask customers to email a photo of their ID and a selfie for verification. While these steps eliminate travel, they introduce new risks:</p>



 
 Photo Spoofing: Fraudsters can easily find or fabricate a customer’s image from online searches. 



 Static Verification Flaws: Static selfies and emailed images lack the depth to confirm whether the person is present. 



 Trust Erosion: Customers are increasingly wary of sharing sensitive documents via unsecured emails. 
 



<p>These workflows can be time-consuming, risky, and frustrating for customers and businesses alike.</p>



 



 The Liveness Detection Revolution 



<p>Liveness detection changes the game by verifying that an individual is physically present during the identity verification process. Unlike static photos or emails, this technology uses advanced algorithms to detect subtle, dynamic cues—like blinking, head movement, or depth perception—to confirm the presence of a real person.</p>



<p>Here’s how this plays out in a modern, digital verification process:</p>



 Step 1: Customer Initiates Verification 



<p>Using a secure KYC or KYB portal, the customer is prompted to upload a government-issued ID and participate in a quick liveness detection session.</p>



 Step 2: Liveness Detection in Action 



<p>The system guides the customer through simple actions, such as turning their head or blinking, while simultaneously scanning their biometric features. These real-time movements make it nearly impossible for fraudsters to use photos, videos, or masks to spoof the system.</p>



 Step 3: Automated Cross-Checks 



<p>Advanced AI validates the ID’s authenticity, matches it to the live biometric data, and cross-references the information against global sanctions lists or other risk databases.</p>



 Step 4: Instant Results 



<p>Within seconds, the verification is complete, and the business receives a secure, detailed report confirming the customer’s identity.</p>



 



 Why Selfie Uploads and Emailed IDs Are Risky 



<p>While selfie uploads and emailed IDs are still common, they’re increasingly insufficient in today’s threat landscape:</p>



 
 Easy to Spoof: With a simple Google search or basic editing tools, fraudsters can create convincing forgeries. 



 Lack of Depth Analysis: Static photos can’t confirm whether a person is physically present. 



 Data Security Concerns: Sensitive documents sent via email are prone to breaches and unauthorized access. 
 



<p>For businesses focused on security, compliance, and trust, relying on these outdated methods is no longer viable.</p>



 



 The Role of KYC and KYB Portals 



<p>With integrated KYC and KYB portals, businesses can deliver secure, seamless identity verification at scale. Here’s how these solutions enhance the liveness detection process:</p>



 
 Scalability: Both individual customers and businesses can verify identities in real-time without the need for physical presence. 



 Privacy-First Architecture: Biometric data is processed securely, adhering to regulations like GDPR. 



 Ease of Use: Customers enjoy a frictionless experience, completing verification from their smartphone or computer in minutes. 



 Compliance Made Simple: Built-in checks for AML regulations and global sanctions ensure adherence to the highest standards. 
 



<p>Whether verifying a customer for a financial transaction or conducting due diligence on a new business partner, these portals provide an all-in-one solution for secure identity verification.</p>



 



 Building Trust Through Better Verification 



<p>Liveness detection isn’t just about meeting regulatory requirements—it’s about building trust in every interaction. When customers know that their identities are verified securely, they’re more likely to engage confidently with your business.</p>



<p>For businesses, adopting advanced liveness detection technologies through KYC and KYB portals reduces fraud, streamlines workflows, and protects sensitive data. It’s a win-win for compliance and customer satisfaction.</p>



 



 The Future of Secure Verification 



<p>As fraudsters become more sophisticated, businesses must stay one step ahead. Liveness detection, paired with robust KYC and KYB solutions, offers a secure, scalable way to verify identities while delivering a seamless user experience.</p>



<p>Gone are the days of emailing IDs or relying on static selfies. The future of identity verification is dynamic, secure, and designed to build trust at every step. Whether notarizing an identity document or verifying a business partner, liveness detection ensures that the person on the other side of the screen is exactly who they claim to be.</p>

				  One of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials is the time savings from reduction in repetitive, manual data entry. Here we will examine just how much time can be saved by using decentralized identity to automatically fill in information for us.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>The time cost of forms</p>
<p>How many hours a year do you spend filling out forms? While it might seem like an annoyance that comes up every now and then, the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> released a report in 2022 that found that the government has <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Government-Digitization-Transforming-Government-to-Better-Serve-Americans.pdf">9,881 unique forms</a>, which took an estimated 10.3 billion hours to complete.</p>
<p>And these numbers are only increasing, if you use the tool provided by the <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAReport?operation=11">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</a> and apply it to 2024 numbers, you can see that we are up to almost 12.3 billion hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are five stand out departments with the most forms and impact. 2022 numbers provided by the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> report:</p>
<p>Department of the Treasury: 1,838 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services 1,242 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Agriculture 553 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Commerce 437 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal Communications Commission 436 forms</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there is so much paperwork to see a doctor? Or why you need to fill it in every time? It could have something to do with the 1,242 federal forms that the hospital or clinic will need to fill out to comply with the department of Health and Human services, not to mention updating your own charts and patient data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accuracy and user experience improvement</p>
<p>What we could all benefit from is a way to create authenticated data once and reuse it often —&nbsp; instantly, conveniently, with the touch of a button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is where Verifiable Credentials come to the rescue, the thing that will make you say “why haven’t we been doing this before?” Verifiable credentials can store any authenticated data (and especially personal data) in a tamper-proof way and allow the user to share it without the need for the verifier to check in with the source. Think of your web browser’s autofill function that remembers your name, email address, phone number, etc, but for the real world. These credentials can store any information that could be on that doctor’s form, such as height, eye color, name, address, or medical history, and share it accurately, instantly. Which is particularly handy because if you need a doctor, you’re probably not in the mood to do paperwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usefulness grows exponentially when you take a look at what this technology can do for organizations. An <a href="https://www.aha.org/">American Hospital Association</a> survey found that there are 6,120 hospitals in the United States, and between them had admitted <a href="https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals">33,679,935 patients</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud reduction</p>
<p>Aside from the time saved from not having to manually enter all this patient data, businesses can benefit in the form of eliminating human error and reducing fraud. If you have almost 33.7 million forms to fill out annually, there are going to be some errors or fraudulent information, which often take time and money to correct. By sharing pre-authenticated data digitally (which is what is inside a Verifiable Credential) you can instantly trust the data and use it however you need, such as verifying a patient’s identity and medical history to begin treatment. This technology also enables biometric patient check-in, which reduces fraud (getting treated under someone else’s name) or giving the incorrect medications due to not reliably identifying the patient as they leave the waiting room for treatment.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials have already seen traction in several industries for their ability to fast-track processes. An excellent example of this is in airports and travel, where their authenticated data can be used for pre-authorization for each traveler and leads to significantly faster international border and border crossing.

<p>Bitcoin traded below $90,000 for the first time in more than 3 weeks and below it's 50-day monthly EMA around $93,000. Opportunistic bulls more than likely added to their holdings in this range while short term bears and momentum traders cover their shorts to lock in profits. For those looking for an entry point, this may be a solid opportunity to wade into the market. </p><p>If you take a look at the daily Coinbase chart for January 13th 2025, you'll see a long wick rising from the lows of the day below 90,000 to nearly turn positive for the day. Similar action occurred during the two days prior possibly indicating the formation of a triple bottom. </p><p>The 6-hour chart below shows the rise from the lows on heavy volume with nearly twice the amount trading hands compared to the prior 6 hour window. </p><p>Over the next 24 to 48 hours, the price should continue to rise to at least test $95-$96K and may rapidly accelerate back over $100K and on to new all-time highs.

<p>La información verificable está transformando rápidamente el panorama de la tecnología Web3.  En <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/contactenos/" title="Extrimian">Extrimian</a> creemos que 2025 será un año clave para potenciar ecosistemas digitales seguros, eficientes e interoperables. Aquí te compartimos 5 tendencias clave para este año:</p>



 1. Ecosistemas integrados con identidades verificables 



<p>Imagina a un estudiante universitario que utiliza su credencial digital emitida por su institución para acceder a una cuenta fintech, contratar un seguro médico, alquilar una vivienda de confianza, resolver situaciones académicas y disfrutar de beneficios exclusivos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Esta interoperabilidad ya es una realidad gracias a soluciones basadas en SSI, como IDConnect de Extrimian, que resuelven problemas de identidad y verificación al conectar múltiples verticales en un solo ecosistema. Durante este año, veremos más adopción, más atracción y mayor sinergia entre actores e industrias.</p>







 2. IA como motor para la eficiencia 



<p>En 2025 los frameworks con inteligencia artificial revolucionarán la gestión de la identidad digital. Según un reporte de <a href="https://www.laecuaciondigital.com/tecnologias/inteligencia-artificial/ibm-potencia-watsonx-para-impulsar-la-inteligencia-artificial-empresarial/">IBM</a>, los procesos de gestión de datos impulsados por IA incrementarán su eficiencia en un 40%.&nbsp;</p>







<p>En este contexto, tecnologías como IDConnect integrarán IA para automatizar procesos clave, como la creación y verificación de credenciales, la detección de errores y la asistencia de un copiloto. Esto no solo mejorará la experiencia del usuario, sino que también incrementará la seguridad, la productividad y la eficiencia en la gestión operativa.</p>



 3. Crecimiento exponencial tras casos de éxito 



<p>El éxito de QuarkID y su implementación en miBA, que posicionó a Buenos Aires como la primera ciudad del mundo en usar credenciales verificables para gestión pública, ha marcado un antes y un después. Este modelo no solo ha inspirado a más gobiernos y empresas a adoptar SSI, sino que también abre las puertas a una expansión global.&nbsp;</p>



<p>El reporte de Cybersecurity Ventures estima que, para 2025, los costos del cibercrimen alcanzarán los $10.5 billones anuales, destacando la importancia de sistemas descentralizados como QuarkID para fortalecer la seguridad de los datos personales.</p>







 4. Idoneidad y conocimiento como ventaja competitiva 



<p><br>Durante este año, la diferencia clave en SSI estará en el conocimiento profundo y la experiencia. Las empresas con trayectoria en esta tecnología, que lideran su implementación y están a la vanguardia, ofrecerán soluciones más robustas, eficientes e integradas. La idoneidad será un valor diferencial frente a quienes recién comienzan, certificando la capacidad de integrar SSI de manera efectiva y maximizar su impacto en ecosistemas digitales interoperables.</p>







<p></p>



 5. SSI: Soluciones prácticas para Latinoamérica 



<p>En una región marcada por burocracia, costos elevados y fraude, SSI maximiza el ROI al simplificar procesos críticos como la validación de empleo, acceso seguro a plataformas y verificación de edad. Al reutilizar datos verificables, reduce costos, agiliza trámites y promueve la inclusión digital, fortaleciendo un ecosistema confiable y accesible para todos.</p>

<p>Non-Human Identities (NHIs) are finally making friends and influencing people—or at least they seem to be, given how much people are talking about them! This is great. People need to have a better sense of this brave new world of workloads, bots, and services. But this also means people need to have a better sense of what NHIs are not.</p>



<p>Whether you’re navigating workloads, APIs, or automated systems, the buzz around NHIs reflects their growing significance in everything from cloud computing to academic research. But as with any hot topic, there’s some confusion and waaaaaay too much marketing hype. I’ve written about NHIs <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/05/the-evolving-landscape-of-non-human-identity/">before</a>; today’s focus is on some of the main areas NHIs are different from human identities. The distinctions matter. </p>



 What NHIs Are Not 



<p>NHIs aren’t just API keys or OAuth tokens. Treating them as such would be like calling a password or a passkey a person’s digital identity—it oversimplifies their function and importance. Tokens, keys, and even credentials like X.509 certificates might help manage access, but they’re tools in the more extensive toolkit of workload identity management. (<a href="https://www.natoma.id/">Natoma</a> has published an interesting <a href="https://www.natoma.id/library/machine-to-machine-identity-maturity">white paper</a> on machine-to-machine authentication if you’re interested in more detail.)</p>



<p>NHIs represent software entities like batch processes, machine learning training models, or microservices operating independently of human identities. They operate at different speeds and have different selective disclosure requirements (yes, NHI <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prorock-spice-use-cases/">use cases</a> may include the need for selective disclosure). Proving who they are to access other systems or resources goes beyond simple authentication. Unlike human authentication, which often revolves around confirming a single user’s identity via passwords, passkeys, or biometrics, NHIs must establish trust and authorization in highly dynamic, machine-driven environments.</p>



 Comparing NHIs and Human Identities 



<p>Part of what makes understanding that NHIs are different is that, if you tilt your head just right, their requirements sound very familiar. They need to demonstrate their identity and the purpose and scope of their request. They benefit from cryptographic proofs, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or X.509 certificates, to securely bind their identity to a specific action. They have a lifecycle that must be managed. And let’s not forget they may need to cross trust boundaries in a federated workflow.</p>



<p>I’ll go into more detail next, but here’s the summary for those who want to get straight to the good stuff.</p>



LayerHuman IdentitiesNon-Human Identities (NHIs)Contextual ValidationRole-based access; occasional risk checksTask-specific; continuous granular checksCryptographic AssurancePasswords, passkeys, MFAJWTs, OAuth tokens, mTLS, certificatesDynamic/Ephemeral IdentitiesPersistent, lifecycle-drivenTransient, task-drivenCross-Boundary TrustSSO, federation (SAML, OIDC)Federated workload identities, SPIFFE



 Contextual Validation 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Humans typically authenticate using static credentials like passwords, passkeys, or biometric scans. 



 Access is often role-based, with permissions tied to organizational hierarchies or specific job functions (e.g., an employee accessing their email). 



 Context, like geolocation or time of access, may be used for risk-based decisions (e.g., blocking a login attempt from an unusual location). 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs rely on detailed, task-specific validation. For example, a microservice might only <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/">access</a> a database during specific operational windows and for specific query types. 



 Permissions are highly granular and tied to the NHI’s role in a larger process, such as allowing read-only access to one API endpoint while granting full control over another. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may operate across various environments, requiring continuous validation at scale. 
 



 Cryptographic Assurance 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Credentials often include usernames, passwords, or passkeys, validated via a central authentication server. 



 Additional layers like multi-factor authentication (MFA) involve OTPs or hardware tokens, but the process remains human-centric. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs use cryptographic credentials, such as JWTs, OAuth tokens, or X.509 certificates, to prove their identity and integrity. 



 These credentials are <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-arch/">typically</a> short-lived and dynamically issued, ensuring they can’t be reused if intercepted. 



 Cryptographic proofs (e.g., mutual TLS) are used to establish secure, trust-bound connections between services. Unlike humans, NHIs don’t rely on password-based authentication, making credential management more complex and secure when implemented correctly. 
 



 Dynamic and Ephemeral Identities 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Human identities are persistent and change only during significant lifecycle events, such as onboarding, promotions, or terminations. 



 Joiner/mover/leaver workflows handle these transitions in directories like Active Directory or IAM systems. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs are transient and may exist for just seconds or minutes, such as a containerized workload in Kubernetes that spins up to handle a specific task. 



 Unlike human-centric workflows, they require dynamic provisioning and de-provisioning of identities without manual intervention. (It would be nice if human-centric flows did this, too, but that’s not common. Yet.) 



 The absence of a natural lifecycle like “hiring” or “firing” makes traditional directory models ineffective for NHIs. 
 



 Cross-Boundary Trust 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Trust boundaries for humans are typically managed within a single organization or via federated identity systems like SAML or OpenID Connect. 



 Federated access is often used to enable single sign-on (SSO) across organizational or application boundaries. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs frequently operate in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, where they must authenticate across disparate trust domains. 



 Identity federation for NHIs requires advanced mechanisms, such as SPIFFE or OAuth token exchanges, to securely share identity and permissions between services in different ecosystems. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may not have a single source of truth (like an HR system), necessitating more robust and decentralized trust models. 
 



 A Better Way to Think About NHIs 



<p>If you’re still thinking that NHIs belong in your human identity systems, I’m just not sure what to tell you. I would say we can agree to disagree, but getting this wrong has implications for how everyone interacts online, so I will continue to make a stand on this hill. NHIs require a different approach to identity management, including:</p>



<p>• Workload Identity Federation: To seamlessly authenticate across cloud providers.</p>



<p>• Dynamic Secrets and Token-Based Authentication: To enhance security and minimize exposure risks.</p>



<p>• Standards Efforts Like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">WIMSE</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">SPICE</a>: To ensure consistent, secure service interactions.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>Embracing NHIs means rethinking your identity systems and recognizing that traditional identity paradigms need to evolve. I know it’s hard work and requires even more resources for your IAM programs, but NHIs are not magic. They cannot bring security and efficiency to your organization without investment. There are vendors out there (I am not one of them) who can guide you through designing or redesigning your systems to account for NHIs. You’ve got this.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>When Mark, a cofounder of a fast-growing fintech startup in the UK, realized his company needed to adhere to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) standards for KYB, KYC, and AML, he was overwhelmed. As his business scaled rapidly, the complexities of compliance threatened to slow down operations and erode investor confidence. Here’s how Mark built an effective AML program that not only met regulatory requirements but also became a cornerstone of his company’s success—all with the help of iComply’s innovative platform.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 1: Understand the Regulatory Requirements</p>



<p>Mark started by diving into the regulatory frameworks his company needed to follow. In the UK, the FCA’s stringent requirements on KYB and KYC processes set the standard. Mark also reviewed global guidelines from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the EU’s AML Directives to ensure his company’s policies aligned with international best practices.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Understanding Regulations:</p>



 
 Identify the specific regulations relevant to your industry and jurisdiction. 



 Consult official resources from regulatory bodies like the FCA or FATF. 



 Seek expert guidance or use tools that summarize complex requirements. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 2: Conduct a Risk Assessment</p>



<p>Next, Mark conducted a detailed risk assessment, analyzing his fintech’s customer base, transaction types, and geographic exposure. With iComply’s support, he categorized his customers by risk levels and identified high-risk activities requiring Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Risk Assessment:</p>



 
 Map out your customer demographics and transaction patterns. 



 Identify high-risk geographies and customer profiles. 



 Document risks and prioritize them for action. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 3: Develop and Document Policies and Procedures</p>



<p>Mark knew that robust policies and procedures would be the backbone of his AML program. iComply’s policy and procedure documentation tools helped him create clear guidelines for:</p>



 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Verifying identities and monitoring activities. 



 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Extra checks for high-risk scenarios. 



 Reporting Mechanisms: Filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) efficiently. 
 



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Policies and Procedures:</p>



 
 Use customizable templates to address specific business needs. 



 Ensure policies cover all required areas, from CDD to reporting. 



 Review and update documentation regularly. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 4: Appoint an AML Compliance Officer</p>



<p>Mark appointed Emily, a dedicated AML Compliance Officer, who used iComply’s tailored training resources to hit the ground running. Emily took charge of:</p>



 
 Implementing and managing the AML program. 



 Acting as the primary contact for regulators. 



 Ensuring the team’s adherence to policies. 
 



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Appointing an Officer:</p>



 
 Select someone with expertise in AML and compliance. 



 Provide them with authority and resources to act effectively. 



 Offer ongoing training and support. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 5: Train Your Team</p>



<p>Mark’s entire team needed to understand their roles in compliance. Using iComply’s AML training modules, he ensured employees could recognize and report suspicious activities.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Training:</p>



 
 Schedule regular training sessions tailored to job roles. 



 Include practical examples of red flags and reporting processes. 



 Update training materials as regulations evolve. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 6: Implement Technology Solutions</p>



<p>To support compliance, Mark integrated iComply’s platform into his operations. The platform provided holistic, integrated solutions to streamline and connect his KYB, KYC, and AML workflows. iComply provided:</p>



 
 Policy and Procedures: Streamlined creation of up-to-date workflow documentation. 



 KYB Automation: Onboard corporates and identify their directors, officers, beneficial owners, and other related parties. 



 KYC Automation: Simplified customer onboarding, identity verification, risk scoring, refresh and reviews. 



 AML Automation: Screen and monitor all clients and related parties in real time for new sanctions, political exposure, crime, money laundering and terrorist financing. 



 Audit Support: Tools for managing records and preparing reports for reviews. 
 



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Technology:</p>



 
 Identify gaps in your compliance processes that technology can address. 



 Select scalable, user-friendly solutions. 



 Test systems thoroughly before implementation. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 7: Monitor and Audit Regularly</p>



<p>Regular audits became a cornerstone of Mark’s compliance strategy. iComply’s platform helped him organize documentation and streamline audit preparation, ensuring a smooth process during regulatory reviews.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Monitoring and Auditing:</p>



 
 Conduct regular internal reviews of compliance practices. 



 Maintain a clear audit trail with organized records. 



 Engage third-party experts for independent assessments. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 8: Foster a Culture of Compliance</p>



<p>Mark and his cofounders led by example, embedding compliance into the company’s values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Culture:</p>



 
 Communicate the importance of compliance at all levels. 



 Recognize and reward compliance efforts. 



 Encourage employees to report concerns without fear of retaliation. 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 9: Report and Respond to Incidents</p>



<p>When suspicious activity arose, Mark’s team acted quickly. This ensured prompt submission of SARs and effective incident resolution.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Incident Response:</p>



 
 Establish clear procedures for identifying and reporting issues. 



 Train staff on how to handle incidents. 



 Review incidents to strengthen future prevention efforts 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 10: Stay Current with Regulatory Changes</p>



<p>With iComply’s regulatory updates to their platform, Mark stayed ahead of new requirements. This proactive approach allowed his company to adapt seamlessly to evolving standards without the need for a big technical lift.</p>



<p>Mark’s Checklist for Staying Current:</p>



 
 Subscribe to updates from relevant regulatory bodies. 



 Participate in industry forums and workshops. 



 Regularly review and update AML policies 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Building Trust Through Compliance</p>



<p>Thanks to iComply, Mark transformed a daunting compliance challenge into a streamlined, cost-effective process. His fintech now operates with confidence, meeting FCA standards and building trust with customers, investors, and regulators. By following Mark’s example, you too can create an AML program that safeguards your organization and supports sustainable growth.</p>

							  Strong Convictions, Loosely Held: El Prof’s DeFi Predictions for 2025   <p>What’s in a prediction that makes it worthwhile? Is it predicting tomorrow’s closing Bitcoin price? Maybe. Surely the finance people who read this say definitely, but the information arbitrage gap is closing so fast these days that competing algorithms predicting the price create a new chaos unto themselves.</p>  <p>My philosophy when it comes to predicting trends and the future is “strong convictions, loosely held.” I’m easily swayed by compelling new data. Anyone who wants to consider themselves rational has to be — even, especially when it conflicts with our priors, or our ego. (The latter of which is usually the problem when it comes to making accurate predictions in the first place.)</p>  <p>Case in point: Solana is hovering around $180. I said it wouldn’t go below $200. Just goes to show you should not take any advice on financial positioning from me. A qualified investment advisor can coach you on when to buy it. I can just tell you if it’s building towards a real market or not. So, with those obligatory risk disclosures aside, here’s my wildest speculations for what 2025 could have in store.</p>  <p>The obvious potential catalyst is Trump’s looming inauguration. (For more on that, read to the end.) With a leader in charge of the nation’s ego —&nbsp;and as obviously sensitive of his own — you bet your ass leading innovation in the fields of security, cryptography, distributed ledgers and filestore systems, peer2peer protocols, and quantum computing are going to be prioritized over anything else. Why? These are the technologies required to operate as sovereign individuals in an increasingly unified and artificially intelligent world, and that’s good for business.</p>  <p>To that end, here are my official predictions for 2025:</p>   Q1     <p>Community-managed AI agents&nbsp;with personalities. (s/o @<a href="https://x.com/newglenneth?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=strong-convictions-loosely-held">newgleen.eth</a>&nbsp;for inspo on this one.) In other words, personified tokens used to control the weights of different interests that can be held, governed, and stored on a chain. Now that these LLM agent systems have been connected to social media accounts and the like, there are channels for investors to interact with these “characters” and watch them come to life.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Crypto payments to creators&nbsp;led by X, followed by Meta, Reddit, and TikTok (if it survives the next couple weeks). The normalization of crypto as social media compensation could in turn stoke the development of utility tokens across all major platforms to reward quality content production programmatically. X already started creator payouts and has been teasing wanting to have a wallet app for years. This one doesn’t seem too far-fetched, or far off.</p>     Q2     <p>A social credit scoring system. Elon Musk is already flirting with this one on the app formerly known as Twitter, although the logical extreme of leveraging&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/25-regulatory-bete-noire/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=strong-convictions-loosely-held">ZK proofs</a>&nbsp;for identity management is more likely to come from&nbsp;Black Mirror&nbsp;rejects like Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project. Let’s grok about that.</p>  <p>Meta will push their AI agents&nbsp;even further to promote products and engage with its real users. Given the success of the meta narrative of AI agents in general, it’s only a matter of time until the gap is bridged. Maybe it will finally land on a genuinely cool product in the process. I’m thinking one-click AI image generation with the finalized outputs minted to chain as NFTs? Feel free to steal this idea, Zuck. I know you’re no stranger to that.</p>     Q3     <p>Tokenized brand loyalty programs. Your contact information, the ability to communicate with you, and some basic information about your demographics are worth $10 to $100s per year to brands. That’s how much their advertising calculations tell them their customer retention costs, on a unit economics basis. Imagine capturing a share of that value from the hundreds to thousands of brands for which you’re a potential consumer. The ability to reward your social behavior, which services their marketing and promotion aims, is a more efficient deployment of that capital. With two consistent years of hype behind the web3 space again, loyalty-oriented platforms could emerge to service the major brands interested in the space again.</p>  <p>First major learn-to-earn platform. On-chain game mechanics are still too slow for the quality gameplay expected of the latest systems. But in pursuit of those game mechanics, retro style games will enable the creation of learning management systems that can leverage the game mechanics to offer a learn-to-earn platform, where a course of information with quizzes can be planned and the completion of levels will be rewarded with tokens. I expect companies to be early adopters, creating novel structures for incentivizing workforce development.</p>     Q4     <p>Personal finance agents. We’ve already seen some mainstream use cases for agentic management of finances. Bots in web3 are nothing new, but many are a group pot that share and distribute risk. I think the next evolution will be to have a chatbot interface powered by an LLM and your personal data, aimed at helping you build a more aligned financial portfolio over time. (One without the misaligned incentives of traditional financial agents.) With rumors of a tokenized stock exchange in Texas, it’s only a matter of time. What should I buy schwabot?</p>  <p>Digital ID wallets&nbsp;will emerge as a public utility — like the one we are building here at playhaus.&nbsp;&nbsp;The data that represents you digitally is valuable to systems like AI. “DID wallets” will allow you to capture that value through chain mechanics that designate you as the originator of the data, not the platform you executed the transaction on, and that will make all the difference. And it’s all built on the back of our buzzword of the week: composability.</p>    <p>—El Prof</p>

							         How Long Can the Trump Bump Last?   <p>The crypto sphere has been celebrating the 2024 U.S. election for the past month, with Bitcoin breaching $100,000 and peaking above $106,000 in December. But at the time of writing, it has dropped back down to just above $93,500, and Solana, as the venerable El Prof mentioned, is below its peak as well.</p>  <p>Has the Trump rally hit its ceiling before inauguration day?</p>  <p>Maybe not. But in the spirit of predictions, I’d argue it’s a safe bet that the major tokens won’t regain their recent highs on hype alone. Much of the rally has been predicated on what traders assume President-elect Donald Trump will do upon his return to the White House in 2025. His campaign has made clear intentions to turn the United States into the “crypto capital of the planet.” But with said return right around the corner, any future catalysts are less likely to be based on intentions than on actions.</p>  <p>To be sure, Trump’s earliest actions do suggest an intent to follow through on that campaign promise. Under the Biden administration, outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s aggressive regulatory stance caused ripples across the crypto community. Trump, in contrast, has tapped Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and known crypto advocate, to lead the charge at the SEC. Atkins’ support for cryptocurrencies could lead to looser regulations and a more welcoming environment for digital assets, at least in the early days of Trump’s second term.</p>  <p>Trump has also taken steps to fill key positions with figures who also heavily invested in the success of the crypto sector — quite literally. He appointed David Sacks, a venture capitalist with ties to both the crypto and AI industries, as a “crypto czar.” However, the rush to embrace digital assets without significant oversight comes with its own set of challenges. Critics, including financial expert Carol Alexander, warn that relaxing regulations could lead to greater market manipulation by professional traders at the expense of average investors. These concerns are valid, especially given the chaotic and speculative nature of meme coins and other cryptocurrencies that could benefit from looser rules.</p>  <p>Then of course there’s Trump’s suggestion of a U.S. “strategic national bitcoin stockpile” —&nbsp;a proposal that the U.S. government begin actively purchasing bitcoin to build a reserve, leveraging seized assets from criminal investigations. Whether this comes to pass, or is viewed as a positive development by the crypto space, remain up in the air. A bitcoin reserve doesn’t exactly smack of MAGA-world priority, and even if it does materialize, it would seem to us to be a decisive blow against the democratization and decentralization of digital assets. Of course, crypto degens aren’t well-known for their rational, in-depth analysis. So such a move could still prove to be a short-term catalyst. If nothing else, it might incite some buying activity as Bitcoin maxis hurry to shore up their holdings, with the G-Men throwing their Fed-oras in the ring.</p>  <p>Another stumbling block could be the ample crypto-related conflicts of interest in Trump World. Eric Trump, for example, is reportedly linked to the launch of World Liberty Financial, a new crypto company. While Trump Jr. is not directly part of his father’s administration, his involvement in this space raises eyebrows, especially when paired with Trump’s ongoing relationships with major international players, including those from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Then again, DeFi enthusiasts have shown a persistent willingness to overlook obvious corruption in the quest for quick gains, and there’s no reason to believe that will change on a federal scale.</p>  <p>In other words, there are plenty of reasons to remain both optimistic —&nbsp;and cautious — for the trajectory of crypto over the next four years. When the future of a technology hinges on the rationality (or lack thereof) of degenerate gamblers and our Reality Show Host in Chief, it will probably pay to stay on your toes.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

 What is a validator?&nbsp; 



<p>A validator is a crucial participant in blockchain networks, responsible for verifying transactions, maintaining consensus, and ensuring the network’s security. In Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, validators are chosen based on the tokens they stake as collateral. The more they stake, the higher their chances of validating new blocks.</p>



<p>Validators verify transactions, propose new blocks, and uphold the network’s rules. They are rewarded for honest actions but risk losing their staked tokens if they act maliciously. This system ensures network security and fairness.</p>



<p>Validators play a vital role in maintaining the decentralization, security, and reliability of blockchain networks, making them essential to the system’s success.</p>

 What does being a validator mean? 



<p>Being a validator means becoming a cornerstone of a blockchain network, tasked with upholding its security, efficiency, and trustworthiness. Validators are essential for ensuring the smooth operation of decentralized systems. Here’s what the role involves:</p>



 
 Verifying Transactions: Validators check that each transaction meets the network’s rules, such as having valid signatures, sufficient account balances, and no double-spending. For instance, Ethereum 2.0 requires validators to process thousands of transactions daily to keep the network functional.<br> 



 Validating Blocks: They review and approve new blocks by verifying the transactions within them. Once approved, these blocks are added to the blockchain permanently. Validators ensure these blocks adhere to the consensus protocol, whether it’s Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).<br> 



 Maintaining Consensus: Validators participate in consensus mechanisms like Ethereum’s PoS, where they use staked tokens to confirm the blockchain’s current state. This process ensures all participants agree on the network’s data and prevents malicious activities like creating conflicting chains.<br> 



 Ensuring Network Security: Validators act as the first line of defense against cyberattacks, such as 51% attacks or double-spending. Their diligence protects the blockchain from being compromised. For example, on networks like Solana, validators contribute to processing over 65,000 transactions per second, showcasing their critical role in network performance. 
 



<p>Being a validator also comes with incentives—validators earn rewards like transaction fees or newly minted tokens for their work. However, the role demands responsibility: validators in PoS systems risk losing their staked tokens if they act dishonestly, ensuring they always operate in the network’s best interest.</p>



<p>Ultimately, being a validator is not just about technical tasks – it’s about ensuring the blockchain remains decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy for everyone.</p>

 Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake (PoW vs. PoS) 



<p><a href="https://blog.herond.org/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-what-is-different/">Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> are the two most popular consensus mechanisms in blockchain. Both play a crucial role in securing networks and maintaining operations, but they differ significantly in their approaches, energy consumption, and efficiency.</p>



 Proof of Work (PoW) 



<p>PoW is the original consensus mechanism, used by blockchains like Bitcoin.</p>



 
 How it works: Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems using computational power. The first to solve the problem adds a new block to the blockchain. 



 Rewards: Miners earn cryptocurrency and transaction fees for their efforts. 



 Challenges: PoW is highly energy-intensive and requires expensive hardware, leading to high operational costs and significant environmental impact. 
 



<p>Example: According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin’s annual energy consumption is comparable to that of small countries like Argentina.</p>



 Proof of Stake (PoS) 



<p>PoS is a more modern and energy-efficient consensus mechanism, used by blockchains like Ethereum 2.0 and Cardano.</p>



 
 How it works: Validators “stake” a certain amount of cryptocurrency to gain the right to verify transactions and propose new blocks. 



 Rewards: Validators earn rewards based on the amount they stake. 



 Advantages: PoS is far more energy-efficient and scalable than PoW, making it more environmentally friendly and suitable for large-scale applications. 
 



<p>Example: After Ethereum transitioned from PoW to PoS (known as the Ethereum Merge), its energy consumption decreased by 99.95%, highlighting PoS’s sustainability.</p>



 Key Comparisons 



CriteriaProof of Work (PoW)Proof of Stake (PoS)Energy ConsumptionHighLowMechanismBased on computational powerBased on staked tokensScalabilityLimitedHighOperational CostsExpensiveAffordable



<p>Both PoW and PoS have their strengths and weaknesses, serving different purposes. While PoW laid the foundation for blockchain technology, PoS is emerging as the preferred choice for its energy efficiency and scalability. The transition of Ethereum from PoW to PoS exemplifies the industry’s move toward more sustainable solutions for the future of blockchain.</p>


 
 


 Validators Vs. Miners: What’s the Difference? 



<p>In blockchain networks, validators and miners serve different purposes depending on the consensus mechanism used. Here’s a simple breakdown of their roles and differences:</p>



 Validators: The Backbone of Proof of Stake (PoS) 



<p>Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and approving blocks in Proof of Stake (PoS) systems. Instead of relying on computational power, they “stake” tokens as collateral to gain the right to validate transactions. Their tasks include:</p>



 
 Ensuring transactions follow network rules. 



 Proposing and validating new blocks. 



 Maintaining the blockchain’s consensus efficiently. 
 



<p>Validators are rewarded with transaction fees or newly minted tokens, but they risk losing their staked tokens if they act dishonestly. PoS mechanisms, used by networks like Ethereum 2.0 and Solana, are known for being energy-efficient and scalable.</p>



 Miners: The Workhorses of Proof of Work (PoW) 



<p>Miners, on the other hand, play a crucial role in Proof of Work (PoW) systems. They compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles using computational power, and the first to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain. Their rewards include:</p>



 
 Newly minted cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin block rewards). 



 Transaction fees for processing transactions. 
 



<p>However, mining is resource-intensive and requires significant energy, making it less sustainable than PoS systems. PoW mechanisms, like those used in Bitcoin, rely on high computational power to maintain security and decentralization.</p>



 Key Differences 



 
 Energy Usage: Validators (PoS) use far less energy compared to miners (PoW). 



 Mechanism: Validators stake tokens, while miners rely on solving puzzles. 



 Efficiency: PoS systems are faster and more scalable, while PoW systems are more energy-intensive but highly secure. 
 



 Insightful Example 



<p>The shift from PoW to PoS, as seen in Ethereum’s Merge update, highlights the growing preference for validator-based systems. Ethereum reduced its energy consumption by 99.95% after transitioning to PoS, showcasing how validators are a more sustainable alternative to miners.</p>



<p>In summary, both validators and miners are essential in blockchain networks but serve different functions based on the consensus mechanism. While miners laid the foundation for early blockchain systems like Bitcoin, validators are shaping the future of blockchain with efficient and eco-friendly systems like PoS.</p>


 
 


 How much can you get as a Validator? 



<p>The earnings of a validator in a blockchain network can vary significantly based on several factors, including the network, the number of tokens staked, and the reward mechanism. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how validator rewards work:</p>



 Types of Rewards 



<p>Validators earn rewards through two primary sources:</p>



 
 Newly Minted Tokens: Many blockchain networks, like Ethereum and Solana, distribute newly minted tokens to validators as an incentive. 



 Transaction Fees: Validators also earn a share of the transaction fees collected from users on the network. 
 



<p>For example, Ethereum 2.0 validators can earn an average annual yield of 4-10%, depending on the total amount of ETH staked on the network.</p>



 Factors That Affect Rewards 



<p>The amount a validator earns is influenced by:</p>



 
 Staked Tokens: The more tokens you stake, the higher your chances of being selected to validate transactions and earn rewards. 



 Network Inflation: Some blockchains have fixed inflation rates that determine the amount of newly minted tokens distributed. 



 Performance: Consistently validating transactions accurately ensures maximum rewards, while downtime or mistakes can lead to penalties or slashed tokens. 



 Competition: As the number of validators increases, the rewards are distributed among more participants, which can reduce individual earnings. 
 



<p>For instance, Cosmos validators earn an average annual reward of 7-20%, depending on network parameters and their staking pool size.</p>



 Potential Risks 



<p>While the rewards can be lucrative, becoming a validator comes with risks:</p>



 
 Token Volatility: Rewards are paid in cryptocurrency, so their value can fluctuate with market conditions. 



 Slashing Penalties: Validators can lose a portion of their staked tokens for malicious activities or extended downtime. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Validators are at the heart of blockchain innovation, particularly in the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). By staking tokens, they maintain security, achieve consensus, and drive decentralization—all while earning rewards for their efforts. Whether you’re a blockchain enthusiast or a potential validator, understanding their role highlights the trustless, secure, and energy-efficient future of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Italian digital identity provider InfoCert suffered a data breach affecting 5.5 million customers, with stolen data, including names, tax codes, and contact details, appearing on the dark web.

<p>U.S. Sanctions Chinese Firm Integrity Tech Over Alleged Cyber Espionage Links to Flax Typhoon</p>



<p>The U.S. sanctioned Beijing-based Integrity Technology Group, linked to China-backed hacking group Flax Typhoon, for aiding cyberattacks on U.S. entities, including critical infrastructure, universities, and media. Between 2022 and 2023, Integrity Tech allegedly operated a botnet of 260,000 devices to hide Flax Typhoon’s activities, dismantled by the FBI in September 2024. The sanctions follow a December cyberattack on the Treasury Department’s OFAC, attributed to China-backed hackers, potentially exposing sensitive sanctions-related data. The U.S. has labeled Chinese cyber actors a persistent national security threat. Integrity Tech has not responded to the allegations. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/03/us-sanctions-chinese-cyber-firm-linked-to-flax-typhoon-hacks/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IH6mpxuogSpaHctWAAHsOmAJHKC4FsyiP3j6eIyZ7fAVpxFSasQ6m3e_LHjaaL4hZRQx_">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Hong Kong Police Bust AI-Powered Deepfake Syndicate Behind $4.4 Billion Global ‘Pig Butchering’ Scams</p>



<p>Hong Kong authorities dismantled a syndicate using AI deepfakes and dating apps to defraud victims in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, stealing over HK$34 million. Operating from Kowloon Bay, 31 suspects were arrested, and HK$100 million in assets, including cash and luxury goods, was seized. The group used face-swapping technology to create fake personas, luring victims into romantic relationships and convincing them to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms. Victims were blocked from withdrawing funds under pretexts like taxes, a hallmark of “pig butchering” scams. The operation, involving extensive money laundering, was led by the Commercial Crime Bureau. <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/hong-kong-crime-ring-used-deepfakes-to-steal-millions/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8IH6mpxuogSpaHctWAAHsOmAJHKC4FsyiP3j6eIyZ7fAVpxFSasQ6m3e_LHjaaL4hZRQx_">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Apple has agreed to a $95 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit alleging Siri violated user privacy by unintentionally recording conversations and sharing them with third parties, including advertisers. Filed in October 2023 in Oakland, California, the settlement awaits approval from US District Judge Jeffrey White.

<p>U.S. Court Rules FCC Lacks Authority to Reinstate Net Neutrality, Shifting Focus to State Laws and Congress</p>



<p>A U.S. appeals court ruled that the FCC cannot reinstate net neutrality rules, citing the Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision limiting federal agency powers. The decision blocks Biden administration efforts to restore open internet principles but leaves state-level rules, like California’s, intact. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on Congress to legislate net neutrality, while industry leaders and former FCC Chair Ajit Pai praised the ruling, favoring investment over federal oversight. The decision may hinder federal internet regulation, though further legal action is possible. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-administration-net-neutrality-rules-2025-01-02/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8_NTiwS3hon0aU1vaQ1avXBZyZi5YGPGY3_fAoI00K0drwJllQAls1ttC2-QpnyNFJx8J7">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Social wallet login is transforming how we access digital platforms, making it easier and more convenient for users to navigate between Web2 and Web3. Instead of managing complicated private keys or passphrases, users can now log in using familiar accounts like Facebook, Google, or Apple ID. This simple yet powerful feature is bridging the gap between traditional internet experiences and blockchain-based applications, paving the way for wider Web3 adoption.&nbsp;</p>

 What is social login? 



<p>Social Login is a quick and easy way for users to access websites or apps using their existing social media accounts, like Facebook, Google, or Twitter. Instead of creating new accounts or remembering extra passwords, users can log in with just one click. This not only saves time but also simplifies the user experience, making it easier for platforms to attract and retain users.</p>



<p>In the context of Web3, Social Wallet Login is still a new concept. Traditionally, Web3 users log in using wallet passphrases or private keys, which are long and complex. By integrating Social Login, crypto platforms can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain technology.</p>


 
 


 4 popular forms of social wallet logins 



<p>Social wallet logins are becoming increasingly common as they simplify access to platforms. Here are four widely used types:</p>



 
 Facebook Login: With over 2.9 billion monthly users worldwide, Facebook Login is one of the most popular options. It allows users to sign in quickly using their Facebook accounts, making the process seamless and widely accessible. 



 Google Login: Leveraging Google’s vast ecosystem, this method enables users to log in securely and effortlessly with their Google accounts. It’s a convenient option for platforms aiming to tap into Google’s trusted services and user base. 



 Apple ID Login: Tailored for Apple users, this method offers a simple and fast login experience. However, it’s mainly suitable for users within Apple’s ecosystem, like iPhone or MacBook owners. 



 LinkedIn Login: Often used in professional settings, LinkedIn Login is perfect for platforms requiring professional profiles or credentials. It’s ideal for job portals, networking sites, and other career-focused applications. 
 



<p>Each form of social wallet login offers unique benefits, helping users connect to platforms effortlessly while enhancing overall user experience.</p>

 The importance of integrating Social Wallet Login into Crypto Web3 Wallets 



<p>Integrating Social Wallet Login into Web3 wallets is a game-changer, especially in the crypto world where user adoption still faces hurdles. Here’s why it’s important:</p>



 
 Simplifying User Experience: Traditional Web3 wallets require users to manage complex private keys or passphrases, which can be intimidating. Social Wallet Login simplifies this by allowing users to log in with familiar social media accounts, making the process faster and less overwhelming. 



 Recovering Access Made Easy: Losing private keys can lead to losing access to crypto assets permanently. Social Login ties wallets to recoverable social accounts, ensuring users can regain access if they forget their credentials. 



 Encouraging Adoption: By offering a seamless and familiar login process, Social Wallet Login lowers the barrier to entry for new users, encouraging broader adoption of crypto wallets and decentralized apps (dApps). 



 Enhanced Identity Verification (KYC): Social media accounts often have built-in identity verification. Integrating these into Web3 wallets can streamline KYC processes, especially for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that require compliance. 
 



<p>This integration not only boosts convenience but also paves the way for mass adoption of Web3 by bridging the gap between traditional users and the complexities of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Metaverse real estate is here and changing the game. Imagine owning virtual land where you can create anything like stores, offices, or even theme parks – in a limitless digital world. Secured as NFTs on the blockchain, these properties are transparent, secure, and full of potential. Whether you’re an investor or just exploring, let’s dive into how metaverse real estate is shaping the future.</p>

 What is Virtual Real Estate? 



<p>Virtual real estate is exactly what it sounds like – digital land and properties that exist in the metaverse, a growing network of 3D virtual spaces. Think of it as the online version of real-world real estate, where you can buy, sell, lease, or even build on digital plots of land. These properties can host anything from virtual events and storefronts to galleries, offices, or even homes, creating spaces where people can connect and interact.</p>



<p>What makes virtual real estate unique is that it’s secured on the blockchain, with ownership recorded as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This means every transaction is transparent, secure, and impossible to tamper with. Just like in the physical world, the value of these properties depends on location, utility, and how much engagement they attract. For example, virtual plots in high-traffic areas of the metaverse are like owning prime real estate on a busy city street.</p>



<p>As more people and businesses embrace the metaverse, virtual real estate is becoming a new frontier for investment and creativity. It’s not just about owning digital land – it’s about reimagining how we use space in a virtual world, with the only limit being your imagination.</p>

 5 differences between Metaverse Real Estate and Traditional Real Estate 



<p>Metaverse real estate is reshaping how we think about property ownership. Unlike physical land, virtual properties exist entirely in a digital world, offering new opportunities and challenges. Here’s a closer look at how metaverse real estate differs from traditional real estate.</p>



 Digital vs. Physical Space 



<p>Traditional real estate is tangible—it’s land, buildings, and spaces you can physically see and touch. Metaverse real estate, on the other hand, exists in a virtual environment. These digital plots of land are represented as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the blockchain, giving them a unique identity and ownership record. While you can’t step on virtual land, it can host everything from virtual concerts to digital storefronts.</p>



 Unlimited Creativity 



<p>Physical properties are often bound by zoning laws, structural limitations, and geographic constraints. In the metaverse, your imagination sets the boundaries. A small virtual plot can become a sprawling digital park or a towering skyscraper. There are no construction permits to worry about—just the platform’s technological capabilities and your vision.</p>



 How Value Is Determined 



<p>The value of physical real estate depends on factors like location, infrastructure, and nearby amenities. In the metaverse, value is driven by virtual foot traffic, proximity to popular digital spaces, and platform demand. A virtual plot next to a well-known NFT gallery or popular digital event venue can be worth significantly more than a less trafficked location.</p>



 Buying and Selling 



<p>Traditional real estate transactions involve lawyers, agents, and mountains of paperwork. In the metaverse, buying or selling property is fast, secure, and transparent. Transactions are handled on the blockchain, often using cryptocurrencies, and ownership is represented by NFTs. There’s no need for middlemen, making the process quick and hassle-free.</p>



 Maintenance and Upkeep 



<p>Owning physical property comes with ongoing responsibilities like repairs, renovations, and property taxes. Virtual real estate, however, requires digital upkeep, such as updating software, securing against hacks, or improving user experience. It’s generally less costly and time-consuming compared to maintaining a physical property.</p>

 The future of Metaverse real estate: is it the next big investment? 



<p>Mark Zuckerberg, one of the most prominent advocates for the metaverse, stated in 2022:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The metaverse will not be built by one company. It will be built by creators and developers making new experiences and digital items that are interoperable and unlock a massively larger creative economy than anything we see today.”</p>



<p>This highlights the potential of metaverse real estate as a collaborative ecosystem where virtual spaces will serve as hubs for interaction, commerce, and innovation.</p>



<p>Unlike physical real estate, virtual properties are free from geographic constraints, offering unique ways to host events, build experiences, and engage audiences. However, the technology is still evolving, with challenges like simplifying property transactions and improving user interfaces. Despite these hurdles, the growing interest in web3 and the metaverse indicates strong potential for future growth.</p>



<p>For investors, metaverse real estate offers both opportunities and risks. While early adopters have seen impressive returns, the market remains speculative and heavily reliant on technological advancements. Whether it becomes the “next big thing” or stays niche will depend on how quickly society embraces this digital frontier.</p>


 
 


 What was the biggest metaverse real estate purchase to date? 



<p>The largest metaverse real estate transaction to date took place in May 2022, when Curzio Research acquired 19 commercial properties in TCG World for a staggering $5 million. This record-breaking purchase eclipsed previous high-profile deals, such as Republic Realm’s $4.3 million investment in The Sandbox in November 2021. These monumental transactions underscore the surging interest and value in virtual real estate, as the metaverse increasingly becomes a viable frontier for business and investment opportunities.</p>



 Notable Success Stories in Metaverse Real Estate 



<p>Beyond these headline-grabbing transactions, several projects have demonstrated the practical utility and profitability of virtual real estate, showcasing the diversity and possibilities within the metaverse:</p>



 Decentraland’s Genesis Plaza: A Gateway to the Metaverse 



<p>Located at the center of Decentraland, Genesis Plaza is more than just a landmark—it’s a community hub. With interactive exhibits and art installations, this space serves as a welcoming zone for newcomers to the platform. It highlights the potential of creating virtual communal areas that foster engagement, creativity, and exploration in the metaverse.</p>



 CryptoVoxels’ Neon District: A Commercial Hotspot 



<p>The Neon District in CryptoVoxels is a vibrant, bustling zone filled with galleries, shops, and entertainment hubs.

<p>Yield farming, often called “liquidity mining,” is a DeFi strategy that lets you earn rewards by putting your crypto assets to work. By providing liquidity to platforms like Uniswap or Curve Finance, you can earn passive income in the form of interest, fees, or tokens. This guide breaks down how yield farming works, the best platforms to use, and the risks you should watch out for before getting started.</p>

 What Is Yield Farming? 



<p>Yield farming, often referred to as “liquidity mining,” is a strategy within the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that enables users to maximize returns on their cryptocurrency holdings. By supplying liquidity to DeFi protocols, participants can earn rewards, typically in the form of governance tokens specific to that platform.</p>



<p>In simple terms, yield farming can be compared to “farming” with crypto assets. Users “plant” their cryptocurrencies into DeFi platforms such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, or staking pools to “harvest” rewards. These rewards might include interest, transaction fees, or newly minted tokens.</p>



 The role of Yield farming in DeFi ecosystem 



<p>Beyond being a way to generate passive income, yield farming plays a crucial role in fostering the growth and sustainability of the DeFi ecosystem. Platforms rely on liquidity providers (LPs) to keep the system operational, ensuring there is sufficient liquidity for borrowing, lending, and trading activities. For users, this offers an opportunity to not only earn but also actively support decentralized financial innovation.</p>



<p>Interesting to note is how yield farming rewards have transformed over time. Initially, governance tokens like COMP (from Compound) or CRV (from Curve Finance) dominated the rewards landscape. Today, some platforms experiment with hybrid incentives, including stablecoins, cross-chain rewards, or even NFT collectibles, further diversifying yield farming’s appeal and applicability.</p>

 How Does Yield Farming Work? 



<p>Yield farming operates on the foundation of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, where Liquidity Providers (LPs) play a central role. LPs provide liquidity by depositing their cryptocurrency assets into liquidity pools—smart contracts that hold funds to facilitate decentralized financial activities such as lending, borrowing, and token trading.</p>



 The Basic Process: 



 
 Providing Liquidity to a Pool:<br>Users deposit their crypto assets (e.g., ETH or USDT) into liquidity pools. In return, they receive a share of the transaction fees generated within the pool, such as those from token swaps or lending activities. 



 Earning Rewards:<br>Beyond transaction fees, many protocols incentivize liquidity provision by distributing additional rewards, often in the form of governance tokens or newly issued platform tokens (a process known as Liquidity Mining). These rewards encourage LPs to continuously supply liquidity, thereby supporting the platform’s growth. 



 Smart Contract Coordination:<br>Smart contracts manage the entire process, including locking LPs’ assets, calculating their share of rewards, and automating transactions within the pool. These contracts ensure transparency, security, and efficiency. 
 


 
 


 Which Platforms Are Best for Yield Farming? 



<p>Choosing the best yield farming platform depends on individual goals and investment strategies. Below are some of the most prominent platforms, known for their stability, attractive yields, and advanced features:</p>



 Uniswap 



<p>Uniswap, one of the most popular platforms in DeFi, is renowned for its Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. Users supply liquidity to pools and earn rewards through transaction fees. It’s an ideal choice for those seeking a transparent, user-friendly, and straightforward solution.</p>



 Curve Finance 



<p>Focused on stablecoins, Curve Finance minimizes price volatility risks. Liquidity providers earn interest, transaction fees, and CRV tokens as rewards. This platform is perfect for investors favoring stability and long-term returns.</p>



 Compound 



<p>Compound offers competitive interest rates for lending and borrowing crypto assets. Liquidity providers earn dual rewards: interest from loans and COMP tokens, creating a lucrative dual-income stream.</p>



 Aave 



<p>Aave stands out for its flash loans and flexible lending protocols. The platform also features rate switching, allowing users to toggle between fixed and variable interest rates, providing greater control over asset management.</p>



 Beefy Finance 



<p>As a yield optimizer, Beefy Finance aggregates over 600 vaults to maximize APY (Annual Percentage Yield) automatically. Its automated harvesting process minimizes gas fees, making it an efficient option for yield maximization.</p>



 yEarn Finance 



<p>yEarn Finance optimizes profits by automatically reallocating assets to the most profitable protocols. This hands-free approach is perfect for users who want high returns without actively monitoring the market.</p>



 Synthetix 



<p>Synthetix enables users to mint synthetic assets like sUSD and use them to provide liquidity on other platforms. This allows for multi-source income optimization across various protocols.</p>



 Radix 



<p>A rising blockchain platform, Radix offers yield farming opportunities with APR rates up to 50%. However, users should note that some Radix protocols require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for bridging, making it more restrictive than other platforms.</p>



 5 Risks to Watch Out for in Yield Farming 



<p>Yield farming offers an enticing opportunity to maximize profits from crypto assets, but it also comes with significant risks. Here are the top 5 risks users should consider before diving in:</p>



 Smart Contract Vulnerabilities 



<p>Yield farming heavily relies on smart contracts, which are not always thoroughly audited. Projects developed by smaller teams with limited budgets are particularly prone to bugs and security breaches. Even audited protocols like Curve Finance and Bzrx have faced exploitation, highlighting the importance of understanding contract risks.</p>



 Impermanent Loss 



<p>Impermanent loss occurs when token prices in a liquidity pool fluctuate significantly, reducing the total value of assets compared to simply holding them. This risk is common in platforms like Uniswap and Balancer, especially during periods of high market volatility.</p>



 Price Volatility and Liquidation Risks 



<p>DeFi assets used as collateral can be liquidated if their value drops sharply due to market volatility. Users must closely monitor collateral ratios to avoid losing their positions.</p>



 Rug Pull Scams 



<p>Rug pulls involve project developers launching a token, attracting liquidity from users, and then selling off their holdings, draining the pool’s funds and rendering the token worthless. This is a major risk with unverified or low-reputation projects.</p>



 Liquidity Depletion 



<p>Liquidity in pools can vanish quickly if many users withdraw their assets simultaneously. This creates high slippage, where users receive less than expected when exchanging tokens. Additionally, locking tokens in pools reduces flexibility to respond to market changes.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Yield farming offers an exciting way to grow your crypto assets while supporting the DeFi ecosystem. By understanding the risks and choosing the right platforms, you can make the most of this innovative investment strategy. As always, careful research and risk management are key.</p>

 DeFi vs. TradFi: A Tale of Two Workforces (and a Whole Lot More) 
<p>As an avid blockchain user and developer, one of the more common questions I reecive from non-technical family and friends is "where and how does blockchain technology make money?". The answer to this very valid question could be explained using complex blockchain vernacular or boiled down to a few familiar business metrics and statistics. In this article we'll look at the impact legacy and blockchain technologies have on employment in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Traditional Finance (TradFi) industries. The numbers may surprise some and be a cause for concern for others, especially for those in the TradFi industry.</p>
<p>DeFi has emerged as a disruptive force in the financial world, challenging the established norms of traditional finance (TradFi). While many discussions focus on the technological underpinnings and financial mechanisms, a key differentiator often overlooked is the stark contrast in organizational structure and the number of employees required to operate. This difference has profound implications for efficiency, accessibility, and the overall nature of financial services.</p>
<p>Let's explore this contrast by comparing a DeFi giant like Uniswap with a traditional centralized exchange operating within the US banking system.</p>
<p>Uniswap: The Lean, Mean, DeFi Machine</p>
<p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It operates using automated market makers (AMMs), which rely on smart contracts to facilitate trading. These smart contracts automatically execute trades based on pre-defined algorithms and liquidity pools provided by users.</p>
 
 Minimal Human Intervention: The core functionality of Uniswap requires virtually no human intervention for day-to-day operations. There's no need for order books managed by human traders, no settlement processes requiring back-office staff, and no need for extensive customer support teams to handle trade execution issues. 
 Small Core Team: Uniswap Labs, the company initially behind Uniswap's development, focuses primarily on protocol development and upgrades. The core team is relatively small compared to traditional financial institutions. The protocol itself operates autonomously once deployed. Uniswap employs approximately 140-190 people. 
 Community Governance: Governance of the Uniswap protocol is largely decentralized, with UNI token holders having voting rights on proposals for protocol changes. This further reduces the need for a large internal management structure while extending the arm of decentralized opportunity across the globe. 
 
<p>Traditional Exchanges: The Workforce Heavyweights</p>
<p>In contrast, traditional centralized exchanges and other financial institutions within the US banking system require significantly larger workforces. Consider a typical stock exchange or a large bank:</p>
 
 Extensive Operations Staff: These institutions require numerous employees for various functions, including:
 
 Trading Desk: Traders execute orders, manage risk, and ensure market stability. 
 Back Office: Settlement, clearing, and reconciliation processes require substantial human oversight. 
 Compliance and Legal: Strict regulatory requirements necessitate large compliance and legal teams. 
 Customer Service: Handling customer inquiries, resolving issues, and providing support requires a large customer service department. 
 IT and Security: Maintaining complex IT infrastructure and ensuring security requires dedicated teams. 
 
 
 Hierarchical Structure: Traditional financial institutions typically have complex hierarchical structures with multiple layers of management, further increasing the number of employees. The average TradFi company listed on the NASDAQ employs 5000+ People. 
 
<p>The Implications of Workforce Size</p>
<p>The difference in workforce size between DeFi and TradFi has several important implications:</p>
 
 Efficiency: DeFi protocols like Uniswap can operate with significantly lower overhead costs due to their minimal staffing needs. This can translate to lower fees for users. 
 Accessibility: Decentralization and automation can make financial services more accessible to a wider audience, as there's less reliance on physical branches and human interaction. 
 Transparency: Smart contracts are publicly auditable, offering greater transparency compared to the often opaque operations of traditional financial institutions. 
 Security Considerations: While DeFi offers transparency, it also introduces new security challenges related to smart contract vulnerabilities and exploits. The smaller teams may have limited resources to address these issues compared to the larger security teams of TradFi. 
 Regulatory Scrutiny: DeFi's decentralized nature makes it challenging for regulators to oversee. This lack of regulatory clarity created a period of uncertainty and slowed wider adoption until the SEC, CFTC and Central Banks worldwide began to relax their stance a few months prior to approving BitCoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on January 10, 2024.  With 2024 in the rearview along with Bitcoin $100K, regulatory headwinds have clearly shifted to tailwinds while the largest investment banks are slated to invest trillions of $USD in blockchain technology and begin tokenizing real world assets (RWA) in earnest. 
 Estimating the Value: Reports suggest that blockchain deployments could enable banks to save billions on operational costs. For example, one study estimated potential savings of up to $27 billion annually on cross-border settlement transactions by 2030.
 
 Faster Transactions: Blockchain transactions can settle much faster than traditional systems, especially for cross-border payments that can take days to process. 
 24/7 Availability: DeFi markets operate continuously, unlike traditional markets with limited trading hours. This increases capital utilization and allows for greater flexibility. 
 
 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The contrast in workforce size between DeFi platforms like Uniswap and traditional financial institutions highlights a fundamental difference in their operational models. DeFi's reliance on automation and smart contracts allows for lean operations and greater efficiency, while TradFi's complex structures require substantial human capital. This difference has profound implications for the future of finance, with DeFi potentially offering greater accessibility and lower costs, while TradFi continues to provide established regulatory frameworks and well-defined security protocols. As both sectors continue to evolve, it's likely that they will influence and learn from each other, shaping the future of finance in ways we are only beginning to understand. Blockchain technology has incredible potential to foster economic dynamics that result in a much needed modernization of nearly every industry from supplain chain logistics to healthcare to waste management infrastructure and many more.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are transforming how organizations verify, share, and manage data in new and powerful ways. Discover the top industries where verifiable credentials are reshaping digital interactions and unlocking new possibilities for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Ken Ebert</p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving digital identity landscape, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are becoming more than just an emerging technology — they are establishing themselves as essential tools for secure, privacy-respecting identity verification. Organizations around the world are deploying this technology to simplify processes, enhance security, and give users control over their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog looks at five of the top use cases for Verifiable Credentials that we see for 2025, providing insight into how this technology is driving efficiency, transparency, and trust. Each example highlights how industries are using VCs to meet the increasing demand for secure, interoperable, and user-centric identity solutions. From improving how we manage biometric data to enabling seamless travel and streamlining compliance in finance, VCs are proving their versatility and value.</p>
<p>International Travel</p>
<p>Using digital identities for domestic proof of identity and travel has already seen some adoption, see our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-drivers-licenses/">Mobile Driver’s Licenses.</a> But the next step is being able to travel internationally faster and more conveniently. Michael Zureik of SITA recently presented the findings of a proof of concept for <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">flying internationally using a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) and the IATA One ID</a> in collaboration with Indicio, the Government of Aruba, and Delta Airlines. Aruba plans to have their solution operational to all travelers to the island in 2025, but keep an eye out for a quick adoption by other countries and airports.</p>
<p>Biometric Authentication</p>
<p>Biometric authentication solves the problem of passwords and logins for many organizations and users; unfortunately, it still relies on the underlying problem that passwords face: reliance on a centralized database. The solution to removing this reliance on a database is what we call “Bring Your Own Biometrics.” Once a biometric is authenticated, it is issued as a Verifiable Credential. When a person presents for a liveness check, they also present their biometric VC and the relying party compares the liveness check with the biometric in the VC. This solution keeps all of the benefits of biometric authentication, while removing the risk of data breach and reducing liability for the organization. Indicio Deputy CTO Sam Curren recently held an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AgdjIhVw24">in-depth discussion</a> on this topic with real world examples and implementations if you would like to learn more. As data breaches continue to rise and more systems switch to biometric authentication to combat fraud, we see this use case for eliminating databases for sensitive personal information being critical.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Schools of all levels are currently generating a mountain of paperwork per student per year. They need records of each student’s grades, transcripts, awards won, participation in sports or activities, and the list goes on. The current process to verify a student’s accomplishments requires the student to go back to the school and get the documents, and present them to the verifying party, either an employer or a higher education institution, and then for that part to also check in with the school to ensure they are authentic, resulting in a time consuming, manual process. The use of Verifiable Credentials and Open badges 3.0 will allow everyone to skip the wait and be able to immediately verify the student’s accomplishments without the need to check in with the school or a third party system. Students and faculty would also be able to use Verifiable Credentials for identity and access management, allowing users to access their accounts and documents in a faster, more secure, passwordless way. Indicio is already working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7aOEfmX_BE">implementing this solution for the United School Administrators of Kansas,</a> but this issue applies to everyone in education, and we see the entire industry being quick to adopt once they see the time and cost savings to be had.</p>
<p>Agriculture&nbsp;</p>
<p>Farmers have a lot of data to share. From organic growing practices to emissions data or water usage, they have a lot to keep track of and share with a variety of stakeholders, including regulators, governments, suppliers, and consumers. Historically they have relied on third-party identity providers and centralized databases, which have proven complex to integrate and slow to operate, and can share the farmer’s data without their knowledge or permission. With a decentralized identity approach their information can be shared directly, and can also create a more transparent supply chain and prove provenance. Recently, the Trust Alliance New Zealand in partnership with Indicio and Anonyme Labs has showed that all of this information can be securely held locally in a digital wallet and shared in a decentralized way, offering a faster, simpler approach to data management that saves time and money for everyone that relies on farming data. This solution won the Constellation Research <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-co-developed-digital-farm-wallet-wins-constellation-research-supernova-award/">2024 SuperNova Award</a> for “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity.” Agriculture and farming is a data intensive activity and we see growing interest and applications for digital farm wallets in 2025.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>No one is targeted more by fraudsters than financial institutions. In fact, it’s likely that your bank receives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake scam phone calls per year</a> trying to gain access to customer accounts. Decentralized identity can stop this problem at its source by providing mutual authentication through DIDComm to both banks and the customers they service before every interaction or transaction, removing the ability for any party to be impersonated. Historically banks have had to identify customers through passwords and MFA, while customers had no way to truly identify their bank without extra due diligence on their part. Fraud prevention and faster customer interactions will be a driving force for finance being a big adopter of Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity in 2025.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced&nbsp;decentralized identity&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;on the market—and the newly released version 3.0 is packed with features that customers can apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new features in the latest version of our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK represent the bleeding edge of decentralized identity (DI), align with European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) regulations, and maintain the modularity, reliability, and security of <a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ products.</p>



<p>Our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK currently allows customers to easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications and now, with version 3.0, these capabilities go even further. The DI Mobile Edge Agent SDKis a native SDK for both iOS and Android, and does not rely on any third party frameworks such as Javascript frameworks.</p>



<p>In nutshell:</p>



 
 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 adds support for OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>), expanding its suite of protocols for receiving and presenting credentials, in addition to the already supported Aries protocols. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 builds on its collection of supported credential formats (Anoncreds and W3C) with the addition of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>, increasing interoperability and supporting new privacy-preserving use cases. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 updates its supported Aries protocols, maintaining interoperability with the latest Aries agents in the ecosystem. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings, such as in the Anonyome Labs Cloud Agent Service and the Anonyome Labs Decentralized Identity Relay. 



 Having accomplished what was on the roadmap we set out in our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous article</a>, we’ve outlined our new enhanced roadmap, including continued investment into OpenID4VC capabilities, and expansion for new DID Methods (such as <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">Cheqd</a>). 
 



<p>Let’s break these down:</p>



 Adds support for OpenID4VC protocols 



<p>With our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK already having support for Aries protocols for receiving and presenting VCs (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md">Issue Credential</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/401acf391b1470fd0b7bc58b94c1b05588b811b7/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md#L4">Present Proof</a>), version 3.0 ventures into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>).</p>



<p>This move allows for wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, including within the EUDI ecosystem where these protocols are being used in technical specifications (such as the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/arf/">Architecture Reference Framework</a>) and pilot deployments.</p>



<p>These new protocols also help achieve new use cases and wallet UX flows alongside the existing Aries protocol’s use cases. A few of the notable differences are:</p>



 
 Being rooted in industry-standard OAuth 2.0 flows, OpenID4VC allows standard OAuth authorization flows to be used in credential issuance flows. 



 Multiple credentials can be offered in the same flow, where the Edge Agent SDK consumer can browse and request the desired credential. 



 The issuer now conveys support for UI display data in the credential exchange, including issuer and credential colors, text, and logos. 



 There’s no prerequisite to establish an existing DIDComm connection. Credential and presentation exchange flows can begin immediately from an initial QR code scan or deep link click. 
 



<p>The possibilities and protocol variations in OpenID4VC are vast. To home in on the variations the Edge Agent SDK will support in this release, we’ve targeted interoperability with the OpenID4VC verifier and issuer capabilities of the popular open-source projects <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts/tree/main/packages/openid4vc">credo-ts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy-plugins/tree/main/oid4vc">ACA-Py</a>.</p>



 Builds on supported VCs formats, with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT VC</a>s is the latest credential format to enter our Edge Agent’s suite of supported formats, alongside <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs</a> and <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncreds</a>.</p>



<p>Like the new OpenID4VC features, this new credential format enables new use cases and wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, since SD-JWT VC is a preferred format in the EUDI ecosystem.</p>



<p>SD-JWT VCs are designed with selective disclosure in mind, allowing for the building of user-centric privacy-preserving use cases. Using SD-JWT VC, the holder can selectively choose to hide certain attributes of their credential (if the issuer permits it), so that when they present their credential in some use cases, they present only the bare minimum to satisfy that use case. By default, our Edge Agent SDK will always disclose as little as possible when presenting SD-JWT VCs, protecting the privacy of our consumers.</p>



<p>Our Edge Agent SDK could already support some of these use cases via Anoncreds and the BBS-variant of W3C VCs, but SD-JWT VCs differ from these formats in that they use <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final/docs/fips1402annexa.pdf">NIST FIPS</a>-compliant cryptography—an attractive feat for EUDI regulation.</p>



 Updates supported Aries protocols 



<p>In addition to our major venture into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite, we continue to maintain and expand our Aries protocol suite. Since <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">2.0</a>, the Edge Agent SDK has added support for the latest Aries connection protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">DID Exchange</a>.</p>



<p>This new protocol has new UX optimizations for Edge Agent SDK consumers where DIDComm connections can be re-used if a duplicate connection is detected when receiving a DIDComm invitation. But, just as importantly, this feature ensures the Edge Agent SDK remains aligned with the latest Aries Interoperability Profile (AIP).</p>



 Exists in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings 



<p>As a market leader in innovative&nbsp;decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;technology offerings, Anonyome Labs continues to advance its&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">DI solutions</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. Our Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with. What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our Edge Agent against our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a>&nbsp;offering (in addition to a suite of open source DI agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Rich roadmap ahead 



<p>With this extensive third release, Anonyome’s DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK has once again exceeded its roadmap, going beyond the plan laid out since the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous release announcement</a>. But we are not slowing down: we plan to keep adding features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Going forward for the SDK, we plan to continue updating our OpenID4VC protocol suite. Despite being deployed in many EUDI pilots, OpenID4VC protocols are still in draft status. We plan to stay up to date with these protocols as they approach their official 1.0 release, aligning with the EUDI. We also plan to:</p>



 
 Enhance our OpenID4VC protocol implementations with new capabilities, such as OpenID4VCI’s “Authorization code flow”, enabling use cases where users must perform a standard OAuth login to access a credential 



 Add support for OpenID’s <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a> protocol, allowing for new “login with decentralized identifier” use cases 



 Continue expanding the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:tdw, and did:jwk, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents. 
 



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ business solution&nbsp;combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of enterprise-ready APIs and SDKs, so you can quickly build and deploy next-generation privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity apps to help your customers communicate privately, navigate online safely, and transact securely in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, 8 January 2025 – <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, a leading provider of onchain finance solutions, has partnered with <a href="https://ditobanx.com/">Ditobanx</a>, a licensed Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in El Salvador, to help the country build a standardized framework for tokenized regulated assets and position the nation as a leader in the tokenization era.</p>
<p>By leveraging Tokeny’s proven technology, Ditobanx has successfully overcome the challenges of launching a robust platform to issue, manage, and distribute tokenized assets in a seamless and compliant way, without recreating operational silos. The company plans to issue $300 million in tokenized assets in 2025, with a pipeline of 22 clients ready to onboard.</p>
<p>Ditobanx’s mission goes beyond simplifying investment access through tokenization. The team is committed to building an ecosystem that extends the reach of El Salvador’s securities and enhances liquidity in private markets. This ecosystem vision hinges on collaboration and standardization, ensuring that participants across the financial landscape can connect and operate seamlessly.</p>
<p>Ditobanx, Tokeny, and over 90 industry players are collaborating through the non-profit ERC3643 Association to ensure the adoption of the market standard ERC-3643 (“T-REX”) for compliant tokenization. This standard defines how compliance, permissions, data, and onchain workflows are managed, enabling participants to interact effortlessly within a standardized framework.</p>
<p>However, the lifecycle management of tokenized securities remains complex, involving the integration of both on-chain and off-chain processes and data. Developing an orchestrated platform from scratch is both time-intensive and costly, often taking years to complete. To overcome these challenges, Ditobanx chose Tokeny’s onchain operating system, which enabled them to launch their platform within weeks. This swift deployment allows Ditobanx to focus on their core business while benefiting from a proven and scalable solution.</p>

  Revolutionizing Customer Identification Procedures (CIP) in 2025

Discover how technology is transforming CIP, enabling businesses to achieve seamless customer experiences, enhance security, and ensure global regulatory compliance.

<p>Customer Identification Procedures (CIP) have long been a cornerstone of regulated industries like financial services and real estate. But for the businesses implementing them, the experience can feel like a balancing act—managing compliance obligations, maintaining security, and delivering a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2025, and technology is reimagining how businesses handle CIP. By replacing manual workflows with scalable, digital-first solutions, companies can verify customers more efficiently, prevent fraud, and ensure global regulatory compliance—all while keeping the customer journey smooth and secure.</p>



 



 The Manual Method: A Customer’s Perspective 



<p>Imagine this: a customer walks into a branch office to verify their identity. They’re armed with multiple documents—government-issued ID, proof of address, and perhaps even supplementary paperwork. A staff member painstakingly photocopies each piece, manually inputs the data into a system, and cross-references it with additional sources.</p>



<p>For the customer, the process is tedious and time-consuming. For the business, it’s an operational bottleneck. Manual CIP methods are prone to:</p>



 
 Delays: Processing times can stretch from hours to days. 



 Errors: Manual data entry increases the risk of inaccuracies. 



 Fraud Risks: Human oversight often fails to detect sophisticated forgery or tampering. 
 



<p>This traditional approach, while once sufficient, is increasingly out of step with modern customer expectations and regulatory demands.</p>



 



 The 2025 CIP Experience: Seamless and Scalable 



<p>Now, imagine a different scenario. The same customer initiates the process from their smartphone. They upload a photo of their government-issued ID and snap a quick selfie. Within seconds, advanced technology verifies the document’s authenticity, matches the selfie to the ID, and cross-checks the data against trusted sources like global sanctions lists.</p>



<p>For businesses managing hundreds—or thousands—of customer verifications, this shift to digital CIP is transformative. Two key innovations are leading this change:</p>



 Turnkey Solutions for KYB and KYC 



<p>Modern CIP platforms are built to handle both Know Your Business (KYB) and Know Your Customer (KYC) needs. These solutions are designed to scale, offering:</p>



 
 Automated Data Validation: Verifications are completed in seconds, reducing wait times and manual effort. 



 Multi-Jurisdictional Support: Compliance with global regulations becomes seamless, even for businesses operating across multiple regions. 



 Biometric Verification: Facial recognition or fingerprint matching adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that identity fraud is mitigated at the source. 
 



 Scalability Without Complexity 



<p>Unlike legacy systems, digital CIP solutions don’t require complex custom builds. Turnkey options like iComply’s KYB and KYC modules allow businesses to roll out fully compliant identity verification systems quickly, without sacrificing flexibility or security.</p>



 



 Building a Smarter CIP Process 



<p>A smarter CIP process isn’t just about speed—it’s about trust, security, and adaptability. In a digital-first approach, businesses can:</p>



 
 Enhance Security with Advanced Technology: AI and biometric tools identify anomalies, verify documents, and flag high-risk profiles in real-time. 



 Ensure Data Privacy Compliance: Privacy-first architectures, such as edge computing, process sensitive customer data locally, meeting regulatory standards like GDPR and CCPA. 



 Reduce Costs and Complexity: By automating processes, businesses can lower operational expenses and eliminate redundant workflows. 
 



<p>For companies like Dye &amp; Durham, where large-scale customer verifications are routine, these advancements make CIP not only a compliance task but also a strategic advantage.</p>



 



 CIP as a Customer-Centric Opportunity 



<p>The days of viewing CIP solely as a regulatory hurdle are over. In 2025, businesses recognize that customer identification is a touchpoint to build trust and loyalty. A seamless onboarding experience shows customers that their data is secure and their time is respected.</p>



<p>By adopting scalable, digital solutions, organizations can enhance their CIP processes without compromising on compliance or the customer experience. The result? Faster, safer, and more reliable identity verification that aligns with both business goals and customer expectations.</p>



<p>In an industry where trust is paramount, turning CIP into a streamlined, secure process is a powerful way to differentiate your business and build lasting relationships.</p>

				  The economic benefits from streamlining cross-border transactions are massive — and decentralized identity provides the digitally transformative infrastructure to do so.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth and Tim Spring</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European central bank,</a> global cross-border payments are expected to increase from <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html">190 trillion USD in 2023 to 290 trillion USD</a> by 2030 as global commerce becomes more digitally integrated.</p>
<p>Yet in practice, cross border payments are complex and difficult for businesses to execute and often punishing for individuals. Currency conversion rates, fees, and regulatory compliance all conspire to slow down and increase the cost of payments in real time; and for remittances —&nbsp;people sending money from one country to another (typically a foreign worker sending money to relatives) — these fees are brutal. According to the World Bank, the <a href="https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q224.pdf">average cost</a> of sending a remittance is 6.65% of the amount sent,&nbsp;rising to 8.37% for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>As a recent World Bank report <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migration/brief/remittances-knomad">notes</a>, “In more than 60 countries, remittances account for 3 percent or more of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and small/fragile states are more heavily dependent on remittances. As such, it is critical that both remittance senders and receivers have access to a multitude of payment methods and channels in order to deliver and receive remittances in an affordable and fast manner.”</p>
<p>Even a modest 1 percentage point reduction in fees, <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html">says</a> the European Central Bank’s Fabio Panetta, “would leave those most in need with USD 6 billion in their pockets every year.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s looking for better solutions, with the goal of making cross border payments cheaper, faster, more flexible, and more secure. Here’s how we believe Decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials can deliver those solutions, fast.</p>
 
  Validating account ownership and status 
 
<p>Identity fraud is the specter haunting all financial transactions. The key benefit of a Verifiable Credential solution is cryptographic trust: If you trust the source of a Verifiable Credential, you can trust the contents, and immediately act on the data.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials enable people or organizations to hold data about themselves, such as the financial account data required to meet “know your customer” and AML requirements. Verifiable Credentials enable people to share and reuse that data in a way that doesn’t require checking in with the original issuer of the information or storing the same data in order to cross check it.</p>
<p>Authentication is seamless because the origin of the credential is instantly verifiable through cryptography. The information in a credential is digitally signed so that any alteration will be instantly detected. And the credential is bound to the person and their device and their digital wallet both by cryptography and biometrics so you can know that it is the rightful owner is presenting their information. The credential can also be programmed to expire or it can be revoked depending on whether its terms of use have been violated.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are capable of delivering “government-grade” digital identities that can be bound to biometrics (see 4 below) and verified using simple software anywhere and at any time.</p>
 
  Know Your Customer’s Biometrics (KYCB).&nbsp; 
 
<p>Biometrics are increasingly being incorporated into payments so that you can “pay with your face.” But the rapid rise of generative AI-driven biometric fraud threatens to derail confidence in conventional biometric authentication. Biometric theft represents a much higher existential risk to people than account or password theft. Similarly, the need to store personal biometric data in order to verify it represents a much higher privacy and security risk to all parties involved.</p>
<p>This is where Verifiable Credential technology comes to the rescue. By submitting an authenticated biometric template from a trusted credential provider while performing a liveness check, a relying party has a simple, reliable way to cross check that the person really is the face in front the camera —&nbsp;and without the relying party having to store any biometric data or change their biometric infrastructure.</p>
<p>This “bring your own validated biometrics” approach is driving seamless digital travel, enabling people to seamlessly cross borders. This kind of “government-grade” digital identity is ideal for payments, domestic and international.</p>
 
  Cross-border technical interoperability 
 
<p>Decentralized identity both simplifies the architecture and workflows for sharing data. The first is accomplished by eliminating the need for direct integrations. If you trust the issuer of a credential (Bank A), you can trust the information in the credential, and connect the verifying software to internal systems through an API. This makes data portable and immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Second, it is easy to establish governance rules for how information in a credential is processed. This is because a) there’s a global specification for these governance rules, and b) the rules are encoded in machine-readable files propagated to issuers, holders, and verifiers alike.</p>
<p>In other words, a governance authority can publish a list of trusted credential issuers in a file and send it to every organization with verifying software. A merchant in a village with a mobile verifier on their phone is able to immediately authenticate whether a credential presented has come from a trusted organization. The file can be rapidly updated and, as it is cached, it can be configured to handle offline verification.</p>
<p>While the technical complexities of cross border transactions are not to be underestimated, decentralized identity&nbsp;—&nbsp;and specifically, decentralized ecosystem governance — can radically simplify workflows needed to deliver efficient, cost-effective real-time payments.</p>
 
  Seamless, connected experiences 
 
<p>When you combine Verifiable Credentials with a powerful communications protocol such as DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communications), you get even more flexibility. DIDComm enables two powerful features.</p>
<p>First, it is the engine that enables parties to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any data.</p>
<p>The second is that it allows a mobile device to operate as if it had a very powerful API for data exchange, one that is much more secure than any conventional API. This is groundbreaking, as the inability (for a variety of technical reasons) of mobile phones to use APIs has limited their functionality.</p>
<p>When these two features combine, we have a very powerful way to integrate services in a seamless, secure way. For example, a fintech AI could be permissioned to access and analyze account data in real time.</p>
<p>But the point is that it makes it easy to permission and process any kind of complex workflow between parties; it turns digital wallets and their owners into verifiable data platforms.</p>
 
  Platformless infrastructural transformation 
 
<p>Verifiable Credentials are not a platform. They are not stand-alone systems that replace existing infrastructure; they are, rather, a set of tools you drop into existing systems. Just as a catalytic converter renders harmful emissions less harmful, Verifiable Credentials make the digital data you already have verifiable, portable, private, and secure —&nbsp;and they do so without this data being stored or controlled by the tech developer.</p>
<p>This is critical for data privacy compliance, transparency, and trust. It is the key to why decentralized identity can scale to, and interoperate as, cost-effective global digital infrastructure accessible to all.</p>
<p>The challenge</p>
<p>The travel sector is rapidly transitioning to decentralized identity and “government-grade” digital identities in order to deliver streamlined and more secure customer experiences as global air passenger numbers are set to double in the near future. Airlines and airports get it.</p>
<p>For finance, the challenge is first, to understand how powerful this technology is and how easily it can be deployed to manage the complex tangle of regulatory and technical challenges across multiple stakeholders; second, to then make the policy decisions to allow implementation.</p>
<p>In this, the technology is, in many ways, the easy bit; it’s the talking and coordinating that’s hard.</p>
<p>But there is an incentive for everyone to align around: reducing the cost of cross border remittances are a Sustainable Development Goal (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/remittances-day/SDGs#:~:text=SDG%2010,additional%20US%2420%20billion%20annually.">SDG10</a>) —&nbsp;and the clock is ticking on 2030. The savings are considerable; the impact of these savings, life transforming. The time to implement Verifiable Credentials has never been better.</p>

 Now that 2024 has come to a close, it’s the perfect time to reflect on the digital identity landscape and evaluate how the year’s trends have shaped the market. In our annual tradition, we look back on our predictions at the start of the year and assess how they measure up against reality. This year, instead of rating each prediction individually, we’ll focus on the major industry trends and discuss how our forecasts align with them. 



<p>2024 has been a transformative year for Liminal as well. As a technology company offering market and competitive intelligence through our Link Platform, we’ve empowered businesses with actionable insights to navigate these trends. Let’s explore the major takeaways from 2024 and how our predictions fared.</p>



 


 
2024 Reflections in Digital Identity 


 The Big Picture: 2024 Reflections in Digital Identity 



<p>The cybersecurity and digital identity space continued to experience rapid growth, innovation, and regulatory scrutiny in 2024. Key trends included:</p>



 
 Trust &amp; Safety Become Core to Platform Integrity: Social media platforms prioritized Trust &amp; Safety initiatives, with age assurance and age verification emerging as critical capabilities to address regulatory pressures, user demands, and platform integrity. 



 Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity: The increasing sophistication of identity-based threats and deepfakes drove the convergence of cybersecurity and identity solutions, with advancements in frameworks, content provenance, and fraud prevention capabilities leading the way. 



 Evolving Regulatory Landscapes: Global regulations targeting AI privacy, age assurance, and data usage placed organizations under greater scrutiny, requiring them to balance compliance, innovation, and ethical practices to maintain market credibility. 



 Market Consolidation and Innovation: Strategic acquisitions and private equity investments reshaped the identity and fraud markets, with adjacent players like Visa, Experian, and Mastercard driving innovation, while identity-first vendors expanded their market influence. 



 The Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption. Despite the promise of reusable identity networks, slow consumer uptake and market pivots highlight ongoing challenges in achieving scalability and trust for widespread adoption. 
 



<p>These trends underscored the market’s complexity and opportunity, shaping the decisions of buyers, providers, and investors alike.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“2024 marked a pivotal year in the fight for digital trust. Breakthroughs in age assurance, AI-driven deepfake detection, and passkeys laid the foundation for a safer, more authentic online ecosystem. At Liminal, we turned complexity into clarity—empowering businesses to navigate these shifts with confidence and shape the strategies that protect integrity in the digital age.”<br>–<a href="https://liminal.co/team-member/jennie-berry/"> Jennie Berry</a>, Liminal</p>
</blockquote>



 



 Revisiting Our 2024 Predictions 



<p>Our 2024 predictions, which drew on the collective expertise of the Liminal team, anticipated many of these developments. Here’s how they aligned with the year’s major trends:</p>



 
 Age Assurance as a Core Pillar for Trust &amp; Safety 



 Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity 



 Market Consolidation 



 Regulatory Shifts 



 Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption 
 



 



 1. Age Assurance as a Core Pillar for Trust &amp; Safety 



<p>Our prediction that major social media platforms would initiate voluntary age verification has proven mostly correct, as platforms like Meta and Snapchat have taken significant steps to enhance age assurance measures, including testing tools such as biometric-based age estimation and document verification to comply with growing regulatory pressures. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">According to Liminal’s 2024 B2B survey of age assurance practitioners</a>, in regulated sectors, age verification coverage is expected to grow from 60% to 66%, while unregulated industries are moving faster, with adoption rising from 64% to 73% in the next year. This shift reflects the growing recognition of age assurance as essential for Trust &amp; Safety, even outside traditionally regulated areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we anticipated a blow to state-level regulations in the U.S., the outcome has been mixed. We use<a href="https://link.liminal.co/market-monitor?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-market-monitor-access"> Link’s Market Monitor </a>to anticipate actionable impacts of proposed legislation, and although the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this issue decisively, recent developments—such as <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/?Tab=BillText">Florida’s new HB 3 bill </a>mandating parental consent for minors under 14 to access social media —demonstrate states’ continued attempts to impose online protections. Internationally, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/">Australia introduced the world-first legislation</a> in its Online Safety Act, which bans children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Age Assurance has emerged as a core focus of our coverage and research this year, driven by its critical role in Trust &amp; Safety initiatives across digital platforms. Throughout the year, we’ve closely tracked <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">market sentiment through buyer surveys</a>, which highlight the growing demand for solutions that balance regulatory compliance, user experience, and platform integrity. The gap between understanding and effectively implementing age assurance regulations presents a significant challenge for businesses, with confusion around the scope of specific regulations being a major issue. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">46% of practitioners</a> incorrectly identify the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) – which primarily applies to schools and libraries – as one of the top regulations impacting businesses. Our <a href="https://link.liminal.co/use-cases?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-use-case-explorer-access">Link Use Case Explorer</a> includes an analysis of product capabilities and technical features, including a detailed view of how solutions are evolving to meet the stringent requirements of this use case, such as biometric age estimation, data enrichment, and parental consent tools. At the same time, we’ve identified key technology gaps—particularly in accuracy and user experience—that remain opportunities for innovation. By mapping the capabilities of emerging technologies to real-world buyer needs, we’ve gained a clear view of how the market is maturing to address the complexities of age assurance, setting the stage for future advancements that ensure safer digital environments for all users.</p>



 



 2. Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity 



<p>Our predictions regarding the convergence of digital identity and cybersecurity were largely correct, with developments across deepfake mitigation, bot detection, and authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deepfakes are more prevalent today than ever before due to a combination of technological advancements and increased accessibility to AI-powered tools. The proliferation of generative AI models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and large language models, has enabled the creation of hyper-realistic audio, video, and image content with minimal expertise or resources. The rapid spread of misinformation on social platforms and the rise of identity-based attacks, such as impersonation fraud and synthetic identities, have made deepfakes an increasingly potent tool for bad actors targeting individuals, organizations, and even nation-states. Solutions that integrate identity verification tools—such as biometric authentication, liveness detection, and digital watermarking—combined with cybersecurity techniques like content provenance, anomaly detection, and cryptographic hashing are essential to detect and authenticate the origin and integrity of digital media. Based on survey data conducted in <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/67336e5f0402b57725ca0900?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-ians-report-access">Liminal’s 2024 Seminar Research Report: The Market for Identity Authorization Networks</a>, 88% of financial services institutions expect GenAI fraud and deepfakes to grow substantially over the next two years. New frameworks and consortiums have emerged to combat deepfakes, and in the Solution Segment for <a href="https://link.liminal.co/solution-segments/5fc17fe2f82a3e5e2cabd3b2?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-ss-user-generated-content-moderation-access">User-Generated Content Moderation</a> within our <a href="https://link.liminal.co/solution-segments?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-liminal-landscape-access">Liminal Landscape</a>, we are tracking the <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> and <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)</a>, which have made progress in establishing technical standards for identifying manipulated media.</p>



 


 
 


<p>Midjourney Image Generations Over Time – Liminal’s 2024 Seminar Research Report: The Market for Identity Authorization Networks</p>



 



<p>Our prediction that Chrome’s third-party cookie deprecation would drive demand for bot detection was incorrect, as <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/google-abandons-plan-to-phase-out-third.html">Google has decided not to phase out third-party cookies</a>. However, as companies shift toward first-party ad strategies, there remains a heightened requirement to ensure that all website impressions are legitimate. The growing reliance on first-party data amplifies the need for identity-centric approaches to cybersecurity, particularly in bot detection. Automated threats like ad fraud, fake traffic, and click bots can severely undermine the accuracy and value of first-party strategies, impacting advertising ROI and business performance. Organizations are adopting advanced solutions such as behavioral analytics, device fingerprinting, and real-time anomaly detection to differentiate between genuine users and malicious bots to combat this. By ensuring the legitimacy of website impressions, businesses protect their advertising investments and reinforce trust and data integrity in an increasingly privacy-driven digital landscape.</p>



<p>Finally, while passkeys have gained traction, particularly with big tech players like Google and Apple, our prediction remains correct that they remain largely secondary authentication methods rather than primary solutions, as adoption faces challenges in user behavior and enterprise readiness. Passkeys are a form of passwordless authentication that leverages public key cryptography to verify a user’s identity without requiring a traditional password. According to <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6718c9b9d7f0e77856e7e1b5?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-wp-cybersecurity-passkeys">Liminal’s 2024 B2B surveys of authentication practitioners</a>, despite nearly 100% of businesses that have yet to adopt passkeys expressing a willingness to transition to them, only about a third are expecting to do so in the next two years. Our ongoing research on a passwordless future highlights the critical role that CISOs and IT leaders can play in promoting the internal adoption of passkeys within the workforce. We hypothesize that workforce adoption can catalyze widespread customer deployments by proving their effectiveness, ease of use, and security benefits in real-world environments. This workforce-first approach enhances identity-centric cybersecurity by removing the vulnerabilities associated with passwords and helps organizations build trust and familiarity with passkey solutions.</p>

 3. Market Consolidation 



<p>Our predictions around market consolidation were partially correct, with significant activity but slightly different dynamics than anticipated. While at least two publicly traded identity companies did choose to go private—such as <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61b12a7401c4b637779827d6/overview">Proofpoint</a>’s acquisition by Thoma Bravo and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61c12b7dc890a08ec3f64f08/overview">ZeroFox</a>’s buyout by Haveli Investments—the broader trend focused on strategic acquisitions.</p>



<p>Key deals like Visa’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61c12b7dc890a08ec3f64f08/overview">Featurespace</a> and Experian’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/62cc485c7718967730d7cf37">NeuroID</a> and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6408eedbe2225e7d5f5cc836">ClearSale</a> highlight how financial giants integrate advanced fraud prevention and behavioral analytics capabilities into their platforms. Mastercard’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6408eedbe2225e7d5f5cc836/overview">Recorded Future</a> also points to a growing appetite for cybersecurity and identity intelligence convergence. We also saw <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f3179dc94908bf4be1/overview">Entrust</a>’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f3179dc94908bf4be1/overview">Onfido</a> for up to $600M, despite prior speculation to IPO over $1B.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, our expectation that <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f7179dc94908bf4c21">Okta</a> and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f7179dc94908bf4c26">Ping</a> would aggressively expand into identity verification and fraud prevention—particularly at account opening—was only partially realized. While both expanded capabilities, their focus remained on core IAM/CIAM, leaving traditional identity verification players like <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fc1d9b2f26e0d7cd04afeb6">Socure</a>, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6101c7f64645a82ed0abf46b">Prove</a>, and others to capture significant market share in fraud prevention and onboarding solutions. The acquisitions and private equity activity seen this year reaffirm that the market is consolidating, but the momentum is being driven by adjacent entrants and strategic investors looking to integrate identity and fraud solutions into larger ecosystems rather than large-scale mergers within the digital identity space.</p>

 4. Regulatory Shifts 



<p>Our predictions regarding regulatory shifts were only somewhat correct, particularly in relation to generative AI and its impact on privacy and data advantage. As generative AI adoption surged, organizations faced increasing privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny. For instance, the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">EU’s AI Act</a> introduced strict guidelines around data usage, transparency, and accountability in generative AI systems, while jurisdictions like <a href="https://www.bakerdonelson.com/californias-new-generative-ai-law-what-your-organization-needs-to-know">California pushed forward tech regulations</a> to safeguard personal data from misuse in AI training models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simultaneously, companies struggling to articulate their unique data advantage in the generative AI space encountered notable market criticism. This was particularly evident with firms unable to differentiate their AI solutions from competitors or justify the quality of their proprietary datasets, leading to investor skepticism and concerns about overinflated claims. These developments reaffirm that regulatory shifts are driving organizations to strike a balance between AI-driven innovation, privacy protections, and transparency, with a clear data advantage increasingly serving as a competitive differentiator.</p>



 



 5. Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption 



<p>Unfortunately, our prediction that reusable identity networks would not gain consumer adoption in 2024 was correct, as significant hurdles around scalability, trust, and consumer behavior persisted. Notably, Mastercard has lost momentum with its ID Network, reflecting the challenges even well-funded, globally recognized players face in driving the adoption of reusable digital identities. <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>, a pioneer in self-sovereign identity, is preparing to <a href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=b2c2f50b93f0ad7684f55ccde&amp;id=97dcc86838">deprecate its MainNet ledger </a>by April of this year, signaling technological hurdles and a marked reduction in transaction activity. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f9179dc94908bf4c42">Trinsic</a>, a startup that sought to enable decentralized identity solutions, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-decentralized-identity-assets-acquired-by-dentity-to-accelerate-digital-id-adoption/">shifted its focus away from its original vision</a>, citing slow market readiness and unclear demand. These developments underscore the difficulty of achieving network effects, interoperability, and end-user trust required for reusable identity solutions to thrive. While reusable identity networks continue to show promise, particularly in niche ecosystems or regulated environments, the broader market remains hesitant, and adoption struggles have reinforced the need for clearer value propositions, regulatory support, and incentives to drive consumer engagement.</p>

 Learn more about IDnow’s latest collaborative project, ACHILLES, which sets out to revolutionize the development and use of AI throughout Europe. 



<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the importance of having access to transparent, robust and sustainable AI increases.</p>



<p>Inspired by the legend of the mythological warrior, the ACHILLES project aims to tackle the traditional limitations and weaknesses of AI, which are typically considered to be efficiency and trust.</p>



<p>With funding of over €8 million from Horizon Europe, and collaboration between 16 partners including IDnow, ACHILLES will run for a four year period (2024-2028) and focus on four areas:</p>



<p>People: Promoting ethical, transparent and explainable AI.</p>



<p>Data: Reducing the use of real data through the use of synthetic alternatives.</p>



<p>AI models: Optimizing efficiency and guaranteeing fairness.</p>



<p>Deployment: Ensuring sustainable, regulatory-compliant implementation.</p>



<blockquote><p>With ACHILLES, we want to put people at the heart of AI innovation. Our aim is to ensure that every technology not only performs well, but is also transparent and ethical, to inspire trust in the long term.</p>André Carreiro, Project Coordinator and Researcher at Fraunhofer AICOS (Portugal).</blockquote>



 The 6 objectives of the ACHILLES project. 



  Identify ethical and legal frameworks in order to design AI systems that are based on human values.  



  Create frameworks to guarantee high quality, diverse and representative data for AI use.  



  Protect consumer privacy when using data and models in machine learning.  



  Optimize AI model training and deployment processes to reduce energy and IT costs.  



  Enable the development of robust and transparent algorithms.  



  Offer researchers and developers an integrated development environment based on machine learning to facilitate efficient, regulatory-compliant and trustworthy AI.  



 What sectors is ACHILLES focused on? 



<p>The ACHILLES project will focus on creating multiple use cases across various industries, including healthcare by optimizing models to provide faster and more reliable diagnostics, and identity verification by developing more secure, privacy-friendly solutions. By ensuring compliance with regulations, ACHILLES will also offer use cases as far and wide as content creation and pharmaceutical development.</p>



<p>Plus, by aligning with the ethical standards of the European Union, ACHILLES demonstrates that innovation and responsibility can, in fact, coexist to create trusted AI.&nbsp;The ACHILLES project is split into three major milestones.</p>



<p>Year 1 (2024-2025): Define use cases and specifications, start of technical developments.</p>



<p>Year 2 (2025-2026): Continue technical developments, assessment of project use cases.</p>



<p>Years 3 and 4 (2026-2028): Implement and evaluate the efficacy of ACHILLES solutions on project use cases.</p>



 IDnow’s role in the ACHILLES project. 



<p>As a leader in the European identity verification market, IDnow’s chief role in the project is to&nbsp;provide identity verification expertise and work to maximize the efficiency of datasets that comply with privacy standards, including GDPR. This includes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Creating synthetic data that is representative of real data.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Optimizing data annotation to minimize human resources and guarantee reliable results.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Renewing datasets without affecting model performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Throughout the project IDnow will be evaluating ACHILLES innovations on real-life use cases linked to identity verification. These tests will enable us to improve the robustness of our algorithms and propose more reliable, secure and privacy-friendly solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p>Thanks to the ACHILLES project, we hope not only to improve the quality and robustness of our algorithms, but also to reduce dependence on real data. This represents a major step toward more sustainable and regulatory-compliant AI.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The ACHILLES project marks a decisive step in the development of sustainable, human-centered AI. With its multidisciplinary approach and rigorous framework, it promises to lay the foundations for a more transparent and safer artificial intelligence that meets the needs of tomorrow. Stay tuned: the first results will be available in 2026!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has launched a pilot program integrating birth and National ID registration, enrolling 29 newborns at Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital in Manila and issuing them ePhilIDs. This initiative ensures every child receives a legal identity from birth, supporting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. As the digital ID system expands, financial institutions like Asia United Bank, BPI, and mobile wallets such as GCash now accept ePhilIDs for account opening and verification. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202412/philippines-pilots-back-to-back-birth-and-national-id-registration-for-newborns?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9bF8vPWlDYprMgJiMYbh-GpVsukoTJxdecC4jwp7DgYfISADWf7cRS9I3V7ttDeR8S9Rz-">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Vietnam Reaches 70M Enrolled in Biometric National ID Database</p>



<p>Vietnam has enrolled 70 million citizens into its national ID database over two years under its Digital Transformation Plan, establishing a centralized biometric identity system. The initiative includes chip-based physical ID cards, digital IDs, and the VNeID mobile app. Citizens must provide fingerprints, iris, and facial biometrics for ID applications. To address geographic and rural challenges, Vietnam partnered with local and international firms to develop portable devices and an AFIS system.

<p>UK Pubs to Accept Digital ID for Age Assurance by Christmas 2025</p>



<p>By 2025, UK pubs and retail outlets will accept mobile digital IDs for age verification, reducing reliance on physical ID cards. These digital IDs must comply with the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) and use biometric authentication for security. Public consultation showed strong support for digital IDs in alcohol purchases, but age estimation technology remains excluded from regulations. Critics argue this exclusion stifles innovation and risks losing expertise to other countries. Physical IDs will still be available for those preferring traditional verification methods. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202412/uk-pubs-to-accept-digital-id-for-age-assurance-by-christmas-2025?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8mSO_9xKeXBJmLEQiEhPd4cD6LxCnVJdn3K8hJzKR_tCm4ulsvZvtGB0qhyA1ljXuJ-n-g">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Trump Asks Supreme Court to Pause TikTok Shutdown</p>



<p>President-elect Donald Trump has asked the Supreme Court to halt the nationwide <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/tiktok/">TikTok</a> ban set for January 19, arguing a negotiated resolution could address security concerns without violating First Amendment rights. The ban, backed by Congress, demands ByteDance divest its ownership over fears of Chinese data misuse. ByteDance refuses, and lower courts upheld the law, which targets ownership, not content. Trump, shifting from his earlier anti-TikTok stance, warned of the ban’s broad impact but offered no specifics. The ban would block updates and hosting services, effectively disabling TikTok in the U.S., despite TikTok’s multibillion-dollar data security investments. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-pause-tiktok-shutdown-e6156484?mod=tech_lead_pos2&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz---B2VJH9zsVDcrPgx-GoB13jQRGZZI8JBF5LzCr_0hi9XFL0sFvSL-qbCy50dzurlpwLXb">(Source)</a></p>

 The Metaverse, an interactive virtual space created by augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) tech that seamlessly integrates digital and physical environments, is rapidly expanding 



<p>A Grand View Research report has estimated that the global Metaverse market size had a value of $82.02 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow until 2030. Promoting immersive experiences is one of the critical features of this virtual space. Our previous <a href="https://unionavatars.com/who-can-i-be-in-the-metaverse/">article Who Can I Be in the Metaverse? </a>&nbsp;discusses how users can personalize avatars to interact with others in the Metaverse and highlights opportunities to expand customization options to promote diversity and inclusivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although tech innovations drive the Metaverse’s growth, many people still lack an awareness of its full potential. In the US, <a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/40805-do-americans-understand-metaverse-and-do-they-care">YouGov research shows only 12% of respondents</a> fully know about the Metaverse, while only two in five partially understand it. Luckily, several resources are available to help introduce the Metaverse to curious minds, including ebooks. Below, we look at why ebooks are helpful and recommend the best titles for understanding the Metaverse.</p>



 Why ebooks? 



<p>Our tech-driven society has enabled the digital world to intertwine with our lives, and ebooks are one example of how tech makes daily tasks like reading more convenient. <a href="https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-021-00176-5">Research published in Springer Open</a> found that the interactive features of ebooks, like highlighting and annotating text, are more efficient in helping readers learn about complex concepts like artificial intelligence compared with other forms of books. If you’re wondering where to access them, <a href="https://www.everand.com/books/Technology-Engineering">Everand hosts a wide range of tech-related ebooks</a> to help you understand the Metaverse, including Mark Van Rijmenam’s Step into the Metaverse and Jaron Lanier’s Dawn of the New Everything. Readers can customize their reading experience by adjusting font sizes and highlighting relevant passages. If you want a range of options, other platforms like Libby might also provide access to titles about the Metaverse through your local library’s ebook catalog.</p>



<p>Here are some titles to check out:</p>



 Ebooks on the Metaverse and virtual worlds 



 The Metaverse Handbook by QuHarrison Terry and Scott Keeney 



<p>There’s nothing like learning from the best. In this ebook, tech and culture experts QuHarrison Terry and Scott Keeney highlight the fundamental concepts of the Metaverse, its history, and how to leverage its opportunities to your advantage. The Metaverse Handbook provides case studies of over 100 Metaverse creators and offers concise and actionable insights into navigating, exploring, and implementing emerging Metaverse tech like blockchain, making it an essential read for beginners.</p>



 Navigating the Metaverse by Cathy Hackl, Dirk Lueth, and Tommaso Di Bartolo 



<p>Research shows that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/more-americans-are-scared-of-the-metaverse-than-excited-poll.html">nearly a third of US adults</a> are scared of the Metaverse. To help soothe these fears and foster more understanding, Navigating the Metaverse provides a comprehensive guide and valuable tips on navigating the Metaverse economy and launching an effective Metaverse project. This ebook offers business executives and innovators helpful knowledge on existing frameworks that can capitalize on the Metaverse’s innovative features for their businesses, including spatial computing and Web3 technology.&nbsp;</p>



 Dawn of the New Everything by Jaron Lanier&nbsp; 



<p>Learning about VR as a foundation for developing the Metaverse is essential in understanding how immersive technology can shape the future of the digital space. In Dawn of the New Everything, the father of virtual reality, Jaron Lanier, explores the power and potential of VR and how it impacts not only the Metaverse but also our daily lives. It’s an essential read for those interested in understanding the Metaverse’s key components.</p>



 Step into the Metaverse by Mark Van Rijmenam 



<p>Perfect for readers who want to understand the business side of the digital space, Mark Van Rijmenam’s Step into the Metaverse explores the untapped potential for Metaverse entertainment. Rijmenam examines the Metaverse’s potential to unlock a trillion-dollar social economy and the challenges that come with it. The ebook also provides commentaries on potential risks, including data breaches, avatar imposters, and surveillance, highlighting the need for a Metaverse law.</p>



<p>The idea of the Metaverse might be too confusing or overwhelming for beginners. With these ebooks, you’ll be well on your way to understanding the basics of the Metaverse and its incredible potential.</p>

<p>We’re all accustomed to using SMS (short message service) verification when we sign on to our mobile apps and services. This method is used to prove that you possess the device during an MFA (multi-factor authentication) experience. When you attempt to access an app, it texts you a code and asks you to provide that code to prove that you are who you claim to be. After providing the code, you immediately gain access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMS verification is extremely popular because most people are accustomed to it and know what to expect. However, this verification method can be vulnerable to SMS fraud, which could result in costly losses for your organization if you do not take the appropriate precautions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the trade timeline was inaccurate, my fundamental and technical analysis was spot on as SUI traded to a new all time high on December 14, 2024 of 4.85 $USD.  What about SUI was and remains compelling? </p><p>Sui has engineered several industry 1st products including a zero-knowledge oauth2 login aptly called zkLogin and a Rust based smart contract language called Move. As a web 2 and blockchain engineer, I naturally gravitated towards these two products because they solve some of the greater challenges on the road to mass adoption. </p>

 What is zkLogin? 

<p>zkLogin enables users to transact on Sui using the familiar OAuth login flow, eliminating the friction of handling cryptographic keys or remembering mnemonics while using externally owned accounts (EOAs). With a bit of engineering ingenuity, zkLogin could enable instant and private identity authentication to extract billions of $USD locked up in antiquated ​customer onboarding flows all while paving a highway toward the post quantum era. </p>

 zkLogin Design Goals 

  Streamlined onboarding: zkLogin enables you to transact on Sui using the familiar OAuth login flow, eliminating the friction of handling cryptographic keys or remembering mnemonics.  Self-custody: A zkLogin transaction requires user approval via the standard OAuth login process--the OAuth provider cannot transact on the user's behalf.  Security: zkLogin is a two-factor authentication scheme; sending a transaction requires both a credential from a recent OAuth login and a salt not managed by the OAuth provider. An attacker who compromises an OAuth account cannot transact from the user's corresponding Sui address unless they separately compromise the salt.  Privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs prevent third parties from linking a Sui address with its corresponding OAuth identifier.  Optional verified identity: A user can opt in to verify the OAuth identifier that was used to derive a particular Sui address. This serves as the foundation for a verifiable on-chain identity layer.  Accessibility: zkLogin is one of several native Sui signature schemes thanks to Sui's cryptography agility. It integrates with other Sui primitives, like sponsored transactions and multisig.  

 What is Move? 

<p>The most important feature of Move is it's ability to create smart contracts in a blockchain agnostic manner meaning it works seamlessly with all blockchains. Sui made a brilliant design choice in writing Move in Rust, and considering Microsoft plans to migrate its codebase to Rust, the implications and potential of Move are profound. Coupled with zkLogin, developers have unprecedented opportunity to engineer the future of public blockchain technology as the world rapidly accelerates into the post quantum era. </p><p>Move was originally created for the "Diem" blockchain and has evolved into a powerful, hghly expressive language with an execution layer offering unmatched efficiency. </p><p></p>
<p>Move's design enables unparalleled flexibility with it's object data model, composable dynamic fields, and programmable transaction blocks that allow up to 1024 separate homogeneous or heterogenous function calls per transaction. Coupled with zkLogin, Move provides the optimal developer and user onboarding experiences to foster the mass adoption of public blockchain technology.

<p>The blockchain industry entered 2024 amidst transformative shifts driven by regulatory pressures and technological advancements. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) faced escalating compliance demands, compelling them to navigate a delicate balance between operational efficiency and the preservation of user privacy. Shyft Network emerged as a leader in this evolving landscape, delivering innovative solutions that address the industry’s most pressing challenges without compromising its foundational values.</p> A Turning Point in Crypto Compliance <p>For VASPs worldwide, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule remained a pressing challenge. Compliance historically demanded cumbersome manual processes, often at the expense of operational efficiency and user trust. These outdated methods left exchanges and their customers exposed to potential breaches while struggling to meet evolving regulatory expectations.</p><p>Shyft Network addressed these issues head-on. In January, the company introduced its groundbreaking<a href="https://demo.usersigning.shyft.network/"> User Signing</a> feature to the Veriscope Travel Rule solution. This innovation enabled VASPs to cryptographically verify wallet ownership while safeguarding user data. The technical leap bridged the gap between regulatory demands and the crypto community’s core&nbsp;values.</p> From Vision to Real-World Impact: Strategic Partnerships <p>The adoption of Shyft’s solutions spread rapidly across the industry. India’s burgeoning crypto market, navigating its own regulatory maze, became an early proving&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Giottus, one of the country’s leading exchanges, replaced manual verification processes with Veriscope’s automated system. Similarly, OmniEX, a prominent over-the-counter (OTC) desk, integrated Veriscope and User Signing to streamline operations for institutional clients.</p><p>OnMeta further showcased Veriscope’s adaptability by enabling seamless payment services for digital assets, while Mudrex exemplified how emerging platforms could build compliance infrastructure without sacrificing user experience.</p><p>Shyft Network’s collaborative efforts in 2024 extended to influential industry players. Chipper Cash, a platform enabling free cross-border payments and financial services for Africans, integrated Shyft’s Veriscope and User Signing solutions to comply with the FATF Travel Rule. This partnership underscored the potential for blockchain-powered compliance tools to support inclusive financial ecosystems.</p><p>These collaborations highlight Shyft’s impact in driving both technological and regulatory advancements globally, setting a benchmark for the industry’s future direction.</p> Advancing Technology for a Private&nbsp;Future <p>Beyond compliance, 2024 saw Shyft Network’s research arm also become a beacon of industry insight. In addition to the Veriscope Regulation bi-weekly newsletter, the Shyft Perspectives profound analysis of critical&nbsp;issues:</p>  Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook for 2024: A detailed analysis of worldwide trends, including the European Union’s Transfer of Funds Regulation and developments in AML/KYC standards.  L2 Solutions and Scalability: Exploring solutions to the blockchain trilemma, with insights into advancements and future prospects in Layer 2 technology.

  <p>You have an app with SSO capabilities. What else can you do with Okta to transform it into an enterprise-ready powerhouse?</p>

<p>Today’s enterprises face critical identity management challenges that directly impact their operations; this includes:</p>

 
   Rapid business growth outpacing their current user management capabilities 
   Scattered user accounts creating administrative chaos 
   User management that doesn’t scale with company growth (access free-for-all to resources) 
   Bottlenecks in user provisioning slowing down productivity (i.e., manual provisioning) 
 

<p>and more critically,</p>

 
   Security vulnerabilities from inconsistent user deprovisioning 
 

<p>This is where you come in as a partner. By integrating with Okta through SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), a standard for managing users, you can offer enterprise customers a solution that addresses these pain points.</p>

 Why System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is your gateway to enterprise success 

<p>It facilitates:</p>
 
   Real-time user synchronization, which keeps customer organizations agile with instant updates as employees join, leave, or move within the company 
   Automated lifecycle management, which eliminates manual processes with streamlined provisioning, updates, and de-provisioning 
   Enhanced security controls, which give enterprises precise control over user access and permissions 
   Standards-based integration, which leverages open Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols for reliable, interoperable, and consistent implementation 
   Reduced operational complexity, which helps customers save on their identity management costs and overhead 
 

 Accelerate your growth by joining the Okta Integration Network (OIN) 
<p>And once you have a SCIM-compliant integration with Okta, we invite you to <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">Okta’s Integration Network (OIN)</a>. Here, you can unlock potential growth by tapping into Okta’s massive customer base of 18,000+ organizations, including leading companies and government institutions that rely on Okta as their identity security foundation. Furthermore, fast-track enterprise deals with your pre-built integration and reduces sales friction with verified enterprise-ready status. More importantly, you’ll be able to differentiate your offering with premium security features.</p>

 How to submit your SCIM integration to the Okta Integration Network (OIN) 
<p>Here is a video walkthrough on creating your SCIM provisioning instance for OIN testing and submission.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for Bluesky! As 2024 draws to a close, I’m excited to take a look back at everything that’s happened in the past year.</p>
<p>Alongside users, creators, and the AT Protocol developer community, Bluesky has grown from an invite-only app with only 3 million people to a public app of over 25.9 million people. In the last month and a half, Bluesky has grown by over 13M people, with organizations reporting a 2-10x increase in the amount of <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/11-29-2024-engagement">engagement</a> they receive.</p>
<p>Here’s a look back at some key milestones of this past year:</p>
 Opening Our Doors 
<p>Bluesky officially launched in just February of this year. When we opened the app to the public, we removed invites, which were a tool to help us grow the app sustainably and safely.</p>
<p>At launch, Bluesky had an early community of 3M people. One week later, over a million new users had signed up.</p>
 Implementing Federation 
<p>Just weeks after our public launch, we achieved a long-standing goal by implementing <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">federation</a>. This milestone represents our commitment to creating an open, interconnected social network that respects user choice. Users can now run their own personal data servers, and thousands have opted to use their own servers instead of Bluesky’s infrastructure.</p>
 Stackable Moderation 
<p>In March, we launched <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">labelers</a>, the first piece of our stackable moderation system that empowers users to take control of their experience. Additionally, we open-sourced Ozone, a collaborative moderation tool that enables independent organizations and people to more easily run their own moderation service.</p>
 More Big Features 
<p>In 2024, we also launched:</p>
 
 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kmjbfqrrbu2t">Hashtags</a>: We added hashtags to make finding content easier. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/05-22-2024-direct-messages">Direct Messages</a>: In May, we launched DMs, creating new avenues for connection. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">Starter packs</a>: In June, we launched starter packs, helping communities onboard to Bluesky more easily. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video">Video Sharing:</a> In September, we launched videos. 
 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3le6bze3nus2c">Trending topics</a>: In December, right around Christmas, we launched trending topics. 
 
 Many Small Features 
<p>We also launched:</p>
 
 Account deactivation (June), 
 Priority notifications (July), 
 Self-moderation tools like detach quotes and hide reply (August), 
 Pinned posts (October), and 
 The thread composer (November). 
 
 Looking forward to 2025 
<p>Building on this year's achievements, we're excited to introduce more features and improvements. Your feedback continues to shape Bluesky’s evolution, and we deeply appreciate the trust you've placed in Bluesky this year.</p>

Through sophisticated algorithms and machine learning, tools built on AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot are revolutionizing how people approach upskilling and professional development.</p><p>In short, AI helps in career development by making the guidance it requires cheaper, faster, and more analytical than ever before.</p> The Five Core Areas of AI-Powered Career Development <p>They’re doing this, because modern AI systems generally excel at several essential areas of career development:</p>  <p>Skill assessment and Enhancement: AI’s affinity for data analysis helps it easily identify someone’s current skills, skill gaps, and how they can bridge them.</p>  <p>Adaptability Training: AI can empower professionals to navigate market trends by illustrating and explaining previous trends, and using data analysis to predict future ones.</p>  <p>Career Exploration: AI’s predictive analytics can combine knowledge of an individual’s skills with current job market insights to suggest potential new opportunities that are within reach.</p>  <p>Social media and networking optimization: With an ability to analyze user profiles, current trends, and platform reviews, personal AI assistants can help individuals transform their online reach and in-person presence.</p>  <p>Automated Routine Tasks: AI can cover a range of small tasks across job searches and career advancement, from simply drafting messages, to summarising information, to providing guides and code for more advanced automation.</p>   The Power of AI Memory and Personalization <p>However, perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of personal AI in career development is its advanced memory capabilities. Unlike human coaches, AI systems can maintain perfect recall of every conversation, goal, and milestone.</p><p>This doesn’t just make interacting with them easier, but allows AI-driven tools to reliably track and interpret long-term data to provide more insightful advice and support.</p><p>For example, our personal AI, Kin, has an advanced memory system which not only remembers what users share, but also analyzes how their attitudes toward work and career goals evolve alongside their skills over time. This helps our users understand their professional growth trajectory, and make more informed decisions about their future.</p> The Role of Emotional Intelligence in AI Career Support <p>While AI's analytical capabilities are impressive, its role in emotional support and motivation is often downplayed—in part down to its bad reputation, thanks to early AI tools and simple <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a>.</p><p>Modern AI systems now include sophisticated emotional intelligence, which allows them to recognize and respond appropriately to user emotions during discussions. Whether that means recognising the user is upset or angry, and adapting accordingly; facilitating the growth of <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a>, or realizing that a user is struggling to see the impact of their emotions on a situation, AI systems can help people not only feel supported, but also increase their own <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-build-emotional-intelligence">emotional intelligence</a> and resilience.</p><p>Those kinds of soft skills are also incredibly powerful in the workplace, so finding easier and cheaper ways to build them effectively is beneficial.<a>3</a></p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee03e263-2526-4f6c-909d-9ff5f35f6c33_1792x1024.webp">          </a>DALL-E/Kin Illustration  Practical Applications of <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Assistants</a> in Today's Workplace <p>So, how does this actually look in practice?</p><p>AI tools based on <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot</a> have revolutionized content optimization, continuous learning, and adaptability in organizations, by making analytical reports, practical information, and bespoke examples much more accessible and easily digestible. As a result, more time can be spent working with the information than working it out.</p><p>Because of this, AI is in the process of getting involved in teaching workers how to use it for career enhancement in these ways. While new frameworks for measuring professional growth, with metrics tracking both technical and soft skill development are the gold standard, they’ve not been deployed much outside of healthcare settings.</p><p>Right now, AI-driven tools for career development are largely initiatives focused around decision-making and job satisfaction enhancements. They provide spaces for employees to log their achievements, skills, and struggles, and then provide real-time feedback for how employees can improve their collaboration, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/boost-productivity-5-top-tips">productivity</a>, and their own skillsets.</p><p>Investment in employee upskilling has <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">already been shown to improve employee retention</a>, so some of these initiatives are a natural extension of that.</p><p>For freelancers and jobseekers, the ability of AI tools on job sites like LinkedIn to summarise skillsets in the context of the job market has made finding a development pathway, or even relevant job opportunities, easier than it's ever been.</p><p>In short, personal AI tools are revolutionizing career development by making it easier for people to be more aware of their emotions, goals, and skillsets, and to be better guided to turning them into what their aspirations require.</p> The Future of AI-Driven Career Development <p>With Deloitte's 2024 Human Capital Trends report claiming only 5% of executives currently feel they’re doing enough to keep employees sufficiently skilled,<a>4</a> how might the technology grow throughout more widespread use?</p><p>The most likely future seems to be the continued integration of AI-powered tools, like personal AI, into workplaces and professional spaces. AI processing and insights don’t just allow companies to better track how their employees are working and learning, and how to improve it, but allow these employees themselves to work toward their own goals. That just makes them happier and more productive in turn.</p><p>Personal AI tools take this a step further, by allowing employees to better focus on self awareness and individual growth with less effort. These tools, especially when integrated with more company-based AI systems, can and will make it much easier for employees to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">have difficult conversations</a>, navigate a <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-tips-to-improve-work-life-balance">work-life balance</a>, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">make time</a> for <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">continuous learning</a>, and keep a<a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/growth-mindset-the-power-of-belief"> growth mindset</a> focused around expanding their abilities.</p><p>Unlike traditional upskilling courses and chatbots, which follow rigid, pre-programmed response patterns, these AI systems can analyze context, remember past interactions, and provide increasingly personalized guidance over time.</p><p>However, this advanced capability also raises important considerations about privacy and ethics—especially given the recent behaviour of the AI industry. As Deloitte has acknowledged alongside us, AI has lost a lot of trust, and needs to focus on being transparent and ethical in its data storage and processing to win it back.</p> Maximizing <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> Tools Like <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> for Career Growth <p>With all that said, how can AI tools be used right now for career development? We’ll use our own personal AI, Kin, as an example.</p><p>The nature of Kin, and of personal AI as a whole, means that it is most effective when used strategically and consistently. All of its benefits rely on a detailed and up-to-date understanding of its users.</p><p>Kin’s advanced, chat-agnostic memory, for instance, becomes more valuable when users regularly and honestly share their professional experiences, challenges, and victories. This helps it build a comprehensive understanding of their current and desired levels in their career journey. As such, Kin can provide more nuanced guidance to where they want to go from where they actually are.</p><p>To aid this, Kin has Chat and Journal features to encourage information, discussion and reflection. These interactive features make it easy for users to express their thoughts, feelings, challenges, and aspirations to Kin, which it then analyzes to reveal personal patterns, insights and advice. This can reveal valuable information about professional strengths, growth areas, and potential career development directions.</p><p>These sessions also supply Kin with workplace relationships and dynamics, which its memory allows it to analyze to provide real-time support in navigating complex professional situations and building <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-ways-to-build-trust-in-digital-workplaces">stronger workplace connections</a>.</p><p>Kin then helps users stay consistent through a customizable push-notification reminder system. In addition to default reminders, users can set up notifications for regular check-ins to review progress toward goals, prepare for important meetings, or reflect on recent professional experiences.</p><p>And, Kin stores and processes <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">as much of this information as possible</a> on user devices—not in the cloud—for maximum <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a>. Every piece of information it remembers is also <a href="https://docs.mykin.ai/articles/7086943-how-to-view-and-delete-your-data-in-kin">viewable and deletable</a> at any time.</p> Get Started with Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Companion</a> Today <p>If that sounds good to you, beginning your career development journey with Kin is straightforward. Just download the app <a href="https://mykin.ai/">here</a>, complete this message, and send it to Kin:</p> <p>"Hi Kin! I'm looking to develop my career with your support. I'm currently [your role] at [your company/industry], and I'm aiming to [your specific goal]. My biggest challenge right now is [your challenge], and I'd like to develop [specific skills/areas]. Could you help me?"</p> <p>From there, Kin will begin building a personalized understanding of your professional situation through conversation. It will ask clarifying questions about your goals and challenges, helping you articulate, plan for, and achieve your career aspirations more clearly.</p> <a>1</a> <p>Anon. 2024. 2024 Workplace Learning Report.

<p>In 2024, the anticipated collision between regulation and innovation gave way to an unprecedented collaboration. This year marked a turning point, where regulatory frameworks and technological advancements joined forces to prioritize privacy without compromising compliance.</p><p>The narrative of “regulation versus innovation” evolved into one of mutual reinforcement, with privacy emerging as the cornerstone of progress.</p> Privacy Innovation: The Cornerstone of&nbsp;2024 <p>The transformation began with a bold proposition: privacy technology can enhance regulatory compliance. Financial institutions and digital asset firms recognized that privacy-preserving tools not only safeguarded user data but also addressed regulators’ demands for transparency.</p><p>Consider the Travel Rule, once a daunting compliance challenge for exchanges. Innovative solutions redefined it, allowing platforms to share only the essential data required for oversight. This shift, driven by mathematical precision and technological ingenuity, highlighted the potential of privacy-centered compliance.</p> Unexpected Pioneers in Privacy-First Regulation <p>Remarkable advancements emerged from surprising quarters. Once-overlooked markets became leaders in regulatory innovation. Experimental regulatory sandboxes transformed into thriving innovation hubs, while central banks integrated privacy features into their digital currency initiatives — reframing them as tools for protecting user rights rather than instruments of surveillance.</p> Technologies That Redefined Compliance <p>Privacy-preserving compliance tools reshaped the regulatory landscape in 2024. These advancements bridged the gap between privacy and oversight:</p>  Identity verification without exposing personal&nbsp;data.  Transaction monitoring that maintains confidentiality.  Regulatory reporting designed to protect user security.  <p>Notably, Shyft Network’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> became a global solution for Travel Rule compliance, enabling secure identity verification and private transaction validation. Similarly, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) matured from theoretical concepts to practical applications, driving innovation in transaction verification and identity management.</p> A Global Shift Toward Privacy and Compliance  North America <p>The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set the stage, but the real breakthroughs lay in privacy-enhanced systems developed by exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. Canada’s advanced frameworks for private institutional trading raised the global&nbsp;bar.</p> Europe <p>MiCA’s implementation propelled European markets to adopt privacy-preserving compliance solutions. French and German exchanges led with tools balancing stringent oversight with robust user privacy. The UK’s emphasis on “privacy by design” influenced global regulatory practices.</p> Asia Pacific <p>Japan’s regulatory framework prioritized privacy, while Singapore introduced cutting-edge compliance tools that became benchmarks for the region. South Korea’s strict approach to oversight spurred creative solutions, and Hong Kong integrated privacy into institutional finance practices.</p> Latin America <p>Brazil’s privacy-preserving compliance measures in payments and Mexico’s advances in remittance privacy showcased the region’s adaptability. Argentina demonstrated that even in challenging economic conditions, confidentiality could be maintained.</p> Middle East and&nbsp;Africa <p>Dubai’s VARA framework enabled groundbreaking cross-border confidentiality tools. Africa’s mobile-first innovations, particularly Nigeria’s, offered solutions that balanced financial inclusion with robust privacy protections.</p> Australia and&nbsp;Oceania <p>Australia’s token mapping initiative redefined asset classification with privacy at its core. Smaller markets in the region demonstrated leadership in adopting and advancing privacy-focused technologies.</p> Key Takeaways   2024 proved that privacy and regulation can complement each other, reshaping financial compliance.  Privacy-preserving tools like zero-knowledge proofs and Veriscope transformed oversight processes.  Unexpected markets, including Latin America and Africa, emerged as leaders in privacy innovation.  Regulatory frameworks like MiCA and the Travel Rule drove technological progress globally.  Privacy-focused compliance is becoming a cornerstone for bridging traditional and decentralized finance.   The Road Ahead: A Privacy-Driven Future <p>As the foundation laid in 2024 takes hold, privacy-preserving compliance is becoming a fundamental aspect of financial innovation. Institutional investors, once hesitant, are now embracing these tools to bridge the divide between traditional and decentralized finance.</p><p>The lessons of 2024 underscore a vital truth: addressing regulatory challenges can drive meaningful progress. By prioritizing privacy alongside compliance, the financial ecosystem has grown stronger, demonstrating that these objectives are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>The next chapter in financial history will focus on leveraging innovation to achieve both oversight and confidentiality, paving the way for a secure, inclusive, and privacy-conscious future.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>🎁 An early gift! Holochain 0.4.0 has been quietly released and is now our recommended version for general use. Holochain 0.3 (currently at 0.3.6) and its infrastructure are still supported and will get maintenance updates as needed, while Holochain 0.2 and its infrastructure are now retired.</p><p>🤏🏻 The big news is that 0.4.0 comes with less – we've disabled unstable features by default, allowing more time for testing. This probably won't affect your app, but just in case, read the upgrade guide&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.4/?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.4/</a>&nbsp;. There are other breaking changes you'll want to know about too!</p><p>🏗 Along with 0.4.0 you'll see a bunch of small quality-of-life improvements in the scaffolding tool. Setting up your first DNA is streamlined, you can edit your entry type's fields before committing to code (super useful feature), and the templates are simpler. Try it over the holidays!&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/</a></p><p>Thank you for journeying with us in 2024. There have been a lot of changes for our organization and the Holochain project, and we deeply appreciate your support through it all. See you in 2025, where we'll keep sharing regular updates on our progress!</p>

 In 2024, we launched our much-anticipated Customer Advisory Board (CAB). Here, we reflect on the top 5 learnings and what we hope to take into 2025.&nbsp; 



<p>At IDnow, the CAB is more than just a platform to communicate with our customers. IDnow CABs are valuable opportunities to collaborate toward the shared goals of shaping the future of identity verification, meeting regulatory requirements, and anticipating upcoming technological and industry challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We organized two CABs in 2024 – one in Munich in June and the other in Paris in October. Both featured strategic discussions, where we covered topics as wide-ranging as eIDAS compliance to fraud prevention and optimal user experience (UX). We also showcased demos of some of our newly launched products like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/yris/">YRIS</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">Videoident Flex</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/instantsign/">InstantSign</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As forums for gathering customer feedback, we also utilize CABs to align our solutions with real market needs and share our strategic vision for the future. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our CABs serve two primary functions,” said Ellie Burns, Head of Product, Customer and Partner Marketing at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>For our customers, they get to play an active advisory role to influence IDnow’s innovation priorities and product roadmap.&nbsp;While for IDnow, it is an invaluable opportunity to tailor our solutions to specific customer challenges.</p>Ellie Burns, Head of Product, Customer and Partner Marketing at IDnow.</blockquote>



 IDnow’s top 5 key takeaways from 2024 CABs.&nbsp; 



 1. Client collaboration is essential for innovation.&nbsp; 



<p>The success of our solutions relies on a deep understanding of client needs. IDnow’s CABs provide a collaborative framework where participants get to share their experiences and directly influence innovation priorities. This process ensures our solutions address tangible challenges across various industries while paving the way for new use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>CABs help us stay aligned with real market needs while giving our clients the opportunity to co-create tomorrow’s solutions.</p>Élodie Poulain, Marketing Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



 2. Regulatory compliance is a shared priority.&nbsp; 



<p>In the face of increasingly complex regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 and upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/aml-compliance-2024-amld6/">Anti Money Laundering Authority requirements</a>, CABs can help raise awareness of industry warning signs and important milestones so customers can prepare. Plus, by integrating customer feedback, we can develop solutions that comply with the highest standards while meeting expectations for speed, security and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>

 3. Fraud prevention requires a collaborative approach.&nbsp; 



<p>With threats like deepfakes and synthetic identity fraud on the rise, CABs can be vital forums for discussing best practices of dealing with fraud. It is these insights that allow us&nbsp;to co-create solutions capable of detecting emerging fraud that also enhance overall security. Innovations such as photoswap detection and video injection prevention are direct outcomes of these strategic discussions.&nbsp;</p>



 4. User experience (UX) is a key differentiator.&nbsp; 



<p>Feedback gathered from CAB participants allows us to regularly refine and optimize our products. For example, customer feedback on InstantSign enabled us to add additional features and advanced functionality and a flawless user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 5. CABs act as accelerators for cross-sector synergies.&nbsp; 



<p>By bringing customers together&nbsp;from a range of industries, including financial services, telecoms, gaming and mobility, the IDnow CABs foster unique synergies. Exchanging opinions on diverse topics leads to unique perspectives and innovative approaches that have applications across multiple sectors. They are valuable opportunities to explore new horizons while strengthening our industry expertise.&nbsp;</p>

 Closing 2024: A Year of Innovation, Growth, and Building Tools For Onchain Finance Economy 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This year has been a journey of innovation, growth, and achievement. <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">At the beginning of this year</a>, we set out to achieve four objectives: accelerating the standardization phase; digitizing real-world assets and securities at scale; enabling DeFi through a unified data layer for private markets; and building distribution rails to streamline access and adoption.</p>
<p>Let’s look back on the remarkable progress we made together.</p>
<p>ERC-3643 is now the official standard, recognized globally</p>
<p>The ERC-3643 open-source standard has emerged as the cornerstone of the tokenization industry, serving as the <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc-3643-the-motherboard-for-composable-tokenized-assets/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">motherboard</a> for building diverse use cases. We have actively worked with <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-achieves-widespread-adoption-with-mas-recognition-and-support-from-92-members">92 industry leaders in the ERC3643 Association</a> to advance the standard by contributing to concrete projects.</p>
<p>Moreover, ERC-3643 has gained significant traction from large organizations, being used or referenced in industry reports by ABN AMRO, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, ESMA, BCG, KPMG, and Deloitte. Recently, it was recognized by the Singapore regulator MAS for enforcing compliance for tokenized funds and debt in the Project Guardian.</p>
<p>An Onchain Operating System Ready for Scale&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the products side, our solutions are now ready to empower asset issuers to tokenize assets at scale. To reach critical mass, asset managers need a tech toolbox that allows them not only to tokenize assets onchain but also to manage and distribute them while working seamlessly with all stakeholders using different tools and systems.</p>
<p>Our products provide exactly that. We’ve redefined <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-journey-to-becoming-the-leading-onchain-finance-operating-system/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">our product positioning as an onchain operating system</a> to make our product’s value proposition clear. We provide an<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-tokenys-platform-empowers-fund-administrators-to-act-in-onchain-finance/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8"> orchestrated platform</a> that unifies and automates workflows with all necessary service providers, whether&nbsp; onchain or offchain.&nbsp; Our added value lies in the most robust technology, a well-connected ecosystem, and expertise gained from 7 years of real-world practices.</p>
<p>Our product is designed to serve diverse business needs, on <a href="https://tokeny.com/multi-chain-tokenization-made-simple/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">any EVM blockchain</a>, for any assets, in any jurisdiction. The T-REX Platform, a no-code tool,&nbsp; empowers businesses to tokenize, manage, and distribute assets without requiring IT resources, while the T-REX Engine, an <a href="https://tokeny.com/56-of-fortune-500-are-onchain-apis-are-your-key-to-staying-ahead/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">APIs solution</a>, is designed for advanced projects integrating onchain operational capabilities directly into their existing workflows.</p>
<p>Our product enhances onchain compliance setup. Controlling tokens requires asset managers to configure token settings through token smart contracts. Our products allow asset managers to <a href="https://tokeny.com/streamline-on-chain-compliance-configure-and-customize-anytime/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">configure and customize compliance rules anytime,</a> such as eligibility rules, transfer restrictions, and enablement of distribution.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi via onchain data management and shared liquidity catalog</p>
<p>Assets issued with ERC-3643 automatically receive an AssetID smart contract. This built-in onchain asset identity enables data enrichment like NAV, ESG proofs, and ratings. ERC-3643 tokens are accessible through a shared onchain catalog with a unified data set, allowing seamless DeFi interaction while adhering to built-in compliance rules.</p>
<p>Step by step, we have started creating a unified Catalog of tokenized assets that includes token data, asset data, stakeholder data, and offering data. This catalog will enable distributors (regulated exchanges, OTC platforms, dApps, neobrokers, etc.) to easily select assets for distribution to their respective audiences.</p>
<p>To maximize transactions and interoperability between distributors, we have also created DINO, a shared liquidity protocol on the blockchain. DINO is a decentralized network enabling the distribution of compliant tokenized assets. The system leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the publishing and settlement of digital assets, transforming how issuers, their distributors, and&nbsp; investors conduct transactions.</p>
<p>At its core, the system enables parties to post and browse trading intentions, known as Offers, via token-specific distribution smart contracts. This innovation ensures that all offers are transparent and accessible on the blockchain, creating a continuous live feed of available trading intentions for all participants to see. It is now ready for prime time. 2025 will be epic!</p>
<p>The Foundation is Built: What’s Next for Tokenization?</p>
<p>This year, we’ve built a solid foundation for onchain finance with all the essential building blocks. 2025 will be a year of accelerating institutional adoption as the buy-side begins to fully&nbsp; benefit from the tokenization format. We will see more and more applications leveraging compliant tokenized assets, and Tokeny is ready to lead this transformation. Thank you for being with us on this journey.</p>
<p>We wish you a great holiday season and a happy new year!</p>

<p>Back in November 2024, my article “<a href="https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.108">Token Lifetimes and Security in OAuth 2.0: Best Practices and Emerging Trends</a>” was published in the <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">IDPro® Body of Knowledge</a>, and wow—over 1,600 people have already checked it out! If you’re one of those people who clicked on the article but didn’t quite have time to read it (or bookmarked it for “later” but haven’t circled back yet), this post is for you.</p>



<p>I love to read—and I’m lucky enough to have the time to do it when I need to. Not everyone gets that chance, and let’s be honest, some people just aren’t ready, willing, or able to dive into a long article. And that’s okay! You do you, boo; it takes all kinds to make this crazy world come together. </p>



 OAuth 2.0 Tokens – the sound version 



<p>Because I enjoy messing around with technology, I decided to see if Google’s <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com">NotebookLM</a> might produce something that would help people who want a differently-consumable format of the Tokens article. While I personally like the written version better (did I mention I like to read?) this didn’t turn out too badly.</p>







<p>If you’re looking for something in between—like a quick outline to decide if you want to spend 20 minutes listening to the AI-generated podcast or however long it takes to read a 15-page article—here’s a brief summary to help you figure out what works best for you.</p>



 Tokens in Summary 



<p>The summary was also generated out of the NotebookLM interface. I’d love to hear what you think about making my content come through this way! Enjoy!</p>



 Executive Summary 



<p>This document analyzes the security implications of short-lived and long-lived tokens within the OAuth 2.0 framework. It highlights the benefits of using short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens to mitigate security risks such as token replay attacks, while acknowledging specific scenarios where long-lived tokens might be considered. The document also explores emerging trends like Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP), risk-based token lifetimes, and sender-constrained tokens, which aim to enhance security without compromising usability. Overall, the document emphasizes that while there are situations where long lived tokens may make sense, short-lived tokens are generally best practice.</p>



 Introduction to Tokens in OAuth 2.0 



 
 Tokens as Identity Representation: Tokens are digital objects representing claims or attributes of an entity (user, device, or process) used in authentication and authorization protocols. They enable secure communication without requiring constant re-validation. 



 Quote: “A token is a digital object that can represent a set of claims or attributes about an entity, such as a user, device, or process, typically used in authentication and authorization protocols.” 



 Stateless vs. Stateful Tokens: Tokens can be stateless (containing all necessary information) or stateful (requiring the server to maintain session information). 



 Bearer vs. Client-Bound Tokens: Tokens can be bearer tokens (usable by anyone holding them) or client-bound (tied to a specific client). 



 Quote: “Tokens can be classified as bearer tokens, which are usable by anyone in possession of them, or client-bound tokens (sometimes called sender-constrained tokens…)…” 



 Scope and Minimization: Limiting the scope of a token (permissions for only specific resources or actions) is critical for reducing security risks. The principle of “least privilege” should be applied. 



 Quote: “One of the most effective strategies when issuing tokens is to narrowly scope their permissions. A narrowly scoped token is designed to grant access to only a specific resource or a limited set of actions rather than offering broad, unrestricted access.” 



 Tokens vs Credentials: Tokens and credentials are not the same thing. Credentials are used for authentication, tokens are used for authorization. 
 



 Short-Lived Tokens: The Security Standard 



 
 Definition: Short-lived tokens expire quickly (minutes or hours) limiting the window of opportunity for attackers. 



 Quote: “Short-lived tokens are designed to expire after a brief period—usually minutes or hours—thereby minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit them if they are intercepted or compromised.” 



 Reduced Attack Surface: Short token lifetimes significantly reduce the impact of token compromise. Even if a token is intercepted, it quickly becomes invalid. 



 Quote: “One of the big benefits of short-lived tokens is the reduction of the attack window (i.e., the length of time that an attacker could exploit endpoints).” 



 Enhanced Security through Rotation: Frequent token rotation enforces the need for persistent attackers to repeatedly intercept new tokens, increasing the chance of detection. 



 Quote: “Short-lived tokens play a crucial role in reducing the impact of token compromise by enforcing frequent token rotation.” 



 Stateless Architectures: Short lived tokens fit well in stateless architectures, eliminating the need to maintain session state on the server. 



 Integration with Security Mechanisms: Short-lived tokens should be used with other security practices like token binding and revocation. 



 Quote: “The standards also encourage the combination of short-lived tokens with other security mechanisms, such as client-bound tokens or token binding, which ensures that tokens can only be used by specific clients…” 
 



 The Role of Refresh Tokens 



 
 Purpose: Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials used to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication. 



 Security Considerations: Compromised refresh tokens can grant extended access, so they need protection. 



 Security Measures:Refresh Token Rotation: Reissue refresh tokens upon every use 



 Client Binding: Cryptographically bind refresh tokens to specific clients or devices. 



 Reauthentication: Require periodic reauthentication before issuing new refresh tokens. 



 Token Revocation: Revoke both refresh and access tokens upon suspicious activity. 



 Secure Storage: Refresh tokens should be stored securely by the client. 
 



 Risks of Long-Lived Tokens 



 
 Definition: Long-lived tokens remain valid for extended periods. API keys and session tokens used in mobile apps are common examples. 



 Prolonged Unauthorized Access: If compromised, attackers gain persistent access, especially if revocation mechanisms are weak or not real time. 



 Quote: “If these long-lived tokens are compromised, attackers can use them to gain persistent unauthorized access to systems or resources without being detected for an extended period.” 



 Token Replay Vulnerabilities: Long-lived tokens are vulnerable to replay attacks where an intercepted token is reused by an attacker. 



 Quote: “In a token replay attack, an attacker intercepts a token…and reuses it to impersonate a legitimate user.” 



 Difficulties with Revocation: Manual revocation or waiting for expiration creates a window for continued exploitation. 



 Increased Attack Surface: Longer validity allows attackers more time to explore and exploit vulnerabilities. 



 Difficulty in Enforcing Least Privilege: Long-lived tokens often grant broader permissions than necessary, making any compromise have greater impact. 
 



 When Long-Lived Tokens May Be Appropriate 



 
 Reduced Overhead in Token Renewal: Less frequent requests to the authentication server. 



 Use case: Batch processing or long-running data analytics. 



 Improved Performance in Stateless Systems: Reduces need for constant issuance of new tokens. 



 Use case: High request APIs 



 Service-to-Service Communication: Efficient communication within a highly trusted environment. 



 Use case: Microservice architectures within secure internal networks. 
 



 Emerging Trends and Future Directions 



 
 Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP): Real-time assessment and adjustment of permissions, enabling longer token lifespans with dynamic revocation. 



 Quote: “CAEP enables access tokens to have longer lifespans without compromising security. This is achieved by combining periodic risk assessments with real-time revocation capabilities.” 



 Risk-Based Token Lifetimes: Dynamic adjustment of token expiration times based on real-time risk analysis. 



 Proof of Possession (PoP) and Sender-Constrained Tokens: Cryptographic proof of token ownership. Standards like DPoP and Mutual TLS reduce token replay risks. 



 Enhanced Revocation Mechanisms: Efforts to develop real-time token revocation standards. 
 



 Conclusion 



 
 Short-Lived Tokens as Best Practice: Short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens combined with client binding and strong cryptographic standards are the best practice for mitigating security risks. 



 Zero Trust: If your organization uses Zero Trust principles, then there is no concept of a trusted environment. 



 Balancing Security and Usability: Aim for a balance between security, usability, and performance. 



 Evolving Landscape: Token management frameworks are evolving, with emerging standards allowing for longer lived tokens under strict monitoring and policy enforcement 



 Organization Risk Posture: An organization’s risk posture should guide the definition of “short” and “long”. However, regardless of the definition, strict scoping, token binding, and robust revocation must be in place. 
 



 Actionable Items 



 
 Review and Update Token Lifetimes: Evaluate current token expiration policies and transition to shorter lifetimes where possible. 



 Implement Client-Bound Tokens: Employ client-bound or sender-constrained tokens where appropriate. 



 Implement Refresh Token Rotation: Ensure that refresh tokens are rotated on every use. 



 Enhance Revocation Mechanisms: Implement robust revocation processes and monitor token usage. 



 Stay Informed: Follow emerging standards like CAEP and adapt strategies based on advancements.

<p>In the <a href="https://datarella.com/confidential-computing-for-industry-4-0/">first part</a> of this <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-takes-part-in-new-industry-4-0-research-project-cosmic-x/">Cosmic-X</a> blogpost series, we evaluated various blockchain platforms for their suitability in Industry 4.0 and explained why we chose the <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> with its confidential computing capabilities. Today, we’ll explore how we use the Secret Network to secure machine data integrity from its origin to its consumption.</p>
<p></p>
 Need for Data Integrity 
<p>Securing data integrity in Industry 4.0 is crucial because systems and devices rely on accurate data to function effectively. Tampered or incorrect data can lead to poor decisions, operational failures, and vulnerabilities in key sectors like manufacturing and logistics. With IoT and AI driving Industry 4.0, maintaining data accuracy ensures reliable operations, protects sensitive information, and prevents cyber threats that disrupt businesses and critical infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ispirer.com/blog/data-integrity-during-migration-5-best-practices"></a></p>
<p>Anchoring data close to its source is essential for securing integrity across the entire data processing chain, which often involves multiple distributed systems. For machines, this means securing the data before it leaves the device. At the same time, the system must protect the anchored data from tampering after export. Blockchain’s immutable nature aligns perfectly with this paradigm. That’s why we built a Wallet Service on top of the Secret Network. This service integrates seamlessly into any machine to secure its data integrity in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner.</p>
 Wallet Service 
<p>The Wallet Service acts as a gateway for communication with the Secret Network. It deploys onto any machine infrastructure that supports <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. By using the Wallet Service, machines interact directly with the blockchain and its smart contracts. The service assigns each machine a unique identity through a public-private key pair. With its private key, the machine signs and broadcasts transactions to anchor its data on the Secret Network. The blockchain’s encryption ensures that no unauthorized third party can access the data. For details on how the network reaches consensus despite encryption, refer to our previous <a href="https://datarella.com/confidential-computing-for-industry-4-0/">post</a>.</p>
 Integration 
<p>To simplify integration, the Wallet Service offers a straightforward REST API with two endpoints. The ingress endpoint accepts a batch of data in a defined structure for anchoring. After receiving the data, the Wallet Service hashes it and stores the resulting hash in the service’s smart contract through a transaction on the Secret Network. This process creates an immutable fingerprint, allowing anyone to verify the integrity of a data batch through the Wallet Service’s verification endpoint. Since data verification typically occurs in systems other than the one that supplied the data, the Wallet Service supports deployment anywhere. In distributed data processing scenarios like Cosmic-X, entities that consume data instantiate a Wallet Service to verify data integrity before making decisions. For example, an AI service provider might deploy a Wallet Service in its cloud environment to verify data before using it for training or inference.</p>
 Requirements 
<p>Two conditions must be met for this workflow to function: first, the verifying Wallet Service must have the appropriate viewing key from the machine that supplied the data. Otherwise, it cannot decrypt and query the fingerprints stored in the smart contract. Second, the format and schema of the data batch must remain standardized across the processing chain. To achieve this, we developed a Data Integrity Protocol as the foundation of the Wallet Service.</p>
 Data Integrity Protocol 
<p>To anchor and verify data batches reliably, the Wallet Service requires a standardized protocol. Both the data anchoring and verification processes must adhere to a common data format, schema, and canonicalization standard. For Cosmic-X, we chose JSON as the data format and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8785">RFC 8785</a> as the canonicalization algorithm. Canonicalization ensures reliable cryptographic operations on JSON data by defining methods for handling whitespace, data types, and objects.</p>
 Batch Structure 
<p>Considering use case requirements and the limitations of edge and cloud environments in Cosmic-X, we define a data batch as one hour’s worth of sensor data collected from a machine. The figure below shows an extract of a data batch collected from one of the use cases. The batch includes a metadata object used only for the Wallet Service’s business logic. This metadata contains key-value pairs such as the batchId and placeholders for the payload hash and the transaction hash on the Secret Network blockchain. The payload, which the system hashes during anchoring, consists of discrete sensor measurements. Each measurement uses a composite key created by concatenating the variable name with the Unix timestamp of its recording. The measurements include key-value pairs for variable name, timestamp, absolute value, and data type.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The batchId is the most critical part of a data batch. Since the Wallet Service uses it to anchor and later locate the data batch for verification, the batchId must be unique. In this setup, the batchId combines a machine ID with a Unix timestamp representing the time range of measurements in the batch, rounded to the nearest hour. For example, if machine <code>2080839</code> collects measurements from <code>11:01:23</code>&nbsp;to <code>11:59:43</code> on May 16, 2024, the batchId becomes <code>2080839_1715853600</code>.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll showcase how we integrated the Wallet Service with three live machines and an AI service to enable secure and accurate anomaly detection in machine components.</p>

Extrimian’s cutting-edge solutions, including ID Connect and SSI API, leverage the power of decentralized identity to safeguard sensitive health data against emerging cyber threats.</p>

<p></p>



 Decentralized Identity: A Shield Against Data Breaches 



<p>Decentralized identity technology serves as the cornerstone of Extrimian’s approach, employing DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) to create a robust framework resistant to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>



 Streamlining Healthcare Processes 



<p>Extrimian’s technology not only enhances security but also streamlines administrative procedures, reducing costs and saving time. This efficiency is crucial for healthcare providers aiming to improve service delivery and patient care quality.</p>



 Improving Patient Experience with Self-Sovereign Identity 



<p>By integrating self-sovereign identity models, Extrimian places control directly in the hands of patients, allowing for a transparent and user-friendly way to manage personal health data. This shift enhances patient trust and satisfaction by providing a more personalized healthcare experience.</p>



 Privacy and Compliance: Securing Patient Data 



<p>Extrimian’s use of the<a href="https://quarkid.org" title=""> QuarkID protocol </a>ensures that all data transactions meet global standards for data protection, such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This protocol is essential for maintaining privacy and securing sensitive information within the health sector.</p>



 Now what? A Proactive Approach to Secure Healthcare 



<p>Extrimian’s decentralized identity solutions represent a proactive approach to secure healthcare data management. By adopting these technologies, healthcare providers can protect sensitive information, comply with stringent regulations, and improve overall patient care.</p>

Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>  <p>Define Your Goal</p>  <p>The first step in setting and following your goals is knowing the goal you’d like to accomplish.</p><p>If you already have a goal in mind, just let Kin know in the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-chat">Chat</a>! <br><br>If you don’t, Kin can use its knowledge of you to suggest potential goals that will help you break out worries or habits it's noticed are affecting you negatively.</p><p>Just ask Kin this, also in the Chat: ‘What goals do you think I should work on, based on your knowledge of me?’</p><p>Either way, your definition of a goal should include:</p>  <p>What you want to accomplish</p>  <p>Why it matters to you</p>  <p>When you'd like to achieve it by</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F326bf11d-843a-4017-9bcd-7ac9bb72fbe1_1280x720.gif">   </a>  <p>💡 While Kin can track multiple goals, it’s best to focus on one main goal at a time for the most helpful results.</p>   <p>Check Kin’s Knowledge</p>  <p>Once you’ve provided a defined goal, ask Kin if there’s anything it needs to know about your current situation in order to help you reach it.</p><p>During this discussion, the more detail you provide about your circumstances and relationships, the better Kin will understand your challenges. This is what allows it to support you in the way you need.</p><p>Remember to include your feelings in this discussion, too: these are especially helpful to Kin!</p><p>As always, you can either <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-personalise-kins-communication">type or use voice commands to communicate with Kin</a>—choose whichever feels most natural.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff52b97b8-f679-41d9-bd9d-30ab39654d1e_1280x720.gif">          </a>  <p>💡 You can also check Kin’s data on you, to see if there’s any missing or outdated information about you in Kin’s memory. Remember, it’s all stored with <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a> in mind.</p>   <p>Break Down the Steps</p>  <p>Now, ask Kin how you should best split your goal into achievable goals based on its understanding of you.</p><p>As Kin makes suggestions about how to structure this work, tell it which you like, and which you don’t.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to add your own ideas to the discussion too!</p><p>Before long, you should have a clear plan on how you’ll work on your goal when, and what results you’ll have at a certain time.</p> <p>💡 Plans can change as skills and situations change. Always talk to Kin if you’re unsure!</p>   <p>Set Up Check-ins</p>  <p>Finally, decide with Kin how often you'd like to check in with Kin about your progress.</p><p>Regular discussions about this help both you and Kin understand your progress, and update your plan as needed to keep you on track.</p><p>You can ask Kin to set custom Reminders for these discussions through the Chat, too. Just tell Kin what to say when, confirm the draft it provides, and it’ll handle the rest!</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced60875-4cf2-487c-a8ed-a5d7c0bb2b9f_1280x720.gif">   </a>  <p>💡 Kin’s Reminders don’t have to be about check-ins—they can be about milestones, important life events outside your goal progress, or anything you like!</p>  Making the Most of Goal-Setting with <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> <p>There’s a lot of potential in Kin’s goal-setting capability that extends beyond other <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a>. Here's how to maximize it:</p>  <p>Be Specific</p>  <p>The more detailed you are about your goals and challenges, the better Kin can help.</p><p>Include specific obstacles, timeframes, motivations and desired outcomes.</p>  <p>Stay Flexible</p>  <p>Goals often need adjustment as circumstances change.</p><p>Don't hesitate to work with Kin to modify your goals or timeline whenever needed. Kin will never judge you for needing to move deadlines.</p>  <p>Regular Updates</p>  <p>Keep Kin informed about your progress. Regular check-ins help Kin understand what's working and what isn't, so it can adjust your plan accordingly with you.</p>  <p><a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">Trust</a> the Process</p>  <p>Working toward any goal takes time, and sometimes it can feel like you’re going nowhere. As hard as it is, sometimes you just have to trust that your work will lead somewhere better.</p><p>If in doubt, you can always explain your doubts to Kin for support and potential solutions.</p> Extra Tips <p>Still looking for tips? Here are some more ways to enhance your goal-setting:</p>  <p>Start Simple: Begin with a straightforward, short-term goal to familiarize yourself with the process. Kin can always help you expand it later.</p>    <p>Track Progress: Regularly view your data to see how you're advancing toward your goals visually, and ask Kin how you could improve as you check in.</p>    <p>Be Honest: Share both successes and setbacks with Kin—both are equally important not just to Kin’s understanding of you, but to the learning process in general.</p>    <p>Celebrate Wins: Take time to acknowledge progress, even small steps forward. Every task completed is something gained, and that’s important!</p>   Get Started Today with your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI Companion</a> <p>Feeling ready to begin setting and achieving your goals?
