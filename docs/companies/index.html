<p>With the acceleration of digital transformation and hybrid work, the number of devices and machines accessing critical data and resources has increased exponentially. The growing number of devices accessing sensitive data gives rise to an expanded attack surface that leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause financial and reputational damage.</p>
<p>The traditional network perimeter is no more. Identities – whether human or machine – have become the new line of defense when it comes to protecting against cyberattacks. To effectively manage your devices, you need complete visibility over all devices and machines in your organization. While digital certificates are an effective way to create and manage machine identities and device authentication to secure data and communication between a device and an organization’s critical resources (whether in the cloud or on-premises), managing the lifecycle of these digital certificates across disparate environments and a multitude of different devices is proving to be a challenge for many enterprise IT teams.</p>
<p>Managing Digital Certificates Across Devices and Operating Systems</p>
<p>Having a complete certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solution that enables automation is key to having control and ensuring compliance across your digital certificate estate. In addition, an effective PKI solution should support multiple protocols to support certificate enrollment across a number of devices (mobile, laptops, IoT, etc.) and operating systems to provide end-to-end CLM across a global enterprise.</p>
<p>Much like the remote/hybrid work option allows people to be flexible, a PKI solution must integrate with mobile device management (MDM) solutions to allow organizations to do the same, in turn supporting advanced identification, authentication, and authorization schemes, enabling organizations to deploy and manage MDM solutions effectively with strong machine identities. Microsoft Windows devices that account for a large number of workforce devices use the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions Protocol (WSTEP), which allows for secure certificate enrollment and revocation capabilities.</p>
<p>Automation is a key requirement for CLM to ensure seamless certificate enrollment and revocation processes. Having a cloud-based PKI as a service that integrates with MDM solutions eliminates the costly overhead with on-premises infrastructure and ensures your organization is being actively managed and secured.</p>
<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, it’s up to you and your organization to continue to grow and evolve with the trends and reduce complexity for enterprise IT departments worldwide. Learn how <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/pki/managed-services/pki-as-a-service">Entrust PKI as a Service (PKIaaS)</a> enables seamless <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/mobile-device-management-byod">integration with leading MDM vendors</a> like Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace ONE, Google Enterprise MDM via Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP), Ivanti, and Jamf Pro, so customers can deploy and provision digital certificates with ease.</p>

<p>Extreme weather events can be catastrophic to both people and the environment. But flash floods, hurricanes and winter storms also profoundly impact utilities. With electricity being the backbone of modern life and business operations, a loss of power can have disastrous consequences that require more than a flashlight and battery-powered radio to be solved. Today, utilities are meeting these challenges and risks with innovation by leaning on data and AI to prepare for the next event.</p>



 US utilities grapple with cold, catastrophic events&nbsp; 



<p>In 2023, the US experienced 28 separate <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/2023-historic-year-us-billion-dollar-weather-and-climate-disasters">weather and climate disasters</a>, ranging from severe thunderstorms to wildfires, that caused around USD 92 billion in damages. However, over the past 12 years, the US has encountered at least five events where unforeseen freezing weather caused outages and posed threats to grid reliability.</p>



<p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S234573762250004X">Winter Storm Uri</a> wreaked havoc on Texas, leaving over 4.5 million people without power and causing economic losses between USD 80 billion and USD 130 billion. As temperatures plummeted, power plants relying on various fuel types began to fail. It became evident that the entire system was unprepared for such extreme freezing conditions and utilities began “load shedding,” which caused a city-wide blackout.&nbsp;And in December 2022, <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-nerc-release-final-report-lessons-winter-storm-elliott">Winter Storm Elliott</a> struck the US Eastern Interconnection grid, resulting in 90,500megawatts (MW) of generation experiencing unplanned outages.</p>







 Challenges to keeping the power on during severe weather 



<p>The root of the monetary damages, outages and grid unreliability can be found in these key challenges currently plaguing US utilities:</p>



 
 Inability to identify at-risk assets: Many US utilities operate on aging infrastructure (such as power lines) that is prone to breakdowns when exposed to harsh weather conditions such as heavy rain, flood waters and strong winds. Identifying at-risk assets in advance is a main challenge for utilities.&nbsp; 



 Ineffective outage predictions: Many utilities struggle to accurately predict outages, and load and energy demand due to a lack of weather forecast parameters, inconsistent data and inadequate technology. Notably, during Winter Storm Elliott, the total load forecast was underestimated by 23,047 MW. 



 Delayed or inadequate response time: Due to a lack of advanced technology and the inability to predict future events accurately, utilities are unable to mobilize crews efficiently, which leads to delayed response time.&nbsp; 



 Failure to meet winterization standards or conduct inspections efficiently: In accordance with <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/winter-storm-elliott-report-inquiry-bulk-power-system-operations-during-december-2022">guidelines</a>, utilities must develop winter weather preparedness plans, including inspection and maintenance checklists for the freeze protection measures of generating units. The lack of adherence to winterization standards and failure to inspect thoroughly ahead of storms result in freezing equipment and pipes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Ineffective vegetation management: Vegetation contact with utility lines and poles cause most power outages, and managing vegetation is one of the largest budgeted expenses for utilities. Utilities spend up to USD 8 billion per year on overhead line and vegetation management. 
 



<p>In addition to these challenges, unplanned generating unit losses and a reduction in natural gas production are significant contributing factors.</p>



 Preparing for disaster with innovation and intelligence&nbsp; 



<p>While natural disasters are inevitable, the power of data, AI, intelligent weather insights, IoT, geospatial technology and advanced asset management technologies can significantly enhance disaster management and fortify the grid.</p>



<p>The combination of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/asset-management">IBM® Maximo® Application Suite (MAS)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM® Environmental Intelligence Suite</a> offers a robust tool to help utilities better prepare for extreme weather conditions:&nbsp;</p>



 1. Reliability centered maintenance:  



<p>Aging assets combined with the inability to identify at-risk assets in advance creates a complex, dangerous environment for utilities. IBM is solving these challenges by combining reliability centered maintenance (RCM), enterprise asset management (EAM), and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">asset performance management</a> (APM) capabilities into a single platform. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/reliability-centered-maintenance">IBM Maximo Reliability Strategies application</a> enables end-to-end processes for initiating, completing and deploying RCM studies and tracking outcomes. These advanced capabilities empower organizations to make data-driven maintenance decisions, focus on critical and at-risk assets, and strategically allocate the exact level of maintenance that organizations require to preserve their functions. Utilities can also develop strategies for cold-weather reliability standards that are tailored to individual assets.<br><br>Diving deeper, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">asset performance management (APM)</a> with MAS helps organizations determine how and when assets are going to fail and identifies at-risk assets in advance so that they can take immediate actions. Using AI-powered tools such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/remote-monitoring">IBM Maximo Monitor</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">IBM Maximo® Health</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/predictive-maintenance">IBM Maximo Predict</a>, utilities can optimize maintenance strategies, reduce maintenance costs and prolong the lifespan of assets by proactively understanding their health and associated risks. The features of this platform can enhance asset performance in extreme situations, minimizing unplanned downtime.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Outage prediction:  



<p>MAS, in conjunction with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite&nbsp;Outage Prediction</a>, enables utilities to predict and monitor outages by location with increased confidence by using weather intelligence data and taking relevant actions. This approach improves demand response, allowing for advanced asset fixes, preparation and the quick integration of backup generation plants into the grid. As an example, discover how IBM successfully implemented IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite Outage Prediction for&nbsp;Hydro One, which resulted in a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hydro-one-reduces-power-outage-ai/">33% improvement in power restoration</a> during an ice storm.</p>







 3. Field service management:  



<p>To overcome the challenges of delayed crew response and paper-based inspections, utilities can harness the power of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/mobile-eam">IBM Maximo Mobile</a> and MAS. These products provide efficient asset management, intelligent scheduling and dispatching, which results in faster crew mobilization and better emergency preparedness.</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/mobile-eam">IBM Maximo Mobile</a> also enables the streamlining of inspection and maintenance checklist processes. For instance, mobile inspections can be integrated with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/visual-inspection">IBM Maximo Visual Inspection</a>, which uses AI to automatically detect visual inspection issues.</p>







 4. Vegetation management:  



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/vegetation-management">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite Vegetation Management</a> platform delivers AI-driven insights about vegetation growth by using satellite data and Geiger-mode LiDAR combined with weather insights to help utilities make more informed decisions.&nbsp;For example, deciding where to trim trees ahead of a storm could be prioritized based on criticality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As extreme weather and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/climate-change-examples/">climate events continue to increase in severity</a>, utilities need the tools to overcome pervasive industry challenges and boost their severe weather preparedness. With data, AI, intelligence and more, IBM’s client resilience solutions can be an effective choice in keeping the lights on today and the grid resilient tomorrow.</p>

  <p>Today <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurityGA">we announced</a> that Microsoft Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide on April 1. The following new Microsoft Entra skills will be available in the standalone Copilot for Security experience: User Details, Group Details, Sign-in Logs, Audit Logs, and Diagnostic Logs. User Risk Investigation, a skill embedded in Microsoft Entra, will also be available in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills help identity admins protect against identity compromise through providing identity context and insights for security incidents and helping to resolve identity-related risks and sign-in issues. We’re excited to bring new identity capabilities to Copilot for Security and help identity and security operators <a href="http://aka.ms/copilotforsecurity">protect at machine speed.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity skills in Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what each of these new Entra Skills in Copilot for Security do to help identity professionals secure access, while easily integrating into any admin's daily workflow via natural language prompts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User details can quickly surface context on any user managed in Entra, such as username, location, job title, contact information, authentication methods, the account creation date, and account status. Admins can prompt Copilot with phrases like "tell me more about this user”, “list the active users created in the last 5 days”, “what authentication methods does this user have”, and “is this user’s account enabled” to pull up this kind of information in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group details can summarize details on any group managed in Entra.&nbsp; Admins can ask Copilot questions like “who is the owner of group X?”, “tell me about the group that starts with XYZ”, and “how many members are in this group?” for immediate context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in logs can highlight information about sign-in logs and conditional access policies applied to your tenant to assist with identity investigations and troubleshooting. Admins must simply instruct their Copilot to “show me recent sign-ins for this user”, “show me the sign-ins from this IP address”, or “show me the failed sign-ins for this user.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs can help isolate anomalies associated with audit logs, including changes to roles and access privileges. Admins just have to ask Copilot to “show me audit logs for actions initiated by this user” or “show me the audit logs for this kind of event”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin, who has identified a risky user under the username ‘rashok’, asks Copilot for the March 5th audit logs for ‘rashok’ to discover what actions that user took while at a heightened risk of compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnostic logs can help assess the health and completeness of your tenant's policy configurations. This helps ensure sign-in and audit logs are correctly set up, and that there are no gaps in the log collection process. Admins can ask “what logs are being collected in my tenant” or “are audit logs enabled” to quickly remediate any gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Copilot in Entra for risk investigation&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better picture of how Copilot for Security can increase the speed at which you respond to identity risks, let’s imagine a scenario in which a user is flagged for having a high-risk level due to several abnormal sign-in attempts. With the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, available in public preview with Copilot for Security, admins can get an analysis of the user risk level coupled with recommendations on how to mitigate an incident and resolve the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot summarizes in natural language why the user risk level was elevated. Then, Copilot provides an actionable list of steps to help nullify the risk and close the alert. Finally, Copilot provides a series of recommendations an identity admin can take to automate the response to identity threats, minimizing exposure to a compromised identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a provisioned pay-as-you-go licensing model&nbsp;that makes Copilot for Security accessible to a wider range of organizations than any other solution on the market. With this flexible, consumption-based pricing model, you can get started quickly, then scale your usage and costs according to your needs and budget. Copilot for Security will be available for purchase April 1, 2024. Connect with your account representative now so your organization can be among the first to realize the incredible benefits.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.</p>
 The Allure of Identity Wallets 
<p>Identity wallets propose an enticing vision: a user-centric model where individuals have full control over their identity credentials, sharing them effortlessly and securely across services and organizations. This concept aligns with the broader trend towards empowering users and enhancing privacy. By consolidating identity verification in a single, secure location, identity wallets seem to offer a panacea for the fragmented, insecure, and cumbersome processes plaguing current online interactions.</p>
 The Core Issue: Authentication Integrity 
<p>However, the rush towards adopting identity wallets overlooks a fundamental flaw in our current cybersecurity infrastructure—the integrity of identity authentication itself and the endless number of protocols. The foundation of any IAM system is its ability to accurately and securely authenticate the identity of users. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly an identity wallet may be, its effectiveness is inherently limited by the reliability of the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>Outside these working groups, &nbsp;reality we face is stark. Phishing attacks, identity theft, and account takeovers are rampant, exploiting weaknesses in password-based systems, biometrics, and even two-factor authentication methods. The security community has long acknowledged these vulnerabilities, yet a truly ironclad solution remains elusive.</p>
 Distraction from the Real Challenge 
<p>The fervor surrounding identity wallets risks diverting attention and resources from addressing the root problem—developing authentication mechanisms that are both impervious to existing threats and adaptable to future challenges. While identity wallets can streamline identity management once a user is authenticated, they do little to enhance the security of the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>This is not to dismiss the potential benefits of identity wallets outright. They represent a significant step forward in managing digital identities. The path forward requires a collective reevaluation of our priorities. The cybersecurity and identity communities must channel iefforts into research and development of authentication technologies that can withstand the sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow. Innovations such as cryptographic proofs, advanced biometrics, and behavioral analytics hold promise, but require significant investment to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, fostering an ecosystem that supports interoperability and open standards will be crucial. This approach will not only enhance the security and usability of authentication methods but also ensure that emerging solutions like identity wallets can integrate seamlessly into the broader IAM framework.</p>
<p>What do you think? Digital wallets and all aspects of IAM will be high on the agenda at KuppingerCole’s European Identity &amp; Cloud EIC2024 conference. There will be opportunities to learn about Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World, to get insights into How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization, to get answers the question: Can you trust AI in IAM? And much more!</p>

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing it? (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-1-d950ae770ef2">Linked&nbsp;here</a>)  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE.  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 2 — the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE  Using narratives, diagrams and images to open a generative dialogue <p>In our first publication we introduced two questions that we are using to navigate towards a foundational logic for Life-Ennobling Economics. In this next post we are using those overall queries to share some initial thoughts, together with the cascading questions that are continuing to arise. A strong reflection at this point is that it’s difficult to express many of the core sentiments of LEE using only words. The articulation of certain ideas feels premature and constrictive and this is something that we want to hold up to the light. On the one hand, it feels important to drive clarity and not to hide behind vague, even poetic phrasing. Yet on the other hand, a sense of humility, awe and deep curiosity makes us reluctant to distil and label these early ideas. How can we adequately express diverse interpretations, yearnings and fears for this future that we are daring to open ourselves towards? How might you as the reader? How might your children, parents or more-than-human relations?</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>In the sections that follow we are outlining three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>3 WORLDVIEW PHILOSOPHIES</p> Philosophy 1 <p>Rooted in the recognition of the full web of life: From violence, scarcity and separation to a thriving planetary community of interbecoming.</p><p>What would it mean to fundamentally reimagine ourselves as permeable, dynamic interbecomings, deeply entwined in diverse right relationships and joyfully part of a full planetary consciousness. This concept challenges the traditional economic view of humans driven primarily by rational, objectified, self-interest. Instead, it suggests a new understanding of self where our individual interests are indistinct from what we can collectively become.</p><p>This shift in perspective would call for a re-evaluation of the infrastructures that shape our lives and identities. It would question how we think about everything; from education and learning, health care and human development to the roles and functions of prisons and the judicial system. For example, what does justice mean in a world where we see ourselves as interconnected becomings?</p><blockquote>What do we mean by when we use the term Interbecoming?</blockquote><blockquote>Interbecoming is an extension of the word Interbe which was invented by the Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh. The becoming element signifies the emergent potential of what it means to verb as a community into the future. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esyQnwz_yJ0">short video</a> he describes how you cannot be by yourself alone, to be you need to be with everything and everyone else and therefore to be means to inter-be.</blockquote> Philosophy 2 <p>Grounded in a non-bounded understanding of value: From extractive profit-driven goals to entangled, intergenerational and distributed value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>In our current economy our measures of success are calculated using a narrow set of accounting rules. This is a collectively accepted norm, but can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or context? In an interconnected world, externalities seem to be a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of profit and GDP. Imagine an economy where value was understood to be attributed to relationships themselves rather than the things that are related? How would our economy behave if the collective goal and source of status was increasing regenerative potential or stocks of&nbsp;care?</p><blockquote>The illogical tyranny of&nbsp;metrics</blockquote><blockquote>“People becoming unhealthy can actually have a positive effect overall on GDP, as revenue from associated healthcare boosts growth. Similarly, the extraction of oil and gas pushes GDP up, while pushing us closer to the precipice of climate breakdown.” — Caroline Lucas, MP (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-07-10/debates/FFE2C4E7-4ED0-4537-BA1F-0DE8B46CA084/EconomicGrowthAndEnvironmentalLimits">UK Parliamentary Debate,&nbsp;2019</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Hazel Henderson’s layer cake was the <a href="https://twitter.com/KateRaworth/status/1528866241683017728">original inspiration</a> behind Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics framework. It is a metaphor for how the current monetised economy (the top layers of cake) are entirely dependent on the non-valued, supportive lower&nbsp;layers.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Annie Spratt</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Philosophy 3 <p>Enabled by technological ecosystems of care: From the utilitarian ‘othering’ of technology to animistic interfaces of wisdom and&nbsp;care.</p><p>The accelerating technological complexity of our world can be seen as a threat. However, it could also offer new opportunities to nurture the capacity of society to understand itself more fully, rather than trying to mould and regulate it. Imagine a future where our governing institutions are empowered to advance and scaffold the continuous learning of a self-aware system. Where we can sense the unique, embodied value of every context, thus fostering care for the entangled impacts, both positive and negative. Ultimately we have a choice; will we use the stunning power of advanced technologies to embrace a new freedom to care, or will we use it to destroy everything we depend on and hold&nbsp;dear?</p><blockquote>Busy fools?</blockquote><blockquote>‘We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom’- E.O.&nbsp;Wilson</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">The Cornerstone Indicators </a>work is an example of participatory dialogues being combined with smart data, to create intuitively understandable multi-contextual indicators of care. In another <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">live initiative</a>, we are exploring ways of linking distributed currencies to participatory governance structures, as a pathway towards stewarding bioregional health.</blockquote>Cornerstone Indicator: the number of people with a dream, plan or goal more than one year into the future. Image: Vlad Afanasiev<p>6 STRUCTURAL SHIFTS</p> Shift 1 <p>Beyond Property: From exerting control over ‘objects’ to seeking reciprocal relationships with the full web of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Words like property and ownership are often associated with ideas of dominion and control, allowing us to treat elements of the living world (such as land and rare earth minerals) as objects. Deep down though, do we really believe that timber holds more value than a forest? Or that a whale’s life is interchangeable with a barrel of oil? What would it mean to explore a world beyond property, a world of self sovereign agents who we are respectfully in treaty&nbsp;with?</p><blockquote>The paradox of individual identity</blockquote><blockquote>The idea of self-sovereign agents is being used to express a conviction that life is not a sum of its constituent parts. Instead, both the whole and the parts co-arise with equal agency. The word identity is derived from the Latin idem, the same and identidem, again and again. We identify ourselves by our internal consistency, but this concept only exists in contrast to external self identifying elements (and vice versa). This idea has been expressed by diverse thinkers from <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-experience-of-meaning/jan-zwicky/9780773557437">Zan Zwicky</a> to <a href="https://www.systematics.org/journal/vol9-2/TheWhole_Bortoft.pdf">Henri Borthoft </a>and is carefully explored by Daniel Wahl in Designing Regenerative Cultures¹ and Iain McGilchrist in The Matter with&nbsp;Things².</blockquote><blockquote>‘To shut ourselves off from these other voices…is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our minds of their coherence. We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human’ — David&nbsp;Abram</blockquote> Shift 2 <p>Beyond Labour: From humans employed as resources to vocations of creativity, purpose and&nbsp;care.</p><p>In our industrialised economies humans are often framed as a functional resource. However, rapidly advancing technologies (such as machine automation and alternative distributed currencies) have the potential to weaken the requirement for labour to service financial capital. What would it mean to emancipate the idea of work from its current focus on hierarchy and external incentives? Could we build a future economy that harnesses our inherent, embodied intelligences and unleashes our intrinsic motivations and ability to discover? Perhaps this would be a future of virtuous flow where human satisfaction is rooted in low impact, transcendent goals.</p><blockquote>Can a state of flow be virtuous?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://timjackson.org.uk/finding-flow-lancet/">Professor Tim Jackson</a> has proposed the concept of flow as a pathway towards sustainable fulfilment.</blockquote> Shift 3 <p>Beyond Extraction: From extractive resource claims to the infinite guardianship of the global&nbsp;commons.</p><p>Even the word resource is innately extractive and predicated on violence. When we see a sentient animal or element of an ecosystem and name it as a natural resource, we are using language to justify collective violence in pursuit of private comfort. We have become highly proficient at accessing diverse fodder for the global economic supertanker; from the deep sea beds to the depths of the Amazon rainforest nowhere is considered too difficult to access if the price is right. What would happen if we erased ‘resource’ from our active vocabulary, and redirected our ingenuity toward stewarding the global&nbsp;commons?</p><blockquote>Do words&nbsp;matter?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714174/46011659/INAYAN_LANDSCAPE+%281%29.gif/36b31524-6d41-6ed3-8cda-bf444bde3fe0?t=1659621341143">Inayan — “Unethical deeds”</a>: Inayan is a word that doesn’t exist in the English language. For the Kankanaey people in the Philippines it expresses a community value of refraining from harmful behaviour towards living and inanimate relations. For example, it is inayan to pollute the&nbsp;rivers.</blockquote> Shift 4 <p>Beyond Private Contracts: From linear agreements that optimise for the few to multi-party, dynamic, digital treaties of&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Many of our existing contracts are structured as bilateral agreements. By design, these agreements ignore the complex interplay of values and the mutual need for care that is integral to most transactions. With the emergence of capabilities such as many-to-many and smart, self-executing contracting, we see an opportunity to revolutionise this root structure of the economy. For example, how would our interactions change if we could easily assemble contracts that recognise relational value? Could we collectively drive a bureaucratic revolution that would create new ways to acknowledge and manage the intricate, entangled flows of&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>Are these new contracts too technical or theoretical to engage&nbsp;with?</blockquote><blockquote>From a conceptual provocation (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons provocation</a>) to a live multi-partner collaboration (<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.notion.site/Beyond-the-Rules-19e692bf98f54b44971ca34700e246fd">Beyond The Rules Portal</a>), we are working out loud to test the theory and practical applications of these new forms of contracting.</blockquote>Credit: Terri&nbsp;Po Shift 5 <p>Beyond Governance: From centralised enforcement to nurturing institutions of stewardship.</p><p>Historically our dominant governance structures have sought to control and instruct. However, with the increasing complexity of both our societal systems and escalating risk pathways, this theory of governance no longer appears viable. From their top-down view, many governments are struggling to intelligently regulate the increasingly complex systems of property that they guarantee.</p><p>The most probable directions of future societal travel do not seem appealing. On the one hand we might fail to resolve our global coordination challenges and continue to experience ever intensifying crises (for example, individual countries reopening coal mines to reduce energy costs in the short-term ). Alternatively, we might find ways to overcome perverse incentives but the means to do so will potentially lead us towards authoritarian dystopias. With this in mind, how can we transition away from a centralised model of control, and embrace a governance style that fosters collective learning and empowers the entire&nbsp;system³.</p><blockquote>Is there an adjacent, third&nbsp;option?</blockquote><blockquote>Consilience: the idea that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can “converge” on strong conclusions.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-neighbourhoods-digital-democracy">In Taiwan</a>, the combination of open data and civic participation has created a transparent governance model that drastically reduced the impact of the Covid-19&nbsp;virus.</blockquote> Shift 6 <p>Beyond Monetary Capital: From the accumulation of financial wealth to a social contract that regeneratively stewards the diverse capitals of&nbsp;life.</p><p>What would it mean if we understood capital wealth as an expression of crystallised suffering? Recognising that financial capital is intertwined and enabled by living and social systems could be an important pivot point towards a future rooted in mutually assured thriving. Perhaps then we would feel empowered to reject a monetary system that continues to colonise, exploit and exclude by design. Imagine how our relationship to financial capital might change if we understood the act of investing to be a commitment to our collective futures? What would a system look like where the ways of creating and stewarding money are decentralised and respectful of incommensurate value&nbsp;flows?</p><blockquote>Is the plurality of existing alternative currencies a blessing or a distraction?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3IuJx8O9o">Bernard Lietaer</a> who co-designed the Euro has proposed three core design principles that fundamentally shape the interaction between money and society: a) who issues a currency, b) the qualities it is given, and c) what it can be used&nbsp;for.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">this provocation</a> we explore 10 design principles that could underpin a cohesive yet diverse regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.</blockquote> What’s next and how can people become involved? <p>We have created these first two sections as a landing point for the LEE movement. The idea will be to leave this initial piece in its original form and update the links to new materials as they emerge. What happens next depends on who engages and in what capacity. When we initially proposed the idea, we had imagined that LEE might manifest as a collaborative book and we are still open to that possibility. However, we feel strongly that whilst a tangible artefact would be a powerful tool, it should not be the end goal. Instead, we are aspiring to create a container that can scaffold a distributed exploration and implementation of LEE principles.</p><p>Publications in the&nbsp;pipeline</p><p>We are working on the following pieces and will publish them&nbsp;soon:</p>  Exploratory conversations with critical friends who have read the early versions of the LEE&nbsp;concept.  An outline of how Dark Matter Labs is organising itself to work on the questions raised by the&nbsp;LEE.  Internal conversations: what would it mean for the different strands of our work if we embraced Life-Ennobling Economics as our overarching mission?  <p>Potential pathways for engagement</p><p>We are interested to hear diverse perspectives and will adjust our approach depending on the feedback we receive. As an initial prompt perhaps one of these descriptions is relevant to&nbsp;you:</p><blockquote>Funding support: we are hoping to convene a partnership of funders who can support, elevate and actively contribute to this vision. The scope of ambition is wide but we will curate the process as a series of modular steps. If you are interested in supporting us, either as a general contribution or as a standalone module, then we would be very happy to discuss your ideas. Email: jayne@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Collaborative support: We expect to organise a series of diverse gatherings and working groups. As a first step we will create a live database of potential collaborators and propose a series of online and in-person events following initial conversations. If this is something you would like to hear more about, we would be grateful if you could send us a short email to let us know your area of interest. Email: emily@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Staying updated: our hope is that the ongoing LEE work will provide a convening point for a wider body of thinking on alternative economies. Please feel free to send us your email contact and we will keep you updated on progress and new publications.

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it?  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the LEE (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-2-da43434545c8">linked&nbsp;here</a>).  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 1 — Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it? <blockquote>The term life-ennobling is in itself an adjacent extension of <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2023/02/07/ruthie-wilson-gilmore-abolition-geography%EF%BF%BC">Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s work</a> on life-affirming institutions.</blockquote><p>Our economic systems are failing to serve the interests of our living planet and the great majority of those who inhabit it. It is not our intention to restate the multiple crises that this mismatch has fuelled and continues to perpetuate. Instead, we are sharing our emerging thinking as we strive to build pathways towards alternative ways of organising society. Reading this opening paragraph you may already be holding many questions. For&nbsp;example:</p>  ‘Surely we don’t need yet another type of economics?’.  ‘We already have Doughnut Economics, Wellbeing Economics, Solidarity Economics, Ecological Economics — the list goes on — wouldn’t it make more sense to focus on implementing their principles rather than proposing a new version?’  ‘What gives Dark Matter Labs the authority to suggest a new form of economics? This seems like an audacious and perhaps even arrogant proposal to&nbsp;make.’  <p>We are holding many of these questions ourselves and fully acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of giants. LEE draws on the work of intersectional scholars, feminist and ecological economists and fuses their insights with indigenous wisdom, the life-affirming passion of the abolitionists and the dynamism of radical technologists.</p><p>As we move deeper into the work we are planning to weave the questions and wisdom of our ecosystem into the things that we are learning. We will embrace the friction that comes with an organic conversation and share this unfolding journey using different mediums. If you have comments on the content, or ideas to shape the format of the conversation, then we would welcome feedback.</p>Credit: Martin&nbsp;Lorenz The concept <p>We are proposing Life-Ennobling Economics as a unifying vision and as a call to action. It is an ennobling invitation to break free from ideological constraints, to embrace the radical potential of new technologies, and to challenge the structural codes of our current socio-economic systems. Implicit in this opening position is an understanding that the structure and values of the economy must be in service to all forms of life (present, future, human, non-human and machine) providing a scaffold of care and&nbsp;respect.</p><p>One way of understanding LEE is as a series of linked questions:</p>  What would a desirable future economy actually look&nbsp;like?  What would need to shift for that to become a&nbsp;reality?  What does that mean in the context of our current socioeconomic and political reality?  What can we build or seed to test those assumptions?  <p>We have started to explore these questions as part of our own organisational strategy. We have visualised our response as a 3D matrix and we will publish more about this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>To open the dialogue with a wider audience we are testing three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a reality. The aspiration is to begin building and testing elements of these proposed shifts on the ground, in diverse contexts and communities.</p> What are the core elements of the hypothesis? <p>We are presenting the opening hypothesis as three short sections: (1) an overall framing (2) a philosophical framework (3) an action orientated scaffold. In some places we have included links to more in-depth content and we will expand on the concept in our upcoming publications, including a series of conversations with critical&nbsp;friends.</p><blockquote>1. Overall&nbsp;framing</blockquote><blockquote>The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house</blockquote><blockquote>— Audre&nbsp;Lorde</blockquote><p>The central augment being put forward by the LEE is that whilst we indisputably need to shift to a new economy, we will not get there using the mental models, tools or value systems of the current one. If we allow ourselves to sit with this statement for a moment, how do we feel? Possibly a sense of deflation, frustration or hopelessness. This is not our intention. Rather, we are proposing that we allow ourselves to lean into the idea of a beyond paradigm movement of unusual allies. Donella Meadows retrospectively adjusted her <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">thesis ↗</a> to include an additional level that she named the power to transcend paradigms. Building on this insight, LEE is inviting us to explore what could happen if we allow ourselves to sense into the edges of everything that we are capable of becoming. From nature rights activists and abolitionists to the advocates of self sovereign technologies and universal basic income, many diverse voices are advocating for a common shift. What might be unlocked if we could collaborate across a broad spectrum of unusual&nbsp;allies?</p><blockquote>2. A philosophical framework</blockquote><p>Iain McGilchrist has commented that in modern society we are living under a philosophical error that is far from abstract and instead runs deep to the way that we experience the world¹. Collaboratively building a coherent philosophical base for a more generative future feels critical, because it is this foundational logic that shapes the more tangible layers of our societies. For example, if we start from a value system that promotes individualism and competition then we are likely to design narrow indicators of progress such as GDP, that further entrench these values. In contrast, in a system centred on regenerative vitality we would probably lean towards more embodied measures of success, thus reinforcing the interconnected basis of societal wellbeing².</p><p>To begin exploring and crafting a shared philosophical baseline we are using the following questions to frame our opening thoughts:</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation, what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>We are deliberately using a beyond x,y,z rather than a steps towards framing to explore the proposed structural shifts. We hope that this will encourage a less prescriptive and declarative mindset as we consider what we might collectively work towards. For&nbsp;example:</p>  What could be unlocked if we looked beyond our current understanding of terms such as natural resources, money, institutions and governance?  How can we ensure that voices from the ideological left or right, those who are privileged or oppressed, indigenous or geographically separated can are respectfully represented within the LEE framework?  What might we imagine (or perhaps glimpse existing fragments of) if we let go of a solution oriented&nbsp;mindset?  Are there already existing pockets of these alternative worldviews spread across diverse communities?  <blockquote>3. An action oriented&nbsp;scaffold</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve been told repeatedly that the current political economy can provide the answers, ignoring systematic faults and invested interests in the way of change. Isn’t the real question here then, how we go about redesigning this political economy in a way that includes other voices, values, and&nbsp;ideas.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Gail Bradbrook</blockquote><p>Establishing a strong theoretical baseline is a priority for this initiative, but it also feels important to begin testing and elevating alternative pathways. There is already a stunning global constellation of organisations, movements and thinkers who are actively embodying regenerative crafts and values (for example we recently mapped actors <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=sharing">working on a just transition for housing</a> in Europe). We hope that by broadening the conversation, welcoming unforeseen allies and recognising diverse interests, the LEE can contribute to strengthening this distributed network.</p><p>An initial suggestion for this scaffold is to think of it as two connected threads:</p>  Case studies: we cannot be sure of how the future will play out. However, we can draw on historical events and foresight methods to explore the more likely scenarios. What might we discover if we collate an evidence base of existing signals of change from around the world (for example UBI trials and distributed currencies)? Or perhaps we can gain new insights from building out exploratory case studies, over varied time horizons, for specific sectors such as finance and food systems. How could our understanding shift if we embrace practices such as vision-questing, somatic and dream work? Perhaps you have practices or ideas that you think might be powerful for this collective visioning? We would be grateful for any suggestions and references.  Systemic capabilities: building on the case studies, we hope to identify a speculative portfolio of systemic capabilities that can be developed, tested and iterated in parallel to the existing system. Potential pathways might include designing large scale participatory dialogues, launching transitional financial instruments or developing the policies and tools for distributed decision making structures.   Living the questions <p>In Part 2 of this post we have illustrated our current understanding of some of the questions raised above. We are also working on a series of conversations where we will present some initial reactions to this proposal and explore the points of resonance and friction.</p><p>This blog was designed and written by Martin Lorenz, Emily Harris and Indy Johar as part of Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB.</p><p>The list can never be complete but to the following, thank you for your wisdom, foresight and work — your voices have given shape and clarity to the LEE concept: Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Ilya Prigogine, Stuart Kauffman, Hermon Daly, James Lovelock, Donella Meadows, Kate Raworth, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Fritjof Capra, Daniel Wahl, Katherina Pistor, Aime Cesaire, Iain McGilchrist, Tim Jackson, Nora Bateson, Elinor Ostrom, Sheila Watt-Cloutier, E. F. Schumacher, Farzana Khan, Thich Nhat Hanh, Mariana Mazzucato and David&nbsp;Abram.</p><p>References:</p>  Iain McGilchrist is a psychiatrist and polymath most famous for his work on how the different hemispheres of the brain impact individual behaviour and thus society as a whole. His view is that this psychological error is based on a belief that the world is made up of a series of parts, rather than understanding that everything happens out of the coming together of complex wholes.

<p>Since its rollout in 2019, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G wireless networks</a> have been growing in both availability and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/5g-use-cases/">use cases</a>. Apple was one of the first manufacturers to test the appetite for 5G in 2020 by offering its newest iPhone with 5G compatibility. From there, the floodgates opened, and today as much as <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/5g-device-outlook">62% of smartphones are built with 5G connectivity</a> (link resides outside ibm.com.) The number of networks also continues to grow, with many popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Verizon, Google and AT&amp;T, offering 5G connectivity in both homes and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what does the future hold in store? 5G has been hailed as a disruptive technology, comparable to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI</a>), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> in terms of the kinds of change it will bring about. How much of that is true and how much is just hype? To answer that question, we first must look at how 5G works and what makes it different than other technologies.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p>5G (fifth-generation mobile technology)&nbsp;is a new standard for cellular networks developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3FPP) in 2018 to replace the previous standards of 3G, 4G and 4G LTE. Its goal was to define a new set of standards for devices and applications compatible with 5G networks. Like its predecessors, 5G uses radio waves to transmit data. However, because of improvements in latency, throughput and bandwidth, 5G networks can reach much faster download and upload speeds, giving it a much wider range of applications. &nbsp;</p>



 How is 5G different from previous generations of wireless networks? 



<p>Because of technological improvements, 5G has been praised for its transformative potential across a number of industries. This is largely due to its ability to move large volumes of data swiftly and securely between connected devices at speeds never achieved before. Since the invention of mobile broadband and its gradual expansion into every corner of work and home life, the amount of data generated by the networks and mobile devices running on it has increased exponentially. Today, some technologies (e.g., AI and ML) require too much data to run at speeds offered by previous generations of wireless networks. 5G, on the other hand, with its lightning-fast speeds and high-band frequencies (24GHz–40GHz), is well suited for applications that demand swift, safe access to large amounts of data.</p>



<p>Here are some of the most important differences between 5G and its predecessors:</p>



 
 Smaller physical footprint:&nbsp;5G transmitters are smaller than those on predecessors’ networks, and its “cells”—the geographical areas wireless technology depend on for connectivity—are smaller and require less power. 



 Improved error rates:&nbsp;5G’s adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), a schematic for transmitting data, is more powerful than the schemes used in 3G and 4G networks. This makes its Block Error Rate (BER)—the frequency of errors on its networks—much lower. 



 Better bandwidth:&nbsp;By using more radio frequencies than previous wireless communications networks, including low-band (less than 1 GHz), mid-band (1 GHz–6 GHz) and high-band (24 GHz–40 GHz), 5G can support more devices at the same time. 



 Lower latency:&nbsp;5G’s low&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>—a measurement of the time it takes data to travel from one location to another—is better than on previous networks, making routine activities like downloading a file or working in the cloud much faster.&nbsp; 
 



 How does 5G work? 



<p>Like all other wireless networks, 5G relies on “cells” to function. Within each cell, a wireless device, such as a phone, laptop or tablet, is connected to the internet using radio waves that bounce between a 5G antennae and base station. The same technology that has powered every previous generation of wireless networks also powers 5G, but with some improvements. Notably, 5G networks transmit data as fast as 10 or even 20 gigabits per second (Gbps)—more than 100 times faster than 4G.</p>



<p>As the number of devices built for 5G technology increases, so does demand for the networks themselves. In North America, all the popular telecommunications companies offer 5G now, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">covering more than 200 million homes and businesses</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), with that number projected to double in the next four years.</p>



<p>Here are three critical areas where 5G technology is superior to its predecessors.</p>



 New RAT standard 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks defines the next generation of radio access technology (RAT) specification for all 5G mobile networks. Today, 45% of networks worldwide are 5G compatible, with that number forecasted to rise to 85% by the end of the decade according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/network-coverage#:~:text=The%20build%2Dout%20of%205G,around%2085%20percent%20in%202029.">a recent report by&nbsp;Ericsson</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



 Network slicing capabilities 



<p>On 5G networks, telecom operators can offer multiple independent virtual networks (in addition to public ones) on the same 5G infrastructure, allowing users to do more things remotely with greater security than ever before.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>In addition to network slicing, 5G allows users to create private networks with enhanced personalization and security. Enterprises seeking more control and mobility for employees are increasingly turning to private 5G network architectures rather than public networks.</p>



 5G future: Innovations in the coming years 



<p>Interest in 5G networks and the devices and applications that run on them is understandably high among both consumers and business leaders. According to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US50828023">this recent IDC white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), in the US alone, almost 120 million 5G devices were expected to ship by the end of 2023—a 9.3 % increase over the previous year. By 2027, the final year covered in the report, 155 million units are expected to ship, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4%.</p>



<p>Although the same numbers aren’t available worldwide, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1418441/5g-smartphone-penetration-rate-worldwide/">a Statista report</a> (link resides outside of ibm.com) pegs global penetration of 5G compatible smartphones at 59% in 2023, with that number expected to reach more than 82% by 2027.</p>



<p>But going beyond the numbers, what does this surge in interest really mean? Sometimes, with new technologies, it can be hard to separate what’s real from all the excitement. Here’s a closer look at some of the areas 5G is expected to impact and the likely changes it will bring.</p>



 Healthcare 



<p>In the healthcare industry, 5G is already enabling greater efficiencies, deeper insights from data, and improvements in patient outcomes. Its low latency, high speed and increased bandwidth will help doctors discover new treatments, perform critical procedures remotely using robotics, and access patient information in the field no matter where they are.</p>



<p>More specifically, 5G will continue to do the following:</p>



 
 Add to the number of IoT devices used to remotely monitor patient health. 



 Supply dependable connectivity with real-time results, enabling staff to make faster, more informed decisions about patient care. 



 Transmit HD photos and videos—such as X-rays and mammograms—swiftly and securely so their results can be read remotely. 
 



 Supply chains 



<p>As 5G connectivity spreads, supply chains everywhere will benefit from its lightning-fast speeds and increased reliability. Since the networks that global trade depends on are increasingly digitized, they’re more reliant than ever on high-speed data transmission capabilities and 5G speeds to function. The more digitization and automation in a supply chain, the more 5G can be leveraged to increase efficiencies, reduce costs and increase security. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, 5G service is already being used in airports, ports, train stations and other logistics hubs critical to supply chain infrastructure, but its potential has barely been tapped. Soon, expect 5G connectivity to play a bigger role in enhancing both the employee and customer experience. Programs already being piloted include IoT devices, such as shelf sensors that know when an item is out of stock and re-order it immediately, cashier-less checkouts, and HD cameras and drones to replace security guards.</p>



 Fixed wireless networks 



<p>The concept of ‘fixed’ wireless connections—an internet connection that delivers a seamless wireless experience in a home or business via radio waves rather than through cable or fiber—can help deliver the internet cheaply to more people and places. In a fixed 5G ecosystem, an antenna is attached to a house or place of business that connects to the nearest 5G transmitter. 5G fixed wireless networks can deliver the same speeds, connectivity and reliability as fiber or cable connections at a fraction of the cost. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/expanding-mobile-broadband-coverage-lifting-millions-out-poverty">a recent World Bank blog</a> (link resides outside of IBM), providing internet connectivity—and specifically wireless access—helps lift millions out of poverty every year. A 5G technology that can deliver the same benefits at a much lower cost to millions of people could be a game-changer, bringing the benefits of internet connectivity to communities that have been living without it for years.</p>



 Smart cities 



<p>Perhaps no other environment is poised to change as much due to 5G connectivity as crowded urban centers where foot and car traffic have long led to congestion, air and noise pollution. 5G is already helping cities improve traffic flow and air quality with sensors connected via the IoT, but the future will likely bring much more innovation to this space.</p>



<p>One of the biggest areas where smart cities can leverage 5G more is in its AI capabilities. Currently, programs are being tested that would see 5G-enabled AI assist in everything from smarter energy management to the routing of 911 calls. In Vienna, <a href="https://www.wien.gv.at/english/bot/index.html">WienBot, an AI chatbot</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), helps users solve problems as simple as finding the nearest drinking fountain or a place to eat dinner to as complex tasks as renewing their passport and obtaining travel visas.</p>



 Edge computing and AI 



<p>Finally, edge computing—a computing framework that relies heavily on 5G to perform computations closer to data sources—is poised to help enterprises achieve unprecedented control over their data and extract insights even faster than they already are. One area where edge computing is particularly well-positioned for growth is cloud computing, where AI requires large amounts of power to handle the data it’s tasked with analyzing. Here, 5G connectivity and reliability is key to realizing value for the enterprise. For example, sending data from one point to another in a chat or personal finance application requires additional power and resources that aren’t necessary if the data is being analyzed at its source.</p>



<p>Soon, it’s possible that edge computing will make real-time AI analysis of large volumes of data a reality for everything from fitness and health apps to remotely operated vehicles like satellites and drones. Given its potential, utilizing 5G-enabled edge computing is quickly becoming the standard for enterprise data processing. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">this Gartner white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge (compared to only 10% today).</p>



 5G solutions with IBM Cloud Satellite 



<p>Before you can take advantage of all the potential possibilities the future of 5G holds, you need a platform that’s built for it. IBM Cloud Satellite lets you deploy and run apps consistently across on-premises, edge computing and public cloud environments on a 5G network. And it’s all enabled by secure and auditable communications within the IBM Cloud.</p>

We do this with a combination of legaltech solutions that connect the <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/">1958 New York Convention (NYC) on Arbitration</a> and the UK Judiciary Taskforce (UKJT) <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> using the blockchain, which is going to enable a once in a century transformation, like when music went&nbsp;digital.</p><p>Now, I want to unpick exactly what this means for the future of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>I see the global scope of the blockchain as fundamental to all this, which is not quite the same thing as globalisation, but close. Anybody can run Free Software, anybody can generate keys, so the blockchain is universal in that sense. The best fit for that global scope in legal / trade systems is the New York Convention on Arbitration. That’s 170 countries. So wiring up blockchain transactions to the NY Convention is close to global scope (it skips North Korea - but then everything does - and a few other places). This is supercharged by the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce Digital Dispute Resolution Rules which make a ton of blockchain-specific provisions which can be invoked from any of the New York Convention counties. <a href="https://arbitrationblog.kluwerarbitration.com/2022/04/27/arbitration-tech-toolbox-arbitrating-digital-asset-disputes/">This gives some analysis of the&nbsp;rules</a></p><p>Some of the “Mattereum magic” has been in figuring out how to use the NYC / UKJT system to carry things like legal definitions of assets on chain in a way that can be seen in those 170 counties. The <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> does some very sophisticated things by using suites of contracts to define asset value and risks. This makes the blockchain vital - if you try to make something like the NFT/MAP system work, only on paper, the complexity goes through the roof because you don’t have atomic swaps and various other blockchain capabilities on hand. It’s a neat system: the solution to trade on the blockchain requires the blockchain to&nbsp;work!</p><p>I am personally pretty pro globalisation because trade is always a good alternative to war, and rival trade blocs often wind up at war, but I do think 1990s American-led globalism is dead. What’s&nbsp;next?</p><p>There is a very clear difficult path forwards: we could very easily wind up with a world which runs on three incompatible global trade technology platforms: the American VISA-SWIFT etc. regime, the EU Digital Product Passports etc. regime, and the Chinese Belt and Road etc. regime. In this instance trade between these blocs will slow down over time as the technical and legal friction of trading across borders is reduced within the systems, but trade between these systems is more costly and difficult. I lay out this case in some detail <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">here</a> (which contrasts the blockchain with high frequency trading systems). You can even find threads of this model in my 2015 “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>” piece written for the Ethereum launch day. The problems database systems have interconnecting using APIs are even more severe when we start looking at things like automated customs clearing&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Is there a more peaceful, positive path we could take? Maybe this: internet-led globalism: Wikipedia style global shared resources, and Alibaba-style free trade. “One ERC721 NFT per item” assets work pretty much anywhere. “Many ERC20 fractional ownership tokens per asset” is likely to work best in the EU under <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MICA</a>, at least at first. So the goal state is “world trade moves to the internet” — a “back of the envelope” calculation would be <a href="https://lawcom.gov.uk/project/electronic-trade-documents/">$250bn of savings a year</a>, estimated – and “real estate moves to the blockchain” — $150bn a year of savings, estimated.</p><p>This is a different “theory of value” of the blockchain to the bitcoiner’s “governments can’t stop printing money so eventually all fiat goes to zero and only Bitcoin remains” model. In practice governments don’t die easy. They’ve got moves: they’ll use them. So the hardcore “internet maximalist” view is centred around trade not money-like tokens, we don’t care what tokens are used to pay for real estate: ether, dollar coins, wBTC, digitised gold bars, CBDCs, SDRs, Doge, what we care about is the transactions happen basically paperlessly, AND we get a cut of the transactions for securing them. That’s our business model: get as much of $trillions of transactions on chain as possible, and take our cut from every one. Currently it’s all still 30-day invoicing and bank transfers once you start routinely dealing with assets over about $10k, never mind the arcane mess that is real estate transactions. Some of the regulations governing that are still written on goat skin, and you breathe a sigh of relief if a transaction only takes three months, because that is currently what passes for fast and&nbsp;smooth.</p><p>We aim to change this, once and for&nbsp;all.</p><p>If this takes off, it’ll do for real estate and&nbsp;trade:</p>  what Big Bang in the 1980s did for trading stocks and shares (electronic exchanges replaced human face to face exchange in trading&nbsp;pits!!!)  what Spotify did for&nbsp;music  what Amazon did for physical goods purchases  what Netflix / YouTube / TikTok did for&nbsp;video  <p>Digitisation of entire industries is routine at this point. Each one needs new technology. Amazon needed HTTPS cryptography and certificate authorities. Spotify and Netflix needed The Cloud, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Our bet is that real estate and global trade need Ethereum to move them&nbsp;online.</p><p>If we are right, your transformation will be much larger than just tokenizing stocks and bonds and revenue streams from rental homes, the current “RWA” leaders. Stocks and bonds etc. are already massively digital and traded on the internet, tokenizing them is an additional improvement but an eToro-type training app isn’t so much worse than real&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The improvement is incremental.</p><p>But enabling internet trading for assets that are currently ENTIRELY manually traded is an absolute game changer. Half a trillion dollars a year of savings by the time cars and a few other things are added to the mix. That’s a lot of potential.</p><p>Just to quantify it a&nbsp;little.</p><p>Half a trillion in savings, cut five ways: buyers, sellers, exchanges, technology providers, traders/market makers/lawyers and other middle men niches that are created - three out of five are maybe new companies. $300bn a year at a 10x multiplier suggests $3 trillion in market cap for the companies living off that revenue stream, kind of about the size of the<a href="https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/industry/internet-retail/"> entire internet retail industry</a> that currently exists. Now you can argue this 50 different ways: 10x multiplier? How long will it take to get to this scale? <a href="https://www.failory.com/startups/shoes-unicorns">Why did Tradelens fail etc</a>, but there are four billion dollar companies just trading sneakers right&nbsp;now.</p><p>What do you think tokenized real estate is going to&nbsp;do?</p><p>And we are playing for the position of “the company everybody uses to lift their assets up to the blockchain”.</p><p>All the global legal stuff and the risk management and dispute resolution and so on — build your own or use the same stuff everybody else uses. A parallel there is the ISDA template contract which carries most of $600 trillion of <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy2211.htm">derivatives</a>. Standardisation pays!

Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>Data Farming Round 80(DF80) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am March 7, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 14. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF81 is live today, March 14. It concludes on March 21. 300K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF81   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF81 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;2.</p><p>Budget. This round has 300,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 75,000 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming docs</a> provide all key info, guides on how to earn, and detailed info about reward schedule, APYs, and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> blog post is a thorough listing of all DF articles in one&nbsp;place.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

DF went through alpha and beta to the final “DF Main” phase. DF Main has sub-phases 1-4:</p>  DF Main 1 had 150,000 OCEAN/week rewards.  ⭐ DF Main 2 has 300,000 OCEAN/week rewards.

At first, DF exclusively rewarded data curation. Now, it also rewards locking OCEAN and making predictions. We can expect further evolution.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes DF reward budgets and expected APYs. Section 3 describes how to data farm, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">the webapp</a>. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Reward Budgets &amp;&nbsp;APYs  2.1 Budgets per&nbsp;Stream <p>The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. Predictoor DF: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> 2.1 APY Estimates <p>As of DF Main 2, how can we expect APY to change? Here’s a quick estimate.</p><p>Today’s rewards increase includes a doubling of Passive DF rewards from 75,000 OCEAN/week to 150,000 OCEAN/week. So APY for Passive DF will jump by 2x (all else being equal). If you’ve locked for 4 years to hit max APY, expect APY to rise from ≈10.1% to&nbsp;≈20.2%.</p><p>APY of Active DF is currently ≈3.13%. It’s capped by data consume volume, so we shouldn’t expect it to increase by&nbsp;2x.</p><p>Overall APY is currently ≈12.75% (for max lock time). Given that Passive DF will increase things by (20.2–10.1) = 10.1%, then overall APY will jump to about 22.75% (all else being&nbsp;equal).</p><p>To max your APY, it makes sense to lock OCEAN for long; to curate with all your locked OCEAN; and to run a predictoor bot with aggressive staking.</p> 4. How to Data&nbsp;Farm  4.1 DF Webapp tasks&nbsp;overview <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: Passive DF, Volume DF, and Predictoor DF. The DF webapp facilitates most of these; the rest are via Predictoor.</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the <a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean">DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim”&nbsp;button.  Volume DF. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards">DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at&nbsp;once).  Predictoor DF. To earn: become a predictoor by running a bot that makes regular predictions. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Here’s how</a>. To claim: predictoors get paid via sales of the prediction feeds to traders. Predictoor DF is treated as extra&nbsp;sales.  <p>The subsections that follow elaborate on key&nbsp;steps.</p> 4.2 Navigating to DF&nbsp;webapp <p>You can get to the DF webapp from the main Ocean Protocol site <a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com,">oceanprotocol.com,</a> and clicking on “STAKE&nbsp;OCEAN”.</p><p>Or, you can go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">df.oceandao.org</a>.</p>Getting to Data Farming page from main Ocean site (<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a>) 4.3 DF Webapp&nbsp;homepage <p>Here’s the DF webapp homepage.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF webapp&nbsp;homepage</a> 4.4 DF Webapp for Passive DF /&nbsp;veOCEAN <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Passive-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">df.oceandao.org/passive-df</a>.</p><p>This page’s main role is to let you lock OCEAN to get veOCEAN. It allows you to explore “what-if” scenarios: you can lock for different durations, with different OCEAN amounts, and different # compounds; and it will tell you the expected OCEAN rewards and APY (including accounting for gas&nbsp;fees).</p><p>This page also lets you track your veOCEAN balance, lock more OCEAN, and lock for&nbsp;longer.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.5 DF Webapp for Volume&nbsp;DF <p>If you’re inside the webapp, click on “Volume-DF” tab. Or go directly to its url at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">df.oceandao.org/volume-df</a>. To participate in Volume DF, you need to allocate your veOCEAN to data assets. The higher the volume the asset, the more you earn: this is curation.</p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF&nbsp;page</a> 4.6 DF Webapp for Claiming&nbsp;Rewards <p>Click the pink “Claim All” buttons on the homepage to claim OCEAN rewards. The image below illustrates.</p><p>Where to claim? All earnings for data farmers are claimable in Ethereum mainnet. This is the case even though data assets for DF may published in any <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">network where Ocean’s deployed in production</a>: Eth mainnet, Polygon, etc. All rewards come through Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>When to claim? There are fresh passive rewards available every Thursday. If you wish, you can wait for many weeks to accumulate before claiming. (It’s all on-chain.) Predictoor rewards can be claimed at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>When to do a first claim? From the time you lock OCEAN, you must wait at least a week, and up to two weeks, to be able to claim rewards. The nerdy version: if you lock OCEAN on day x, you’ll be able to claim rewards on the first weekly ve “epoch” that begins after day x+7. This behavior is inherited from <a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html">veCRV</a>; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/ve/veFeeDistributor.vy#L240-L256">here’s the&nbsp;code.</a></p> 5. Conclusion <p>On March 14, 2024, Data Farming Main, Phase 2 starts. Weekly rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. We can expect APY to jump&nbsp;too.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  There is no minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia.  The definition of VASPs in Estonia now covers a wider array of crypto services, expanding AML compliance requirements.  Licensing fees and capital requirements for crypto businesses have been increased in&nbsp;Estonia.  <p>In 2017, Estonia became the first country to set the European legal framework for virtual currencies. The country then enacted amendments to its anti-money laundering (AML) legislation that define cryptocurrencies as value represented in digital form that is digitally transferable and acceptable as a payment instrument but not a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>In the following year, the European Union (EU) <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">adopted the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>, which introduced AML and know-your-client (KYC) obligations for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. To comply with the EU directive, Estonia made changes to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act, which were implemented in March&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Since then, Estonia has started treating virtual currency service providers as “financial institutions,” subjecting them to the same reporting regulations and requirements as other financial institutions within the&nbsp;country.</p><p>In March 2022, Estonia further tightened its regulations with <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112032022002">amendments to its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act</a>. These amendments enforced the FATF Travel Rule, set more stringent licensing conditions for crypto service providers, and broadened the AML Act’s reach to include new virtual currency services.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Estonia <p>By introducing <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel Rule</a>, Estonia expanded the definition of “virtual currency service” to include virtual currency transfer services and services related to the issuance of virtual currency.</p><p>Based on the changes, intermediaries between buyers and sellers and services that bring buyers and sellers together, decentralized platforms, services that delegate transactions to third parties, ICO platforms, and other similar services all fall under the VASP category. Hence, they must comply with AML and licensing requirements.</p><p>Meanwhile, regulators raised the cost of obtaining a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) license to €10,000. They also set a minimum share capital requirement of €100,000 for licensees and introduced a new administrative fee for changes in crypto-related activities.</p><p>Businesses also had to submit extra documents, such as a two-year business plan, financial details, descriptions of the information technology systems for identifying and monitoring transactions, information about customers and their beneficial owners, and details required for fulfilling the Travel Rule obligation.</p><p>Moreover, regulators updated the management board requirements and introduced additional grounds for refusing or revoking a VASP&nbsp;license.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Having implemented the FATF Travel Rule in March 2022, the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) gave crypto businesses only three months, up until June 15, 2022, to enforce the rules. However, there is no minimum transaction threshold for reporting transactions.</p><p>Under the Estonia Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs must collect data on a transaction’s originator and share it with the service provider of the transaction’s recipient when completing a virtual currency exchange or transfer. For legal persons, the information to be gathered and shared includes:</p><p>- Full Name &amp; Place of&nbsp;business</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Registry code or residence country identifier</p><p>Meanwhile, the information to be collected for natural persons includes:</p><p>- Full&nbsp;Name</p><p>- Unique transaction identifier</p><p>- Crypto wallet identifier or payment account identifier</p><p>- Identity number and personal identification code</p><p>- Date of birth, place of birth, and residential address</p><p>To comply with the Travel Rule and avoid license revocation, VASPs must maintain accurate records. While transactions involving private wallets are not directly covered by the rule, VASPs initiating such transactions are obligated to perform risk assessments.</p><p>Additionally, the revised AML Act imposes stringent penalties for non-compliance. Fines can reach up to €400,000, with additional penalties of up to 300 fine units (€4 per unit) for violations, including failing to meet capital requirements, neglecting VASP duties, and creating anonymous wallets or accounts.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Estonia, the Crypto Travel Rule applies to all VASPs operating within its borders, including foreign VASPs, which must register locally to offer their services. VASPs here means crypto exchanges, crypto transfer providers, and any services related to virtual currency issuance.</p><p>Initially, Estonia offered two different licenses to crypto exchanges depending on their functions: the Exchange Service License and the Wallet Service License. However, it has now changed to just one license: the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange&nbsp;License.</p><p>To apply for the Estonian Cryptocurrency Exchange license, VASPs must meet stringent requirements that cover but are not limited to the following:</p><p>- The virtual currency company should be registered in&nbsp;Estonia.</p><p>- The company’s business plan must include its intended business activities as well as operational procedures and expected spending.</p><p>- A description of the information technological system and other systems to be used to operate the business.</p><p>- The company’s intended security measures to protect customer&nbsp;assets.</p><p>- Information about the company’s assigned audit firm, including their name, personal identity code, or personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>- A share capital of at least EUR 100,000 for exchange services and EUR 250,000 for transfer services.</p><p>In transactions involving unhosted (non-custodial or self-hosted) wallets, Estonian VASPs are not obliged to transmit detailed personally identifiable information (PII). However, they must assess the transaction’s risk, retain essential information about both the transaction’s originator and beneficiary, and provide this data to regulatory or supervisory bodies when requested.</p><p>While PII from the beneficiary is not always mandatory in transactions from self-hosted wallets, the originator must supply PII when transferring to a VASP. Additionally, transactions of high value or those conducted frequently may require the beneficiary’s PII as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Context and Comparison <p>The FATF guidance and various global regulators further stipulate that VASPs must apply the Travel Rule to transactions above the $1,000 threshold. This minimum requirement varies based on jurisdictions. For instance, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">in the US</a>, this limit is higher at $3,000, while some jurisdictions, like Estonia, do not have one at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Moreover, contrary to the guidance of FATF, Estonia doesn’t need VASPs to gather and share any personal information about the Beneficiary customer. Most jurisdictions require the beneficiary’s name to be obtained and transmitted. This may cause issues when an Estonia exchange exchange interacts with a foreign exchange, as they may reject the transaction that has no information about the beneficiary.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>By enforcing the FATF Travel Rule and revising its AML laws, Estonia has set a framework that necessitates a detailed approach to transactions and service provider operations. These regulations aim to ensure transaction transparency and combat financial crimes, posing challenges for both regulators and industry participants to navigate this evolving landscape. In this evolving regulatory landscape, any actions taken must be carefully considered for their impact, with a focus on maintaining both security and a positive user experience.</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Q1: What is the FATF Travel Rule, and how does it apply in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share transaction data between senders and receivers for transparency. In Estonia, this rule applies to all transactions regardless of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: Who is considered a VASP under Estonian regulations?</p><p>In Estonia, the definition of a VASP is broad, including crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and any service related to the transfer, exchange, or issuance of virtual currencies.</p><p>Q3: What are the licensing requirements for crypto businesses in&nbsp;Estonia?</p><p>Crypto businesses must obtain a VASP license, meet criteria such as a minimum capital requirement (which varies by service type), and pay a licensing fee, which has been increased to ensure only compliant entities&nbsp;operate.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Suppose you’re a growing company. Then you’ve got a growing Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problem–because that happens when you grow. You’ve probably been using a combination of spreadsheets, emails, checklists, and half-remembered procedures to handle onboarding, offboarding, and compliance audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then along comes an IAM vendor who pitches their shiny identity provider service: a vision of IAM nirvana with automated provisioning, de-provisioning, and access requests. All you have to do is sign up and push a couple of buttons. (After you pay them, of course.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what the IAM vision looks like:</p>
 
 One Platform, Seamless Control: Manage all your SaaS applications’ identities and access in a single, centralized IAM platform. No more jumping between different tools or spreadsheets. 
 Automated Efficiency: Streamline user access with automated provisioning and de-provisioning across all connected applications. Forget manual tasks and ensure instant access when needed. 
 Cost-Effective Security: Secure your SaaS environment without breaking the bank. Expect transparent pricing for essential IAM features like SCIM/SAML support. 
 
<p>Great vision. But according to the customers we’ve talked to, it’s a mirage.</p>
<p>Here’s what IAM reality looked like once they encountered it:</p>
 
 Fragmented Landscape: Many IAM tools only manage a limited subset of SaaS applications, leaving you with a patchwork of tools and manual processes for the rest. 
 Paywalled Integrations: Access to crucial features like SCIM/SAML often requires upgrading to more expensive tiers with your SaaS providers. 
 Inconsistent Implementation: Even when available, SCIM/SAML implementations can vary significantly between SaaS providers, causing compatibility issues and integration headaches. 
 Manual Mayhem: Unsupported applications force admins to resort to manual workarounds, relying on static documentation and informal communication (emails, Slack, spreadsheets) to manage access, leading to inefficiency and security risks. 
 
<p>So they experience IAMBM – an acronym I just made up for Identity and Access Management Buyer’s Remorse. Automating a chaotic, uncontrolled, disorderly process does not make it harmonious, controlled, or orderly. You replace a messy manual mess with a messy automated mess.</p>
<p>Bill Gates said it right: “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting the Paradigm 
<p>Consider orchestration before automation. YeshID’s orchestration lets you capture and organize your tasks in playbooks. As you organize your activities–in one place, with a single source of truth–you can automate when it’s cost-effective, convenient, and technically feasible. You can integrate manual processes, partly automated processes, and completely automated processes using a single interface. Orchestration lets you delegate tasks, follow up, and distribute work without losing visibility and control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orchestration will make your IAM activities transparent, orderly, distributed, and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>IAM is about people, not just technology. Don’t fall into the automation trap. By empowering your team and focusing on clear, trackable processes, you can achieve secure and efficient access management without the “buyer’s remorse” hangover.</p>

<p>How do we prove who we are in an increasingly digital world?&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of identity has evolved from social constructs to centralized digital profiles defined more by technology companies than individuals themselves. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to put personal ownership back into the equation through emerging solutions centered around distributed ledger technology and cryptography.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conversation that ranged from philosophy to blockchain technology, Lohan Spies discusses how SSI and related innovations might empower youth in developing nations, enable marginalized populations’ participation in regulated economies, and help regenerate land while fighting climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, complexities around public/private key management, unintended consequences of new systems, and the excitement of driving real global change through collaboration come clearly into focus.</p> Defining Digital Identity <p>The concept of identity has shifted greatly in the digital age. As Spies explains, "The traditional way for identity was very much a social construct." People associated names and faces and built interpersonal trust through repeated interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet lacked an innate understanding of identity, however; online systems resorted to centralized user profiles attached to email addresses, unique IDs controlled more by service providers than individuals.</p><p>This approach enabled security risks, data breaches, and unilateral account shutdowns without recourse. Spies contrasts these realities with self-sovereign identity "where you have full control and ownership of your identity, meaning nobody can take it away from you." Control and ownership sit right at the crux of the philosophical and practical divide.</p> Realizing the Potential of Self-Sovereign Systems <p>For digital identity solutions to reach their full potential, Spies believes several essential ingredients need to coalesce. "The first thing that's extremely important is that we do have standards and video specifications," he explains, "because that is the one thing that aligns us or not."</p><p>However, Spies cautions against rigid standardization stifling innovation, noting that "some people might have a different view...but ultimately, I think we're going to get to a point where we will diverge into a common understanding of what's acceptable and what's not acceptable."</p><p>This balanced approach allows for experimentation on the fringes by "people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases" while still working towards interoperable frameworks.</p><p>“The hope is...it aligns us,” Spies notes of identity standards while allowing for “people that are willing to go through those extremely complicated use cases” on the fringes.</p><p>Second, spreading access to cryptography and related capabilities helps empower individuals rather than leaving specialized knowledge in the hands of a small subset of people.&nbsp;</p><p></p><blockquote>“We kind of call it democratizing in a way, the concept of cryptography,” Spies explains regarding this drive to distribute understanding and control, “really giving it to everyone to leverage and utilize to their own benefit.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Finally, governance structures need to evolve in tandem with technological ones. From local contexts to national digital identity initiatives spanning public and private entities, multipronged coordination paves the road to real-world adoption.</p><p>The payoff of this coordination could prove immense in daily life for everyone. Imagine crossing borders digitally rather than waiting in queues. Consider accessing regulated financial systems regardless of formal government identification documents. Or think about connecting payments directly, not just to account numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the realm of payments, self-sovereign identity could enable direct transactions without relying on intermediary institutions. "I think there's just a natural progression to bring identity and payments closer together," Spies explains.</p><p>Rather than sending money to an account number and routing through banks or payment apps, funds could move directly between verified individuals. The secure digital identities of self-sovereign systems would serve in place of centralized platforms that currently mediate transactions.</p> Use Cases, Obstacles, and Promise <p>If coordinated properly, self-sovereign systems could greatly benefit populations in need across the globe. Spies points to the <a href="https://www.generationunlimited.org/yoma?ref=blog.holochain.org">YOMA project from UNICEF</a>, which empowers youth in developing countries, where he is working to help integrate digital identity technology to increase access to education and employment credentials.</p><p>Other models help shift marginalized groups away from all-cash economies into greater digital inclusion. Environmentally, distributed identity solutions offer promise by securely tracking and verifying sustainability data. Spies details one such application in regenerative agriculture:</p><p></p><blockquote>"From the ground, it's verifiable data...we can make sure that a human or IoT device can be identified and how we can make sure that that data feeds up into the chain of various layers. But we know we can trust the data that originated from the ground."</blockquote><p></p><p>This trusted provenance allows for the creation of what Spies calls "nature certificates," which go beyond traditional carbon credits:</p><p>Of course, obstacles remain in these early days. Complexities of public/private key management persist, though various startups work toward solutions. Mainstream understanding and education around the relevance of self-sovereign systems currently fall short as well. As the internet’s unintended impact shows, we must take care to avoid exclusion where promises of inclusion abound.</p><p>However, with expanding real-world deployment comes cause for optimism. Spies expresses excitement “to see this technology really being adopted, really solving real-world problems.”&nbsp;</p><p>New collaborations between digital identity projects are driving tangible progress in addressing real-world challenges. If holistic human needs and ethical considerations guide developers and adopters alike, efforts like YOMA and Holochain could portend more equitable and empowered societies ahead.</p>

<p>For established businesses, the debate is settled: a hybrid cloud approach is the right strategic choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while embracing hybrid cloud might be intrinsic, clients continually seek to derive business value and higher return on investment (ROI) from their investments. According to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52600">study conducted by HFS Research</a> in partnership with IBM Consulting®, only 25% of surveyed enterprises have reported solid ROI on business outcomes from their cloud transformation efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lack of ROI progress can be attributed to several factors, including slow adoption, unrealized use cases and unaddressed cloud sprawl. This is exacerbated by the increasing challenges of platform scaling, skilling, cybersecurity and the explosion of data volumes. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Businesses aiming to derive value from business outcomes through their cloud investments and harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) must adopt an intentional approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IBM, we provide clear guidance for navigating these challenges and achieving better business outcomes. Adopting a hybrid by design strategy allows organizations to align architectural choices with business priorities across technology, platforms, processes and people, resulting in significantly enhanced outcomes and a higher ROI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest paper from IBM, titled “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52663">Maximize the value of hybrid cloud in the generative AI era</a>,” offers clarity for businesses seeking to optimize their hybrid cloud architecture and amplify the impact of generative AI (gen AI).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What does a Hybrid by design approach involve? &nbsp; 



<p>Many organizations have adopted cloud in isolated areas, seeking immediate benefits, but inconsistently applying the technology throughout their operations. This complexity and inconsistency increase costs and hinder businesses from meeting demands, goals and outcomes. We view this as a default approach, which characterizes most companies today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses must recalibrate transformation programs to align more closely with business imperatives and outcomes. They must also recognize how gen AI can amplify the value of hybrid cloud and accelerate digital transformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A hybrid by design approach intentionally structures your hybrid, multicloud IT estate to achieve key business priorities and maximize ROI. Organizations can shift from technology dictating business limitations to purposefully built architectures ready for evolving technology landscapes, new business and customer demands, and emerging processes and skill requirements. Driven by an organization’s key business objectives, intentional and consistent architectural decisions enable organizations to fully use hybrid cloud and gen AI to drive business outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM built a codified framework to help clients strategically focus on decisions that drive the most outcomes for their business, promoting a hybrid by design approach. This framework facilitates the translation of business priorities into key architectural decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We implement this framework by aligning business objectives with a set of decision points across 3 domains: product native by design, technology by design and integration by design. These domains also encompass various design points. Each enterprise situation requires different levels of capabilities to address and achieve its business objectives. This value framework aids in capturing these decision points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 In an AI-centric world, why does this matter for enterprises?&nbsp; 



<p>Gen AI plays a critical role in shaping the digital enterprise, helping to maximize business returns on IT investments. However, wide-scale adoption and deployment of gen AI present challenges. Enterprises must manage vast volumes of data, significant computing power, advanced security architecture across distributed environments and ensure rapid scalability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An intentional and consistent hybrid architecture design helps enterprises to overcome these challenges, facilitating the successful adoption and scalability of gen AI capabilities to meet business needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current pilots and deployments prove that a hybrid by design approach is required to scale the adoption of gen AI to meet business needs. Gen AI accelerates the execution and value of hybrid cloud by providing enhanced automation with observability, improved cost optimization with automated insights, and heightened security with compliance across the hybrid platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Applying intentional architecture decisions based on business needs amplifies the value of hybrid cloud and AI, driving business outcomes.&nbsp;<br><br>Want to learn more? <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52266">Connect with the hybrid cloud and AI team at IBM</a>.</p>

<p>Apache Kafka stands as a widely recognized open source event store and stream processing platform. It has evolved into the de facto standard for data streaming, as over 80% of Fortune 500 companies use it. All major cloud providers provide managed data streaming services to meet this growing demand.</p>



<p>One key advantage of opting for managed Kafka services is the delegation of responsibility for broker and operational metrics, allowing users to focus solely on metrics specific to applications. In this article, Product Manager Uche Nwankwo provides guidance on a set of producer and consumer metrics that customers should monitor for optimal performance.</p>



<p>With Kafka, monitoring typically involves various metrics that are related to topics, partitions, brokers and consumer groups. Standard Kafka metrics include information on throughput, latency, replication and disk usage. Refer to the&nbsp;<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/">Kafka documentation</a>&nbsp;and relevant monitoring tools to understand the specific metrics available for your version of Kafka and how to interpret them effectively.</p>



 Why is it important to monitor Kafka clients? 



<p>Monitoring your IBM® Event Streams for IBM Cloud® instance is crucial to ensure optimal functionality and overall health of your data pipeline. Monitoring your Kafka clients helps to identify early signs of application failure, such as high resource usage and lagging consumers and bottlenecks. Identifying these warning signs early enables proactive response to potential issues that minimize downtime and prevent any disruption to business operations.</p>



<p>Kafka clients (producers and consumers) have their own set of metrics to monitor their performance and health. In addition, the Event Streams service supports a rich set of metrics produced by the server. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-metrics">Monitoring Event Streams metrics by using IBM Cloud Monitoring</a>.</p>



 Client metrics to monitor 



 Producer metrics 



MetricDescriptionRecord-error-rateThis metric measures the average per-second number of records sent that resulted in errors. A high (or an increase in) record-error-rate might indicate a loss in data or data not being processed as expected. All these effects might compromise the integrity of the data you are processing and storing in Kafka. Monitoring this metric helps to ensure that data being sent by producers is accurately and reliably recorded in your Kafka topics.Request-latency-avgThis is the average latency for each produce request in ms. An increase in latency impacts performance and might signal an issue. Measuring the request-latency-avg metric can help to identify bottlenecks within your instance. For many applications, low latency is crucial to ensure a high-quality user experience and a spike in request-latency-avg might indicate that you are reaching the limits of your provisioned instance. You can fix the issue by changing your producer settings, for example, by batching or scaling your plan to optimize performance.Byte-rateThe average number of bytes sent per second for a topic is a measure of your throughput. If you stream data regularly, a drop in throughput can indicate an anomaly in your Kafka instance. The Event Streams Enterprise plan starts from 150MB-per-second split one-to-one between ingress and egress, and it is important to know how much of that you are consuming for effective capacity planning. Do not go above two-thirds of the maximum throughput, to account for the possible impact of operational actions, such as internal updates or failure modes (for example, the loss of an availability zone). Scroll to view full table  Table 1. Producer metrics



 Consumer metrics 



MetricDescriptionFetch-rate<br>fetch-size-avgThe number of fetch requests per second (fetch-rate) and the average number of bytes fetched per request (fetch-size-avg) are key indicators for how well your Kafka consumers are performing. A high fetch-rate might signal inefficiency, especially over a small number of messages, as it means insufficient (possibly no) data is being received each time. The fetch-rate and fetch-size-avg are affected by three settings: fetch.min.bytes, fetch.max.bytes and fetch.max.wait.ms. Tune these settings to achieve the desired overall latency, while minimizing the number of fetch requests and potentially the load on the broker CPU. Monitoring and optimizing both metrics ensures that you are processing data efficiently for current and future workloads.Commit-latency-avgThis metric measures the average time between a committed record being sent and the commit response being received. Similar to the request-latency-avg as a producer metric, a stable commit-latency-avg means that your offset commits happen in a timely manner. A high-commit latency might indicate problems within the consumer that prevent it from committing offsets quickly, which directly impacts the reliability of data processing. It might lead to duplicate processing of messages if a consumer must restart and reprocess messages from a previously uncommitted offset. A high-commit latency also means spending more time in administrative operations than actual message processing. This issue might lead to backlogs of messages waiting to be processed, especially in high-volume environments.Bytes-consumed-rateThis is a consumer-fetch metric that measures the average number of bytes consumed per second. Similar to the byte-rate as a producer metric, this should be a stable and expected metric. A sudden change in the expected trend of the bytes-consumed-rate might represent an issue with your applications. A low rate might be a signal of efficiency in data fetches or over-provisioned resources. A higher rate might overwhelm the consumers’ processing capability and thus require scaling, creating more consumers to balance out the load or changing consumer configurations, such as fetch sizes.Rebalance-rate-per-hourThe number of group rebalances participated per hour. Rebalancing occurs every time there is a new consumer or when a consumer leaves the group and causes a delay in processing. This happens because partitions are reassigned making Kafka consumers less efficient if there are a lot of rebalances per hour. A higher rebalance rate per hour can be caused by misconfigurations leading to unstable consumer behavior. This rebalancing act can cause an increase in latency and might result in applications crashing. Ensure that your consumer groups are stable by tracking a low and stable rebalance-rate-per-hour. Scroll to view full table  Table 2. Consumer metrics



<p>The metrics should cover a wide variety of applications and use cases. Event Streams on IBM Cloud provide a rich set of metrics that are documented here and will provide further useful insights depending on the domain of your application. Take the next step.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>SAP recently announced the end-of-life of their SAP Identity Management solution in 2027, with an extended maintenance period until 2030. With already being in 2024, this leaves three to at maximum six years for migrating SAP Identity Management to another solution. Three years, if avoiding the extended maintenance period and associated cost (even while the premium is only slightly above the regular maintenance fee), is not long enough for the transition of an IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) solution. In other words: It is time to start planning.</p>
 IAM solutions provided by SAP and the SAP solution approach 
<p>SAP recently <a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/preparing-for-sap-identity-management-s-end-of-maintenance-in-2027/ba-p/13596101">proposed a solution approach</a> based on <a href="https://pages.community.sap.com/topics/cloud-identity-services">SAP Cloud Identity Services</a>. This article has been frequently misinterpreted in saying “SAP endorses a combined solution based on SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID”. In fact, it says that SAP will continue its investment in both SAP Cloud Identity Services and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/cloud-iam.html">SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance</a> (Cloud IAG) and “that these enhancements are designed to facilitate integration with other partner identity management solutions, like Microsoft Entra ID, that provide a comprehensive approach to enterprise-wide identity and access scenarios.”</p>
<p>SAP unveils its strategy for the own IAM-related solutions as well as their focus on a flexible integration strategy for scenarios that require IAM capabilities beyond what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide.</p>
<p>SAP Cloud Identity Services are a SaaS solution supporting a good set of IAM capabilities, ranging from Access Management features for authentication and identity federation to SCIM-based provisioning, integrated directory services, and authorization management for Policy-Based Access Management (PBAM). SAP focuses on utilizing open standards, but also on integration to other IAM solutions in the organization. Access Governance features are provided by SAP Cloud IAG, which is primarily focused on the SAP ecosystem and neatly integrates with the SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
 Challenges and limitations 
<p>With SAP itself supporting an integration approach with other identity management solutions “that provide a comprehensive approach”, the question is where such expansion and integration is needed. There are two dimensions to look at. One is the breadth and depth of capabilities that are needed versus what is provided by SAP’s own solutions, which needs a thorough requirements analysis. To keep in mind here: Access Governance capabilities are delivered by the “companion product” SAP Cloud IAG, not by SAP Cloud Identity Services.</p>
<p>The other is the breadth and depth of integration to target systems. The focus on SCIM-based provisioning is one important area here. While SCIM is increasingly supported by SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions, SCIM interfaces are very rarely found in legacy on-premises applications.</p>
<p>A simple rule is: The more non-SAP solutions, the more legacy and on-premises integration, and the larger and more complex the organization is, the more likely such integration approach is needed.</p>
<p>Plus: There are several IAM solutions out there that can cover what SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud IAG provide in capabilities. There are options. And some of them provide very powerful, in-depth support even for complex SAP environments.</p>
 Taking a structured approach 
<p>Don’t oversimplify a decision that will impact your IT for the next 10-15 years at least, when taking common lifetimes of IGA solutions. Analyze the options you have thoroughly.</p>
 
 Start with your overall IAM strategy: How will your Identity Fabric of the future look like? 
 Analyze what you have and what (SAP Identity Manager, due to end-of-life) must change 
 Understand what you will need 
 Go into the detailed analysis of requirements 
 Run a thorough tools choice process to find the right solution 
 
<p>For that tools choice process, best practice for an organization that has SAP Identity Manager in place is to have SAP Cloud Identity Services and Cloud IAG as one of the shortlisted options, amongst other IAM solutions. Such process also will allow you to assess combinations such as SAP Cloud Identity Services in combination with Microsoft Entra ID or other enterprise IAM solutions.</p>
<p>In any case: Don’t take it easy. Spend the time for planning and assessing the options you have, to find the right solution for your enterprise. Impacting factors include aspects such as</p>
 
 The current and future SAP landscape versus a multi-vendor strategy for Line-of-Business applications 
 The complexity of the non-SAP application and system landscape in scope of IAM 
 The state of IAM solutions beyond SAP Identity Manager 
 The overall IAM strategy towards a modern Identity Fabric 
 The organizational structure, specifically regarding responsibilities for SAP environments vs. IAM 
 
<p>There is no simple answer to the right approach for replacing SAP Identity Manager. Don’t oversimplify.</p>

<p>This blog is first in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in a practical way on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p> Summary   Mydex CIC’s personal data infrastructure is live and operational 24/7/365  The personal data store (PDS) lies at the heart of this infrastructure. PDSs enable individuals to collect, receive, store and use their own data under their own control, independently of the organisations that collect data about&nbsp;them.  PDSs can hold any and all types of data and are designed to last the individual’s lifetime.  PDSs are designed to protect peoples’ privacy. The data held in a person’s PDS can only be seen or accessed by them. Not even Mydex can see or access this data, because each individual holds their own key to their own&nbsp;PDS.  PDSs are designed to be safe and secure, using many different methods and approaches, all designed to work together to maintain the system’s integrity and continuity.   Introduction <p>Over the years, we have blogged many times about developments and issues as they relate to personal data. We’ve talked about the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/economics-of-personal-data/home">economic opportunities</a> that are opened up by empowering individuals with their data, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">related human rights issues</a>, or the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">design principles needed</a> to operate a safe, secure, benign and efficient personal data ecosystem.</p><p>But we haven’t talked much about what we (Mydex CIC) actually do. After working on it for 17 years now, it’s time we&nbsp;did!</p><p>All this time we’ve been building, building, building. Not just a ‘product’ here or a service or app there, but an entire personal data infrastructure capable of providing every citizen nationally (and internationally) with the means to collect, store, manage, use and share any and all their data, from birth to death, in their own own safe, private database, independently of the organisations that collect and use data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This infrastructure can and will change how our entire economy and society works. By giving individuals as much power over their data as organisations currently have, and by enabling individuals to build up the richest and most powerful personal data assets ever seen (data assets that provide individuals with a complete picture of their life), this infrastructure will transform what both people, and the services, researchers and governments they deal with, can do with&nbsp;data.</p><p>Building this infrastructure — infrastructure that works safely and securely, day in, day out, 24/7/365, at national/international scale — hasn’t been easy. It has taken time. But it’s live and operational and it’s time we talked about it in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>If you are a software developer and you really want to dig deep into the nuts and bolts of how this infrastructure works, there is a separate website for you: <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/">dev.mydex.org</a>. There are pages of detail here about, for example, how our APIs work, our data schema (describing what data we can currently collect and hold), or how to access and use our Identity or Master Reference Data services. But this blog will describe what we do at a higher level — the core functionality and design requirements of a Personal Data&nbsp;Store.</p> An overview <p>Three core platforms make up the foundations of our infrastructure. They are akin to a plumbing system with a tank that holds the water, pipes that let water flow into and out of this tank, and taps and valves which control these flows. Similarly, our infrastructure provides:</p>  a Personal Data Store (PDS): the ‘tank’ that actually holds the&nbsp;data  a ‘Personal Data eXchange’ (PDX) system: the ‘pipes’ which enable data to flow into and out of the&nbsp;PDS  interfaces which enable individuals to control this flow of data — the ‘taps and valves’. Internally, we call this interface the Member Experience Layer or&nbsp;MEL  <p>Another analogy is that of a digital filing cabinet. The PDS acts as the filing cabinet itself, keeping each person’s data safely for them under their own lock and key. It is linked to a postal service that enables them to send and receive data as and when they wish (the PDX). Then there are administrative tools that let them decide what data they wish to send or receive, to and from whom, for what purposes (the Experience Layer or&nbsp;MEL).</p><p>Now let’s answer some basic questions.</p> Who? <p>At its most expansive, our mission potentially embraces every individual in the world. We believe every individual in the world should have the means to collect, receive, store and use their own data for their own purposes — to manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>They can (and should) be equipped with a PDS even before they are born — that starts gathering data about them, for them, in pregnancy. Their PDS should still be working for them after they die — to help manage probate and digital wills for example. In between, a person’s PDS creates a lifelong digital record of that person’s life for use by that&nbsp;person.</p> What data? <p>Our PDSs can hold any sort of data you like. Here are some examples.</p>  Transactional activity data This is data that has a time series component. It keeps a record of things that have happened and that you have done. This could include bank transactions, itemised bills, browsing history, secure messages and interactions with service providers and other people. It could also include self- monitoring activity data, for example from wearable devices and sensor data. Huge amounts of data can be involved here. For example, right now, we are collecting billions of rows of data from smart energy metres that are making new readings of electricity in peoples’ homes every 30&nbsp;seconds.  Lists, including assets of all types (documents, contracts, agreements, warranties, bookmarks, actions, calendars and&nbsp;events),  Verified State data This is usually data about you that has been generated by an organisation in the course of providing you with a service (for example blood pressure readings, test results or diagnoses in the case of a health service). Or it could be data that has been ‘conferred’ upon you by an organisation. This is potentially a very long list including, for example, educational attainments, training and professional qualifications, employment history, tenancy, tax status, National Insurance Number, passport details, driving licence details, Disclosure and Barring Service details, approved entitlements (e.g. to a Government benefit) or verified identity. And so&nbsp;on!  <p>These are all ‘verified attributes’, where the data point in question comes wrapped with additional metadata (data about the data) by which the originating organisation confirms its validity. In this way, trust that this data is reliable can travel seamlessly with it wherever it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>Using the PDX, it is possible to keep track of any ways in which this data might change. For example, if you have a driving licence, the data about your driving licence in your PDS can be linked to the data in the DVLA’s systems so that any changes it makes to its records are instantly registered in your PDS. Thus, if you have just passed your Heavy Goods driving test or have been barred from driving, your PDS will log this change as soon as it is logged by the DVLA. In this way your PDS works for you ‘while you are asleep’, keeping your records up-to-date.</p>  About me data This includes additional data that you decide to add to your PDS. This can be information about you that nobody else would necessarily know — for example your preferences, goals and plans. This is another potentially vast set of data, and it can be organised into different modules and dimensions. It is the sort of information that can be critically important to service providers wanting to understand you and your needs in the context of the services they provide. Because it is modular in nature (e.g. broken down to a series of separate details about you) you can choose to share different bundles of this data with different service providers, who often need different bundles of information. This helps you gain access to services and configure them to your&nbsp;needs.  Metadata about relationships and connections Metadata is data about the data. In this case, this metadata includes account level records of your relationships with service providers and other people that you share data with or received data&nbsp;from.  Immutable logs These record all activity and interactions with your and your use of Mydex APIs (links between your systems and others’ systems) and the applications connected to those APIs. They log who undertook what activity, via what route. Where relevant, they keep a before-and-after copy of the record, to show how it has been updated. All of this is crucial for audit and accountability. Should anything go wrong in your relationship with a service, you have proof of what has been transacted under your own control, like an audit trail which removes&nbsp;doubt.  <p>To keep on top of each new piece of data that comes into or goes out of the PDS, and to keep it in its right place, we have created what we call the ‘Personal Data Store Master Schema’. It is this Schema that structures and scopes the personal data store held in the PDS, enabling it to be used in endlessly different ways in different combinations. The Schema enables interoperability between the individual’s PDS and the subscribers who deliver and collect personal data via the&nbsp;PDX.</p><p>You can see a list of the data sets we are <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/datasets.html">currently handling here</a>. This list is forever growing and will continue growing. Mydex can automatically deploy updates to the PDS Master Data Schema as new datasets become available, using open standards where applicable and available. Some examples in the current list are: bank account details (including each bank transaction), browsing history, energy consumption data, health and social care records, intentions and notes made by members using the PDS, telephone calls and SMS messages, and details of voluntary activities.</p><p>Over an individual’s lifetime their PDS can collect and hold a potentially vast amount of data. Even so, not all the data that is generated or collected by an organisation will necessarily be deposited into an individual’s PDS — only the data that is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>We stress this point because some people get the wrong end of the stick about PDSs, thinking they are meant to replace the traditional organisation-centric database. They are not. They are meant to complement it, adding to the ecosystem by enabling individuals as well as organisations to use this data, and enabling new uses of this data via eased data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>Organisation-centric databases continue operating as they did before, with two changes. They can now deposit verified copies of some of their data in the individual’s PDS if the individual asks for it. They can also receive additional information from the individual’s PDS if they ask for it and the individual is prepared to provide&nbsp;it.</p><p>One crucial change made possible by the PDS is the ability to create new combinations of data. Currently, all your data is dispersed across the hundreds of different organisations that collect data about you (often the same data in many areas). Each one collects their own little slivers of data that really matter to them. PDSs enable individuals to become the ‘point of integration’, by which all this data from a vast range of sources can be gathered together and combined to create a complete picture of the individual’s life — all directly under the individual’s exclusive control.</p> How? <p>For us as a PDS provider, keeping on top of it all the above takes a lot of work. As you can imagine, providing this service involves a number of technical issues. Amongst these issues, interoperability is&nbsp;key.</p><p>It is irritating but true that different organisations use different formats to hold data — and if you jumble up these formats you end up with multiple data sets that cannot ‘talk’ to each other. A simple example is data formats where Americans and Europeans switch days and months around. To an American, 9/11/2001 means the eleventh of September 2001. To a European it means the ninth of November, 2001.</p><p>To cope with these endless sources of confusion, we have designed systems by which the PDS can store data that is delivered in the originating organisation’s raw delivery format but which also parse that data into the right part of the Master Schema (making appropriate links to ensure the integrity of the data is maintained at all times). The data is always watermarked with its source and verification status.</p><p>This means the data can be used in many different contexts, including being combined with other data sets that were once originally in completely different formats. By attaching metadata to the data — for example, who originally minted it, when, and when it was last checked and updated — trust can travel with each data&nbsp;point.</p> Where? <p>All the data held in our members’ PDSs are held in the Cloud, independently of and separate to any systems that organisations use to collect data about individuals.</p><p>This means that Mydex personal data stores are NOT just a different name or version of a traditional organisational ‘MyAccount’ service. With a MyAccount service, an individual can log in to an organisation’s systems (not their own personal system), see some of the data held by that particular organisation, tweak settings, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Mydex personal data stores have nothing to do with such MyAccount systems (even if these systems are sometimes misleadingly called ‘personal data stores’ or ‘personal online data stores’ — i.e. where an organisation is storing personal data about an individual.)</p><p>Using the Cloud as the storage medium is important because it provides maximum possible flexibility with security. Mydex personal data stores are not held in distributed ledgers or blockchains. These are too slow and unwieldy. Nor are they held on the individual’s device such as a smartphone. That’s too risky. (What happens if your device is lost or stolen?) Our PDSs are not the same as phone-held ‘wallets’ either, because these wallets hold only a tiny proportion of the data held by a&nbsp;PDS.</p><p>This doesn’t mean we are against any of these things. Mydex PDSs can and do connect to organisations’ MyAccount systems. They can work with specific blockchain applications. Mobile phones (and ‘wallets’ held on the mobile phones) are one of the main ways that individuals access and use their PDS — including via different types of web app. They are an interface. Part of the experience layer.</p><p>But the Cloud is the place for the PDS itselfbecause of its scale, flexibility and security. The simple fact that the Cloud is ‘always on’ means data deliveries and collections can operate 24hrs a day, following the rules the member has set for their relationships with&nbsp;others.</p><p>Of course, the Cloud is provided by physical infrastructure sitting in physical places. Our PDSs sit in data centres rented off specialist service providers, with the servers operated in highly secure locations in the individual’s country of residence (to comply fully, not only with the letter of GDPR data protection regulations but with their spirit too). Because they are ‘always on’, we operate them across ‘availability zones’. This means that if one location goes off-line we keep running. We also back them up continually. This means we always have a means of recovery even in the highly unlikely scenario of the Cloud being lost and all the availability zones being&nbsp;lost.</p> Who is in&nbsp;control? <p>One key feature about our PDSs is that we cannot and do not want to see the data it holds or exert any control over it. The only person able to see the data held in a PDS is the person that the data relates to (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Znjev1g6XtYXaiew_OLjS1uav21v6MvWlpCbiJddy28/edit#heading=h.7ki3ej3oc5ty">But is it safe?</a> Below). We provide individuals with the tools by which they can exercise control over the sharing and use of this data, but these tools are designed to empower the individual, not us. We act for the individual, as their agent, carrying out their instructions. We explain more about how this works in our blog on the PDX (personal data exchange).</p><p>This issue of control raises a further important question about <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">guardianship</a>. The baby in the womb isn’t up to managing and controlling their data. Nor is an ageing person with dementia. Processes for safe, ethical guardianship are key to the design of what we do: we have designed auditable, easy-to-manage ways by which one individual can act for another in managing that individual’s data, including powers of attorney, when needed. Again, we’ll say more about this when we look at the PDX. These arrangements may include one individual acting on another’s behalf e.g. sending messages, reviewing referrals, calendar invites and any number of interactions with their service providers. Every such activity is tracked and audited transparently. This helps protect both the individual and the service provider interacting with that individual.</p> But is it&nbsp;safe? <p>Given the vast range and potential sensitivity of the data that can go into a PDS, security has to be paramount. (After all, this is a hugely powerful personal asset that will grow in value over your lifetime)</p><p>To maintain security at all times, all data held in a Mydex PDS is encrypted both at rest and in motion. From the moment it is entered into your PDS, your personal information is encrypted using AES 512-bit encryption, the highest standard available today.</p><p>The company as a whole is independently accredited and certified for Information Security and Management under ISO27001 (and has been for the last ten years). As part of this, Mydex operates extensive security and threat vector protections and monitoring to ensure the stability, availability and performance of its data infrastructure. This is constantly monitored with specific triggers and alerts and automated responses and mitigations.</p><p>To get an idea of the detailed work that goes into operating our encryption processes, go to <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/pki.html">this page on our developer website</a>. There, you can see the instructions we give to developers wanting to deposit data in a PDS or receive data from it. <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/fyi/security-model.html">This page provides</a> a higher level overview of our security&nbsp;model.</p><p>Our platforms and all data held in our PDS have triple availability (e.g. stored in three different availability zones across a scalable infrastructure, all in undisclosed locations within the UK (for UK citizens). ​​These locations are monitored 24x7 and cannot be accessed without security clearance including photo ID and pre-notification in advance. Meanwhile, as part of our ISO27001 certification, we operate multi-layer backup services which means that if any data should be lost in some sort of outage or physical damage, it can be recovered (as described above).</p><p>Many companies make a big fuss about how privacy protecting they are because, like us, all the data they hold is encrypted. What they don’t point out is that while such encryption protects the data from external prying eyes, it doesn’t do anything to protect it from internal prying eyes — e.g. the company itself. If the company holds the encryption key, it can access this data any time it likes. Which means that their much-vaunted encryption-based privacy protection amounts to very&nbsp;little.</p><p>Our PDSs are different. First off, each PDS is a standalone database and each is separately encrypted. This means we have not built one single huge database holding millions of records, but a separate personal database for each individual. The distributed nature of this infrastructure means it is impossible for a hacker to do one, single hack to access a million records in one fell swoop (the sort of thing that is reported daily, in growing numbers, across the globe). To access a million people’s records on the Mydex platform, a hacker would have to conduct a million separate, successful hacks. This turns the economics and incentives of hacking on its head, maximising the hacker’s costs while minimising their&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>In addition, every individual has their own private encryption key to their PDS. Basically, this is their own additional passphrase (which can be up to 128 characters in length). Mydex doesn’t have access to this passphrase. This means not even Mydex can ‘see’ the data held by its members in their&nbsp;PDSs.</p><p>There are no hidden ‘back doors’. The entire system is designed NOT to have such back doors. (This isn’t without its problems. For example, many Governments and security services don’t like services that don’t keep secret back doors open for&nbsp;them.)</p><p>Because only the individual knows their particular Private Key, if they forget this passphrase we cannot reset it for them — because we never knew what it was in the first place. The downside of this is that if they lose this Private Key — if they forget this additional passphrase — they lose direct access to their&nbsp;data.</p><p>We have ways of addressing this problem. In a nutshell, we have created a system whereby individuals can break their Private Keys/additional passphrase into ‘shards’ or fragments. Each of these shards is cryptographically secured so it can only be accessed by the person who set it up. These shards are then distributed among the PDSs of friends and family, who are invited act as trustees of just one particular shard. The shards are thus held securely by friends and family on behalf of the individual. (The fact that it is a shard means that should the friend or family member turn evil and, in the extremely unlikely event of their being able to break the encryption, even then they would only be able to access one part of the Private Key, thereby rendering it useless.)</p><p>If the individual forgets their Private Key passphrase, they can then ask friends and family to return the cryptographic tokens back to them, and our systems will help the member put them back together and de-encrypt them for the individual. This is a bit of hassle for both us and the individual. But it’s needed if the whole system is to be genuinely secure.</p> Conclusion <p>Mydex has built citizen-empowering personal data infrastructure that enables individuals to safely and easily collect, store, manage, use and share their own data in their own database independently of all organisations that collect data about them. This helps remove friction, effort, risk, cost and micro-stress in their lives.

<p>Today’s healthcare organizations must address a multitude of high-priority challenges. With competition at an all-time high, healthcare organizations are under pressure to meet patient and member demands for easy, personalized digital experiences. Healthcare providers, workers, and partners are also insisting on seamless digital experiences that streamline their work for greater operational efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the healthcare industry is facing unrelenting cyberattacks that wreak havoc upon patient care, budgets, and business operations. According to the 2024 ForgeRock Breach Report (ForgeRock is now a part of Ping Identity), healthcare systems have remained the number one breach target for over five years.&nbsp; Electronic health records containing personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI), such as medical records and patient data, are highly sought after by cybercriminals. Unauthorized access is the root cause of most breaches – emphasizing the dire need for modern digital identity cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most healthcare organizations are using <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/iam-modernization.html">legacy systems</a> that weren’t built to deliver personalized experiences and secure access for millions of diverse identity types to on-premises, cloud, and SaaS apps from any device, at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a modern, HIPAA compliant <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management.html">identity and access management (IAM)</a> platform should be on every healthcare leader’s radar. Modern IAM is proven to protect sensitive information and data by drastically reducing cyberattacks. It also improves user experience and engagement, such as removing friction from the authentication process, all while protecting sensitive data against ransomware, fraud, and other cyberattacks. HIPAA-compliant IAM platforms also enable healthcare organizations to meet compliance requirements for regulations such as HIPAA, TEFCA, HITECH, the 21st Century Cures Act, and many more.</p>

<p>IBM at the B7</p>



<p>We are living in a watershed moment for AI: the European Parliament has just voted on the EU AI Act, which will regulate and govern the use and implications of this technology. In turn, governments and enterprises are getting ready to set their own standards around AI. AI featured in the G7 Ministerial Meeting in Verona, Italy, and in conversations happening in parallel in the Business Federations gatherings, or B7. I had the opportunity to bring IBM’s perspective to these industry discussions.</p>



<p>At IBM, we firmly believe that AI can deliver huge benefits in every field. But first, we must overcome barriers to adoption and build trust in this exciting technology.</p>



 From bleeding edge to standard issue 



<p>Most organizations have kicked off their AI journey. Our research shows that 42% of large enterprises have AI actively deployed while another 40% are in the experimentation phase (source: IBM <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">Global AI Adoption Index</a>). But few are realizing the full potential of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence">AI solutions</a>. What’s holding them back?</p>



<p>Our analysis shows that the top three factors are limited AI skills and expertise (33%), data complexity (25%), and ethical concerns (23%). IBM plans to build on a long legacy of democratizing technology by helping to dissolve these barriers.</p>



<p>First we will continue to invest in open and transparent innovation around AI. Promoting collaboration and information sharing surfaces risks sooner—and helps the international community mitigate those risks faster. Initiatives such as the <a href="https://thealliance.ai/">AI Alliance</a> help engender an open AI community that prioritizes responsibility, safety, and innovation.</p>



<p>We believe it’s in everyone’s interests to foster open market ecosystems around AI. The increased competition will help level the playing field for companies of all sizes, regardless of their access to data and compute resources.</p>



<p>Our solutions are designed to address complexity at every level: from data to governance to scaling. IBM believes that scaling AI with governance is the path to sustainable, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics">ethically responsible AI</a>—boosting customer trust and corporate reputation.</p>



 Building that all-important trust 



<p>The headline of the IBM vision for AI is that both industry and government must continue to build and grow confidence in the technology worldwide. The EU AI Act is a breakthrough in regulating this fast-evolving field. In our latest <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">AI Adoption research</a>, 85% of IT professionals strongly or somewhat agree that consumers are more likely to choose services from companies with transparent and ethical AI practices, while 83% of companies deploying or exploring the technology stated that being able to explain how their AI reached a decision is important to their business.</p>



<p>Navigating the increasingly complex global regulatory landscape is a challenge for businesses and organizations of all sizes. That’s why we released <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a>, an integrated platform that’s designed to break open the black box of AI.</p>



<p>Moreover, IBM fully backs the work undertaken during last year’s Japanese G7 Presidency to develop the Hiroshima Principles—a set of guiding principles for organizations worldwide to develop advanced AI systems that promote safe, secure and trustworthy AI. We look forward to supporting the Italian Presidency in building on this solid foundation.</p>



<p>As next steps, we propose that the G7 task an AI workstream to create a ‘crosswalk’ to compare the AI regulatory regimes in individual member countries to the Hiroshima Principles. We believe this move could help establish gaps and differences, and accelerate the international harmonization of standards and adoption of best practices for AI. This would allow the G7 to focus its attention on specific policy areas that require additional time and resources (such as AI safety).</p>



 Looking to the future 



<p>We can’t stop looking ahead. Even though AI is at an exciting turning point, there is so much more on the horizon thanks to technologies like quantum computing. Our belief is that AI and quantum computing will work in tandem, with quantum extending classical machine learning, but not replacing it. So, just like with AI, we are pioneering quantum governance Combining different technologies will broaden the problems we can solve, from the climate crisis to food insecurity to global health.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IBM we believe we have a responsibility to ensure innovation solves problems faster than it creates them. Again: openness, transparency, and collaboration are the principles that will help us fulfill the full potential of new technologies to change the world for the better.</p>

				  Learn how some educators are taking advantage of new technologies to provide faster student and employee verification and eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>In the US <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/highest-school-enrollment-count.html#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20college%20enrollment%20remained,percentage%20point%20increase%20from%202020">17.3 million students were enrolled in college</a> in 2022, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184010/school-enrollment-in-public-and-private-institutions-2008/#statisticContainer">17.16 million were enrolled in high school.</a> Each student generates data — such as transcripts of courses taken and grades achieved — all of which will need to be shared and verified over the course of the school year and beyond.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in higher education, colleges in the US received roughly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2023/03/30/college-applications-are-up-dramatically-in-2023/?sh=6b7324349c4d">seven million applications in 2023,</a> each of which requiring a short list of supporting documents.</p>
<p>Student athletes will need documents for sports they participated in, as well as medical paperwork, such as physicals or injury reports, to be on file.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitnux.org/college-housing-statistics/#:~:text=50%25%20of%20college%20students%20in,colleges%20have%20on-campus%20housing">50% of college students who live on campus </a>need an identity and access management system to access dorms, dining halls, labs and libraries.</p>
<p>Each of the <a href="https://educationdata.org/number-of-college-graduates#:~:text=The%20total%20number%20of%20graduates,college%20students%20graduated%20in%202021">4.16 million students who received some level of degree in 2021</a> will need to prove that achievement when they apply for a job and will need to keep supplying that data for many jobs to come.</p>
<p>Employers will want to verify that the degree is real, a <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/how-employers-verify-college-degrees#:~:text=This%20type%20of%20check%20is,which%20usually%20incurs%20a%20fee">manual process most often handled by the school records office</a>. This process can take up to <a href="https://clarifacts.com/faqs/education-verification-turnaround-time/#:~:text=Education%20Verification%20Turnaround%20Time&amp;text=The%20normal%20turnaround%20time%20for,or%20state%20and%20federal%20holiday">72 hours</a> unless subject to additional delays such as school holidays, resulting in a lot of work for the school.</p>
<p>Verifying these degrees is not just a “nice to have,” fraudulent degrees and transcripts are estimated to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">seven billion-dollar-a-year industry</a> worldwide, with real impact. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawhitford/2023/02/21/how-thousands-of-nurses-got-licensed-with-fake-degrees/?sh=4de695cb5c6d">Thousands of nurses</a> have recently been caught practicing using fake or purchased credentials.</p>
<p>What if there was a really simple way of managing all this, so that all this data was portable, held by the student, and instantly and reliably authenticatable?</p>
<p>How decentralized identity can help</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology is a way to digitize data so that its original source can be cryptographically proven and any attempt to alter it will be caught. It is designed so that a person can hold their own data, locally, on their mobile devices in the form of a verifiable credential. This makes data easy to share directly with other parties, each of whom can verify the authenticity of the data with simple, mobile software. Critically, this system of holding one’s own data, sharing it directly, and verifying it easily means that direct integrations can be avoided (saving money) and third parties are no longer needed as data brokers (simplifying data privacy), — a revolution in data management.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective for an educational institution, paperwork such as grades, transcripts, and diplomas can now be issued to students directly with a verifiable credential. The student or graduate holds their records and shares them with whoever needs the information, such as when signing up for more classes or applying for college or a job.</p>
<p>Similarly, a student’s identity card can be issued as a verifiable credential, meaning educators have a way to verify a student’s identity for access to accounts, buildings, research collections, laboratories, and more. Verifiable credentials can easily be configured with rules to grant and revoke this access and expire upon graduation.</p>
<p>By issuing verifiable credentials for identity and data, an educational institution can remove the need for passwords, locks, key fobs, or access cards, manual checks in the records office, digging through servers, paper documents and more. By issuing degrees through a verifiable credential, any business with the proper verifier agent can immediately know that the information presented to them is trustworthy, removing the need to go back to the school at all.</p>
<p>How Open Badges fit in</p>
<p>Currently, if you want to verify a person’s transcript, diploma, or certificate, you will need to contact whomever issued the transcript or diploma or certificate. This often means contacting them directly.</p>
<p>But what if that issuing party no longer exists? Schools close, businesses go under or become absorbed. Even if the original data exists, it can be time-consuming to track it down.</p>
<p>This is where Open Badges 3.0 comes in. As a type of verifiable credential for storing data about academic achievements, or certifications, an Open Badge credential can be verified without having to directly check in with the institution that issued them, meaning it can essentially “live forever.”</p>
<p>In contrast to earlier versions of the Open Badges format, the badge can be held by its owner and shared directly. Previously, the badge was hosted by a website (with the risk that it, too, could go bust and disappear, taking the credential record with it).</p>
<p>Open badges 3.0 offer a new smart, decentralized way to store transcripts, grades, and diplomas. Even if a school closes, merges with another, or loses the records, the student has a record and can prove what they have accomplished.</p>

 Digital identity pilot implementation to start in Q1 2024: Kick-off with 2,700 citizens from Austria, Romania and Spain to test wallet solution 



<p>Rennes/Munich, March 12, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is pleased to announce the start of the pilot implementation phase for the EU-wide SOTERIA research project which aims to develop a user-centric, citizen-driven tool to help European citizens manage their personal data.</p>



<p>The ultimate goal of the project is to combine the creation of a digital identity to access online services with a user-friendly platform that allows for secure and easy data management, while increasing citizens’ awareness of their personal data. “SOTERIA is a large scale demonstrator that shows how a digital identity wallet can enable citizens to protect and control their personal data while making access to online services easier than ever before,” says Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow and coordinator of the SOTERIA project.</p>



 E-voting, e-exam, and e-health field tests in three EU countries 



<p>Launched in October 2021, the SOTERIA project is nearing the final pilot implementation and testing phase of the identity wallet solution, which was developed by IDnow and the other SOTERIA partners as part of the project. The wallet will be integrated into the platforms of <a href="https://scytl.com/">SCYTL</a>, <a href="https://ipcenter.international/">IPCenter</a> and <a href="https://www.science.eus/en/institutions/biobizkaia">Biobizkaia Health Research Institute</a> (with the support of <a href="https://infocons.org/">INFOCONS</a> association) in Romania, Austria and Spain, respectively, for use cases in e-voting, e-exam, and e-health.</p>



<p>This month, the three pilot use cases will kick off with field tests consisting of 900 citizens each from Austria, Romania and Spain. For the e-voting and e-exam use cases, participants will authenticate themselves through the SOTERIA app and test the onboarding, which IDnow provides via proven identity verification methods. These include several new security checks developed within the project, reinforcing the fraud detection capability of the solution further. Then the citizens will go through the voting or exam process, and at the end, have the choice to add their voting receipt or their exam results to their wallet. For the e-health trial, citizens will have the possibility to add their health data to their wallet, while choosing the type of data and documents they want to store. This will allow them to have all important health information about themselves in their pockets.</p>



<p>The benefits of this testing phase are twofold: The 2,700 citizens will test the authentication process and the access to an online service with the help of a stored digital identity; while the wallet’s capability to store documents and attributes (e.g., e-voting receipt, e-exam results, e-health data) in the form of verifiable credentials will also be tested. Afterwards, the citizens’ feedback will be analyzed and evaluated by <a href="https://www.audencia.com/en">AUDENCIA</a> and will be used to improve the platform. These findings can then inform the further development of digital identity wallets under the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS2 (electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) regulation</a>.</p>



<p>Awal adds: “Thanks to the findings in the use cases with citizens, SOTERIA will help strengthen security, privacy, and personal data protection across all layers of the digital economy, and will help pave the way for a trustworthy EU digital environment. We are very proud that the R&amp;D team at IDnow gets to lead this ambitious consortium of 13 European partners. It is testament to our innovative spirit and curiosity that forms part of our DNA at IDnow.”</p>



 



<p>About SOTERIA</p>



<p>The SOTERIA consortium consists of 13 partners from eight EU countries, composed of small medium enterprises (ERDYN), large enterprises (IDnow, SCYTL, IPCenter.at), universities and research centers (Audencia, KU Leuven, CVC, IDIAP, Inria, Biocruces Bizkaia) and non-for-profit organizations (INFOCONS, STELAR, NORIA Onlus). The project was written and submitted to the European Union in August 2020, following a call for projects by the European Commission on the topics of digital security and privacy for citizens. The SOTERIA project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101018342. More information on the project can be found at <a href="https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/">https://www.soteria-h2020.eu/</a>.<a>[1]</a></p>

  Today, we’re open sourcing Ozone, a tool that lets a team of moderators or curators collaboratively review reports, create labels, and inspect content on the atproto network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for users to run their own independent moderation services.

<p>Bluesky was created to put <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">users and communities in control</a> of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">open-sourcing Ozone</a>, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app. This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a>. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.</p>
<p>In designing these moderation services, Bluesky operated by three principles:</p>
 
 Simple and Powerful: Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood 
 User Choice: Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems 
 Openness: Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces 
 
<p>We first shared our vision for <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a> before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.</p>
 Sensible Defaults with User Choice 
<p>In everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">community guidelines</a> with several automated moderation systems. This provides a strong foundation for moderation on the app. You can read our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023">2023 Moderation Report</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s vision for moderation is a stackable ecosystem of services. Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).</p>

  
  An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.

<p>In the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide. Independent moderation services will let you and community builders further customize your own spaces, and open APIs will let developers evolve and innovate on these systems.</p>

  
  Configurable options per label from an example moderation service. 


  
  Example of a post that the moderation service The Chiller has labeled as “rude.”

<p>One team will never be perfect at moderation and curation for the entire world, with its wide variety of contexts, cultures, and preferences. So we’re excited about opening the ecosystem to empower experts, developers, and users with local context to provide their own input that you can additionally subscribe to, on top of Bluesky’s moderation service.</p>
<p>Later this week, we will publish a technical explainer for moderation across the AT Protocol. (This blog post will be updated with a link at that time.)</p>
 How will this all work? 
<p>Here’s what users, moderators, and developers can expect to see this week:</p>
 From a user perspective: 
<p>First and foremost, we want Bluesky to be a great and intuitive experience as soon as you install the app. But if you want to customize your experience, you can easily browse and select from other independent moderation services and subscribe to them in the Bluesky app — as easily as you’d follow another account.</p>
<p>For example, someone could make a moderation service that blocks photos of spiders from Bluesky — let’s call it the Spider Shield. If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.</p>
<p>Moderation services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.</p>
 From a moderator perspective: 
<p>If you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.</p>

  
  Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.

<p>Today, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.</p>
<p>Ozone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.</p>
 From a developer perspective: 
<p>As a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">submit a PR</a> or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust &amp; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.</p>
<p>The generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.</p>
<p>Moderation services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of "composable moderation" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.</p>
<p>We think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.</p>
 FAQ 
<p>Where can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?</p>
<p>You can find the GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why are you open-sourcing Ozone?</p>
<p>By making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.</p>
<p>How is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?</p>
<p>Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">post on federation</a> goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?</p>
<p>All users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.</p>
<p>However, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.</p>
<p>How will running a moderation service be sustainable?</p>
<p>Moderation services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations. However, there is also nothing stopping a moderation service from having paid subscribers.</p>

 Introduction <p>The Meteorological Aerodrome Report (<a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">METAR</a>) is a globally standardized format for communicating current weather conditions at airports or permanent weather observation stations. This format plays a vital role in aviation, aiding in flight planning and ensuring safety. Composed as a concise alphanumeric code, the <a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">METAR</a> delivers comprehensive meteorological data specific to an airport at a particular moment. These reports, consisting of letters and numbers, are issued every 30 or 60 minutes by airports and airfields.</p>METAR, Miami International Airport (KMIA) on March 9, 2024, at 15:00&nbsp;UTC<p>In the recently concluded data challenge hosted on <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/list">Desights.ai</a>, participants used exploratory data analysis (EDA) and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance aviation weather forecasting accuracy. Focusing on Miami International Airport (KMIA), participants analyzed historical METAR reports spanning an entire&nbsp;decade.</p>Image showing the decoded METAR for KMIA on March 9, 2024, at 15:00 UTC, as provided by <a href="http://metar-taf.com">metar-taf.com</a><p>The challenge began with an in-depth exploration of EDA, where participants meticulously examined trends, patterns, and anomalies within the METAR data. Through this process, they gained valuable insights into Miami’s meteorological landscape, including seasonal variations and significant weather events impacting KMIA operations.</p><p>Transitioning to AI and machine learning (ML), participants developed models for precise weather prediction at KMIA. They addressed critical questions about prediction accuracy and model performance across weather phenomena. Additionally, they explored the influence of geographical and seasonal factors on prediction outcomes, aiming to enhance the applicability of their models in real-world aviation scenarios.</p> Winners Podium <p>The podium submissions exemplified ingenuity and precision in aviation weather forecasting. Participants showcased their expertise through innovative approaches, leveraging advanced machine-learning techniques to deliver accurate predictions. Let’s explore the top three submissions that stood out for their excellence and creativity in tackling this complex data challenge.</p> Andrey Bessalov — 1st&nbsp;Place <p>Andrey demonstrated a meticulous and methodologically sound approach to weather forecasting, using three critical&nbsp;stages:</p><p>1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Andrey undertook an extensive data preprocessing exercise to clean and prepare the METAR data for analysis. It involved handling missing values, encoding categorical data, normalizing measurements, and converting various data types. He also applied feature engineering to extract additional information from the data, including time-based features and rolling averages.</p><p>2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Development: He performed an exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics of the data, such as the distribution of various weather parameters and their correlations. Patterns and anomalies in the data, like seasonal variations, were identified. Andrey developed a machine-learning model and trained it to predict METAR data for the next hour, comparing different models ( linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks) and choosing the best based on performance. He analyzed which features were most influential in predicting weather conditions and evaluated the model based on its accuracy.</p><p>3. Individual Weather Component Analysis and Final Algorithm: The project involved detailed analysis and modeling of various weather components, such as air temperature, dew point, air pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility, rain, fog, thunderstorms, and clouds. Andrey built separate Xgboost models for each component to predict future values one hour ahead. He validated the models using data from 2023, with training data from 2014 to 2022. The final step was the creation of an algorithm to process the data, create features, make predictions for individual components, and then convert these predictions into METAR format for practical use.</p> Dominikus Brian — 2nd&nbsp;Place <p>Dominikus’ primary objectives were to explore the relationships between different meteorological data, uncover statistical patterns influencing weather, and demonstrate the use of historical METAR report data in building a predictive machine-learning model.</p><p>His submission outlined essential findings from the exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development. It employed a Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network to predict next-hour weather conditions around Miami International Airport, revealing that models with shorter memory spans are generally more effective. The study faced challenges in accurately predicting wind direction and cloud types while achieving high accuracy in predicting temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility. Additionally, it observed yearly weather trends, such as an increase in mean temperatures and seasonal variations like stronger winds in the latter half of the year. The study also included correlation analyses showing various relationships between different weather&nbsp;factors.</p><p>His report comprehensively explored employing machine learning in weather forecasting, focusing on Miami International Airport. It highlighted the effectiveness of models with shorter memory spans and the interconnectedness of various weather factors. The insights gained are valuable for understanding meteorological dynamics specific to the airport and developing a machine-learning pipeline for weather prediction. Plans include refining the model’s efficiency and exploring its applicability to other airports, broadening the scope of the study’s utility in aviation and related&nbsp;fields.</p> Anamaria Loznianu — 3rd&nbsp;Place <p>Anamaria presented a structured approach to predicting weather conditions using METAR data. She applied predictive models, including MultiOutputRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to forecast weather values like wind direction, speed, gusts, visibility, temperature, dew point, and pressure. The report mentioned significant discrepancies in some predictions, such as temperature, while acknowledging the better accuracy of models like RandomForestRegressor and&nbsp;LSTM.</p><p>In addition to historical data, Anamaria explored using real-time data from airports surrounding Miami to improve weather predictions. This included a novel approach of using real-time data from nearby airports to refine weather predictions for Miami. She analyzed weather patterns from eight nearby airports and examined how these patterns influenced Miami’s conditions, then aggregated the latest METAR data from nearby airports and analyzed whether weather patterns at these locations influenced Miami’s conditions.</p><p>Her report concluded that while historical data is vital for recognizing patterns, forecasting weather in the short term is most effective when combining current data with the overall direction of weather systems. While the MultiOutputRegressor showed significant discrepancies, especially in temperature predictions, the RandomForestRegressor and LSTM models delivered more accurate results with significantly lower error&nbsp;rates.</p> Interesting Facts  Data Preprocessing and&nbsp;Parsing <p>The challenge required processing approximately 90,000 METAR lines from the Miami International Airport (KMIA) spanning over ten&nbsp;years.</p> General Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The study observed seasonal temperature variations, with Miami experiencing warm, humid summers and mild, dry winters due to its tropical monsoon climate. Rainfall is significant during the summer, while winters are the peak tourist season due to comfortable weather. The city is also susceptible to hurricanes and tropical&nbsp;storms.</p> Yearly Weather&nbsp;Trends <p>The report noted an increase in mean temperatures from an average of 25.01°C in 2014 to 26.24°C by 2023. It also highlighted seasonal variations, such as stronger winds in the second half of the year, poorer visibility in fall and winter, decreased air pressure, and more predominantly eastward wind directions towards the year-end.</p> Seasonal Analysis <p>The data showed clear seasonal patterns. The highest temperatures occurred in summer (July-August) and during late afternoons (16:00 to 18:00), while the lowest temperatures were in winter (December-January) and early mornings (6:00 to&nbsp;9:00).</p> Challenges in Predicting Certain Weather&nbsp;Features <p>Among the primary features analyzed (wind direction, wind speed, visibility, cloud types, cloud heights, temperature, dew point, and air pressure), wind direction and cloud types were the most challenging to predict accurately. In contrast, temperature, dew point, air pressure, and visibility were predicted with high accuracy.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Did you know that our reward structure has changed? The prize pool is now $10,000 for every challenge, and it pays the top 10 participants.</p><p>In addition to the monetary rewards, we’ve also revamped our points system to better recognize our top performers’ achievements. Points will now be awarded to the top 10 finishers in each event, with 100 championship points up for&nbsp;grabs.</p><p>Collect points in each challenge for the 2024 Championship. Last year’s Championships’ top 10 received an additional $10 for every point earned during the&nbsp;year.</p><p>The top 3 in each challenge may work with Ocean on a dApp that monetizes their algorithm.

<p>The health sector faces a staggering array of challenges and consequences in the relentless battle against cyberthreats. Surprisingly, it’s not just a battle against malicious outsiders — within healthcare organizations internal users represent 39% of all threat actors.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human error in the forms of data loss and misuse are the most common ways internal actors pose a threat to the healthcare organizations they work for. With the average cost of a breach at $10.93 million2, it is essential to ensure that healthcare providers, employees, contractors, and partners only have access to the internal apps and systems that they need to do their jobs — and nothing more — to keep the risk of internal threats at bay.</p>

 As the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ecommerce">ecommerce</a> market grows exponentially, six trends projected to heavily impact the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/global-ecommerce-growth-forecast-2022">global market</a> are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), augmented reality, live commerce, online-to-offline ecommerce, social commerce and voice assistants. 
 



 
 Generative AI opens up greater opportunities for value-creating personalization, dynamic pricing, user-friendly <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a>, voice assistants, virtual assistants, and improved customer search. 
 



 
 Social commerce, a form of ecommerce in which a social media platform serves as both a marketing channel and a shopping destination, is expected to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/e-commerce-at-the-center-of-profitable-growth-in-consumer-goods">grow by more than 50%</a> between 2021 and 2025.  
 



 



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ecommerce">ecommerce</a> market has grown exponentially over the last decade. The ecosystem has become more complex as business models advance and new ecommerce trends appear. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the rate of digital adoption <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-resilience-consumer-survey-finds-ample-scope-for-growth">doubled across the globe</a>. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/solving-the-paradox-of-growth-and-profitability-in-e-commerce">Some forecasts</a> suggest online retail might be responsible for half of all retail revenues by next year. </p>



<p>But, as many companies found out, expanding a business’ digital footprint or placing more emphasis on its online store didn’t guarantee profit. In what McKinsey refers to as <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/solving-the-paradox-of-growth-and-profitability-in-e-commerce">“the e-commerce catch-22,”</a> many retailers with significant growth in ecommerce sales through 2020 and 2021 saw their margins decline.</p>



<p>In part, this is because of high saturation in the market: An electronics or home goods retailer now competes globally, not just with its direct competitors, but with small-scale online stores and ecommerce giants like Amazon. This can force businesses to bring down prices to compete. </p>



<p>Shipping and logistics can get complicated in new markets and are subject to global supply chain interruptions. Consumers today, having become accustomed to ecommerce staples like same-day delivery and customized products, expect a seamless and unified digital shopping experience. They also expect the ability to use the payment option of their choice. Increasingly, these customers desire benefits like free shipping or designated loyalty programs. Also, and to successfully market to digitally native demographics like Gen Z, businesses must demonstrate a commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>In the constantly shifting, rapidly expanding ecommerce ecosystem, businesses must think creatively about their digital strategies and how best to create dynamic, interactive shopping experiences that improve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer relationships</a>. In the midst of a massive shift in how consumers purchase goods and services, here are some ecommerce trends that are projected to impact the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/global-ecommerce-growth-forecast-2022">global USD 3.3 trillion market</a> and enhance a customer’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">digital experience</a>:</p>



 
 Artificial intelligence (AI) 



 Augmented reality 



 Live commerce 



 Online-to-offline ecommerce 



 Social commerce 



 Voice assistants 
 



 Trend: Artificial intelligence (AI) 



<p>It’s often said that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> is ushering in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/win-the-fourth-industrial-revolution-with-artificial-intelligence/">fourth industrial revolution</a>, and the technology’s impact on digital commerce has been immense. Personalized shopping experiences are no longer an aberration, but something customers expect. Digital optimization and automation tools have made it cheaper and easier for businesses to use customer data or third-party data, creating intelligent ecommerce sites. AI-enabled marketing and product discovery tools help facilitate customer engagement and retention, if deployed correctly.</p>



 Personalization 



<p>AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of customer data, including browsing history, purchasing behavior, and demographic information to deliver personalized product recommendations and tailored shopping experiences. AI-based personalization surfaces goods a consumer is most likely to buy, reminds customers when it’s time to refill an order, and offers shopping experiences tailored to an individual’s preferences. These personalized shopping experiences can be deployed in several touchpoints including product pages, email campaigns, and during the checkout process.</p>



 Dynamic pricing 



<p>Dynamic pricing, most famously deployed by ride-share companies but increasingly used in other markets, allows retailers to adjust prices in real-time based on factors like demand, inventory levels, and competitor pricing. For some ecommerce businesses, dynamic pricing can help maximize revenue while remaining competitive in the market, though it’s crucial to carefully select the AI’s parameters to avoid unrealistic pricing structures that might deter new customers.</p>



 Chatbots and virtual assistants 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51435">Gartner</a>, by 2027 chatbots will become, for as many as a quarter of organizations, the technology providing personalized customer support in natural language, answering questions, and addressing consumer concerns in real-time. As some researchers <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/marketing-and-sales-operations/global-marketing-trends/2022/end-to-end-customer-experience-ai.html">have cautioned</a>, it’s imperative to find synergy between <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai">conversational AI-assisted</a> customer service and the humans that manage it, to ensure customers have a productive online shopping experience from end-to-end.</p>



 Search and discovery 



<p>AI-powered search and recommendation engines use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms to better capture user intent, improve search relevance, and enhance product discovery. For example: Large retailers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/06/business/lily-ai-retail-shopping.html">are engaging third-party AI</a> to make searching for products in natural language simpler, so shoppers can search by pattern or style and find the exact item they’re looking to buy.</p>



<p>The AI revolution has also facilitated the creation of new kinds of ecommerce brands that are built on the technology. In recent years, for instance, ecommerce companies based on a subscription model—like Blue Apron and BarkBox—<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/using-analytics-and-ai-subscription-e-commerce-has-personalized-marketing-all-boxed-up/">have grown over 1,000%</a>. Direct-to-consumer subscription brands like these often harness AI and advanced analytics to provide their customers with personalized product selections.</p>



 Trend: Augmented reality 



<p>With the advancement of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, brands are increasingly able to enhance digital experiences and weave digital touchpoints into traditional buying channels. For purchases that are heavily dependent on environmental context—e.g., a new living room couch—consumers can reduce uncertainty and the likelihood of returning a product by “trying it out” in their living room. Particularly in markets like travel, hospitality, and consumer retail, AR and VR have the potential to enhance customer experiences by giving them the best possible preview of a product before they buy.</p>



 Enhanced product visualizations 



<p>One of the primary benefits of integrating AR and VR into ecommerce is the ability to provide customers with a lifelike and immersive preview of a product. This function can be useful in industries where consumers make large and contextually sensitive purchases. In the real estate industry, <a href="https://nyti.ms/2kbYAo9">several firms have experimented</a> with technologies that allow customers to view properties remotely. In recent years, IKEA has <a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/innovation/ikea-launches-ikea-place-a-new-app-that-allows-people-to-virtually-place-furniture-in-their-home-170912/">started a successful AR mobile app</a> that allows customers to view the furniture retailer’s goods in their own homes.</p>



 Virtual try on experiences 



<p>Virtual try on experiences, when designed properly, have the potential to transform the fashion and beauty industries. With this technology, customers can use their smartphones or webcams to remotely try on clothing, accessories, or makeup. For example, several optical retailers allow consumers to digitally “try on” a pair of glasses. And Sephora has been massively successful with an <a href="https://medium.com/marketing-in-the-age-of-digital/how-augmented-reality-lets-sephora-try-on-something-different-23b4446fd5c1">app that renders makeup selections</a> on a user’s face in real-time.</p>



 Trend: Live commerce 



<p>Live commerce originated in China. Just six years after it emerged in 2016, the industry was projected to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/business/live-shopping-us.html">bring in USD 647 billion in the country</a>. In the United States, the market is still emerging, bringing in a forecasted USD 32 billion as of 2023. </p>



<p>During live commerce events, customers can interact with a host over a live-stream as they purchase products—often by using digital wallets—in real-time. The sales tactic, which started with the Chinese social media network Alibaba, has been adopted by businesses like TikTok, Amazon, and the clothing resale platform Poshmark. During shopping events, influencers or celebrities might offer specific products, encouraging consumers to discuss the item and eventual sale over a chat client. Using live commerce, businesses can highlight markdowns or promotions, encouraging a sense of camaraderie around a specific event.</p>



 Trend: Online-to-offline ecommerce 



<p>Online-to-offline (O2O) ecommerce refers to a wide variety of ecommerce experiences that seamlessly integrate digital channels with physical retail experiences, thus creating a holistic customer journey spanning both online and offline touchpoints. And while it might initially sound counterintuitive, getting customers back to shopping in-store has become a major imperative for <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/five-trends-shaping-the-future-of-e-commerce-in-china/">some ecommerce retailers</a>. Offering select experiences in physical locations can engender customer loyalty and uncover new target markets.</p>



<p>In one high-profile example, Amazon purchased Whole Foods and integrated in-store grocery shopping with the ecommerce giant’s digital ecosystem. But a host of other businesses, from the massive social media company Alibaba in China to the small direct-to-consumer furniture brand Magnolia Market, have also opened physical locations based on their ecommerce stores.</p>



<p>Some examples of online-to-offline ecommerce initiatives include:</p>



 
 Omnichannel shopping experiences where a customer orders a product online and picks it up in a store 



 Physical showrooms for furniture that will be ordered online and delivered to a customer’s home 



 QR codes or other bar codes that can be scanned in-store to learn more about a product online 
 



 Trend: Social commerce&nbsp; 



<p>Social commerce, a form of ecommerce in which a social media platform serves as both a marketing channel and a shopping destination, is expected to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/e-commerce-at-the-center-of-profitable-growth-in-consumer-goods">grow by more than 50%</a> between 2021 and 2025. Like live commerce, it often takes the form of a mobile shopping experience, and is a leading ecommerce trend that is expected to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2022/01/27/social-commerce-is-a-12-trillion-opportunity-and-the-next-global-shopping-revolution/?sh=6734885c1d98">generate USD 1.2 trillion globally by 2025.</a></p>



<p>Using this approach, organizations can use social media’s reach to facilitate product discovery, encourage social purchasing decisions, and foster customer engagement. Several platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, have built social commerce into their platforms to facilitate the process. </p>



<p>Seamless shopping experiences through a social media channel capitalize on existing social behaviors and streamline the path to purchase, increasing conversion rates. Using social recommendation and discovery processes, customers can find the most relevant products. Often, brands that use social commerce will partner with influencers or engage with user-generated content to connect with their audience. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-clinique-uses-tiktok-to-appeal-to-younger-skincare-shoppers-2021-8">Brands like Clinique</a> have successfully engaged new and younger markets through a combination of savvy social media marketing and social commerce.</p>



 Trend: Voice assistants&nbsp; 



<p>Voice assistants integrate voice-enabled technologies, such as smart speakers, to facilitate the shopping process and streamline interactions between consumers and online retailers. This approach uses AI to enable users to search for products and place orders through various payment methods. Users can track shipments and select to receive custom recommendations using voice commands.</p>



<p>In addition to fostering an inclusive shopping experience for those who might have difficulty navigating traditional interfaces, voice search-assisted ecommerce provides a convenient and hands-free experience for online shoppers who might be multitasking. The intuitive nature of ordering by voice can be useful for businesses selling grocery staples or home goods. Though businesses are increasingly developing voice search-friendly product descriptions and creating their own back-end voice assistant products, the trend has been growing for several years. For example, since 2017 Dominos has operated its own app for mobile devices through which customers can quickly order a pizza.</p>



 The future of ecommerce 



<p>Given the rate at which ecommerce is expanding globally, new digital commerce forms are appearing at a rapid clip. In leading-edge countries like China, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/ecommerce-sales-china-global-growth/">which accounts for more than half of all digital retail sales</a> worldwide, new ecommerce trends like social commerce and live commerce have developed at a shocking rate. Over a period of less than five years, live commerce in China grew from an emerging innovation to a channel through which two-thirds of consumers in the country <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">bought a product in the course of a year</a>.</p>



<p>For most organizations, it’s no longer enough to list items from a brick-and-mortar store on an ecommerce platform or merely allow integrations with PayPal. According to the IBM Institute for Business Value, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ai-retail">just 14% of 20,000 consumers recently surveyed</a> across 26 countries were satisfied with online shopping. There’s much room for innovation to provide a delightful <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-experience">ecommerce experience.</a></p>

<p>In the tech world and beyond, new 5G applications are being discovered every day. From driverless cars to smarter cities, farms, and even shopping experiences, the latest standard in wireless networks is poised to transform the way we interact with information, devices and each other. What better time to take a closer look at how humans are putting 5G to use to transform their world.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G (fifth-generation mobile technology)</a> is the newest standard for cellular networks. Like its predecessors, 3G, 4G and 4G LTE, 5G technology uses radio waves for data transmission. However, due to significant improvements in latency, throughput and bandwidth, 5G is capable of much faster download and upload speeds than previous networks.</p>



 How is 5G different from other wireless networks? 



<p>Since its release in 2019, 5G broadband technology has been hailed as a breakthrough technology with big implications for both consumers and businesses. Primarily, this is due to its ability to handle large volumes of data generated by complex devices using its networks.</p>



<p>As mobile technology has expanded over the years, the amount of data users generate every day has increased exponentially. Currently, other transformational technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI),</a> the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT</a>) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20(ML)%20is%20a,learn%2C%20gradually%20improving%20its%20accuracy.">machine learning (ML)</a> require much faster speeds to function than 3G and 4G networks offer. Enter 5G, with its lightning-fast data transfer capabilities that allow newer technologies to function in the way they were designed to.</p>



<p>Here are some of the biggest differences between 5G and previous wireless networks.</p>



 
 Physical footprint: The transmitters used in 5G technology are smaller than in predecessors’ networks, allowing for discrete placement in out-of-the-way places. Furthermore, “cells”—geographical areas that all wireless networks require for connectivity—in 5G networks are smaller and require less power to run than in previous generations. 



 Error rates: 5G’s adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), a schematic that WiFi devices use to transmit data, is more powerful than ones in 3G and 4G networks. This makes 5G’s Block Error Rate (BER)—a metric of error frequency—much lower. 



 Bandwidth: By utilizing a broader spectrum of radio frequencies than previous wireless networks, 5G networks can transmit on a much wider range of bandwidths. This increases the number of devices they can support at any given time. 



 Lower latency: 5G’s low <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/latency">latency</a>, a measurement of the time it takes data to travel from one location to another, is a significant upgrade over previous generations. This means routine activities like downloading a file or working in the cloud is going to be much faster with a 5G connection than a connection on a different network. 
 



 How does 5G work? 



<p>Like all wireless networks, 5G networks are separated into geographical areas known as cells. Within each cell, wireless devices—such as smartphones, PCs and IoT devices—connect to the internet via radio waves transmitted between an antenna and a base station. The technology that underpins 5G is essentially the same as in 3G and 4G networks, but due to its lower latency, 5G networks are capable of delivering much faster download speeds—in some cases as high as 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).</p>



<p>As more and more devices are built for 5G speeds, demand for 5G connectivity is growing. Today, many popular Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as Verizon, Google and AT&amp;T, offer 5G networks to homes and businesses. According to Statista, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">more than 200 million homes</a> and businesses have already purchased it with that number expected to at least double by 2028 (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at three areas of technological improvement that have made 5G so unique.</p>



 New telecom specifications 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks defines a new radio access technology (RAT) specification for all 5G mobile networks. The 5G rollout began in 2018 with a global initiative known as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3FPP) that defined a new set of standards to steer the design of devices and applications for use on 5G networks.</p>



<p>The initiative was a success, and 5G networks began to grow swiftly in the ensuing years. Today, 45% of networks worldwide are 5G compatible, with that number forecasted to rise to 85% by the end of the decade according to <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/network-coverage#:~:text=The%20build%2Dout%20of%205G,around%2085%20percent%20in%202029.">a recent report by&nbsp;Ericsson</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



 Independent virtual networks (network slicing) 



<p>On 5G networks, network operators can offer multiple independent virtual networks (in addition to public ones) on the same infrastructure. Unlike previous wireless networks, this new capability allows users to do more things remotely with greater security than ever before. For example, on a 5G network, enterprises can create use cases or business models and assign them their own independent virtual network, dramatically improving the user experience for their employees by adding greater customizability and security.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>In addition to network slicing, creating a 5G private network can also enhance personalization and security features over those available on previous generations of wireless networks. Global businesses seeking more control and mobility for their employees increasingly turn to private 5G network architectures rather than public networks they’ve used in the past.</p>



 5G use cases 



<p>Now that we better understand how 5G technology works, let’s take a closer look at some of the exciting applications it’s enabling.</p>



 Autonomous vehicles 



<p>From taxi cabs to drones and beyond, 5G technology underpins most of the next-generation capabilities in autonomous vehicles. Until the 5G cellular standard came along, fully autonomous vehicles were a bit of a pipe dream due to the data transmission limitations of 3G and 4G technology. Now, 5G’s lightning-fast connection speeds have made transport systems for cars, trains and more much faster than previous generations, transforming the way systems and devices connect, communicate and collaborate.</p>



 Smart factories 



<p>5G, along with AI and ML, is poised to help factories become not only smarter but more automated, efficient and resilient. Today, many mundane but necessary tasks associated with equipment repair and optimization are being turned over to machines thanks to 5G connectivity paired with AI and ML capabilities. This is one area where 5G is expected to be highly disruptive, impacting everything from fuel economy to the design of equipment lifecycles and how goods arrive at our homes.</p>



<p>For example, on a busy factory floor, drones and cameras connected to smart devices utilizing the IoT can help locate and transport something more efficiently than in the past and prevent theft. Not only is this better for the environment and consumers, but it also frees up employees to dedicate their time and energy to tasks that are more suited to their skill sets.</p>



 Smart cities 



<p>The idea of a hyper-connected urban environment that uses 5G network speeds to spur innovation in areas like law enforcement, waste disposal and disaster mitigation is fast becoming a reality. Some cities already use 5G-enabled sensors to track traffic patterns in real time and adjust signals, helping guide the flow of traffic, minimize congestion and improve air quality.</p>



<p>In another example, 5G power grids monitor supply and demand across heavily populated areas and deploy AI and ML applications to “learn” what times energy is in high or low demand. This process has been shown to significantly impact energy conservation and waste, potentially reducing carbon emissions and helping cities reach sustainability goals.</p>



 Smart healthcare 



<p>Hospitals, doctors and the healthcare industry as a whole already benefit from the speed and reliability of 5G networks every day. One example is the area of remote surgery that uses robotics and a high-definition live stream connected to the internet via a 5G network. Another is the field of mobile health, where 5G gives medical workers in the field quick access to patient data and medical history, enabling them to make smarter decisions, faster, and potentially save lives.</p>



<p>Lastly, as we saw during the pandemic, contact tracing and the mapping of outbreaks are critical to keeping populations safe. 5G’s ability to deliver of volumes of data swiftly and securely allows experts to make more informed decisions that have ramifications for everyone.</p>



 Better employee experiences 



<p>5G paired with new technological capabilities won’t just result in the automation of employee tasks, it will dramatically improve them and the overall <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-experience">employee experience</a>. Take virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), for example. VR (digital environments that shut out the real world) and AR (digital content that augments the real world) are already used by stockroom employees, transportation drivers and many others. These employees rely on wearables connected to a 5G network capable of high-speed data transfer rates that improve several key capabilities, including the following:</p>



 
 Live views: 5G connectivity provides live, real-time views of equipment, events and even people. One way in which this feature is being used in professional sports is to allow broadcasters to remotely call a sporting event from outside the stadium where the event is taking place. 



 Digital overlays: IoT applications in a warehouse or industrial setting allow workers equipped with smart glasses (or even just a smartphone) to obtain real-time insights from an application, including repair instructions or the name and location of a spare part. 



 Drone inspections: Right now, one of the leading causes of employee injury is inspection of equipment or project sites in remote and potentially dangerous areas. Drones, connected via 5G networks, can safely monitor equipment and project sites and even take readings from hard-to-reach gauges. 
 



 Edge computing 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge c</a>omputing, a computing framework that allows computations to be done closer to data sources, is fast becoming the standard for enterprises. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">this Gartner white paper</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge (compared to only 10% today). This shift saves businesses time and money and enables better control over large volumes of data. It would be impossible without the new speed standards generated by 5G technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultra-reliable edge computing and 5G enable the enterprise to achieve faster transmission speeds, increased control and greater security over massive volumes of data. Together, these twin technologies will help reduce latency while increasing speed, reliability and bandwidth, resulting in faster, more comprehensive data analysis and insights for businesses everywhere.</p>



 5G solutions with IBM Cloud Satellite 



<p>5G presents big opportunities for the enterprise, but first, you need a platform that can handle its speed. IBM Cloud Satellite lets you deploy and run apps consistently across on-premises, edge computing and public cloud environments on a 5G network. And it’s all enabled by secure and auditable communications within the IBM Cloud.</p>

<p>Over 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are dealing with increased fraud and financial crime, putting more pressure on banks to choose between friction and security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quick overview: Conventional KYC methods are becoming obsolete. These outdated approaches demand time-consuming, manual processes that are inefficient for banks and tedious for customers. But the new era of KYC is here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials: Reusable credentials are a revolutionary verification solution where the customer only has to verify themselves once. This cutting-edge technology removes friction from operations and fortifies every touchpoint (in the branch, app, contact center, etc.), ensuring heightened security. With reusable credentials, banks can:</p>



 
 Stop fraud by reducing weak security points 



 Take the pressure off your employee&nbsp; and prevent human error 



 Create a better customer experience with seamless processes at every touch point. 
 



<p>Why this matters: This is the next step in identity verification. There is now a way to have less friction without having to sacrifice security through reusable credentials.<br></p>



<p><a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">👀 See how reusable credentials are reshaping bank operations in our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.”</a>&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The big picture: Humans are human, which means we can make mistakes or be taken advantage of by social engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/state-of-vishing-report/#:~:text=Social%2DEngineer%27s%202023%20State%20of,%2C%20network%2C%20or%20financial%20breach.">State of Vishing Report</a> found a 10% increase in compromises when the fraudulent caller was a female as opposed to a male caller. Reusable credentials instantly take care of this problem. Your customer will have a hyper-secure, encrypted credential that your employee will request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No guesswork is involved. Your customers and employees know that the account is secure.</p>



 Dive Deeper 



 Why the Traditional KYC Methods Are Not Working 



<p></p>



<p></p>



 The Achilles’ heel of current KYC processes is its temporary nature. 



<p>Once the initial identity verification occurs during account opening, it becomes a one-time, non-reusable process. This leaves day-to-day interactions vulnerable, forcing employees to repeatedly verify customer information through methods susceptible to exploitation, such as:</p>



 
 Security questions 



 Teller judgments on IDs 



 SMS verifications 



 Over-the-phone verification. 
 



<p>Using reusable credentials allows customers to be seamlessly verified at every touch point. No reverification. No room for fraud. Only a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Stop Fraud with Reusable Credentials 



<p>In the continual battle against fraud, where every weak link in security can lead to losses, reusable credentials fortify FIs. Traditional KYC methods are vulnerable to social engineering and create an environment where fraud can thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A FI employee <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/19at82r/call_center_loses_1500_in_provisional_credit_to_a/">shared their story</a> showcasing that humans are unfortunately susceptible to social engineering: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[A] member is claiming he attempted a deposit of $2,900 over the long weekend that was not processed … I thought it was a no-brainer. [The] account was [less than] 45 days old, and aside from the initial $10 deposit to open the account there was no other activity. There’s no way a supervisor would agree to PRCR. And yet, when the ticket came in, there was a comment that the Call Center’s director approved a PRCR of $1,500 “so the member can pay his bills.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sure enough, within an hour, the member pulled $800 out at another ATM. A few hours later, another $200. The next day, about a dozen or so $10 withdrawals from Cash App, and finally another ATM [withdrawal] of $330. [The] account now has less than $15.</p>



<p>Any odds on us seeing this $1,500 coming back to us? [The] call center rep feels bad because she is “normally a really good judge of character.”</p>



<p></p>



<p>The problem: Weak points of traditional security measures. Security questions, often easy targets for social engineering, can be guessed or manipulated. Bank tellers, despite their expertise, may struggle to differentiate between authentic and forged IDs. SMS-based verifications, a common practice, can expose customers to phishing attacks.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The solution: Embracing reusable credentials that close vulnerabilities for identity verification. By adopting an approach similar to the success of TSA Precheck in travel, banks can usher in a new era of fraud resistance. They provide a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding, making fraud attempts nearly impossible.</p>



<p>Fraud prevention is not just a reactive measure; it’s a company-wide initiative. Reusable credentials significantly reduce the workload associated with fraud-related projects, allowing financial institutions to reallocate resources.</p>

 Take the Pressure Off Your Employees 



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience.</a></p>



<p>The heartbeat of any financial institution is its dedicated workforce, tirelessly navigating the delicate balance between service and security. Traditional KYC and identity verification require manual processes and diverse verification methods that put immense pressure on employees to stop fraud while providing a great customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reusable credentials revolutionize this situation by offering a streamlined solution that alleviates the pressure on bank employees. Employees are freed from repeatedly needing to validate customer information with a one-time, thorough verification during onboarding. This shift enhances operations and empowers employees to focus on delivering excellent customer experience.</p>

 FAQ: Reusable Credentials and Decentralized Identity&nbsp; 



What is the reusable credentials process?




 
 The First Identity Verification A decentralized identity (DI) system verifies a customer’s identity during account creation using robust authentication methods. 
 







 
 Creation of Reusable Credentials: Once the identity is verified, the DI system generates a reusable credential. These credentials are encrypted, making them tamper-proof and incredibly secure. 
 







 
 Customer-Controlled Data: Unlike conventional identity systems where the FIs oversee and store user data, decentralized identity transfers this to the customer. For banks, this translates to customers possessing their credentials securely stored on their devices, offering the convenience of storing and presenting credentials directly within your banking app and interfaces. 
 







 
 Persistent Verification: Reusable credentials stop the need for repetitive verification processes. Whether logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, customers simply present their reusable credentials as irrefutable proof of identity. 
 




What are the benefits for banks to use reusable credentials?
 
 Enhanced Security: Reusable credentials reduce reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud, replacing security questions susceptible to social engineering or SMS-based verifications vulnerable to phishing. 
 



 
 Frictionless Customer Experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for bank customers to enjoy continuous and secure interactions across various touchpoints. 
 




How can banks use reusable credentials to prevent fraud?
 
 The Highest Level of Security: Reusable credentials use advanced cryptographic techniques to make information tamper-proof and nearly eliminate the risk of fraud. 
 



 
 Absolute Proof of Identity: Once a customer’s identity is verified and turned into a reusable credential, it becomes irrefutable proof of their identity, minimizing the risk of social engineering or phishing. 
 



 
 Strengthen Security Points: Reusable credentials limit places where fraudulent activities can occur, minimizing potential attack points found in traditional verification methods. 
 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance, including:</p>



 
 Healthcare 



 Government services 



 Education 



 Farming 



 Mining 



 Travel and hospitality 



 Retail and e-commerce 



 Human resources and employment 
 




<p></p>



<p>Although widespread adoption is still evolving, various pilot programs and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving challenges and improving user experiences across industries.</p>

<p>In a warming world, the transition from fossil fuels to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> is heating up. Global capacity for renewable power generation is expanding more quickly than at any time in the last thirty years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28">The agency predicts</a> that by 2025, renewable energy will surpass coal to become the world’s top source of electricity. Wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation are forecast to exceed nuclear power generation in 2025 and 2026, respectively. And by 2028, <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">68 countries</a> will boast renewables as their main source of power.</p>



<p>The acceleration in clean, renewable energy power generation comes not a moment too soon for policymakers and advocates concerned with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a> caused by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p>



 Policies driving development 



<p>At 2023’s United Nation’s Climate Change Conference (COP28), governments set a goal to triple global renewables power capacity by 2030. This will ideally help advance <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">decarbonization</a>, mitigate climate change and achieve <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/net-zero">net-zero</a> emissions, <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/massive-expansion-of-renewable-power-opens-door-to-achieving-global-tripling-goal-set-at-cop28">according to the IEA</a>.</p>



<p>To develop renewable energy technology, governments are turning to various public policy measures. The European Union’s Green Deal Industrial Plan, India’s Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the US are all policies designed to further stimulate the integration of sustainable energy. Supportive economic policies in China have accelerated onshore wind and solar photovoltaic energy projects there, helping the country surpass national 2030 targets years ahead of schedule. (This is crucial to the goal of tripling worldwide renewables as China accounts for almost 60% of all new global renewable energy capacity <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">expected to come online by 2028</a>.) In addition, evolving regulations on corporate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/esg-reporting">environmental, social and governance (ESG)</a> initiatives around the world are increasing demand for renewable energy in the private sector, encouraging further growth.</p>



 Renewable energy growth by type 



<p>Broad policy measures notwithstanding, policy support often varies depending on the type of renewable energy in question. Let’s take a closer look at several types of renewable energy resources and the trends taking shape in each category.</p>



 Solar power 



<p>In 2023, solar photovoltaic energy made up three-quarters of renewable capacity additions around the world, according to the IEA. Capacity growth stemmed from both utility-scale plants and consumer adoption of distributed PV systems—on-site solar power generation at homes and businesses—<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">accounted for the other half</a>.</p>



<p>Continued policy support from governments around the world remains the primary driver of this growth. For example, some policymakers incentivize renewable power generation by individuals and businesses through net-metering programs that allow utility customers to send excess energy generated back to their utilities for credits. Other incentives encouraging the production and use of solar power include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">feed-in-tariffs</a>, tax credits and auctions in which solar power providers compete on energy market price to win contracts.</p>



<p>The expansion of the solar PV supply chain is enabling the manufacturing necessary to meet the demands of the growing industry. More manufacturing capacity in the US, India and the EU is expected to help diversify the solar PV supply chain, but China continues to dominate the space. (The country was home to <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/solar-pv">95% of new solar technology manufacturing facilities in 2022</a>.) And advancements in solar photovoltaic technology are producing <a href="https://metropolismag.com/viewpoints/the-next-generation-of-solar-energy/">lighter, less expensive, more efficient solar panels</a> that will continue to increase generation capacity over time.</p>



<p>Based on the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE), if current growth rates are maintained through 2030, solar PV is “on track” to meet annual generation capacity of approximately 8,300 terawatt hours (TWh) <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">by the end of the decade</a>. In addition, solar PV is expected to be the dominant source of energy in the production of low-emissions or green hydrogen. Low-emissions hydrogen (in contrast to hydrogen produced with fossil fuel power) can potentially drive <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-wind-energy-can-help-clean-hydrogen-contribute-zero-carbon-future">greater decarbonization efforts</a> in businesses ranging from steelmaking to ammonia production, where hydrogen is used for industrial purposes.</p>



 Wind power 



<p>As with solar power, public policies have been key to driving wind energy expansion, but growth projections vary by region. China saw a 66% increase in wind power capacity in 2023 and is on track for more additions in the coming years. Project development, however, has been slower than initially expected in Europe and North America. Offshore wind projects have been especially vulnerable: In 2023, in the US and UK alone, developers <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/wind">canceled offshore projects</a> with total capacity of 15 gigawatts (GW).</p>



<p>Recent public policies may help support the industry during this challenging period. In 2023, the European Union announced its Wind Power Action Plan, with measures to improve permitting, auction processes and financing access as well as <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">expand workforce training</a>. In the same year, nine European countries announced plans to increase offshore wind power capacity to over 120 GW by 2030 and over <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot">300 GW by 2050</a>. Meanwhile, in the US, the government is investing in the development of floating wind farms. The deployment of floating wind farms with a capacity of 15 GW is <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/wind">expected by 2035</a>.</p>



<p>For wind power to meet the goals of the IEA’s NZE, average annual growth would need to <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">reach or surpass 17% per year until 2030</a>.</p>



 Hydropower 



<p>Currently, hydropower generates more power—reaching 4,300 TWh in 2022— than all other clean energy sources combined and will remain the largest source through 2030, according to the IEA. Despite small but steady growth and proven reliability, new hydropower additions are forecast to <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">decrease 23%</a> over the next decade due to development slowdowns in Europe, China and Latin America.</p>



<p>Over the past 20 years, energy industry focus has shifted from hydropower, with most countries focusing policies and incentives on expanding solar and wind power. Today, <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/renewables/hydroelectricity">less than 30 countries</a> offer policies to support new hydropower development and refurbishment of existing plants versus over 100 countries with policies to support wind and solar PV.</p>



<p>To meet the NZE Scenario, hydropower would need to grow at an annual rate of <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">at least 4%</a>.</p>



 Biofuel 



<p>Global biofuel expansion is underway, thanks largely to supportive government policies in emerging economies such as Brazil, India and Indonesia. Demand is largely driven by the transportation sector in those countries, while supply is enabled by the availability of biomass feedstock. Brazil leads the way in biofuel expansion, accounting for a projected <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">40% of growth by 2028</a>.</p>



<p>Biofuel expansion is more limited in the EU, US, Canada and Japan due in part to high costs and the growing popularity of electric vehicles. The main areas of growth for biofuels in these countries are the renewable diesel and biojet fuel segments. Overall, biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel, in combination with electric vehicles (EVs), have the potential to offset the oil equivalent of four million barrels by 2028. Such milestones notwithstanding, the <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">IEA predicts</a> that biofuel expansion will still fall short of 2030 NZE goals.</p>



<p>Biogas: While the growth of the biogas industry began in the 1990s, the last two years have seen an increase in policy support for the natural gas alternative. Currently, almost half of all global biogas production comes from Europe, with <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/96d66a8b-d502-476b-ba94-54ffda84cf72/Renewables_2023.pdf">20% of that from Germany alone</a>.</p>



<p>Historically, biogas has been used at heat and power plants. More recently, however, governments have encouraged industrial and transportation uses for biomethane, a biogas which, as its name suggests, contains a substantial concentration of methane. With 13 countries implementing strong new policies supporting biogas since 2022, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems">the IEA projects</a> that biogas production growth will accelerate through 2028.</p>



 Geothermal energy 



<p>Technological developments are creating opportunities to bring geothermal energy to more places. For example, through Enhanced Geothermal Energy Systems, fluid is injected underground in areas without naturally occurring hot water sources. The fluid heats up underground and then is pumped to the surface, <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/deebef5d-0c34-4539-9d0c-10b13d840027/NetZeroby2050-ARoadmapfortheGlobalEnergySector_CORR.pdf">where it generates electricity</a>. Various geothermal projects are planned or underway around the word, including in North America, Europe and Asia.</p>



<p>Such advancements notwithstanding, advocates for geothermal energy say policies are needed to take advantage of its untapped potential. The capital-intensive nature and financing costs of geothermal projects can be prohibitive. The evolution of economies of scale and continued technological advancements could help drive down costs, but for now, the IEA forecasts that only about 1% of renewable energy will be sourced from geothermal energy production by 2030.23</p>



 Technology to support evolving renewable energy 



<p>As more renewable energy is added to energy systems, technology will play a crucial role in keeping the energy supply flowing while ensuring energy security and the stability of power grids.</p>



<p>Because renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar, are vulnerable to environmental conditions, ensuring optimal production and distribution is crucial to providing a stable, resilient power supply. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/projects/renewables-forecasting">Renewables forecasting</a> is rapidly becoming an important tool in the energy transition. For example, solutions such as the IBM Renewables Forecasting Platform within the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite </a>can provide <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/V3PG5DNY">day-ahead wind and solar forecasts with 92% accuracy</a>.</p>



<p>Better storage will also help make power systems more resilient. Solar, wind and hydropower all require energy storage systems (ESS) to provide a consistent energy supply. As grid-scale battery technology evolves, utility companies will be able to store electricity long-term to better manage load during periods of low- or non-production. For instance, flow batteries are a low-cost and scalable form of long-term grid-scale energy storage currently being developed.</p>



<p>From batteries to solar arrays, effective asset management is an important component in supporting a clean energy transition; intelligent asset management and predictive maintenance can monitor asset health and prolong its lifespan. For instance, the New York Power Authority (NYPA) is streamlining its asset management with the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo® Application Suite</a>. The goal is to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/new-york-power-authority">digitalize the state’s energy infrastructure</a> and transform it into a clean, reliable, resilient and affordable system over the next decade.</p>

				  Together, Indicio and SITA are changing how we travel —&nbsp;and in doing so, how we can share and trust data to make the world a better place.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>I’m proud to announce that Indicio’s partnership with SITA is deepening with a <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">new and important investment</a> in our company.</p>
<p>Both companies have been on an transformative journey for the past four years: making seamless travel a reality. We have developed new solutions to the challenge of digitizing identity documents; we have set new standards for biometrics, data privacy and protection; we have won some of the most prestigious awards in the digital identity space; and, most of all, we solved one of the most challenging trust problems in the world: how to pre-clear passengers for immigration ahead of their arrival and get them across borders in seconds.</p>
<p>In delivering the world’s first implementation of a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) following ICAO standards, in Aruba in March 2023, we drew a map of the future. It’s a seamless world, where verifiable identity and data makes interacting with each other smoother, faster, and more secure — because we now have genuine confidence that identity and data can be trusted.</p>
<p>For airports and airlines and governments, that future is here, it’s happening right now; we’re implementing it. That is why our partnership with SITA is so exciting. It means global reach at the start of a new era. For travelers, it’s the end of rushing to wait. We’re freeing data to do what it can do when it’s trusted: Speed everything up, make everything simple.</p>
<p>But the technology we developed for the DTC is transformational for every industry, business operation, and service where identity and data need to be authenticated and trusted and where paper-based processes and traditional digital approaches are getting in the way of making things simple, efficient, and fast.</p>
<p>Because we’ve created the most powerful form of digital identity, that power can be used in so many innovative ways, big and small, to create better processes, products, and customer experiences. And because our solutions work on any system, we have an organic way to integrate identity and data across all sectors, creating spectacular new opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Travel is leading the way —&nbsp;but we are delivering exciting use cases from agriculture to AI, education to finance that are not far behind. Innovation in one use case feeds innovation in another. Suddenly, a landscape of borders — not just geographic and national — but sector and vertical, can be easily crossed. The digital world created by the internet is open when you can authenticate and trust. This is what we’re doing. And we’re tremendously excited about this investment because it helps to accelerate our development roadmap to deliver these benefits to all.</p>
<p>Indicio has distinguished itself by making our customers’ ideas become a reality. Our team members are world-class visioneers. So watch this space as we accelerate — and drop us a line if you’d like us to make your vision for a smarter, smoother, safer world real too.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Heather Dahl</p>

 Stakers can claim DF79 rewards. DF80 runs Mar 7 — Mar 14,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 79 (DF79) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 29, 2024 and ended 12:01 am March 7. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF80 is live today, March 7. It concludes on March 14. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF81 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF80   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF80 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>In partnership with Mastercard Open Banking, with services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company, Fannie Mae continues to work toward improving access to affordable housing with secure banking-powered technologies, speeding up the application process for lenders and reducing the need for manual document preparation.</p>



<p>In addition to helping lenders validate assets and assess a borrower’s rent payment history and cash flow, <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-desktop-originator/asset-reports?utm_campaign=pte-sf-duenh-202403&amp;utm_source=vanity&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=awa-van-noa-len-o-n&amp;utm_term=len">Fannie Mae’s Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) validation service</a> gives lenders the power to verify a borrowers’ income and employment information using a single 12-month asset report. This digital enhancement is saving lenders time while enhancing the borrower experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Demand for a better mortgage process&nbsp; 



<p>Traditionally, borrowers have been asked to manually collect and share stacks of sensitive income documents with mortgage loan officers, a time-consuming and less secure process that creates inefficiency for both the borrower and the lender.&nbsp;</p>



 A complete digital verification solution for mortgage lenders&nbsp; 



<p>DU provides a digital option that simplifies and removes friction from the application process. When applying for a mortgage, borrowers can access Finicity’s user-friendly <a href="https://www.finicity.com/connect/">Connect</a> consent flow to link their bank accounts, enabling their data to be easily shared with the lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With one report from Finicity, DU can help lenders validate a borrower’s asset, income and employment information while simultaneously analyzing cash flow and rent payment history to help approve more potential homeowners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the verifications needed to process a mortgage application can be conducted on the spot, without paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fannie Mae’s latest innovation leverages <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS) from Finicity as a leading report supplier to power the verifications needed to process a mortgage application. &nbsp;</p>



 
 Fannie Mae’s Digital Verification Solution requires an asset report of 12 months or more to run 



 Lenders must request that this feature be <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/form/single-source-activation">turned on</a> 
 



<blockquote><p>“With Desktop Underwriter® (DU®), lenders can now get even more benefits from using a single 12-month asset report. We continue to look for ways to help lenders streamline their validation processes and improve the borrower experience, and this latest enhancement helps them do just that.”&nbsp;</p>Peter Skarnulis, Fannie Mae Vice President, Business Account Management Solutions</blockquote>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>In this episode of the SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude, alongside Hakan Yildiz from <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Vladimir Simjanoski from <a href="https://www.blokverse.com/">Blokverse</a>, engage in an insightful examination of the intricate world of digital credential protocols, including Aries, OpenID4VC, ISO, and KERI. This episode is a treasure trove of insights on the future of digital identities, focusing on interoperability, privacy, and combating challenges like deepfakes.</p>
<p>The discussion begins by comparing digital credential exchange protocols and their applicability in varying contexts, from government-issued digital identities to private-sector applications. A highlight is the exploration of the architectural models—server-client vs. peer-to-peer—and their impact on the scalability and privacy of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Privacy considerations take center stage, especially concerning surveillance and data-sharing autonomy. The episode also tackles the critical issue of deepfakes, proposing enhanced content authenticity through digital credentials as a solution.</p>

<p>Startups build ad-hoc IAM systems, a tangled mess of spreadsheets, emails, and memory traces in the brains of the team members. As organizations grow, the tangles grow. Think about it:</p>
 
 When a new hire joins, how easy is it to get them productive? How long does it take until they’ve been given access to everything they need?&nbsp; 
 When it’s time for a compliance audit, do you need to sweat over spreadsheets, check multiple app interfaces, and comb through email chains, hoping you don’t miss something?&nbsp; 
 Is “Shadow IT” growing? When well-meaning employees start using convenient new apps, are they bypassing IT? Or does IT maintain visibility and control without bureaucracy?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Is offboarding easy? When someone leaves, can you quickly cut access to all the apps they used while retaining access to the data they created?&nbsp; 
 
<p>Cheer up! Things will get worse.</p>
<p>As your company grows and your tech stack gets more complex, whatever chaos you had will get worse. Why?</p>
 
 You’re juggling multiple playbooks. One spreadsheet for onboarding, a checklist for audits, a half-remembered process for software requests. 
 Time becomes essential. Onboarding tasks, regular access reviews, or even handling forgotten password resets shouldn’t rely on your memory. 
 Your processes aren’t static. New apps get adopted, rules change, one-off issues reveal cracks in your workflows. Updating your playbooks becomes a time-consuming chore. 
 Your organization changes. New groups appear. Old groups merge. Consultants, temps, and suppliers need access 
 Collaboration is a nightmare. Chasing down other teams to get tasks done, sending reminders, consolidating responses, and hoping they update the results in the right place… it turns your attempted efficiency into another massive time suck. 
 
<p>The YeshID Difference: One Playbook, Total Control</p>
<p>Now imagine this:</p>
 
 Effortless orchestration: A new employee begins, and your centralized YeshID playbook spins into action. Accounts are created, exploiting the best available integrations. For anything without an integration, YeshID creates tasks with clear owners and deadlines. Task reminders? Automatically sent to the right department. You get progress reports, not a growing sense of dread. 
 Compliance is no sweat: Audit looming? YeshID pulls who has access to what and current settings across every supported app, then surveys users and managers to verify who truly needs what access. Reports become accurate and stress-free. 
 Offboarding without the panic: Employee departs, and your playbook cuts off access to integrated apps instantly. It also generates tasks with clear owners for everything else, ensuring no security holes slip through the cracks. 
 A playbook that evolves with you: YeshID is your adaptable IT brain. It leverages your IAM, automates manual steps, sends timely reminders, and handles approvals across teams. Change a process? Update the playbook, and everyone instantly follows the latest version. 
 
<p>Sound too good to be true? Let YeshID be your partner in keeping your identity and access management realm simple, effective, and secure. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Get YeshID Onboard for free</a> and start today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Anonyome Labs team has headed to Washington, D.C., for the biggest credit union advocacy event of the year—the Governmental Affairs Conference, March 3–7, 2024!</p>



<p>If you’re attending the conference in D.C., we invite you to meet with us to learn how to streamline your operations, boost member satisfaction, and stop fraud with the revolutionary verification solution, reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Our sales team will be on hand to explain how reusable credentials are replacing inefficient and risky conventional Know Your Customer (KYC) methods with a frictionless system in which customers only have to verify themselves once.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials leverage ground-breaking decentralized identity and blockchain technology to create a cryptographically protected&nbsp;digital ID that is persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. The same credential ecosystem creates proof of identity for any customer interaction with the credit union.</p>



<p>While planning your visit to D.C. and all of the key sessions and events, why not schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team from Anonyome Labs, where we’ll show you exactly how reusable credentials can work for your institution and, as a bonus, give you access to our new eBook, “Identity Revolution in Banking: Combating Fraud, Enhancing Security.” This valuable tool will be a great resource to take back home to your credit union team for review.</p>



<p>We are excited to also share that on Day 4 of the conference (March 6), you can catch our team during an exclusive interview with Anonyome Labs’ VP of Sales, Matt Ure, on CU Broadcast Hosted by Mike Lawson.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be a sponsor of the first America’s Credit Unions GAC, the massive in-person and online event highlighting the meaningful work credit unions do to improve the financial well-being of their members and communities. This year’s program includes keynotes by former U.K. Prime Minister, The Rt Hon Theresa May MP, and renowned actor-humanitarian Gary Sinise.</p>



<p>Don’t miss this important opportunity to advance the credit union industry with the latest innovations and offerings. &nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll find the team from Anonyome Labs in the industry hall of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center every day of the conference, March 3 to 7. Come say hi!</p>

<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a> is the leader in proactive identity protection technologies. From verifiable credentials to VPNs and encrypted communications, we leverage our cryptography and blockchain technology expertise to take data privacy and security to the next level.

 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/bot-security-market">Future Market Insights</a>, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention 



 Programmatic Ad Fraud Detection 



 Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices. This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers (ATO), has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical.&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.kasada.io/2023-state-of-bot-mitigation/">96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots</a>: Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 



 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/er-tv-may19-whiteops">digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion</a> and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 



 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, <a href="https://doubleverify.com/newsroom/ctv-ad-fraud-surges-with-a-69-increase-in-bot-fraud-in-2022-and-significant-growth-in-ctv-fraud-schemes">leading to inflated video ad impressions</a>. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 <a href="https://artsci.wustl.edu/ampersand/are-bots-winning-war-control-social-media">Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots</a>: This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 <a href="https://cmosurvey.org/">57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022</a>: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies: Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened demand from publishers for accurate user metrics. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Hundreds of keynotes and sessions in six tracks are awaiting you. While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy right?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.</p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

<p>Scotland’s The Herald recently ran an article talking about how technology could be used to genuinely improve health and care services. It <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/24140446.prof-george-crooks-dhi-spearheading-hi-tech-solutions-nhs/">quotes Professor George Crooks</a>, head of Scotland’s Digital and Health Care Innovation Centre, saying it is time for a digital revolution which will empower both patients and free up clinical staff to direct their efforts to where it is most&nbsp;needed.</p><blockquote>It may sound like science fiction, but Prof Crooks foresees a future where citizens are empowered to make decisions through having detailed knowledge of their own health needs, gathered by constant collection of data which flows into the hands of medical professionals digitally.</blockquote><blockquote>The ongoing health needs of individual Scots would be recorded in a data cloud accessible to themselves and those who need it, providing scope for targeted care on a round-the-clock basis.</blockquote><blockquote>Even details such as whether there are pets that need taken care of should someone need to go into hospital would be recorded, along with data which could even predict when care might be needed before a problem manifests in such a way that the health need becomes&nbsp;urgent.</blockquote><blockquote>The success of this programme, and the ethos behind it, is what Prof Crooks would like to see happen NHS Scotland as the digital revolution takes&nbsp;hold.</blockquote><p>Professor Crooks said: “Scotland’s medical model of care, that has served us very well for the past 150 years, is no longer fit for purpose in the 21st Century. We must move away from our existing approach to one where we listen to, activate, and empower our citizens to make better informed health and wellbeing choices supported by resources in their communities.</p><p>“The only way that can happen is through the appropriate use of digital technologies allied to an understanding of the lived experience of people in Scotland, using our expertise to co-design with them, and tailoring services to meet their personal and local circumstances. That’s the crux of the knowledge, skills and experience DHI has acquired over the past 10&nbsp;years.”</p><p>We, Mydex CIC, are proud to say we have been working with DHI over the past eight years to build the personal data infrastructure needed to make such an approach work. This infrastructure is now being used in an increasing number of projects.</p><p>The NHS faces relentless operational, front line and demographic challenges, compounded by increasing financial constraints. For example, the combined financial deficit in Scotland’s NHS Health Boards and Health &amp; Social Care Partnerships now approaching one billion pounds for 2024–2025. Yet service providers in the third, public and independent sectors still have to find a way to deliver the best possible&nbsp;service.</p><p>It’s possible for them to work together on this, to develop a common vision and delivery plan for the future that is inclusive, building human rights and operational efficiencies into how it works. The person centred data infrastructure that is now available helps achieve&nbsp;this.</p><p>Our next blogs explore in detail how this infrastructure works.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-positive-vision-for-health-af66990ca7e9">A Positive Vision for Health</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — February 21st to March&nbsp;4th <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Taiwan’s upcoming digital asset regulations, Russia’s FATF assessment, the US’s legislative push on crypto reporting, and the UK’s steps towards regulating stablecoins and staking services. Join us as we navigate these global shifts in the crypto regulatory landscape.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>Around the globe, countries are revisiting their regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies, marking a period of significant adaptation in response to the digital asset market’s expansion.</p><p>In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is preparing to present new digital asset regulations by September 2024, focusing on investor protection and market integrity. This move is part of Taiwan’s broader effort to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><p>Another major development over the last two weeks came from Russia, as its standing with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has shifted due to perceived gaps in crypto oversight. Reportedly, the FATF’s assessment points to the need for clearer guidelines and definitions within Russia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control digital financial transactions effectively.</p><p>In North America, the United States is witnessing legislative efforts aimed at refining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related services. Recent proposals challenge existing guidance on financial institutions’ reporting of crypto assets and seek to bolster the Secret Service’s capabilities in investigating crypto-related cybercrimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is advancing towards implementing cryptocurrency regulations, with a focus on stablecoins and staking services.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1761086134405255416?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These developments highlight a global trend towards recalibrating regulatory frameworks to better accommodate the unique aspects of digital assets. As countries grapple with the complexities of crypto regulation, the outcomes of these efforts will likely shape the future of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> Taiwan Sets September Deadline for Comprehensive Crypto Regulation <p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission is gearing up to introduce a draft of new digital asset regulations in September 2024, marking a significant step towards regulating the burgeoning digital asset market. The draft, as outlined by FSC Chairman Huang Tien-mu, aims to bolster market regulation and investor safety amidst concerns over the potential for fraud within the digital currency&nbsp;space.</p><p>The proposed legislation, including the Virtual Asset Management Bill introduced in October, seeks to enhance customer protection and industry oversight, imposing stiff penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Speaking of its possible impact on Taiwan’s crypto ecosystem, clearer regulations may attract more institutional investors, fostering a safer and more stable investment environment. On the downside, stringent measures and the potential for heavy fines could dampen innovation, especially among startups and smaller entities struggling with compliance costs.</p> US House Committee Challenges SEC&nbsp;Guidance <p>The US House Financial Services Committee has shown majority support to repeal the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which mandates financial institutions to list customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets. This guidance, criticized for potentially inflating balance sheets and hindering banks from engaging in digital asset custody, faces opposition for its implications on the sector’s operational dynamics.</p><p>Critics argue that SAB 121 limits traditional financial institutions’ participation in the burgeoning crypto market, especially in the context of the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, predominantly custodied by non-bank entities. On the flip side, proponents of the guidance advocate for its role in clarifying custody responsibilities amid the volatile crypto landscape.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

 The Year of Broadening Adoption and Empowering Identities <p>As we navigate through 2024, Ontology embarks on a journey to redefine the landscape of digital identity and blockchain technology. Our roadmap is designed with a clear vision: to catalyze the widespread adoption of Decentralized Identity (DID) and enhance the seamless interaction across blockchain networks, advancing digital assets management technology. This year, we aim to deepen our engagement with the community, lead innovation, and offer unparalleled support to developers and users alike. Our commitment is to not only advance the technological infrastructure of Web3 but also to enrich the user experience and security that underpin the digital economy of the future, emphasizing data sovereignty and identity verification.</p> Providing All-Round Interoperability of Ontology Blockchain <p>As Ontology continues to cement its position as a leading public blockchain, our strategic focus remains steadfast on key application scenarios that include identity, data, and reputation management. This commitment drives our initiatives and innovations, ensuring that our technology not only meets but exceeds the evolving needs of our users and the broader blockchain community.</p> Integration with Goshen&nbsp;Network <p>Ontology is set to enhance its infrastructure significantly by incorporating Goshen Network’s Ethereum layer 2 and Bitcoin EVM layer, a strategic move aimed at providing a seamless interaction across EVM and Bitcoin blockchains. Through this integration, facilitated by the Ontology and Goshen Bridge, users will gain the ability to effortlessly manage and access their assets across diverse blockchain ecosystems. This initiative not only underscores Ontology’s dedication to fostering cross-chain interoperability but also positions Ontology’s Consensus Nodes to actively participate in Goshen’s governance, leveraging its unique mechanism to ensure a fluid, interoperable digital asset experience.</p> Strengthening Blockchain Security <p>In its unwavering commitment to security, Ontology is implementing stringent measures to safeguard its blockchain. This includes the establishment of strict confirming and proving procedures for all wrapped assets across blockchain interfaces, coupled with the introduction of a Slash mechanism. These measures are designed to fortify the Ontology blockchain against malicious threats, thereby providing a secure and trustworthy environment for conducting transactions and managing digital&nbsp;assets.</p> Expansion of ONT&nbsp;Staking <p>Ontology is expanding its staking ecosystem to be more inclusive and accessible through the introduction of the Naming Nodes Program and the launch of the stONT product. This expansion aims to streamline the staking process for both individual users and institutional partners, making it simpler for them to participate as stakers or node operators. By lowering the barriers to entry for ONT staking, Ontology enhances the overall security and participation within its network, fostering a more robust and engaged community.</p> Pushing DID Adoption &amp; Application  Enhancing DID Awareness <p>Ontology is amplifying its efforts to increase decentralized identity awareness by enhancing communication with pivotal DID entities such as DIF, Polygon ID, and Verax, who have joined as co-builders. This initiative aims to extend the reach of DID-related educational content, bringing a broader understanding of decentralized identity solutions across the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Support for ONT ID Integration <p>We are committed to providing comprehensive support across technical, marketing, business, and community aspects for projects integrating ONT ID, alongside our OWN infrastructure for enhanced data exchange and collaboration. Protocols like ONT Login, ONT TAG, and Mercury are made available as open-source tools, enabling seamless integration and fostering innovation within the decentralized identity space, ensuring robust identity verification processes without any additional charges.</p> Improving User Experience <p>The ONTO Wallet is undergoing significant updates to enhance its functionalities for digital assets management. By increasing inclusivity and interoperability with external protocols, such as domain providers, we aim to offer a superior user experience in managing IDs, VCs, and reputation, while also prioritizing data sovereignty. A robust loyalty and referral system is being developed to improve user retention, underlining the value of comprehensive digital identity management across various platforms.</p> ONTO Wallet as a Comprehensive DID&nbsp;Tool <p>The ONTO Wallet is evolving into an all-encompassing DID management tool, allowing users to manage their domains, IDs, VCs, and reputation across different chains and applications. This approach not only simplifies the management of digital identities but also enriches DIDs with additional utility, enabling users to access various task platforms like Galxe and TaskOn for credential management.</p> Enhancements to Orange&nbsp;Protocol <p>Orange Protocol is set to receive substantial updates, including the introduction of the Orange Points mechanism designed to incentivize user engagement and contribution. Integrating more Proof of Humanity (PoH) providers and launching reputation-related campaigns are steps towards activating users’ on-chain reputations and cultivating a more trustable Web3 community.</p> ONT ID Fund for Innovation <p>An ONT ID fund is being established to incentivize actions that optimize and promote the adoption of ONT ID. The fund will support projects based on their brand impact, existing user base, and their strategy for continuous growth, underscoring Ontology’s commitment to supporting innovation within the decentralized identity&nbsp;domain.</p> Building Global Community with Continuous Loyalty&nbsp;System  Global Expansion of Ontology Harbingers <p>Ontology is focused on expanding its Harbingers program worldwide, providing localized support to community members and fostering potential business collaborations. This global network plays a crucial role in growing the Ontology ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of community support and engagement.</p> Engaging Online Community Campaigns <p>Regular online community campaigns, including Weekly Discussion, Community Call, and Web3 Wonderings, are pivotal for keeping the community engaged and informed. These initiatives, hosted across X, Telegram, Discord, and other local social channels, ensure that the latest developments and updates within the Ontology ecosystem are widely shared and discussed.</p> Ontology Loyal Program Incentives <p>Encouraging active participation in the Ontology Loyal Program and related campaigns is a key strategy for building a loyal and engaged community. By offering diverse ways to earn Ontology Loyal NFT Plus and Ontology Collabs NFTs, we aim to reward community members for their contributions and engagement, fostering a sense of belonging and loyalty within the Ontology ecosystem.</p> Stay Connected with&nbsp;Ontology <p>Your insights, feedback, and participation are what drive us forward.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>

<p>The Australian parliament is working on the government’s <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1404&amp;utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">Digital ID Bill 2023</a>. After passing the lower house, the Bill has been considered by a senate committee <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">inquiry</a>, which included hearing a day’s worth of expert testimony.&nbsp; The committee’s report has now been <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023/Report?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">tabled</a>.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the senate approve the Bill, but as usual, a number of opposition politicians wrote dissenting reports.</p>
<p>Two sorts of objections are worth correcting because they reflect serious misunderstandings of the Digital ID Bill and of the whole field of digital identity.</p>
 The Digital ID Bill has no new ID 
<p>The Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report at paragraph 1.16 alleges:</p>
<p>“It seems that [the government] has decided on a more syndicated model that centralises Digital ID in government hands, disregarding the Murray Review’s warnings. By departing from a truly federated approach to Digital ID, Labor is risking the integrity of the entire premise of such a framework.”</p>
<p>I will come back to the Murray Review shortly. For now, I only want to stress that the Digital ID Bill is not a “syndicated” model of digital identities. It is not any sort of model of digital identity.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill introduces no new IDs whatsoever. The whole point of the legislation is to conserve existing IDs and make them more reliable in digital form.</p>
 Federated identity has been tried and tried 
<p>The Coalition Senators are much attached to federated identity. They call out the 2014 <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/c2014-fsi-final-report">Murray Inquiry into the Financial System</a> which recommended a public-private federation of trusted digital identities. And they’re obviously proud of the public sector Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the dissenting report doesn’t mention the private sector trust framework effort.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the government worked on TDIF while the Australian Payments Council took on a parallel financial services trust framework called TrustID. After many years work, the TrustID working group was unable to reach consensus on use cases for banking digital identities, and the framework was quietly dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, more attention should be given to the impasse on TrustID use cases when digital identity is thought to be so urgent. That’s quite a paradox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that federated identity has been tried over and over in Australia, and in comparable economies, and it has <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-will-we-learn-from-the-market-failure-of-digital-identity/">proven to be a market failure</a>. Many commercial Identity Providers have launched in Australia but not one has built a sustainable business. As for TDIF, it’s solitary measure of success is the rush of identity service providers seeking accreditation in anticipation of business expected to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should listen to the market. The idea of free market federated identity provision, reusable across banking and government, has proven plainly not to be viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the government has heeded 15 years of experience of a stagnant digital identity market. With its fresh new Bill, the Australian&nbsp;government has progressed beyond the past idealism of reusable “digital identity”. The <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">Digital ID Bill doesn’t use the term anymore</a>, and instead focuses on digitising the many trusted IDs we already have, so they are more reliable online.</p>

   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has evolved since the 1980s and now requires two out of three options: something you have, are, or know. However, phishing poses a significant threat to MFA's security, emphasizing the need for better options. Biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators offer more secure alternatives. FIDO2 stands out as it includes phishing resistance in i

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been used by computer administrators since at least the 1980s. Regular people started using it in the mid-1990s when banking systems began to roll this out. It was pretty clunky; those key fobs were not small! And since I mentioned MFA as one road to greater security in my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">recent post</a> on passwordless technologies, I thought a quick refresher might be in order.</p>



 Today’s MFA 



<p>MFA looks much different than it did thirty years ago. MFA requires at least two out of these three options:</p>



 
 something you have 



 something you are 



 something you know 
 



<p>In practice, that has taken the form of everything from an SMS message to an iris scanner and more. As it turns out, not all MFA options have stood the test of time when it comes to better security. Depending on what you’re protecting, you might need to get more discerning when it comes to what techniques you use for MFA.</p>



 The Phishing Threat to MFA 



<p>Phishing is the biggest threat to MFA’s ability to solve all the world’s authentication problems. One definition of phishing is:</p>



<p>A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/phishing#">U.S. NIST Glossary</a>)</p>



<p>Phishing is when someone tricks you into clicking on a link that either takes you to or is part of a website that looks a LOT like a legit thing. It will likely pass your username and password on to the actual site and put up a page to collect the code received via SMS or email. At that point, the hacker (or, more to the point, their program) usually has 10-15 minutes to use the username, password, and code to get into the site and do things. Most likely, they’ll change your settings so the account has a different recovery email, a new phone number, and a new password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerks.</p>



 Better Options 



<p>So, what else is there if there are better ideas than an SMS message or, heavens forbid, an email? The answers fall into three categories: biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators. Which one you choose depends on the criticality assigned to what’s being protected.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometrics 



<p>Biometrics cover the “something you are” option of MFA. These can be anything from fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and voice recognition. This was a relatively reliable option, though <a href="https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/biometrics-and-privacy-issues-and-challenges/">accessibility issues</a> are a problem. However, with the age of AI and deep fakes dawning, not all biometric options are equally secure. According to <a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/can-deepfakes-beat-biometric-security/">Cybersecurity Magazine</a>, facial recognition is at the most risk, though voice recognition is not far behind. Fingerprints are better off, but not without their own challenges.</p>



<p>There are ways to make biometric recognition more robust. The evolution of attack and response, however, means attack mitigation is always a moving target.</p>



 App-based Authenticators 



<p>Another option that will fill the “something you have” option is an app-based authenticator. There are several out there, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">Google Authenticator</a>. Many of these apps use something called TOTP. This Time-based One Time Password functionality generates a number that changes, as you might guess from the name, over some (short) period of time. Several password managers (you <a href="https://security.georgetown.edu/csam-2020/benefits-of-password-managers/">use a password manager</a>, right?), like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, include a TOTP code, too. (I admit, I’m not sure about storing my password with my second factor, but that’s just me.)</p>



<p>If you are using a TOTP-based authenticator, then you need to be on top of getting that code out of the app and into the authentication screen. I often delay responding to the MFA challenge if it looks like my authenticator app only has under 10 seconds left for that number.</p>



 FIDO2-based MFA 



<p>Now for the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gold%20standard">gold standard</a> of authenticators: FIDO2! This MFA option puts <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa/">phishing resistance</a> as part of its core design. Go, team!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">FIDO Alliance</a> is the source of the FIDO2 family of specifications, including WebAuthn. FIDO2-compliant authenticators can use dedicated hardware tokens or mobile devices (like your phone). To use that token or the key stored on your mobile device, though, you need a biometric or a PIN. Combined with a traditional password step, this takes us from two-factor authentication (2FA) to multi-factor authentication.</p>



 Passkeys 



<p>If you read my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">last post</a> about passwordless authentication, you may be thinking that FIDO2-based MFA and passkeys sound similar. And, in fact, you would not be wrong! In many cases, you can just use a passkey and have 2FA, which is enough for many situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are not perfect; there are <a href="https://youtu.be/mxGczv1-XlE?si=YBrrRvPRcb-bVXM6">new threat models</a> that implementors need to consider before they roll out support for passkeys willy-nilly. However, they are still arguably better than passwords.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>I believe some form of MFA is better than none. That said, I also worry that it lulls people into a false sense of security. How risky is it for you personally if your account is hacked? How risky is it for your organization if your systems are compromised? What data will be exposed? If you don’t have time to understand those gory details, the only real option is to require a stronger form of MFA so you don’t have to worry about that. There are always plenty of other things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are an end-user, you may not have a choice of the quality of the MFA you get to use. In that case, something is better than nothing! If you work for a company with an IT department and the need for people to log in remotely (including your customers), then you really need to make MFA a priority. And when you do, make sure you do it properly with a phishing-resistant option.</p>

 Breaking Down Barriers: Integrated Wallets for Tokenized Securities 
 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Navigating the complexities of blockchain wallets has been a significant hurdle for traditional investors. The wallet barrier not only discourages investors from embracing digital securities but also presents compliance constraints, in some jurisdictions, for issuers who provide custodian wallet options.</p>
<p>To achieve critical mass, we must simplify the experience for end users by hiding these complexities. Integrated wallets are specifically designed to do that, especially the non-custodial ones.</p>
<p>What are integrated wallets?</p>
<p>Integrated wallets are digital wallets that are seamlessly embedded into a tokenization platform. It provides multiple benefits as listed below:</p>
 
 Hassle-free experience:&nbsp;Automatic creation of wallets, providing a seamless experience for non-blockchain investors. 
 Easy for traditional investors:&nbsp;Web banking-like transaction confirmation processes using passwords or biometric authentication. 
 All-in-one platform:&nbsp;No external navigation is needed, everything is integrated within the platform. 
 Flexible wallet support:&nbsp;Issuers can seamlessly support integrated custodial or non-custodial wallets, as we expand our integration with all wallet providers. 
 
<p>How does an integrated wallet work?</p>
<p>Onboarded investors effortlessly claim their automatically issued integrated wallet by creating a security key (e.g., biometric authentication) following simple instructions. Confirming operations and transactions becomes seamless through their security key (e.g., Touch ID).</p>

 The Future of Personal AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-personal-ai" title="Direct link to The Future of Personal AI">​</a> 
<p>For many years, artificial intelligence primarily piqued the interest of academic researchers and enthusiasts within niche technological sectors such as robotics. Although respected, AI presented little practical application for the average person. That changed in June 2020 with the debut of a Large Language Model (LLM) called GPT-3. GPT-3 inspired organizations and individuals to use AI to accelerate their workflows, from coding and blogging to planning itineraries. Today, the potential of AI is so immense that Simon Westh Henriksen, the CTO of Kin, believes personal AI will be one of the most valuable digital assets we own in the future. Simon and his team built Kin. They describe it as "your personal AI assistant for your private life." The intended persona for Kin is a mix between a life coach and a close friend.</p>
 My First Impressions of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#my-first-impressions-of-kin" title="Direct link to My First Impressions of Kin">​</a> 
<p>For the last three years, I've deemed ChatGPT my bestie, so when I heard about Kin, I immediately downloaded the beta on my phone. My initial impression was that there was a sense of familiarity because the user interface and interaction were reminiscent of other LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. However, there were some key differences between Kin and traditional chatbots – it focuses on privacy and personalization.</p>
 Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#privacy-first-artificial-intelligence" title="Direct link to Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence">​</a> 
<p>With traditional Generative AI Chatbots, your data lives on the company's servers for telemetry purposes (and more). In contrast, Simon explained that Kin doesn't have backend servers, and users' data stays exclusively with the user. This is possible because of Web5's <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a>. DWNs provide users with a local and personal data store. Now, you can ask an AI personal questions without worrying if someone else can also read it.</p>
 Personalized for You<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#personalized-for-you" title="Direct link to Personalized for You">​</a> 
<p>Unlike traditional Generative AI Chatbots, Kin retains the context of your conversations to provide personalized and relevant responses. As users engage with Kin, the platform analyzes these interactions to extract facts about the user, constructing a semantic memory. This process involves graphing and mapping details such as your name, relationships, interests, etc.</p>
<p>Simon explained the technological process behind this functionality: "It takes in this new knowledge that we have recognized from the chat, or what we think is new knowledge. And then we query this graph that already exists, and we kind of take a subgraph, the relevant subgraph, that might be related to that thing. Then we give it to the LLM, to the model, and it outputs graph operations. So that's something like add node, add edge, remove node, remove edge, and then we apply those to the graph. And in that way, the memory evolves as you speak and interact with Kin."</p>
 The Future of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-kin" title="Direct link to The Future of Kin">​</a> 
<p>The team at Kin is working on enhancing the platform's memory beyond facts of the user by introducing episodic memory. Episodic memory tracks events in users' lives and anchors them to a timeline to give AI an idea of how a user's life evolves.</p>
<p>They also plan to implement natural voice interfaces and personalized reminders.</p>
 The True Value of Data Ownership<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-true-value-of-data-ownership" title="Direct link to The True Value of Data Ownership">​</a> 
<p>Simon envisions a future where Kin takes full advantage of Web5's data ownership and cryptographic verification capabilities. He provided a futuristic example: After a year of personalized interaction, Kin could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> to serve as a digital assistant with verified authority on the user's behalf. Kin could share preferences with third parties like e-commerce websites with the user's permission.</p>
<p>"This is where owning and controlling your data suddenly becomes extremely valuable," Simon proclaims. Data ownership is not just about keeping your data private but having control over who you share your data with.</p>

<p>Deepfake cyberattacks, phishing, and social engineering have all received a turbo boost in recent months due to the proliferation of easily accessed AI tools. Cybercriminals are some of the most creative individuals in the world. They spend their days conjuring up different ways to bypass security systems, not filling out spreadsheets and reports.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this article, we discuss how hackers are leveraging AI tools to bypass traditional identity security controls at an unprecedented pace, and just why generative AI attacks are so successful. We also look at how these attacks can be defeated using identity assurance controls that take a deterministic approach to securing identities, rather than relying on probabilistic methods that contain inherent levels of uncertainty. By implementing these modern controls, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of identity fraud for both their workforce as well as customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Generative AI Attacks  
<p>Hackers use out of the box as well as specifically trained large language models (LLMs), often created by nation state hackers (China, Russia, North Korea), to execute cyberattacks with frightening accuracy. Here are some of the attacks that get a significant boost from AI.</p> 
 Phishing  
<p>Prior to AI, we used to frequently delineate between “phishing” and “spear phishing,” where attacks were tailored to a specific individual. By using LLMs, hackers are now able to tailor just about every single phishing message to a specific target to get a much higher success rate. For decades now the industry has trained employees to spot telltale signs of phishing by looking for grammatical and spelling errors. Today, phishing messages created by LLMs are in the local language, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from the legitimate messages users get every single day. A <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">recent study</a> found a 1,265% rise in phishing, largely due to the usage of AI tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 Impersonation (Deepfake Cyberattacks)  
<p>Identity theft is at an all time high due to the ability of AI to impersonate an individual across all communication channels including voice, text and video. In recent weeks, a scammer used a series of<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/05/deepfake-video-conference-call/"> video deepfakes to extract more than $25M from an organization</a>. Hackers can create personas based on individuals in minutes, merely by looking at samples of their writing, publicly available videos, and social media posts. Just a few years ago, creating a deepfake video required significant resources. Today, freely available apps can do the job fairly well, with accuracy improving by leaps and bounds daily.&nbsp;</p> 
 Social Engineering&nbsp;  
<p>Before AI, social engineering attacks were highly manual in nature and oftentimes had low success rates. We’ve all received scam calls and many of us can easily spot them when the caller has no knowledge of our details and speaks with an unfamiliar accent. By using AI, hackers are able to create chatbots and voice conversation systems that mimic the tone, cadence, and contextual nuances of a specific target audience. LLMs also are able to use reinforcement learning so that they get better with every single conversation that occurs. These improved algorithms can then be used to target large numbers of users simultaneously, rather than being bottlenecked by human interactions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Generative AI Attacks Are Successful  
<p>Hackers love AI tools because they make them more efficient than ever. There are a few key reasons why AI-assisted attacks are seeing so much success today:&nbsp;</p> 
 Speed and Scalability  
<p>AI can process and analyze data and conversations at speeds that outpace any human by orders of magnitude. This ability enables these tools to launch widespread attacks in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adaptability  
<p>AI systems can adapt their strategies based on the responses from the target’s defenses. If users have been trained to look for specific red flags, these tools can adapt and respond accordingly within seconds. As a result, defense systems that rely on blocking known attack patterns are trivial for an AI attack to bypass quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
 Efficiency in Targeting  
<p>AI can analyze data from various sources to identify the most valuable targets to maximize its success. When AI identifies a series of patterns or signals, it can quickly train itself to focus on targets with the most likelihood for success. Most importantly, it can correlate with other AI systems who “soften the target,” to then outflank victim organizations' security controls. For example, one AI tool can target an organization with a DDOS attack and, when the victim is busy responding, another AI tool can execute a highly contextualized phishing campaign that references the DDOS attack to maximize its success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Leveraging Big Data  
<p>AI systems are able to integrate with countless data sources both public and private in order to maximize their impact. Attackers leveraging AI can refine strategies within seconds based on real-time events in ways never possible before. Social media, previous breach data available on the dark web, and leaked credentials can all be processed instantaneously to create new and more sophisticated attacks with a high likelihood of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Probabilistic Identity Security Controls Fail Against an AI Attack  
<p>The vast majority of identity security controls are failing today. To understand why this is the case, we have to understand the probabilistic nature of their implementations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probabilistic security controls operate on the basis of likelihood. They use various criteria to determine the probability that something is safe or a potential security threat. By contrast, deterministic security controls identify an outcome with a binary level of precision. They can determine with a high degree of certainty if something is true or false, safe or a threat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some of the primary methods the industry uses today to prove that someone is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishable Authentication Factors  
<p>Passwords, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one time passwords (OTP) </a>delivered via SMS or app, and push notifications are the primary methods organizations use to verify users today into their systems. AI creates significant accuracy in brute force password spraying attacks by being able to predict passwords. It also strengthens phishing and social engineering to trick users into providing OTP codes or accepting push notifications at a high rate. These controls are probabilistic as they cannot determine with certainty that the entity seeking access is the legitimate credential holder, and can be intercepted, replayed and phished.&nbsp;</p> 
 KBA-Based Identity Verification  
<p>AI systems’ ability to ingest massive amounts of data extremely quickly and in real time enables them to learn about their targets and easily answer questions such as their mother's maiden name and the street they grew up on. By combining this with phishing and social engineering capabilities, these AI-assisted hackers can quickly execute identity theft and gain access to employee and customer accounts. Knowledge-based security methods are also probabilistic by nature and can be easily intercepted, replayed, and phished from users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Human-Verified Documents  
<p>Many businesses have moved from KBA to online or in-person document verification in order to reduce identity fraud. However, attackers can use widely available AI tools to create fake documents such as passports and driver licenses that are able to trick most systems. The image below is a fake passport generated by AI that was able to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-fake-ids-pass-crypto-exchange-kyc-onlyfake">bypass the identity verification system of a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">404 Media</a></p> 
<p>Both human and machine-based verification controls of documents are probabilistic in nature because they have to account for differences in documents with regard to image quality and the sheer number of variations of the documents themselves. They can only determine the likelihood that a document is legitimate.</p> 
 Five Identity Controls to Defend Against AI Attacks  
 1. Focus on Deterministic Controls  
<p>In recent years, deterministic controls to secure identities have started to enter the market by way of open standards and innovative technology companies. Unlike most probabilistic controls, deterministic identity technology plays a crucial role in countering AI-assisted cyber attacks because they can provide a binary certainty; a definitive yes or no that eliminates the gaps exploited by AI-assisted attacks.</p> 
 2. Strong Authentication Protocols  
<p>Cryptographic Techniques: FIDO and similar protocols, such as the traditional smartcard, use public-key cryptography for authentication. During the registration process, the user’s device creates a new public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret on the device, while the public key is registered with the online service. Authentication involves proving possession of the private key without it ever leaving the user's device, making it extremely difficult for attackers (AI-assisted or not) to steal or replicate.</p> 
<p>Biometric Verification: FIDO, for example, supports local <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric verification</a> (like fingerprint sensors, facial recognition, etc.), which are difficult for AI to fake because the biometric data is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the device confirms the match and then uses cryptographic keys to authenticate the user to the service.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing Resistance</a>: FIDO authentication is bound to the original website's URL, making it resistant to phishing attacks. Even if AI is used to create highly convincing phishing sites, the authentication process checks the URL to ensure it matches the registered service’s URL, preventing the credentials from being used to authenticate a fraudulent site.</p> 
<p>Local Storage of Credentials: Since the cryptographic credentials in FIDO are stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the server or across the network, AI-assisted attacks that rely on intercepting or deducing credentials remotely are rendered ineffective.</p> 
 3. Layered IDV to Prevent Deepfake Cyber Attacks  
<p>Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated on a daily basis. While liveness detection is a positive step forward, it’s only a matter of time before it’s defeated by the rapid pace of innovation in AI. Multi-layered identity verification offers a deterministic way to prove people’s identities to defend against deepfake cyber attacks. Instead of relying purely on voice or video feeds, you combine a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 4. AI-Assisted Identity Risk Mitigation  
<p>While deterministic security controls are essential, they cannot fully protect against unknown and emerging threats. Modern probabilistic identity security controls take advantage of the same AI assistance as attackers. Real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls are a critical tool for organizations to manage evolving identity risks. By ingesting risk signals from a wide variety of sources, you can bring high fidelity to probabilistic controls.</p> 
 5. A Collaborative Identity Security Stack&nbsp;  
<p>It’s no secret that many identity security solutions tackle very specific challenges, operating in isolated spheres. Generative AI attacks find and exploit the gaps between these fragmented identity security processes. Open standards like FIDO and Open Policy Agent (OPA), were developed, in part, to ensure compatibility between security tools and processes. A more unified identity security approach, with solutions that communicate and collaborate across the identity lifecycle, greatly decreases the success rates of generative AI attacks.</p> 
 HYPR’s Anti-AI Strategy  
<p>HYPR was founded to put in place a deterministic way of proving that people are who they say they are. As a result, we were one of the first commercially successful implementations of the FIDO standards. Since then, our platform has expanded to prevent automation and scaling of identity-related attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines strong passwordless authentication, continuous risk mitigation and comprehensive identity verification so that you can be certain that a person is who they claim to be throughout the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>HYPR Authenticate is our category-leading <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> solution, which is built on top of the FIDO standards and fully eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication and verification processes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> is an identity fabric, which integrates&nbsp;real-time risk assessment and mitigation, leveraging high-fidelity risk signals from numerous sources, including external environments, endpoints and other cybersecurity products.</p> 
<p>HYPR Affirm, our comprehensive product for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a>, provides a deterministic way to prove that an identity is legitimate and belongs to the person asserting it. HYPR Affirm combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification, AI-powered chat, video, facial recognition and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 78 (DF78) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 22, 2024 and ended 12:01 am February 29.

It concludes on March 7. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF81 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF79   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF79 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. In previous years, the Ocean core team built a core tech stack with broad applicability in AI x crypto. In 2023, we tested hypotheses towards growing traction. From that, the three brightest spots are Ocean Predictoor, Ocean Compute-to-Data (C2D), and Ocean Enterprise. For 2024, we focus on&nbsp;these.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Sections 2, 3, and 4 elaborate on goals for Predictoor, C2D, and Ocean Enterprise respectively. Section 5 covers ongoing work: Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. Goal: Accelerate Ocean Predictoor  2.1 Predictoor Background <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. The “earn $” part is key, because it fosters&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Predictoor involves two groups of&nbsp;people:</p>  Predictoors: data scientists who use AI models to predict what the price of ETH, BTC, etc will be 5 (or 60) minutes into the future. The scientists run bots that submit these predictions onto the chain every 5 minutes. Predictoors earn $ based on sales of the feeds, including sales from Ocean’s Data Farming incentives program.  Traders: run bots that input predictoors’ aggregated predictions, to use as alpha in trading. It’s another edge for making $ while&nbsp;trading.  <p>Predictoor is built using the Ocean stack. And, it runs on<a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/"> Oasis Sapphire</a>; we’ve <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/success-in-ai-powered-prediction-bots-leads-to-ocean-oasis-partnership-e4e9f697c99a?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">partnered</a> with the Oasis&nbsp;team.</p><p>Predictoor Traction. Predictoor has highly promising traction: starting from zero volume on mainnet launch in October 2023, volume has grown to &gt; $15M / day. [Source: <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=all">DappRadar</a>].</p><p>Predictoor is rocking! So we’re doubling down on it in&nbsp;2024.</p> 2.2 Predictoor Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>With this context in mind, here are Predictoor goals for 2024. We’ll work to get users making serious $, then we’ll scale&nbsp;up.</p><p>Goal 1: Users making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. We want both predictoors and traders making serious $. So, the key trick is for traders to make serious $; then they’ll spend $ to buy feeds; which leads to serious $ for predictoors. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Everything else&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Here are the sub-steps of goal&nbsp;1:</p>  1.1 Make $ trading: internal. Conduct experiments iteratively until we make $ trading in some combination of {trading venue &amp; pair, prediction strategy, trading strategy, other}. Results are highly promising, and getting better weekly. Simultaneously, build a first-class data pipeline and analytics dapp, to better answer the question “how much $ am I making” and drill-down questions. The dapp will start with predictoor bots, then expand to trading&nbsp;bots.  1.2 Make $ trading: external. Update Predictoor product so that community can follow the make $ strategy from (1). Eg add feeds, change prediction bot, change trading bot. If needed, have new smart contracts. Continually improve data pipeline and analytics dapp.  1.3 Make more $ predicting: external. Each feed is currently priced 1 OCEAN/day, which under-values the feed compared to $ being made by traders, and therefore means lost $ opportunity for predictoors. A better pricing approach will address this. We will explore possible approaches (e.g. auctions), and roll out the best one in the Predictoor product.  <p>At this point, the Predictoor product architecture enables predictoors and traders to make serious $ on any given feed, or combination of&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Goal 2: Scale up. Here are sub-steps:</p>  2.1 Reduce trading friction via TG bots &amp; more. Coming into this step, both predictoors and traders onboard via READMEs to run Python bots. For predictoors this is generally fine, since they need to change code to improve modeling or trading strategies if they want an edge. However for traders, we can make it easier to run bots with “good default” strategies. This in turn increases sales volume. Therefore the goal of this step is to make it easier for traders to run bots. A key strategy will be to leverage Telegram (TG)&nbsp;bots.  2.2 Grow # feeds in DeFi. Once predictoors and traders are making serious $, we will significantly expand the number of feeds within DeFi: more tokens, more exchanges, more time scales, signals beyond just close price, and more. E.g. from 20 to 20,000 feeds. This will increase the $ made by traders and by predictoors.  2.3 Grow to new verticals. As that starts to hit diminishing returns, we will expand beyond DeFi: weather, climate, energy, real estate, logistics, agriculture, food prices, gas prices, and more. One possible starting point is prediction weather prediction for a couple cities; then expand city by city; then to every square km on&nbsp;earth.  <p>Goal 1 is for “0→1” to get product-market fit, and goal 2 “1→n” for scale-up.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1732321049847456123">Stretch goal</a>: world model on ground-truth physics. We’ll train a single AI model across all feeds. This model will continually ingest the physics of the world to predict its next state. Truly a *world model*. We’ll also give it all the training data that current LLMs take. The net result: a model with vastly more data than current LLMs, and ground-truth physics in all that additional data. <a href="https://www.explainablestartup.com/2017/06/why-prediction-is-the-essence-of-intelligence.html">Prediction is intelligence</a>. This is Predictoor’s endgame.</p><p>It’s a big vision! Goals 1 and 2 alone will occupy us for all of 2024 and much of 2025. The stretch goal will&nbsp;follow.</p> 3. Goal: Launch C2D Springboard  3.1 Core Stack Background <p>At the core of the Ocean tech stack are <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/data-nfts-and-data-tokens/">datatokens</a> and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/compute-to-data/">Compute-to-Data (C2D)</a>. Datatokens enables token-gating of AI models, predictions, and more. They enable data wallets, data exchanges, and data DAOs. C2D is pragmatic and useful privacy approach, complementary to other privacy approaches.</p><p>C2D Details. Let’s drill into C2D&nbsp;further.</p>  Why C2D. Private data is valuable: using private data can improve research and business outcomes. But concerns over privacy and control make it hard to&nbsp;access.  What is C2D. Compute-to-Data (C2D) grants access to run compute against the data, on the same premises of the data. Only the results are visible to the consumer. The data never leaves the premises. Decentralized blockchain technology does the handshaking.  C2D Benefits. Ocean C2D enables people to sell private data while preserving privacy, as an opportunity for companies to monetize their data assets. C2D can also be used for data sharing in science or technology contexts, with lower liability risk, because the data doesn’t&nbsp;move.  Left: C2D Conceptual Flow. Right:&nbsp;C2D2!<p>Internal discussions. In Ocean core team, we’ve long understood the unique selling points of C2D. It’s why we built it in the first place, way back in 2019! Over the years, we’ve had continuous interest in using it, such as our collaboration with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a> (a part of Daimler). However, we saw that we hadn’t fully leveraged its potential, as we’d invested our time on other features.</p><p>Besides C2D, we’ve see many friction points in using the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Community feedback. Over the past several months, we interviewed community members for feedback, especially to gain insights on how to best enhance the core stack. Some feedback has already translated to completed actions such as improving <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean docs</a>. The two main themes from the community were: (a) clear demand to make C2D great, and (b) developer experience is still high friction.</p> 3.2 C2D &amp; Core Stack Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>The community feedback was consistent with our own discussions, and helped us to confirm what mattered. This in turn informs our plans for 2024. Thus, here are C2D / tech stack goals for 2024, culminating in a C2D springboard.</p><p>Goal 1. Unified backend. From community feedback we learned that deploying and maintaining the various Ocean components (Aquarius, Provider, Subgraph, C2D) is too complex. In 2024, we will simplify this process by merging all of them into a single, more manageable component. This upgrade means easier installation with just one command and a user-friendly admin dashboard, set for release in Q2 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 2. C2D.2. The current C2D, while powerful, has friction in creating and deploying algorithms. So we’re integrating C2D into the newly-unified backend to simplify its use. This means straightforward installation and maintenance, along with easier ways for users to write and deploy algorithms and ML models. This update will be launched in Q3 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 3. Build a “C2D springboard” to further empower our Ocean community. This platform will make it easy to showcase the capabilities of your AI algorithms for specific use cases, reminiscent of Ocean Market, but heavily tuned to C2D workflows. The product is set to launch in Q4 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As we roll out these updates, we’ll continue to leverage Ocean’s Data Challenges to catalyze development of AI algorithms for&nbsp;each.</p> 4. Goal: Roll Out Ocean Enterprise <p>Ever since the release of Ocean v4 (spring 2022), there has been growing interest in the businesses community about Ocean’s capabilities, especially Data NFTs, datatokens and Compute-to-Data (C2D).</p><p>Traditional businesses operate in highly regulated environments, where strict compliance to industry regulation such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://www.eu-data-act.com/">EU Data Act</a>, and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MiCA</a> have a major impact on operations and product development. Ensuring compliance can hinder innovative solutions from going into production.</p><p>Starting this year, a new endeavor called Ocean Enterprise will launch. It will help businesses take Ocean-powered solutions into production. Ocean Enterprise comprises both a group of collaborators and a tech&nbsp;stack.</p>  The collaborators are a diverse group of organizations spanning eight countries and seven industries. This group has already established the Ocean Enterprise Collective to gather requirements, design and develop a tech&nbsp;stack  The tech stack is an enterprise-ready, compliant version of Ocean. It will be based on the existing Ocean stack. It will incorporate additional new enterprise-specific features to allow businesses to securely collaborate, share and monetise their data in a fully compliant manner. The first release will be later this&nbsp;year.  <p>Work on the new Ocean Enterprise version began quietly several months ago. Stay tuned: more details will be announced in the following months&nbsp;👀.</p> 5. Ongoing <p>In addition to the core initiatives above, we will continue with ongoing efforts in Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. This section elaborates.</p> 5.1 Data Challenges <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Ocean Data Challenges</a> are competitions for data scientists to build predictive models, do analytics, or otherwise.</p><p>We’ve been running them since 2022. We will continue them in 2024, though as mentioned above, now tuned towards&nbsp;C2D.</p> 5.2 Data Farming&nbsp;(DF) <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF</a> is Ocean’s incentives program. Typical APYs are&nbsp;5–20%.</p><p>DF currently emits 150,000 OCEAN weekly rewards. As the schedule outlines, rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-March 2024, and double again to 600,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-September 2004.</p>  50% of weekly DF rewards are for Passive DF, i.e. locking&nbsp;OCEAN.  The other 50% for Active DF, where users have to engage more actively for rewards, such as running prediction bots.  <p>As with previous years, for 2024, Passive DF will remain unchanged, and the specific activities within Active DF may&nbsp;evolve.</p> 5.3 Ecosystem support <p>Ocean has a lively<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem"> ecosystem</a> of dapps grown over years, built by enthusiastic developers. The Ocean ecosystem also contains many data scientists and OCEAN holders who do predictions, data challenges, Data Farming, and more. Furthermore, Ocean has an excellent<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/community"> community of ambassadors</a>.</p><p>For 2024, the core team will continue to support the Ocean ecosystem &amp; Ocean Ambassadors.</p>Some <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem/">featured dapps</a> from Ocean’s ecosystem. 6. Conclusion <p>In 2024, we will double down on Predictoor’s exponential growth, launch a “C2D springboard”, and roll out Ocean Enterprise. We will continue to run Ocean Data Challenges, Data Farming, and support our lively ecosystem.</p><p>This product update stands for our roadmap to making Ocean Protocol more accessible, efficient and powerful — all in the name in traction.</p> Notes <p>[1] This step only comes now, because we first needed to establish an architecture where both predictoors and traders can conceptually make serious $. If we did this UX work earlier, we’d have spend time optimizing a UX that any step of goal 1 might have become obsolete.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Fission has been working with the IPFS ecosystem since we started. Content addressing is a fundamentally useful innovation that opens new use cases and approaches that are difficult or impossible without.</p><p>This year, the community and the organizations involved are changing in significant ways. Protocol Labs is nucleating a number of the engineering, open source, and operational teams into separate startups, engineering collectives, and foundations.</p><p>For IPFS projects and tooling, we must re-evaluate how we work together from code to commons.</p> What is IPFS Mainnet? <p>Mainnet is a term used to describe the default or "main" network that default settings connect to. This has mostly been "assumed" for the IPFS network, and not really highlighted for anyone other than protocol experts. The technical name for Mainnet is Amino, and there's a <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/">blog post from September 2023</a> that goes into some more details and changes happening.</p><p>Diving deeper into Mainnet, there are a variety of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/">public utilities that are described in more detail in the IPFS docs</a>. One of the most notable is the IPFS.io public gateway, that serve up content-addressed data through an HTTP gateway that every browser can access.</p><p>This was run by Protocol Labs, and will now be a responsibility of the emerging IPFS Foundation, who in turn are relying on the new <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/">IP Shipyard organization</a> to do the technical work to host and maintain the gateway.</p><p>There are a number of other <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS Mainnet gateways</a>, including the gateway we've been running at Fission for many years:</p>While Fission's gateway is listed, we only serve up content that is synched to our servers by published apps and WNFS file systems<p>You'll note from the list that there are a number of commercial providers of IPFS services, like Cloudflare, Pinata, and Web3 Storage. As well as their "public" gateways, many of these organizations also sell services hosting dedicated gateways.</p><p>The way that IPFS works, all the nodes / gateways / desktops etc connect together and store pieces of data, "addressed" by the data itself. Unlike with a single web server being down and no one else having the "authority" to have the data at a location like <code>example.com/somedata.pdf</code>, IPFS nodes ask each other for all of the blocks that make up a content address, and the receiver can then verify that the data is correct.</p><p>IPFS Mainnet is the giant global network that uses the default bootstrap list, the default Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that helps locate content on the network, and all of the public and dedicated gateways that connect to it.</p> Alternate Networks <p>Using a different list of bootstrap nodes and other configuration settings, you can choose to not connect to IPFS Mainnet. Here are two examples of projects that made this choice:</p><p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> uses IPFS to synch and serve data across their ecosystem – we had them on for a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-tech-talks-sourcery-with-decentralized-databases/">Fission Tech Talk</a> a while back – but doesn't connect to Mainnet by default.</p><p><a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a> is a chat app that uses IPFS to synch and connect devices, but on a network that is private to the connected devices.</p><p>Performance, privacy, or other considerations are all reasons that you might not want to use Mainnet, while still relying on the same codebases and technology stack.</p> Everywhere Computer and IPFS <p>Fission's primary product is the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. This is the platform we're building on top of the open protocol InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM) that we developed alongside a number of collaborators in the UCAN and IPVM working groups.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer lets you run compute everywhere. This is accomplished by supporting WebAssembly functions that are published to IPFS, and by fetching and storing data that needs to be computed to and from IPFS. Separately, we use libp2p, the peer-to-peer networking layer that IPFS also runs on, to connect all of the compute providers, and to share receipts of results and other data across the network.</p><p>Simplistically, you could say IPVM and the Everywhere Computer add compute to IPFS.</p><p>Note that we didn't say "IPFS Mainnet" there. We heavily use content addressing in the design of the system, so that we can do things like cache functions on compute nodes, cache results across the network to skip computation all together, and many of the other optimizations you can do from edge devices to servers when you're using content addressing rather than location addressing.</p><p>The design of the Everywhere Computer will introduce the concept of Subnets. These will be default settings, permissions, optimized functions, and other configuration options that let anyone compose groups of computers to support different ecosystems and applications.</p><p>However, our default public beta subnet (cool name and logo forthcoming!) will connect to IPFS Mainnet. The public commons that the IPFS Mainnet represents is something that we've always been excited about and supported, and we're excited to add content-addressed compute with the Everywhere Computer.</p>You can watch a demo and overview of the Everywhere Computer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6n2dhjmYes&amp;t=10s">from our late Feb 2024 presentation</a><p>Across both public gateways and commercial providers, developers will be able to fetch data, run it through an IPVM compatible function, and then store the results back on IPFS Mainnet.</p><p><a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up for the Everywhere Computer beta</a> if you'd like to be involved.</p> Gathering the Commons <p>Along with IP Shipyard, we're hosting an event today in Denver to share the news about IPFS Mainnet support, and start gathering the commons of people and organizations that are interested in supporting and improving this public global network.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about IPFS as Commons:</p><p>As an ecosystem, app or project that relies on the IPFS technology stack (whether it connects to Mainnet or you run a private network), what do you need and how do you want to provide support in return?</p><p>As a commercial provider, let's talk about inter-connecting our nodes and jointly running a more efficient network. If you rely on Kubo, go-libp2p, js-libp2p that are maintained by the IP Shipyard team, or other open source code bases, how do you plan on supporting them? What features and functions would you want to prioritize and fund, or contribute engineering resources to help implement?</p><p>As an individual using IPFS from your desktop or through various apps, how do you want such an open network to function, and what should it prioritize?</p><p>There are a number of legal challenges, takedown requests, and content moderation topics that come up across public gateways. Should IPFS Mainnet supporters join forces to decide on how to handle some of these concerns across the commons network?</p><blockquote>This year, the IPFS and extended ecosystem is graduating to a more commons based approached, with many separate companies, foundations, and funding partners.<br><br>At ETH Denver we want to introduce the changes, and invite people to take part in supporting and governing large public commons projects like the <a href="http://ipfs.io/">ipfs.io</a> public gateway, and the Kubo IPFS node codebase.<br>​<br>We will have a presentation by Adin Schmahmann from IP Shipyard, IPFS Core Maintainer, to introduce <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/new-chapter">IP Shipyard’s New Chapter</a> and other existing and upcoming initiatives.<br><br>We will follow with a discussion of IPFS as Commons, welcoming IPFS operators, dapp builders, blockchain ecosystems, and others interested in the future of the IPFS commons. This will be a facilitated discussion and Q&amp;A, hosted by Boris Mann, Founder of Fission.</blockquote><p>If you're in Denver, you've still got time to join us for the <a href="https://lu.ma/6suk3oa5">IPFS Mainnet event today, Wed Feb 28th, 4pm MST</a>, otherwise we'll be sharing presentation slides and other follow up notes <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/ipfs-mainnet-at-ethdenver/17620">on the IPFS Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

<p>According to the most recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are seeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. This puts credit unions between a rock and a hard place: friction vs security.</p>



<p>Quick catch-up: Traditional KYC methods often lead to tedious, friction-filled processes such as:</p>



 
 Manual processing 



 Relying on third parties 



 Physical branch visits 



 Delays in account access 



 The list can go on and on. 
 



<p>But this process is now obsolete thanks to reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Why it matters: With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once. By applying cutting-edge technology, reusable credentials not only take friction out of your operations, but makes every touch point more secure than ever before.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can revolutionize credit union operations in our new eBook, “KYC: A New Age of Less Fraud and Friction”.</a></p>



<p>The big picture: Say goodbye to “What is your mother’s maiden name?” With reusable credentials, credit unions will revolutionize their operations and create an incredible member experience with seamless interactions in every channel.</p>



 Dive deeper 







<p>Beyond credit union KYC: the ongoing friction struggle</p>



<p>Friction is an ongoing challenge for credit unions at every touch point. There can be different login or verification experiences at every channel.</p>



<p>The core issue that causes most of the friction in your operations is the temporary nature of current credit union KYC and identity verification. While the initial KYC process validates a member’s identity for account opening, this verification is a one-time use and cannot be reused. For members to have day-to-day interactions with their credit union they’ll have to repeatedly verify their identity. Not to mention that the current methods can be reproduced by bad actors.</p>



<p>Security questions can be easily guessed through social engineering, tellers may struggle to differentiate between fake and real IDs, and SMS-based verifications are often indistinguishable from phishing.</p>



<p>The current credit union KYC process not only causes delays in member service and satisfaction but also burdens employees in the fight against fraud, potentially leading to financial losses.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Give your members the experience of “pre-check”</p>



<p>Drawing inspiration from the success of TSA Pre-check&nbsp; in travel, Anonyome Labs’ solution introduces credentials that are persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. By applying this concept to credit unions, the result is an elevated member experience where KYC becomes a persistent validation process.</p>



<p>&nbsp;With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once, ensuring seamless and secure interactions from account sign-up to every subsequent touchpoint. This innovative technology eliminates the need for repetitive verifications, reducing friction in member interactions, and enhancing overall security. (All without disrupting existing solutions, processes, or member experiences.)</p>



<p></p>



<p>Tellers can focus on member experience instead of fake IDs</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PYMNTS-FIs-Revamping-Technologies-to-Fight-Financial-Crimes-December-2023.pdf">30% of financial institutions</a> plan on taking feedback from their employees or their customers’ needs when selecting solutions partners.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will transform your member and employee experience. Employees, especially those in critical roles such as call centers and tellers, will be empowered to be more effective&nbsp;for the overall security and satisfaction of credit union members.</p>



<p>Tellers and employees often&nbsp; bear the responsibility of verifying member identities, a task full of pressure and potential security risks. With reusable credentials, the burden is significantly lifted, as the need for repetitive verifications.</p>



<p>Call center employees can shift their focus from identity validation to enhancing the member experience, fostering quicker response times and more efficient interactions. Similarly, tellers are no longer in high-stress situations like having to distinguish between genuine and forged IDs.</p>



<p>Providing usable credentials cultivates a positive atmosphere for both employees and credit union members.</p>







<p>Credit union KYC innovation is easy</p>



<p>Credit unions are losing members due to a lack of innovation. A <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/credit-union-innovation-real-time-payments-fintechs/">PYMNTS Intelligence</a> research study found:</p>



 
 27% of credit union members say they would consider changing financial institutions (FIs) to access new products or more innovative solutions. 



 This willingness to switch has increased to 27%, up from 17% since 2018. 



 The share of CU members willing to switch to more innovative solutions is very close to the number of non-CU members willing to do the same, 29%. 
 



<p>Between member’s preferences and the continual increase in fraud, it is vital for credit unions to implement new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with a technology provider, like Anonyome Labs, makes adding cutting-edge technology to your existing operations not only doable, but seamless. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Our technology</a> includes everything you need to build reusable credentials into your existing apps and systems. No need to rip and replace what’s been working for years.</p>



<p></p>



 FAQ: Reusable credentials and decentralized identity&nbsp; 



How do reusable credentials work?&nbsp;




<p>1. Initial identity verification: When a member joins a credit union or starts an account, a decentralized identity (DI) system verifies their identity using robust authentication methods.<br></p>







<p>2. Creation of reusable credentials: Once the member’s identity is verified, the DI system generates reusable credentials. These credentials are encrypted – making them tamper-proof and secure.<br></p>







<p>3. Ownership and control: Unlike traditional identity systems where organizations manage and store user data, decentralized identity gives ownership and control to the individual. For credit unions, this means the member owns their credentials and they are stored securely on their device, including the ability to store and present credentials from within your app and interfaces.<br></p>







<p>4. Verification at touchpoints: For every interaction with the credit union, whether it’s logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, the member can present their reusable credentials. These credentials serve as irrefutable proof of their identity without the need for repetitive verification processes.</p>



 




How can reusable credentials help credit unions?




 
 Enhanced security: Reusable credentials enhance security by reducing the reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud. For example, traditional security measures, such as security questions that can be exploited through social engineering or SMS-based verifications that are susceptible to phishing, are replaced by reusable credentials.<br> 
 







 
 Frictionless member experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for credit union members. Once verified, members enjoy a continuous and secure interaction across various touchpoints without the need for repeated identity checks.<br> 
 







 
 Privacy protection: Since members control their reusable credentials, they have the flexibility to share only the necessary information at each interaction. This is a privacy-centered approach that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.  
 



<p>Reusable credentials redefine the way identity is managed, placing control in the hands of members and ensuring a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused experience across various credit union touchpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can affect credit union operations here.</a></p>



 




What is decentralized identity?




<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>A decentralized identity looks like this:</p>



 
 Reusable credentials: Identity credentials, once verified, can become reusable and portable across various services and applications. Users can present their credentials without the need for repeated identity verification, streamlining interactions and reducing friction.<br> 



 Tamper-proof technology: Decentralized identity uses technology, such as blockchain, to record and verify identity information. This technology ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.<br> 



 Secure communication: By its very nature, decentralized identity provides perpetual, irrefutable, and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure and immediate authentication and identity validation. <br> 



 Reduced identity fraud: By giving individuals control over their identity and leveraging advanced security technology, DI can drastically reduce the risk of identity fraud.<br> 



 Privacy by design: Privacy is a fundamental principle of DI. Users have control over what information they share. This approach contrasts with centralized systems where users often give over control of their data.<br> 



 User control: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, decentralized identity empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>Decentralized identity has the power to reshape how individuals interact with digital services, ensuring greater privacy, security, and user control over their identity. As the technology continues to evolve, DI solutions are becoming increasingly relevant across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/">Dr. Paul Ashley,</a> who’s spent over 25 years in the privacy and security space, says this about DI: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view.”</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains decentralized identity to get the full picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 




How can reusable credentials prevent fraud?
 
 Cryptographic security: Reusable credentials use advanced tech (cryptography) to secure information. This makes credentials tamper-proof which reduces the risk of fraudsters attempting to manipulate or replicate identity information.<br> 



 Irrefutable proof of identity: Once a user’s identity is verified and made into a reusable credential, it is irrefutable proof of their identity. Traditional methods, such as security questions or SMS verifications, are more susceptible to social engineering or phishing.&nbsp;<br> 



 Reduced weak security points: Traditional KYC methods often include the exchange of sensitive information, creating potential attack points for fraudsters. Reusable credentials limit the places where fraudulent activities can occur.<br> 



 Decentralized ownership: With decentralized identity, users own and control their reusable credentials. This decentralization minimizes the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there’s no single data center storing a vast amount of sensitive user information. 
 



 




How can reusable credentials decrease friction?
 
 Seamless interactions: Reusable credentials streamline user interactions across various touchpoints, eliminating the need for repetitive identity verification. Once a user’s identity is verified and a reusable credential is established, subsequent interactions, whether online, in-app, or in-person, become seamless. This reduces friction and enhances the overall member experience.<br> 



 Single verification point: With reusable credentials, the need for repeated identity checks is gone. Users can verify their identity once, and the credentials can be used at different touchpoints without the necessity for additional verifications.<br> 



 Privacy and consent control: Users have control over what information is shared with service providers. They can selectively disclose only the necessary information for a particular interaction. This privacy-centric approach minimizes the amount of data exchanged, contributing to a smoother, more privacy-respecting user experience. 
 



 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance. Here are some examples:</p>



 
 Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, reusable credentials can play a vital role in securely managing patient identities, medical records, and access permissions. Patients could have portable credentials for verifying their identity during medical visits, and healthcare providers can access relevant information securely.<br> 



 Government services: Governments are exploring DI and reusable credentials for services such as issuing digital IDs, driver’s licenses, and other official documents. This approach can enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and provide citizens with more control over their personal information.<br> 



 Education: In the education sector, reusable credentials can be used for academic certifications and transcripts. Students could have a secure and portable credential that verifies their education, which they can present to employers or other educational institutions.<br> 



 Farming and mining: Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. Reusable credentials can be used in these two industries when submitting reports to government agencies or receiving certifications – even across wildly disparate certifying bodies and reporting organizations.<br> 



 Supply chain and logistics: Reusable credentials can be applied in supply chain and logistics for secure tracking of products and verifying the authenticity of goods. This can help prevent counterfeiting and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.<br> 



 Travel and hospitality: The travel industry is exploring the use of reusable credentials for seamless and secure identity verification at airports, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. This could simplify the check-in process and enhance the overall travel experience.<br> 



 Retail and e-commerce: Reusable credentials can enhance the security of online transactions in retail and e-commerce by providing users with a secure and portable identity for authentication. This can help reduce fraud in online purchases.<br> 



 Human resources and employment: For employment-related processes, reusable credentials can be used for verifiable employment history, certifications, and qualifications and even background checks. This can streamline the hiring process and provide employers with confidence in the candidate’s credentials. 
 




<p></p>



<p>Reusable credential technology is promising; widespread adoption across industries is still evolving. Various pilot programs, initiatives, and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving identity-related challenges, improving security, and better user experiences across industries.</p>

This token gives significant discounts to users of the Mattereum system when onboarding assets. Nine years ago I was part of the Ethereum team that wrote the rulebook for the future of finance and many other things, now Mattereum is delivering on this by enabling Real World Assets (RWA) to be put on chain safely and effectively. The landscape has been changed by TradFi deciding the future is tokenized assets. Mattereum’s system is the only one that can make this work. It provides an enforceable legal connection between the token representing an asset and the tokenized asset&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This has the power to completely transform finance for the future and make Mattereum bigger than&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>This is a once in a century transformation, like when music went&nbsp;digital</p><p>Please note that the Mattereum Discount Token (MATR) is available for purchase through <a href="https://mattereum.de/?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Mattereum GmbH</a>’s fully regulated German crypto exchange partner, <a href="http://swarm.com">Swarm</a>. Buying MATR is subject to terms and conditions in eligible jurisdictions — in particular, residents of the United Kingdom and the United States of America are excluded from the public sale of MATR. Sorry about that,&nbsp;folks.</p><p>==============================================================</p><p>At the end of January, Mattereum GmbH launched its token MATR* on Swarm, a German exchange regulated to the same level as a bank. As I write, prior to our big marketing push, it has already sold something in the region of $650k of tokens. This is the culmination of a long path that began, for Mattereum, back in 2017, but for me, much&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Nine years ago (almost to the day!) I started as launch coordinator for Ethereum, and I set out the big vision for it in Ethereum’s launch document <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains In Context</a>. It was nothing less than a new vision for the blockchain, a vision based around smart contracts. Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 is conventionally seen as the inflection point, the moment when everything changed, the moment when the blockchain became the future. I am not so sure, we’d definitely never seen anything like that before, but Bitcoin was weird money, and decided to stay as weird money, even though the prospect of the blockchain being able to do everything could be seen by the far-sighted from the start — Satoshi got it, it’s there in the original <a href="https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> — “Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect&nbsp;buyers”.</p><p>So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">Ethereum</a> happened. The key thing that you could do with Ethereum that you could not do with Bitcoin was smart contracts; you could use the blockchain as a computer to execute digital contracts that would allow it to do almost anything. This loosed the true potential of the blockchain on the world — the ability to create new kinds of property, beyond money itself. It is perhaps this that was the true inflection point. In a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-does-ether-100-mean-bb58522f781e">piece I wrote</a> when ETH hit $100 I described its origins as “a bunch of funny-looking villains pull together this remarkable piece of technology which, at the time, we thought was going to change the world”, and well, it kind of did, but maybe not how we envisaged it.</p><p>As I write this ETH has just hit $3500, the NFT craze, which needed Ethereum to function, has come and gone making a whole lot of people a bunch of money, then, just as quickly, losing it for them again. There have been scandals, frauds and rug pulls, and the entire reputation of the blockchain, particularly Ethereum, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">stank like a month-old kipper</a> for a while. But those of us with the long view know about the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a>. This describes how world-changing innovations undergo a steep innovation curve, create unsustainable bubbles, which burst, ruin a lot of people, become radioactively untouchable for a while, then have the sound, workable elements picked up by mature actors and built into solid, useful and profitable long term businesses. We saw it in the dotcom boom, we saw it in 1929 with the stock market, and even with the railway boom way back in the mid-19th century. Out of these came web 2.0, the modern financial system, and most countries’ transport infrastructure. And so it is with Ethereum. What we have seen so far may not have embodied the vision we had for Ethereum, but that vision was not&nbsp;lost.</p><p>I have kept that vision in sight and sat tight. Mostly, the Mattereum team are old, at least compared to other blockchain people, and have seen the Perez Cycle before; one of our team ran a top level domain in the early 2000s and I lived through the dotcom crunch. While bull markets turn to bear markets and back, and crypto winters come and go, we have had our eyes on long-term mature use cases. We have spent the time doing the hard, complicated, slow work that builds the machinery to make Ethereum everything it was supposed to be so that it has a long-term future.</p><p>If you wonder why the blockchain has not got greater traction, why it has just been the locus of fads, fancies and scams, it is because it hasn’t had a mechanism to connect it to the real world. It’s been like an engine revving in isolation, it needs the gearbox to connect it to the wheels so that it has grip on the road and the traction to actually get somewhere. Mattereum has been building that gearbox, the thing that gives the Ethereum blockchain a way of grasping the physical world by firmly and legally connecting it to RWA. That way it can achieve what it was always meant to do. The reason I left the Ethereum Foundation was that I saw that this is what was needing to be done and it was becoming increasingly clear that they were not going to do it, so I needed to. Now I have, through Mattereum.</p><p>But what is it exactly that I have done? What was it that took six years and millions of dollars of investment? Mattereum has built the digital and legal infrastructure that enables the sale and lease of physical property and other assets through smart contracts using Ethereum. To do this we have created the Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), which is a detailed product description of physical assets backed by legal warranties bundled together using smart contracts on the blockchain. With our partners at Swarm, we can now tokenize any asset a lawyer can recognise and fractionalize it too, and any asset or fraction of an asset comes with the Mattereum protections. This means that when you buy a real world asset token that has a MAP on Ethereum, you have unambiguous legal ownership of the linked physical asset. If you buy a token representing a gold bar, it enables you to turn up at the vault where the gold bar is stored and say “that specific gold bar there is mine” and have your claim accepted.</p><p>This is major — it is a potentially world-changing innovation.</p><p>Moreover, a MAP provides guarantees that the real world asset it describes is as claimed. If you buy a piece of real estate with a MAP that has been guaranteed to be in a certain condition and you turn up to find the roof leaks and the drains are blocked, you have the right to make a claim and be compensated. It is not just Mattereum that makes these promises, it is independent guarantors, and legal claims against them can be made in 172 jurisdictions worldwide — Mattereum’s legal infrastructure is built on UK common law provisions for digital commerce and is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions under international law. We help create a doubt-free environment for trade. We’ve started with gold, real estate, luxury goods, art, antiques, and other items where authenticity is particularly important, but ultimately our system could be used for everything. There are huge implications for this that I’ve explored in more depth <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">elsewhere</a>.</p><p>It’s easy to claim to put physical, real world stuff on chain, but it’s hard to prove that the stuff is real to a buyer on the other side of the world, and it’s even harder if that buyer is an AI (the Mattereum system also has important implications for enabling AI to connect to the physical world). Without the ability to prove that stuff is real, there’s no way to keep scammers out, and RWA scams will make the old NFT scams look trivial. Allow the scams to thrive and the long term viability of Ethereum as a global platform for trade will be doomed. Mattereum’s system squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>If you buy things like stock in major companies, say Facebook or Tesla, due diligence is built in, but for most other things, like real estate, you have to do that work for yourself before you buy, and it’s expensive. Diligence is the hard problem in almost all financial transactions.</p><p>Mattereum solves this; it is essentially a diligence facilitation company for Ethereum. Any transaction done on Ethereum for an asset with a MAP has the diligence done automatically.</p><p>We can do this for Mattereum customers, but we can also do it for other companies in the RWA space. Making it work took time and money (a lot of both); other companies putting RWAs on the blockchain don’t have to repeat that work, we can provide our system to them as a service, giving them a shortcut to secure and reliable tokenization and fractionalization.</p><p>Mattereum has built upon successive waves of innovation on the blockchain that have peaked and then crashed, building as more and more people get involved. At each step there are ten times the number of people involved than were in the previous wave, and each time that happens the story changes radically. Eventually the innovation reaches escape velocity and goes stratospheric, and, I believe, this is where we are&nbsp;now.</p><p>Our system has the potential to be the rails on which the future of commerce runs. Serious TradFi people are getting it; <a href="https://x.com/radarhits/status/1746155031265489197?s=46&amp;t=kMmiWeWpV1U1zyPrnuPkAA">Larry Fink from BlackRock Capital </a>has come out in favour of a tokenized future, saying that their great new horizon is tokenization of every real world financial asset, and Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, has followed him, <a href="https://twitter.com/EstateProtocol/status/1751673693141361095">saying</a> “everything of value in the world will eventually be a token”. The City of London, too, gets it, the world’s leading financial centre. The Lord Mayor, who heads the City, has set up his <a href="https://www.mainelli.org/?page_id=3704">Smart Economy Networks</a> project, which has tokenized assets as a major plank and actually names Mattereum as a key company in the network. Before all this, Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, head of the UK’s civil justice system, involved Mattereum in the development of the UK’s <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) as he <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">is a firm believer in the blockchain</a> as the future of commerce, and sees the opportunities offered by Mattereum’s innovations. Mattereum has gone on to be the first company to use the DDRR in their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past ten years we’ve gone from a single lone hero talking about building smart contracts into Bitcoin (Vitalik’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">MasterCoin</a>) to the leaders of TradFi insisting that blockchains, tokenization and similar are the future of&nbsp;finance.</p><p>We nailed this. Too early to know if we won or not, but back in 2015, the Ethereum team wrote the rulebook for the future of finance and many other things. Now Mattereum is delivering on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the end it’s about the&nbsp;money.</p><p>How much&nbsp;money?</p><p>All of it: how much information is left offline these days in unscanned paper books and undigitized music? A few percent. What we are doing is like that, but with money and assets. We have the potential to be bigger than Visa; I had long conversations about Mattereum with Dee Hock, Visa’s founder, and he did not think this was ridiculous.</p><p>Ethereum is now hitting Early Adopters where institutions with real use cases stop trying to fit the technology into their existing technology stack, and start moving their assets on to Ethereum’s technology stack, Mattereum is here to guarantee that this works. This is the beginning of “TradFi” and “DeFi” merging into, well, just&nbsp;“Fi”.</p><p>This is a once in a century transformation, like when music went digital. That doesn’t happen&nbsp;twice.</p><p>We held back on issuing a token until now, until we were sure we were being lifted by an unstoppable rising tide, and the legal, licensing and regulatory environment were ready. We could have leapt onboard with one during the ICO goldrush with everyone else, but our strategic mindset said “wait”, and we were not wrong. With the mature use case for the blockchain that we were planning for now being understood by the serious players, now is the time, so the decision was taken to launch MATR, a token offering discounts on Mattereum’s products and services.</p><p>Mattereum’s purpose is to provide a legal structure for RWA operations on the blockchain so that when users buy a tokenized asset such as real estate or gold, the purchaser of the token unambiguously owns the connected physical asset, or a fraction of the physical asset if it has been fractionalized as well. As a result, it was particularly important for any token associated with the Mattereum Group to be constructed in a legally sound way that provides the protections for purchasers that many other tokens fail to do. Without such protections other token buyers are vulnerable to rug-pulls and other sharp (and illegal) practices. To do this, Mattereum’s chosen path was to incorporate a subsidiary in Germany (Mattereum GmbH) which could mint and sell the MATR token through Swarm, a fully regulated and licensed German exchange operating under the same regulations and to the same standards as TradFi banking institutions in Germany and so providing customers with equivalent protections.</p><p>This was not, perhaps, the simplest route, but it was the one that gave MATR the absolutely best protection. We believe we are the first group to issue a token through an exchange regulated under the same rules as banks, but we hope this paves the way for more people to do things the same way. It involved more lawyers and negotiation than other routes, but it works, and now we’ve done it we can help others do it too, adding assistance with token issue processes to Mattereum’s portfolio.</p><p>The <a href="https://mattereum.de/token-whitepaper/?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Mattereum Discount Token White Paper</a> gives the exact formal details of how the MATR token works, but essentially it offers a discount on Mattereum fees for transactions with real world assets on chain, such as Onboarding Fees and Certifier Fees. Each token used reduces the fee by 1% and given that, in turn, onboarding fees are 1% of the assets’ selling price, for the kind of assets we’ll be onboarding, the discount received for using a token could be substantial. Let’s just have a look at how that would play out in a real transaction:</p><p>If a client wishes to onboard a $1m asset, the onboarding fee would be $10,000. If they use MATR tokens to reduce this fee, each token reduces the onboarding fee by 1% (subject to a maximum discount of USD $10,000), and a user can burn up to 50 tokens per asset. So for that $1m asset this means that burning the maximum of 50 tokens would result in a 50% reduction in the onboarding fee, or $5000. For that transaction each token would represent a cost saving of $100, and they are currently on sale* at $0.65 per token (going up in increments to $2.00 until the sale ends on 4 July — details are in the white&nbsp;paper).</p> We think this will be&nbsp;popular.

 Crisis and/of&nbsp;Property <p>The concept of property is deeply embedded in our modern socio-economic systems. So much so, that it is often viewed as sacrosanct, a near-natural law-like means to distribute agency, power, and freedom, breaking away from the dominance of the few and old empires. Yet, property has simultaneously been part of a pathway of dispossession, violence, environmental degradation and the exclusion of vast and growing numbers of&nbsp;people.</p><p>Where property seemed immutable, the ground is shifting, for better or worse. Property has been an information processing and structuring mechanism through which we have governed our world by means of abstraction, simplification, and dominion over. Faced with today’s unprecedented complexity and entanglement of risks, externalities, and value creation, this theory of governance is falling&nbsp;short.</p><p>Indeed, the very paradigms underpinning our property institutions have become unavailable to think with, technically, materially and ethically:</p>  Objectification: The existing paradigm of objectification of land, nature, labor and information has obscured intrinsic interdependence  Extraction: The detachment of property rights from embodied responsibilities of stewardship had caused systemic negative externalities  Centralization: The optimization of abstract, exclusive rights has led to growing concentration of means of production and the benefits derived from&nbsp;them  Control: Top-down regulatory practices have failed to manage complex conceptual systems of value creation and extraction, and their externalities and&nbsp;impacts  <p>Interestingly, the structural failure of existing property systems to respond adequately to many of our critical contemporary challenges — be it the housing crisis, COVID-19, or Generative AI — is opening up windows of opportunity for large-scale transformation. What is emerging is a <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/fc2ab4ede8e254491b3160db3fed49d060634671.pdf">new theory of change</a> where increasing and cascading crises of various forms that will have profound and tragic effects, will also create conditions to open up new imaginative and political space for alternative approaches. Preparing for these moments, and developing proactive strategies, is critical.</p> Launching Property &amp; Beyond&nbsp;Lab <p>That’s why at Dark Matter Labs we are launching <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a>: a new part of our ecosystem focused on developing the building blocks for futures of property and ownership. Property &amp; Beyond Lab aims to build a diverse and proactive portfolio of alternative forms of property, from collective ownership of land to self-owning houses, land, and&nbsp;cameras.</p>Property &amp; Beyond Lab&nbsp;website<p>Some of the questions we’re exploring:</p>  How might new conceptions of property reflect and embed a more entangled notion of the&nbsp;human?  How might we move beyond control-oriented mechanisms towards ennobling systems, leveraging distributed protocols to recognize complexity and respond to contextual needs and&nbsp;nuance?  How might we move from commoning externalities towards outcome-based governance and long-term guardianship?  How might we move beyond centralization towards distributed and peer-to-peer permissioning, verification and accountability systems?  How might we braid alternative paradigms such as Indigenous governance and rights-of-nature with property institutions?  How might we create the enabling infrastructures that allow for alternative property mechanisms to be financed and adopted at&nbsp;scale?   Our portfolio <p>To help us prepare for deepening and emerging crises, we need to delve deeper into the multifaceted challenges of property and build shared understanding and urgency.

 pdr-backend v0.3 is out! Bots do up *and* down predictions with confidence-weighted stakes. Bonus: upgrades to simulator  ## Contents<br>0. <a>Summary</a><br>1. <a href="http://d3bf">Before: One-Sided Predictions</a><br>2. <a>New: Two-Sided Predictions</a><br>3. <a>Upgrades to Simulator</a><br>4. <a>Other v0.3 Improvements</a><br>5. <a>Conclusion</a><br>6. <a>Appendix: Simulator Plots Details</a>  0. Summary <p>With <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a>, you can run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> is a key part of Predictoor implementation: it’s the GitHub repo to run predictoor bots, run trading bots, do simulations &amp; analytics, do payouts, submit truevals, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Previously, a typical predictoor bot would only submit an “up” or “down” prediction in a given epoch. As of the new <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">pdr-backend v0.3 release</a>, bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”. This reduces epoch-to-epoch variance and increases profitability.</p><p>Also, the simulator got upgraded: predictions are two-sided, the trader bot uses model confidence, and there are new plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The v0.3 release has many other improvements: in trader bots, data pipeline, UX, and core bug&nbsp;fixes.</p><p>Try for yourself at pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot&nbsp;README</a>.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Sections 1 and 2 describe one- and two-sided predictions (the before and after). Section 3 describes simulator upgrades, and section 4 other upgrades for v0.3. Section 5 concludes. Section 6 shows more cool plots from simulation.</p> 1. Before: One-Sided Predictions <p>In a given epoch, a predictoor bot would predict a direction (“up” or “down”), and stake on that prediction (e.g. 10 OCEAN if not confident, 1000 if highly confident). Call it “one-sided predictions”. The image below illustrates.</p>Prior to v0.3, prediction bots would only submit an “up” OR a “down” prediction, i.e. “one-sided prediction”.<p>The problem is: accuracy in up/down predictions is typically 50.5% to 60% max. With such accuracies, a bot is never very confident in its up vs down prediction. It can nonetheless make $ doing these predictions, but is there a better&nbsp;way?</p><p>Furthermore, if a bot gets it wrong, they are slashed the full stake amount. So there is high variance in winnings from epoch to epoch: big win or big loss. High variance hurts profitability.</p><p>Towards a better way, here’s some brief&nbsp;theory.</p>  When a bot makes a prediction, its underlying model is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli probability distribution</a> [1]. That is, there are exactly two possible outcomes, a single trial, and the bot’s model has estimated the probability of each&nbsp;outcome.  However, in the status quo code, the bot only expresses one side of the model— the most probable side — in the course of submitting a prediction. It’s leaving information on the table, and exposing itself to high variance.   2. New: Two-Sided Predictions <p>The idea of two-sided predictions is to let the bot express both sides of the distribution in the course of submitting a prediction.</p><p>For example, if the predictoor bot calculates a probability of up=60%, and therefore down=40%, and has 1000 OCEAN to stake, then the bot stake 0.60*1000 = 600 OCEAN to “up”, and 100 OCEAN to down. Therefore the bot is always on both the winning side and the losing side, pro-rata to its prediction confidence. The image below illustrates.</p>As of pdr-backend v0.3, prediction bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.<p>The winning side will be there to catch the slashed stakes of the losing side, which in turn greatly reduces epoch-to-epoch variance.</p><p>Updated AI model. Before, the prediction bots a regression model to predict a next value of BTC etc. Now, it’s explicitly a classifier model, classifying up vs. down. pdr-backend currently has two linear classifiers: LinearLogistic and LinearSVC [2]. The classifiers give probability estimates.</p><p>How it’s implemented. In a given epoch, a predictoor bots does two transactions to the blockchain. It needs two accounts / private keys, because the Predictoor contracts allow only one tx per epoch per&nbsp;account.</p><p>How to run two-sided prediction bots. First, you need to set a second account, with envvar PRIVATE_KEY2.</p> export PRIVATE_KEY=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 1&gt;<br>export PRIVATE_KEY2=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 2&gt; <p>Second, be sure to have ROSE and OCEAN, to pay for gas fees and stake respectively.</p><p>Related minor&nbsp;changes:</p>  The model-based predictoor bot used to be approach 3. Now it’s approach 2. Approach 3 is deprecated.  Approach 1 used to randomly pick an up-vs-down prediction. Now it puts 50% stake into “up” and 50% stake into “down” (50–50). Therefore it needs two keys&nbsp;too.   3. Upgrades to Simulator <p>The prediction/trading simulator pdr sim got upgraded.</p><p>First, the simulator’s bots got upgraded.</p>  Sim prediction bots are now two-sided, behaving just like in the main predictoor bots. Therefore you can do rapid “what-if” experiments in simulation, before proceeding to run a predictoor bot for real&nbsp;$.  Sim trading bots are now confidence-based. Before, the trading bot would always buy OCEAN according to a fixed amount of USD if there was an “up” prediction; and did nothing on a “down” prediction. Now, in an “up” prediction it buys, in a “down” prediction it sells, both proportional to the model’s confidence in up vs&nbsp;down.  <p>Second, the simulator’s plots got a big upgrade. There are now realtime plots of: predictoor profit vs time, trader profit vs time, model accuracy vs time, predictoor profit distribution, trader profit distribution, and a contour plot to show the model’s probability response surface. The appendix shows these in detail. Or, run for yourself with pdr sim my_ppss.yaml. Expect simulator plots to continue to evolve&nbsp;😎.</p>The updated “pdr sim” realtime plot, having many sub-plots. The appendix zooms in on&nbsp;each. 4. Other v0.3 Improvements <p>From <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3.0 release notes</a>, here’s a thorough list of&nbsp;changes.</p>  Predictoor bots: Two-sided prediction. Easy deployment of &gt;1 agents via Kubernetes + CLI; pm2 deprecated.  Trader bots: live-mocking ability, enabling “ghost”&nbsp;trades.  Simulator: predictions are two-sided. Trades use model confidence. New plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response surface. Live trading possible.  Data pipeline: better structure, with DuckDB at the core. Analytics are starting to get built on&nbsp;top.  UX: There is now proper Python-style logging. ppss.yaml tuned. Small CLI utilities added.  Core: The codebase is more robust, including greatly-expanded type-checking and several bug fixes. Predictoor and trader agents are refactored to be simpler. Technical debt is low — no small&nbsp;feat.   5. Conclusion <p>As of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3</a>, predictoor bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”. This reduces epoch-to-epoch variance and increases profitability.</p><p>Also, the simulator got upgraded: predictions are two-sided, the trader bot uses model confidence, and there are new plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The v0.3 release has many other improvements: in trader bots, data pipeline, UX, and core bug&nbsp;fixes.</p><p>Try for yourself at pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot&nbsp;README</a>.</p> 6. Appendix: Simulator Plots&nbsp;Details <p>This section gives plots from an example simulation run.</p><p>Settings. It was predicting BTC/USDT on Binance, on 5m epochs. The predictoor bot LinearLogistic model, using the most recent value of BTC and of ETH, staking 100 OCEAN per epoch. The trader used up to 1000 USD per epoch. Simulation ran for about 2000 epochs (1 week). The YAML file given below lists all parameters.</p><p>Below is predictoor profit vs. epoch. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted 915&nbsp;OCEAN.</p>Predictoor profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below is trader profit vs. time. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted $2613.19&nbsp;USD.</p>Trader profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below left is model accuracy vs time, where accuracy is the % time it was correct in predicting up vs. down. Green is the estimated value, and the grey shadow is the 95% [lower bound, upper bound] <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint.html">confidence intervals according to a Binomial distribution</a>.</p><p>Below middle and right are predictoor and trader profit distributions as 1d scatterplots, respectively.</p>Left: model accuracy vs time. Middle: predictoor profit distribution. Right: trader profit distribution.<p>Below is a contour plot to visualize the model probability response surface. We can have a contour plot because this run has only two input variables: most recent value of ETH (y-axis), and most recent value of BTC (x-axis).</p>  The model predicts a direction of “down” for any (x,y)=(prev ETH, prev BTC) in the red region. The model predicts a direction of “up” for any (x,y) in the blue&nbsp;region.  The decision boundary is white. The contours towards the white are lower confidence; contours moving farther from white are higher confidence.  The red and blue points are training data for “went down” and “went up” respectively. Being encircled by yellow means that the model mis-classified on the training data; this is not surprising because we should not expect these two input variables to fully capture the response.

<p>Happy Birthday, dear Chameleons! 🎂🎉</p><p>A year ago, on February 28, 2023, we launched the Shyft DAO Ambassador Program, and what a journey it has been! To celebrate this milestone, we’re taking a moment to look back at the incredible path we’ve traveled together this first year, filled with achievements, challenges, and&nbsp;growth.</p> Early Beginnings <p>From the get-go, our Ambassador Program was joined by more than 9o active Apprentices, all eager to support our mission. Your energy and commitment, dear Chameleons, were infectious, and quickly led to 16 of the most outstanding performers stepping up as Ambassadors by March. This number grew to 21 by April, showing just how vibrant and dedicated our community is.</p><p>In June, the Ambassadors took the lead with the #DiscoverShyft campaign, spreading the word far and wide and bringing our message to over 241,465 people across social media. That’s a real&nbsp;feat!</p><p>We also celebrated the top contributors who had the most tweets in the #DiscoverShyft campaign — a real testament to hard work and passion. @Lauriano, @October, @September, @Manusan, and @Lucas — your efforts have been nothing short of inspiring!✨</p><p>And by the end of June, we also introduced the WotNot Made of Fire Collection, the first edition of Shyft DAO NFT series for all our members. Inspired by our iconic mascot, WotNot — the legendary detective known for its magical ability to change colors — this collection represents the spirit and adventure of our community.</p> Together Forward <p>As with everything grand, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. In October last year, we faced a spooky challenge when our Discord link got compromised. Yet, our quick response and the community’s resilience showed just how strong and secure we are together.</p><p>We listened and learned throughout the year, evolving our tasks to focus more on quality than speed, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their time zone, could contribute meaningfully. Our qualitative tasks, like creative videos and insightful tweets, have brought out the best in our ambassadors, highlighting the importance of thoughtful participation.</p><p>In the first month of 2024, our spirited Festive Campaign came to a close, overwhelming us with gratitude for our community’s incredible participation.</p><p>Our latest campaign on the successful rollout of User Signing in February also proved to be a resounding success, demonstrating the power of community engagement and the sharing of knowledge.</p><p>A total of 19 dedicated participants consistently contributed to the campaign with a total of 115 insightful tweets. These tweets not only sparked lively discussions but also shared valuable insights on the importance and intricacies of user signing within our ecosystem.</p><p>This shows that the creativity and insights our community shared through tweets, videos, and memes brightened our campaigns and deepened the understanding of Shyft Network, Veriscope, and User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Birthday Gifts &amp;&nbsp;Thoughts <p>As we mark a year of incredible progress and collaboration, we’re also kicking off celebrations in&nbsp;style.</p><p>For a limited time, we will be opening up the opportunity for everyone in our community to mint special WotNot Made of Fire NFTs without needing to be on a whitelist. This is our way of saying thank you and letting everyone share in the success of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>❤️To mint, go to: <a href="https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-fire">https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-fire</a></p><p>For our dedicated Ambassadors, we have something extra special: the exclusive chance to mint WottNot Made of Water NFTs starting today. These unique NFTs are a token of our appreciation for the relentless support and commitment our Ambassadors have shown throughout the&nbsp;year.</p><p>💚To mint, go to: <a href="https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-water">https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-water</a></p><p>🔍 But that’s not all — we’re also introducing an exciting opportunity for our community members. Anyone who mints an NFT featuring a magnifying glass between February 27 and March 3 will automatically be entered into a lottery. Three lucky winners will be chosen at random to receive SHFT tokens worth 50 USDC&nbsp;each.</p><p>This journey has been made possible by every Apprentice, Ambassador, and community member who believed in the Shyft DAO mission and contributed their time, creativity, and passion to its expansion and success. Here’s to another year of growth, innovation, and community. 🎊</p><p>The <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO </a>community is committed to building a decentralized, trustless ecosystem that empowers its members to collaborate and make decisions in a transparent and democratic manner.

<p>This month Google and Yahoo introduced crucial changes to their email delivery requirements. For senders targeting individual Gmail accounts, particularly those exceeding 5,000 emails daily, Google mandates authentication measures. While Yahoo does not state a minimum sending requirement, it will align with Google’s criteria.</p>
<p>Requirements that are to be enforced:</p>
 
 Implementation of both SPF + DKIM 
 Sending with an aligned “From” domain in either the SPF or DKIM domains 
 Sending from a domain with a DMARC policy of at least p=none 
 Using a TLS connection for transmitting email 
 Valid forward and reverse DNS (FCrDNS) 
 One-click unsubscribe (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058">RFC 8058</a>) 
 Low spam reported rate 
 
<p>Full requirements can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">Google’s help article</a>.</p>
<p>What are the implications of non-compliance with Google and Yahoo’s email standards?</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the new email standards set by Google and Yahoo could mean non-delivery to Gmail and Yahoo inboxes, affecting businesses relying on email communication.</p>
<p>These new requirements aim to fortify email security globally, emphasizing industry-acknowledged best practices. Safeguarding business reputation from phishing attacks is one of the top benefits of these changes. DMARC, now a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/">steadfast requirement</a>, blocks domain impersonation, providing control over email identity. Google emphasizes the validation of sender authenticity for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Take action now: Reduce email phishing and ensure deliverability</p>
<p>Strong authentication with DMARC and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> is an important milestone for email users.</p>
<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology. Entrust also offers DMARC implementation services to help customers in their BIMI journey.

<p>Over the past few years, digital transformation has been relentless. Businesses of all sizes are at the forefront, continuously adapting to an ever-evolving digital landscape. One of the biggest challenges is managing the surge in cyberattacks, where the number and sophistication of phishing attacks have reached unprecedented levels, especially since the adoption of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/generative-ai-security-challenges-fighting-fire-with-fire/">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a> has led to cybercriminals being able to launch more accurate and effective phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>The need to protect your organization from threats has never been greater. The introduction of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has also spotlighted the necessity for data security and compliance. On top of it all, with the omnipresence of smart devices and the IoT, we’re living in an era where everything is connected. This interconnectedness, along with the growing reliance on <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25362/card-not-present-transactions--friend-or-foe--transaction-volumes-are-soaring-but-so-is-fraud">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a> facilitated by digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, accentuates the need for secure digital payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers demand secure, seamless digital experiences</p>
<p>Along with these challenges, today’s customers have become well-informed, and their demands have never been clearer. They want a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">mobile-first experience</a>, where their digital journey is seamless on their preferred device. Beyond just accessibility, they expect robust protection against fraud and the looming threats of advanced cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Speed and ease are paramount, with customers seeking frictionless access that doesn’t compromise their security and allows them to switch seamlessly from one device to another to continue their journey. Furthermore, the modern customer isn’t content with a one-size-fits-all approach. They want <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/601818?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=topic&amp;utm_content=upcoming">personalized digital interactions</a>, tailor-made to resonate with their unique preferences.</p>
<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM)</p>
<p>An effective customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution streamlines the digital onboarding process, making sign-ups both user-friendly and secure. It should support various login methods, including single sign-on (SSO), and integrate with popular social media platforms to streamline registration and login through social login. More than just managing identities, a CIAM solution enhances decision-making through intelligent access and detailed risk assessments, ensuring identity data remains consistent and unified across all platforms.</p>
<p>A CIAM solution’s impact on today’s business landscape is profound. It improves the user experience, which leads to increased sign-ups. This paves the way for building trust, as businesses can cultivate customer confidence with rigorous privacy measures and create personalized interactions. By delivering tailored services and products, the CIAM solution can boost sales and customer loyalty, while prioritizing safety through proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The Entrust difference</p>
<p>At Entrust, our vision of the CIAM lifecycle is holistic. Starting with seamless digital onboarding, our system is designed to efficiently capture and manage customer identity. Robust authentication protocols are then employed to verify user access, ensuring that only genuine and verified users gain entry. Proactive identity management provides comprehensive oversight throughout the entire customer journey, from sign-up to eventual offboarding.</p>
<p>Administration is equally paramount, with policy enforcement mechanisms and measures to ensure continuous compliance. Lastly, in line with modern demands, our CIAM system is equipped to provide tailored engagements, crafting custom experiences that build deeper customer bonds.</p>

 Oasis Sapphire-Powered Ocean Predictoor’s Growth Spurs Ocean Protocol &amp; Oasis Protocol to Formalize Ties  Overview <p>The core teams behind <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol</a> have joined forces via a formal partnership, to deepen the level of collaboration on <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Ocean Predictoor is a stack and a dapp for accurate AI-powered prediction feeds, running on Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM chain. Ocean Predictoor enables AI experts to earn significant $ by running AI prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feed$. Since launch just 6 months ago, Predictoor has grown to around $20M daily volume, and is the <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/oasis-sapphire?sort=totalVolumeInFiat&amp;order=desc">#1 dapp on Oasis Sapphire</a> in terms of volume. The success of Ocean Predictoor has spurred the Oasis and Ocean core teams to formalize their relationship into a partnership.</p><p>The first step in the partnership aligns incentives of the respective teams. Specifically, Ocean Protocol and Oasis Network have done a $500K token swap — $250K in OCEAN to Oasis, and $250K in ROSE to Ocean. The partnership is structured to quickly do many more of these going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>The next step reduces friction for people using Ocean Predictoor on Sapphire. Specifically, each team will add $250K of OCEAN and $250K of ROSE to an OCEAN-ROSE DEX pool on Sapphire chain, for a total of $1M liquidity baseline. This enables users to easily swap among OCEAN and ROSE, to further ease onboarding to Predictoor on Oasis Sapphire.</p><p>The partnership gives space for continually deeper collaboration, which we anticipate.</p> Ocean Predictoor Six-Month Snapshot <p>In the six short months since launch, Ocean Predictoor has climbed from zero to an impressive ATH of $20.5M daily volume, with a 30-day aggregate soaring to $174.97M — stats from Feb&nbsp;27.</p><p><a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=30d&amp;range-ds=24h">dappradar.com</a> has further,&nbsp;stats.</p> Roots of Predictoor Success <p>Predictoor’s success so far has a few roots. First was a new hypothesis: that the most valuable data is predictions, because they are the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">final step of the data value supply chain</a> right before action is taken and money is made. As its name implies, Predictoor focuses squarely on predictions.</p><p>Second was a focus on a vertical with high value, where Predictoor could make a difference, which has quick turnaround for users making $. DeFi meets this best. Other verticals will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Third and final, Predictoor design &amp; rollout has been aggressively crypto-native: create a game, make it easy to play, add incentives, optimize. To elaborate:</p>  We started by creating an on-chain game where people can make $ quickly, where more usage led to higher accuracy, which in turn leads to more usage. Oasis Sapphire’s privacy features made it possible for Predictoor’s game to be fully on-chain.  Then, we made it easy to play, via easy-to-run bots.  We kickstarted usage by incentivizing people to run AI-powered prediction bots, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming</a>.  And since launch, the Ocean core team has continually optimized by becoming an internal customer to pass on learnings as product improvements.   What Lies Ahead for Predictoor <p>The primary goal of the Ocean Predictoor core team is for both predictoors and traders making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. For predictoors to make serious $, traders need to spend serious $ on feeds. For that, traders need to make serious $ trading. Our first goal is to make that happen. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Results are highly promising, and getting better&nbsp;weekly.</p><p>Then, once traders are making serious $, we’ll expand the scope of prediction feeds. First within Defi, then other verticals. Imagine 10 thousand AI-powered prediction feeds spanning the globe. Real estate, weather, climate, transportation, agriculture, more. And we’ll keep scaling up, for truly huge&nbsp;data.</p><p>In short: traders serious $ → predictoors serious $ → expand&nbsp;scope.</p><p>As Predictoor traction grows, the Ocean and Oasis core teams expect to continually deepen their partnership.</p> From Team&nbsp;Members <blockquote>“Oasis Sapphire is the world’s first and only confidential EVM chain in production. This functionality was key for Ocean to ship Predictoor and grow its traction. We expect Predictoor to keep growing exponentially, and with that, our collaboration with the Oasis&nbsp;team”</blockquote><blockquote>— Trent McConaghy, co-founder of Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><blockquote>“Our entire team at Oasis is proud to be contributors to the accelerated growth of Ocean Predictoor as an important validation of the integral utility of smart contracts with customizable confidentiality. Predictoor has emerged as one of our industry’s leading privacy-preserving DeFi applications, and we are excited to see our close collaboration result in more of Web3 using this powerful&nbsp;tool.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Matej Janez, Business Development Manager at the Oasis Foundation.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The data speaks for itself: Ocean Predictoor is enabling users to make money through AI-powered prediction bots and trader&nbsp;bots.</p><p>Ocean Predictoor runs on Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The success of Ocean Predictoor has spurred the Oasis and Ocean core teams to formalize their relationship into a partnership. The first action is a token swap to align incentives of the respective teams. The second action is to create deep liquidity in the <a href="https://illuminex.xyz/swap?inputCurrency=0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520&amp;inputChainId=23294&amp;outputCurrency=0x8Bc2B030b299964eEfb5e1e0b36991352E56D2D3&amp;outputChainId=23294">OCEAN-ROSE DEX pool</a>. We look forward to build on our success with Predictoor, and to continue to deepen relations between Ocean and&nbsp;Oasis.</p><p>👉 To learn more about Predictoor, simply go to <a href="http://predictoor.ai">http://predictoor.ai</a> and see the feeds in action.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>We undoubtedly live in interesting times, at least in terms of technological innovation. And like most things in life, this can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we respond to it. Technology certainly provides new opportunities, but these are typically accompanied by a set of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the proliferation of internet-connected devices that have quickly become part of everyday life. These range from smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers in the home that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80423/enabling-the-digital-business-with-identity-for-the-internet-of-things">internet of things</a> (IoT); to automatic and remote climate control, occupancy monitoring, and smart access controls in the office; to sensors and trackers for temperature, pressure, air quality, and noise levels on the factory floor that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_securing_iiot">industrial internet of things</a> (IIoT); to patient, blood glucose, heart rate, hygiene, and mood monitors that make of the internet of medical things (IoMT).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges associated with internet-connected devices&nbsp; 
<p>While all these devices are aimed at improving efficiency, productivity, and quality of life, they all come with challenges. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">attack surface</a>, making it challenging to manage and secure every device; the lack of standardized security protocols and frameworks across these devices leads to inconsistencies in security implementations; the lack of focus on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fernandez-cuesta">security by design</a> leads to vulnerabilities; these devices often collect and transmit sensitive data, raising privacy concerns; and weak <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-based-case-for-zero-trust-authentication-eic2023">authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc71144/dynamic-authorization-management">authorization</a> mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the challenges do not end there. Inadequate network security measures may expose devices to cyberattacks; vulnerabilities introduced during the manufacturing and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">supply chain</a> process may be exploited by attacker; devices can be tampered with; managing the entire lifecycle of devices, including updates and patches; and decentralized data processing in edge computing introduces additional security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity key to addressing IoT challenges&nbsp; 
<p>Identity plays a crucial role in addressing challenges associated with IoT, IIoT, and IoMT devices. Establishing identities for devices and users can ensure that only authorized entities have access to specific resources and functionality, while identity-based access policies enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained authorization rules to improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning unique identities to devices enables secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to a network, while implementing mutual authentication between devices and the network enhances overall security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can help prevent unauthorized access to internet-connected devices by managing the identity lifecycle proactively by implementing secure provisioning processes and ensuring that devices are decommissioned when no longer in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing identities for devices (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standards-framework-non-human-identities-eic2023">non-human identities</a>) and users enables organizations to analyze and monitor behavioral patterns. Anomalies indicating potential security threats can be detected and addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can improve privacy protection in consumer-facing applications by associating user identities with devices to enable personalized services, while respecting consumer privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of standardized identity protocols such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/3083/2">OAuth</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5077">OpenID Connect</a> ensures consistent and security identity management practices for internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking device and user identities helps with regulatory compliance because it enables organizations to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards through identity-based audit logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 It is all in the approach&nbsp; 
<p>And implementing a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach, where devices are not automatically trusted and must authenticate before accessing resources, will improve security but requires robust identity management during the onboarding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity-centric approaches, therefore, can contribute significantly to a more controlled, accountable, and secure environment, addressing many of the challenges introduced by the rapid adoption of internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the international identity community at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity &amp; Cloud conference</a> #EIC2024&nbsp; in June to discuss every aspect of identity across the wider IT landscape.

<p>At Mydex, we’ve grown wary of ‘market’ talk. People often talk about ‘the market’ for this or for that, as if they have a clear, precise understanding of something definite and real. But the deeper we dig, the more we discover the opposite is usually&nbsp;true.</p><p>In fact, we’ve concluded that thinking about economic challenges and opportunities in terms of markets where firms trade things for money prices is, more often than not, a good way of not understanding what’s going on and an even better way of not seeing opportunities that lie within our grasp. Market myopia blinds far more than it illuminates.</p><p>To rise to the challenges our society and economy now face, we need to escape market myopia. This blog explains Mydex’s thinking on this issue and what we are doing to escape&nbsp;it.</p> The information challenge <p>For a market to happen, money needs to change hands as ownership of something is handed over from one person to another. For the exchange to happen, a money price needs to be put on this ‘something’.</p><p>Friedrich Hayek was the high priest of market talk. Writing in the mid-1940s, he noted that to make good decisions and execute plans effectively, people and organisations need good information. Money prices are, he argued, the key source of such information.</p><p>Hayek’s bete noir was state socialism. When he pointed out that central planners could never, ever, collect and crunch the amount of information they needed to make and implement a good economic plan, he thrust an intellectual stake into state socialism’s heart.</p><p>“There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts,” he wrote in his book The Road To Serfdom. “It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them, that decentralisation becomes imperative.”</p><p>Markets, he argued, are the best way to achieve such decentralisation. But such decentralisation generates a ‘division of knowledge’ between people, that acts as a potential source of fragmentation. It creates the need for a system of coordination which brings the separate efforts of decentralised parts together, to create a greater whole. This coordination can be achieved, he argued, by “the price system”&nbsp;… “which leaves the separate agencies free to adjust their activities to the facts that only they can&nbsp;know.”</p><p>Hayek’s was a brilliant argument that helped set the course of Government economic policies across the world to this day. But it was and remains irredeemably flawed.</p><p>Price changes, he argued, can and should “register all the relevant changes in circumstances&nbsp;…[to] provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions”. This “enables entrepreneurs, by watching the hands of a few dials, to adjust their activities to those of their fellows.”</p> Why markets never work as&nbsp;intended <p>Trouble is, the one thing price changes can never do is register all the relevant changes in circumstances that provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions.</p><p>Here are three reasons&nbsp;why.</p> Externalities <p>An ‘externality’ is economists’ jargon for a cost or benefit that is incurred by an entity that is ‘external’ to a transaction between two&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Pollution is a classic example. A producer spills noxious substances into a river. Not having to clean up his own waste means he is able to keep his costs (and therefore his prices) low. But these costs haven’t disappeared. They have just been passed on to somebody else — costs not recognised by the money price that has been paid by the producer’s customer.</p><p>Externalities aren’t always negative. They may be positive. For example, if a big new employer sets up in a town, the new enterprise attracts all sorts of other services related to and surrounding its enterprise. The result is extra employment on top of the enterprise itself, in services like food outlets, taxis and hotels for&nbsp;example.</p><p>In his writings, Hayek was well aware of the importance of externalities. “The main condition on which the usefulness of the system of competition and private property depends,” he wrote, is “that the owner benefits from all the useful services rendered by his property and suffers all the damages caused to others by its use”. (Our emphasis).</p><p>If there is a ‘divergence’ between the two, he continued, “whenever this divergence becomes important some method other than competition [the market] may have to be&nbsp;found”.</p><p>Oh dear. In making this statement, Hayek thrust an intellectual stake into the heart of his own arguments, because the way modern economies work means it is never possible for all the benefits and all of the costs of the owner’s services to be reflected in the money price. Which means that, using Hayek’s own logic, “some method other than competition” [the market] needs to be&nbsp;found.</p> Internalities <p>‘Externalities’ (both positive and negative) are one reason why the price system can never capture all the information needed for economic decision making - because externalities are ubiquitous. But ‘externalities’ are just one example of a much bigger challenge of information loss.</p><p>The genius of a money price is that it allows you to compare the values of completely incommensurate items: a pair of socks to a flight to Paris to a pizza. That’s wonderful and incredible. It’s why money prices have proved to be so&nbsp;useful.</p><p>But this genius comes at a very high price: a catastrophic loss of information. The only way it becomes possible to use one, single measure to compare diverse things like pairs of socks, flights to Paris and pizzas is to ignore everything about them which is not directly comparable. Which is&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… virtually everything, including their unique and special qualities, their utility (e.g. what they will actually be used for) and the real-world costs of producing them.</p><p>By ‘real-world costs’ we don’t mean anything measured by money. We mean physical, operational reality. Amount of time spent doing something. Amount of energy used doing it. Amount of resources used up. These are the real costs of production — costs that the money price&nbsp;ignores.</p><p>Hang on a second! Good economic decision-making depends on information about two crucial things: real-world utility and real-world costs. But these are precisely the two types of information that money-prices discard. People may use money price as a proxy for these things but, it turns out, the result is a distorting, obfuscating proxy. A blurring lens that crowds out other useful information, not than a clarifying one.</p><p>‘Internalities’ is one way to describe information about the real world utilities and costs that money price ignores. These ‘internalities’ go right to the heart of wealth creation. Why? While externalities relate to impacts on third parties not directly involved in either the production or consumption of the good in question, internalities relate to the costs and benefits of those directly involved.</p><p>By discarding all information relating to real world costs and benefits, to focus all attention on just one comparison point — the money price — the price system actually renders everything needed to make good economic decisions (and to take effective economic actions) invisible.</p><p>So, for example, if an organisation makes all its decisions based on money measures, e.g. budgets, ‘profits’ and bank balances, it is not using any of the real-world information it needs to actually understand what it itself is doing, or how to improve its operations. By focusing only on ‘what we can afford’ rather than <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘what we can actually do</a>’ — such organisations routinely end up making counterproductive decisions and taking counterproductive actions.</p><p>Carbon emissions are a good example. Twenty years ago, if you had asked ‘what are the carbon emissions of this product or that service?’ you would have been met by a blank stare. People hadn’t even thought of collecting this data, never mind working out how best to do it. Yet, now, twenty years later, many people think an item’s carbon emission is its most important metric — a metric that money price does not, and cannot,&nbsp;measure.</p><p>The catastrophic information loss perpetrated by the price system means that Hayek’s vision of markets registering ‘all the relevant changes’ in circumstances and ‘providing a reliable guide for the individual’s actions’ can never happen. Instead, it results in informationally emaciated organisations operating within an informationally emaciated economy, lacking the informational nutrients they need about real world time, energy and materials costs and real world benefits (utility) — lacking the information they need to make better decisions and to implement these decisions better. That ignore what ‘we can actually&nbsp;do’.</p> Transaction costs <p>Externalities and ‘internalities’ represent a fundamental problem for the price system. But there’s more: the costs of operating the price system itself. This is the arena of transaction costs.</p><p>Many years ago the economist Ronald Coase described transaction costs as ‘market-ing’ costs — e.g. the costs of taking something to market. This is what he&nbsp;wrote.</p><blockquote>“In order to carry out a market transaction it is necessary to discover who it is that one wishes to deal with, to inform people that one wishes to deal and on what terms, to conduct negotiations leading up to a bargain, to draw up the contract, to undertake the inspection needed to make sure that the terms of the contract are being observed, and so&nbsp;on.”</blockquote><p>Without an understanding of what transaction costs are, and what effects they have, he continued, it is “impossible to understand the working of the economic system”. He was absolutely right. Far from being an automatic guarantee of efficiency, the market-isation of economically productive activities can simply add multiple layers of extra, burdensome red&nbsp;tape.</p><p>Two important things about transaction costs&nbsp;are:</p><p>a) that the particular transaction costs generated by each item are often very difficult to isolate or measure. So they tend to get lost in blanket accounting terms such as ‘overheads’. Once again, money prices don’t represent these costs accurately.</p><p>b) the very act of putting a price on something — of ‘market-ing’ — generates many extra costs in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>You can see this if you compare the cost structure of the UK health system to the American insurance-based health system (where everything has to have a price put on&nbsp;it).</p><p>In the American system, physicians spend an average of 19 hours a week dealing with the administration of insurance claims. Administration accounts for over 27% of all costs. The result is a country with the highest health care costs in the world but among the worst outcomes. In comparison, the NHS, for all its ills, is a paragon of efficiency, partly because it avoids the (hidden) transaction costs of putting a price on everything that&nbsp;moves.</p> Market-speak as a confusion engine <p>Hayek was right when he said “some method” other than the market “may have to be found” if money prices do not capture all the information people and organisations need to make decisions. When advocating markets as the solution to socialism’s information deficit, he simply advocated another system that creates even worse information deficits. Western societies have been yo-yoing between different variants of these two flawed solutions ever&nbsp;since.</p><p>To rise to the social and economic challenges nations now face, we need to free ourselves of market myopia and address the information deficit challenge. At Mydex, we are doing our bit — by demonstrating what ‘some method other than the market’ could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Externalities People mesmerised by market-speak assume that the test of an organisation’s success is in how much money it makes: its profitability. But often a good way to improve profitability is to simply dump costs on other people, like the river polluter. Mydex does not exist to maximise money profits. Sure, to survive within today’s institutional frameworks we have to earn enough money to cover our costs. But we exist to maximise positive externalities — to create social and economic benefits for others that don’t flow back to&nbsp;us.</p><p>For people mesmerised by the money-price-market mindset, this is dumbfounding.</p><p>Internalities People who focus only on money prices and money costs lose awareness of all the information they are discarding (so can’t use). They have a huge blindspot, but they don’t even know they have it. We at Mydex are working to fill this hole and repair the damage it causes. Our data sharing infrastructure is all about information replenishment, making critical informational nutrients available (in our case, personal data) so that both people and organisations can make better decisions and implement these decisions better. We are doing what Hayek said needed to be done — but which his price system failed to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Transaction costs Everything we do is about stripping away the many layers of excess costs that are generated by attempts to put a money price on everything that&nbsp;moves.</p><p>These are just a few examples. There are&nbsp;more.</p><p>Markets are famously amoral, whereas humans judge each others’ behaviour on all manner of moral grounds. Markets have a one dimensional approach to human rights —recognising only property rights. Whereas humans recognise <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">a wide diversity of&nbsp;rights</a>.</p><p>Markets can only work if it is possible for one side to fully and completely ‘own’ the thing that’s being traded and to fully transfer this ownership to somebody else. If this can’t happen, a market can’t happen. But personal data isn’t legally owned by the organisations that collect or the individuals it relates to. So with our data sharing infrastructure, the question of ‘ownership’ of the data doesn’t even come up — so the question of ‘creating a market’ doesn’t come up&nbsp;either.</p><p>The best way of realising data’s value is to share it. So that is what we do — enable data sharing. This has nothing to do with ownership, and therefore nothing to do with ‘markets’. Nevertheless, enabling such data sharing helps unleash enormous economic value, generating real world utility and reducing real world costs — the things the price system&nbsp;ignores.</p><p>Also (by the way), markets never actually create any value in the first place. All a market can ever do is shuffle title deeds to bits of value that have already been created elsewhere — not in a market but by a producer. The focus of our work at Mydex isn’t to shuffle title deeds to value that already exists, but to enable the creation of new value — helping people and organisations use data to do better things in better&nbsp;ways.</p> Conclusion <p>The era of digital data opens up an epoch-defining opportunity to address the informational deficits created by externalities, internalities and transaction costs. But as soon as people try to shoe-horn their activities back into the price-market system, they risk squandering this opportunity&nbsp;. It was this price-market system that generated these informational deficits in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>The money-price-market mindset is the source of a dazzling, mesmerising mirage — a mental straitjacket — that obscures peoples’ vision of how the world really works and how to act effectively within it. It renders them unable to see what’s right before them, in front of their&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>We don’t dislike market-talk because we are swivel-eyed ideologues. We dislike it because we are practitioners. Our focus is on what actually works. On how to get stuff done in the real world, not a parallel symbolic universe.</p><p>When one sets market myopia aside to look at the world afresh, suddenly enormous social and economic opportunities become visible. Opportunities to do existing things much better. Opportunities to do new things that weren’t possible to do before. Mydex is making such opportunities real in one area — personal data. Our next blogs will focus on exactly how our infrastructure enables these opportunities to be realised.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/escaping-market-myopia-9a3669014dcd">Escaping Market Myopia</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Those who have been following Holochain for a while have heard of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)</a>. In short, IOEN’s goal is to support a sustainable energy transition by enabling microgrids of local renewables to collectively account for the energy they produce and to engage in the global financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, they need a way for the individuals and communities that make up these microgrids to document their energy generation in a verifiable manner.</p><p>Holochain, <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>, <a href="https://gildlab.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GildLab</a>, and IOEN have teamed up to bring a working demonstration of verifiable energy to ETHDenver 2024. This will show how you can build a verifiable data system on Holochain and connect that system to an EVM, accessing financial opportunities like semi-fungible tokens and renewable energy certificates.</p> The Demo <p>To demonstrate the possibilities of verifiable energy generation at ETHDenver we are scaling down to the human level. With an <a href="https://www.getoffthegrid.ca/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Off the Grid</a> exercise bike set up as a human powered generator, we’re asking event participants to join in and create some energy with us.&nbsp;</p><p>As the bike produces a charge it will be measured with a sensor on its way to charge a battery. This data is then fed into a raspberry pi running a Holochain app that will transmit this data to an auditable <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT</a>. To tie that particular instance of energy generation to the person riding the bike, we’ll have them scan a QR code to connect the <a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">tokenproof app</a> (which they used for their ETHDenver tickets). Along with the profile from their tickets and the measurement of energy generated, an observer will post photographic evidence of the particular person riding the bike at the particular time that energy was generated.</p><p>Then, human power credits (developed for this demo) are minted and sent to the wallet the rider connected. These are then placed into the IOEN marketplace, where they will be aggregated into IOEN renewable energy certificates (IOEN RECs), and bought and retired using IOEN tokens — showing end-to-end value, tracking and transparency of data through the Holochain app, and showcasing opportunities for liquidity in decentralized energy generation and finance.</p> Demonstrating Verifiable Data <p>The exact data fields collected are particular to this demonstration. What is important are the ways we can layer data sources, building up context so that we can verify an event that occurred in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Having multiple sources of data which authenticate the same event allows for outside observers to verify the generation of that energy, compensating the individuals who generated the energy.&nbsp; Holochain provides a self-validating system where this data can be stored and managed. Because you can audit not just storage but also actions within Holochain it allows data to be updated over time. And because Holochain uses distributed peer-to-peer networks, there aren’t the data limits or transaction costs of blockchains. Plus now with Rainlang, we can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-a-new-link-in-web3/">connect the data in Holochain to EVM transactions</a>, securely linking the financials with the data.</p><p>This system has been developed to prototype verifiable data, and these same principles can be customized to any particular use case. Different regulators need different types of information depending on the industry. The goal is to show how multiple data sources can be layered in a self-validating environment and used to connect the digital environment to real world assets. From there, systems for automated witnessing and the validation of outputs can be developed.</p> The Use Case <p>So, what is the use case at scale?</p><p>Renewable energy certificates (RECs) offer businesses a way to offset their use of non-renewable energy by supporting renewables. Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.</p><p>IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.</p><p>For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).</p><p>IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.</p><p>With integrations for tokenizing the assets almost finished, the ETHDenver demo is the prototype that shows how this will function embedded with Holochain when complete.&nbsp;</p> The Finances <p>So, what does any of this have to do with blockchains?</p><p>By connecting the sale and consumption of RECs to the financial markets of blockchains, we can open up a few new DeFi-driven opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.</p><p>Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy.&nbsp;</p> What It Means <p>IOEN is opening access to global financial opportunities and creating an economy of scale by aggregating small producers. This is part of a strategy for transition. By leveraging DeFi to finance a sustainable energy transition, the goal is to eventually move to a truly decentralized physical infrastructure for renewable energy generation. At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables. Microgrids, with mutual credit currencies to manage and account for the local production and consumption of energy, auditable at the global level, will be the DePIN future for energy. IOEN is developing the tools that will help us make that transition and build the foundations of that future. </p>

  <p>Howdy folks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce support for additional capabilities now available for&nbsp;Conditional Access reauthentication policy scenarios. Reauthentication policy lets you require users to interactively provide their credentials again - typically before accessing critical applications and taking sensitive actions. Combined with Conditional Access session control of Sign-in frequency, you can require reauthentication for users and sign-ins with risk, or for Intune enrollment. With today's public preview, now you can require reauthentication for any resource protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell you more about this capability, I’ve invited Inbar Cizer Kobrinsky, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Entra, to talk about the scenarios and configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you more about the public preview capabilities that we’re adding to the “Sign-in frequency – every time” session control in Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single sign-on (SSO) using modern authentication is like a secret sauce for productivity and security. It improves productivity because users can access applications smoothly without signing in to each one with their credentials. SSO also enhances security because it reduces the risks of credential reuse and gives you a common point for control and logging for your Zero Trust deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are situations where you may want the user's input, such as interactive authentication, before accessing a resource. One of these situations is token theft. A token theft attack occurs when threat actors compromise and replay tokens issued to a user, even if that user has satisfied multifactor authentication (MFA). Because authentication requirements are met, the threat actor is granted access to organizational resources by using the stolen token. Risk-based reauthentication policies can help lower the risk that results from a token theft, requiring threat actors to compromise a fresh token to regain system access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some additional examples of these situations, where you may want to prompt the user for reauthentication:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Accessing high-risk resources, such as connecting to a VPN.&nbsp; 
 Activating a privileged role in Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp; 
 Performing an action within an application, such as changing personal information in an HR application.&nbsp; 
 Critical actions such as Intune enrollment or updating credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Risky sign-ins, as called out above, help reduce and mitigate the risk of token theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the latest update, you now can create policies requiring interactive reauthentication for any application or authentication context protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, we’ve created a reauthentication policy for super sensitive actions, such as wire transfer. We’re using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a>, which the developer has integrated into the application. Before a user can transfer any amount from the application, they must satisfy the Conditional Access policy that targets this authentication context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Create a "sign-in frequency - every time" policy for super sensitive actions using authentication context</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conditional Access policy for this authentication context requires phishing-resistant authentication (using authentication strength) and “Sign-in frequency – every time”. The next time a user attempts to make a wire transfer, they will be required to reauthenticate with a phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: selecting the session control of “Sign-in frequency every time”</p>

 IDnow’s recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report explores the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits use risky channels. 



 



<p>2023 proved to be a monumental year for fraud in the UK. In fact, by the middle of the year, the losses attributed to fraud <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/oct/25/uk-consumer-lose-580m-fraudster-first-half-2023-romance-scam-id-theft-fastest-growing-categories">were already £580 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year was also important for the steps that the UK government pledged to take to address fraud. Chief among these was the release of its fraud strategy, which, the government hopes, will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-fraud-charter-2023">Online Fraud Charter</a> was also launched in 2023, which is a voluntary agreement between the government and technology sector to reduce fraud on their platforms and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these initiatives will hopefully go some way to encourage the public and private sector to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, they will not necessarily address perhaps the most important challenge: educating the public in a tangible, meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aim of investigating the British public’s awareness of fraud and its attitudes toward fraud prevention technology, we created the inaugural IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report.&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


<p>In the first of a three-part blog series, we explore the fraud education levels of the British population, the areas of life most susceptible to fraud, and users’ behavior around insecure digital communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing the awareness of fraud. 



<p>If there was one term that appeared to be on everybody’s lips (from the fraud prevention community) last year, it was ‘deepfakes.’ However, despite some widely circulated deepfake videos of famous politicians making headlines in 2023, we discovered that almost half (47%) of Brits said that they do not know what deepfakes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We define deepfakes as deceptively lifelike, manipulated images, audio or video recordings. The quality of deepfakes is constantly improving as computing power increases and AI advances, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and artificially created or altered material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social engineering, unlike other forms of cyberattacks, appeals to human vulnerabilities and emotions. For example, in romance fraud, the fraudster uses social engineering to build up a rapport with the victim with the intention of tricking them into registering for a service or transferring funds. Worryingly, we discovered that more than half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we did discover some positives regarding the British public’s awareness of fraud terms. A vast majority (83%) of respondents say they know what ‘phishing’ is (gathering a victim’s personal information, such as credentials or payment information, by getting them to click on a malicious link or attachment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although many respondents were not aware of the definitions of the latest forms of fraud, an overwhelming number (93%) say they are concerned about fraud in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Which industry is most susceptible to fraud? 



<p>Despite a majority (73%) of Brits believing their bank is effective in safeguarding their financial assets, three quarters (75%) of respondents said banking was the industry they were most concerned about when it comes to fraud. More than half (55%) of UK adults say they are also concerned about online shopping fraud, followed by a third of the population (37%) citing social media fraud as a worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked to assess the risk levels of different crimes: 32% think they are most at risk of someone having access to their bank account through identity fraud; another 21% of Brits think they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the different types of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other industries are also perceived as rife with fraud. Around 2 in 10 Brits are concerned about insurance fraud (19%); 14% worry about fraud in cryptocurrency, eGovernment (13%), online dating (13%), travel (12%) and telecoms (11%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover the steps that one woman is taking to expose romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Which channel is considered the riskiest? 



<p>Despite 97% of respondents knowing what identity theft means, and widespread concern about fraud in various areas of life, a third of Brits (33%) have admitted to sharing scans or photos of ID cards, driving licenses or passports via insecure and largely unencrypted channels, such as social media, email or messenger apps.&nbsp;Of these people, almost half (45%) said they were aware that these document scans or photos could land in the hands of fraudsters but&nbsp;proceeded to share these scans or photos anyway. This is a clear indicator that consumers are either unaware of an alternative way of verification (for example, via an identity verification solution) or the service they were trying to access did not offer a secure channel. It also highlights the importance for businesses to provide secure digital channels for customers to share personal information.&nbsp;</p>



 How IDnow helps prevent fraud. 



<p>IDnow offers comprehensive fraud prevention solutions to safeguard against various types of fraud, including social engineering, fake IDs, identity fraud, and much more.

             February 2024   
	 
		 
			 Why Do Asset Managers Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another significant news is Blackrock’s recent statement on tokenization, positioning it as the next step after the cryptocurrency spot ETFs. Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

<p>Dear Community,</p><p>Despite numerous challenges, Metadium has achieved grown significantly over the past 5 years. We are proud to announce unveiling our latest vision map as Metadium prepares for another leap in&nbsp;2024.</p> Mission: Metadium with advanced technology, creating a new&nbsp;market <p>Since the announcement of Metadium 2.0, the Metadium team has been dedicated to providing better services. To achieve this updates such as Fee delegation, improvements in block validation methods, and the adoption of the EIP-1559 mechanism were implemented to offer users more convenient and secure services. Additionally, various partnerships have been to expand the Metadium ecosystem.</p><p>Metadium is enhancing its technological capabilities to provide services that more users can seamlessly adopt. Through the B2G (business-to-global) model, Metadium aims to expand its ecosystem globally. Moreover, we aim to lower the barriers to entry into the blockchain environment, providing opportunities for Web 2 users to easily and conveniently experience the benefits of Web 3. It will enable Metadium to open doors to various areas, such as smart student IDs, autonomous driving, and supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Metadium seeks to create a new market through advanced technology, breaking down the boundaries between Web 2 and Web 3, and striving for a continuous effort to create a high-value-added service&nbsp;model.</p> Vision: Decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity, Innovation in Digital Identity Management and Authentication <p>Metadium Blockchain’s Identity Layer aims to achieve decentralized self-sovereign identity and revolutionize users’ digital identity management and authentication. Users can directly own and manage their digital identities, securely protecting personal information and identity data through the blockchain-based Identity Layer without the need for central authorities or intermediaries, and selectively share them only when necessary.</p><p>With the advancement of blockchain technology, damages related to virtual assets are increasing, prompting countries to introduce regulations on blockchain-based services. KYC (Know Your Customer) is emphasized as an essential regulatory element, and DID (Decentralized Identity) services can be utilized for this purpose. Due to decentralization, blockchain-based services often involve anonymous transactions, potential harming users. Consequently, regulations requiring verification of the identity of transaction initiators are gradually expanding.</p><p>Furthermore, blockchain technology faces challenges such as malicious attacks and illicit fundraising, leading various countries to implement anti-money laundering (AML) measures for virtual asset operators. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is the most active area of blockchain-based services, where KYC is emphasized as a mandatory requirement. Therefore, expanding DID services is expected to form the basis for blockchain-based financial transactions.</p><p>Metadium is striving to address the challenges experienced by users by introducing DID in various technical fields. Additionally, we pursue the B2G (Business-to-global) model and continuously improve multiple services to provide smooth services for businesses, including enhancing block validation methods. Metadium prioritizes personal data protection and user-centric services, aiming to contribute to blockchain technology’s innovation and security enhancement. Through these efforts, Metadium seeks to contribute to the development of the blockchain ecosystem and expand the ecosystem globally.</p> Metadium Vision Map&nbsp;2024 <p>Metadium is planning to enhance the blockchain network, governance changes, and expand DID usability through its 2024 Vision&nbsp;Map.</p> #Phase 1 — Chain Improvement <p>Metadium aims to improve its chain in line with the rapidly changing trends in the blockchain network. Although it already has high reliability and performance, it plans to make changes specific processes and provide additional support for ecosystem needs to prepare for future changes. Through this, Metadium will be able to reflect new technologies and service trends and be ready to apply upgrades safely and&nbsp;quickly.</p> # Phase 2 — Governance Change <p>Metadium’s upgrade begins with changes in governance. The governance operation, which allows network members to make decisions in a decentralized manner, has been validated over years of upgrades and modifications. Metadium aims to improve governance to enable decision-making on various aspects of the chain ecosystem and increase the participation of network members. The improved governance will strengthen the network’s decentralization through continuous upgrades and evolve in a transparent and reliable direction.</p> # Phase 3 — DID Usability Expansion <p>After the changes in governance and the establishment of a trusted environment, Metadium completes a trusted environment for a powerful DID service. The goal is to expand the usability of DID by broadening its scope and providing various functions through upgrades. Metadium is expected to serve as an identity layer by adding DID usage on-chain and strong connections with other chains. As the usage scope of DID expands in the on-chain environment, solutions utilizing DID transactions will increase, improving the activation of the network ecosystem and the stability of services.</p> Evolution of Metadium, easier to blockchain <p>Metadium is a project to build an innovative blockchain ecosystem based on Decentralized Identity (DID) technology and trust. To achieve this, it plans to integrate with Ethereum-based EVM blockchains to bring transactions from various services into Metadium and activate the ecosystem. Metadium aims to provide users with freedom and security, pioneering the future of blockchain by understanding the importance of identity information and enabling user-centric identity management. Additionally, the Metadium blockchain will contribute to the blockchain ecosystem through self-sovereign identity, supporting the proliferation of services that enhance decentralization and personal data protection. Metadium prioritizes users’ data privacy and security, leading innovation in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>많은 어려움에도 불구하고 메타디움은 지난 5년간 큰 성장을 이루었습니다. 메타디움이 2024년 또 다른 도약을 준비하면서 최신 비전맵을 공개하게 된 것을 자랑스럽게&nbsp;생각합니다.</p> 미션: 진화된 기술을 담은 메타디움, 새로운 시장을&nbsp;만들어가다 <p>메타디움 팀은 메타디움 2.0 발표 이후 더 나은 서비스를 위해 지속적인 노력을 기울여왔습니다. 이를 위해 Fee delegation과 블록 검증 방법 개선, EIP-1559 메커니즘 도입 등의 업데이트를 통해 사용자들에게 보다 편리하고 안전한 서비스를 제공하고자 했습니다. 또한, 다양한 파트너십을 맺으며 메타디움의 생태계를 확장하는 노력을&nbsp;기울였습니다.</p><p>메타디움은 기술력을 향상시켜 더 많은 사용자들에게 자연스럽게 적용되는 서비스를 제공하기 위한 기반을 강화하고 있으며, B2G(business-to-global) 모델을 통해 메타디움의 생태계를 전 세계적으로 확장하고자 합니다. 또한, 블록체인 환경에 대한 진입 장벽을 낮추기 위해 웹2 사용자도 웹3의 장점을 쉽고 편리하게 경험할 수 있는 기회를 제공하고자 합니다. 이를 통해 메타디움은 스마트 학생증, 자율주행, 공급망 등 다양한 영역으로 확장해 나갈 수 있는 포문을 열어줄&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>메타디움은 진화된 기술을 통해 새로운 시장을 창출하고자 하며, 웹2와 웹3의 경계를 허물고 부가가치가 높은 새로운 서비스 모델을 창출하기 위해 지속적인 노력을 기울일&nbsp;것입니다.</p> 비전: 탈중앙화된 자기주권 신원, 디지털 신원 관리와 인증의&nbsp;혁신 <p>메타디움 블록체인 Identity Layer는 탈중앙화된 자기주권 신원을 실현하고, 사용자들의 디지털 신원 관리와 인증을 혁신적으로 변화시키는 것을 목표로 합니다. 이를 위해 사용자들은 자신의 디지털 신원을 직접 소유하고 관리할 수 있으며, 중앙기관이나 중개자 없이 블록체인 기반의 Identity Layer를 통해 개인 정보와 신원 데이터를 안전하게 보호하고 필요한 경우에만 선택적으로 공유할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>블록체인 기술의 발전으로 인해 가상자산에 대한 피해가 증가하고 있으며, 이에 따라 국가들은 블록체인 기반 서비스에 규제를 도입하고 있습니다. KYC(Know Your Customer)가 중요한 규제 요소로 강조되고 있으며, 이를 위해 DID(분산 신원 확인) 서비스가 활용될 수 있습니다. 블록체인 기반 서비스는 탈중앙화로 인해 익명성을 보장한 거래가 이루어지다보니 사용자에게 피해가 발생하는 경우가 있습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 거래의 주최자의 신원을 확인하는 규제가 점차 늘어나고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>또한, 블록체인 기술은 악의적인 공격과 불법자금 조달 등의 문제를 겪고 있으며, 각국에서는 가상자산 사업자에게 자금세탁방지(AML)를 적용하고 있습니다. DeFi(탈중앙화 금융)는 블록체인 기반 서비스 중 거래가 가장 활발한데, 이를 위해 KYC가 필수 요소로 강조되고 있습니다. 따라서, DID 서비스의 확장은 블록체인 기반 금융 거래에 기반이 될 것으로&nbsp;예상됩니다.</p><p>메타디움은 다양한 기술 분야에 DID를 도입하면서 사용자들이 경험하는 어려움을 해결하기 위한 노력을 하고 있습니다. 또한 B2G(Business-to-global) 모델을 추구하며, 블록 검증 방법 개선과 사업자가 원활한 서비스를 제공하기 위한 다양한 서비스 개선을 진행하고 있습니다. 메타디움은 개인 정보 보호와 사용자 중심의 서비스를 최우선으로 하며, 블록체인 기술의 혁신과 보안성을 향상시키는 데 기여하고자 합니다. 이를 통해 메타디움은 블록체인 생태계의 발전에 기여하고 전 세계적으로 생태계를 확장하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p> Metadium Vision Map&nbsp;2024 <p>메타디움은 2024년 비전 맵을 통해 블록체인 네트워크의 개선과 거버넌스 변화, 그리고 DID 사용성 확장을 계획하고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> Phase 1 — 체인&nbsp;개선: <p>메타디움은 빠르게 변화하는 블록체인 네트워크 동향에 맞춰 체인을 개선하고자 합니다. 이미 높은 신뢰성과 성능을 가지고 있지만, 앞으로의 변화를 대비하여 일부 프로세스를 변경하고 생태계를 위해 필요한 기능을 추가적으로 지원합니다. 이를 통해 메타디움은 새로운 기술과 서비스 트렌드를 반영하고, 업그레이드를 안전하고 신속하게 적용할 수 있는 준비를 갖출 수 있게&nbsp;됩니다.</p> Phase 2 — 거버넌스&nbsp;변경: <p>메타디움의 업그레이드는 거버넌스의 변화와 함께 시작됩니다. 탈중앙화된 방식으로 네트워크 멤버가 의사결정을 하도록 하는 거버넌스 운영 방식은 다년간의 업그레이드와 변화에서 필요성이 검증되었습니다. 메타디움은 거버넌스를 개선하여 체인 생태계의 다양한 부분에 대한 의사결정을 가능하게 하고, 네트워크 멤버의 참여도를 높이는 목표를 가지고 있습니다. 개선된 거버넌스는 지속적인 업그레이드를 통해 네트워크의 탈중앙화를 강화하고 투명하고 신뢰성 있는 방향으로 진화할&nbsp;것입니다.</p> Phase 3 — DID 사용성&nbsp;확장: <p>거버넌스의 변화와 신뢰 환경의 구축 이후, 메타디움은 강력한 DID 서비스의 신뢰 환경을 완성합니다. 업그레이드를 통해 DID의 사용 범위를 넓히고 다양한 기능을 제공하여 사용성을 확장하는 것이 목표입니다. 메타디움은 온체인에서의 DID 사용처를 추가하고, 다른 체인과의 강력한 연결을 통해 아이덴티티 레이어로써의 역할을 수행할 것으로 예상됩니다. 이렇게 DID 서비스가 온체인에서의 사용 범위를 넓혀감에 따라, DID를 이용한 트랜잭션이 증가하고 네트워크 생태계의 활성화와 서비스의 안정성을 개선하는 솔루션이 될&nbsp;것입니다.</p> 메타디움의 진화, 더 쉬운&nbsp;블록체인으로 <p>메타디움은 분산 신원 인증(DID) 기술과 신뢰를 기반으로 혁신적인 블록체인 생태계를 구축하고자 하는 프로젝트입니다. 이를 위해 이더리움 기반의 EVM 블록체인과 연계하여 다양한 서비스의 트랜잭션을 메타디움으로 유입시키고 생태계를 활성화할 계획입니다. 메타디움은 사용자들에게 자유와 보안을 동시에 제공하며, 신원 정보의 중요성을 이해하고 사용자 중심의 신원 관리를 가능하게 함으로써 블록체인의 미래를 개척하고자 합니다. 또한 메타디움 블록체인은 자기주권 신원을 통해 블록체인 생태계에 기여하고, 탈중앙화와 개인 데이터 보호를 강화하는 서비스들이 보급될 수 있도록 지원할 것입니다. 메타디움은 사용자들의 데이터 프라이버시와 안전성을 최우선으로 생각하며, 디지털 세계에서의 혁신을 주도해&nbsp;나가겠습니다.</p><p>- 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-2024-vision-map-cb8e117516fb">Metadium 2024 Vision Map</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About Making Data Better episode 9, <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">“The Bigger Step: Want a Single Digital ID?”</a></p>
 The presumption of a singular ID&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new sort of attribute, a de facto ID? No, and the spectre of a singular ID distracts from the true potential of Digital ID to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.  A lot of work to clean up the ‘workflows’, the processes that run pretty much everything in the conductor, leading to better testability, better performance, and more correctness.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.2/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20240206184429">full changelog</a> or skim through the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a>. If this is your first time using 0.2, make sure you read all the way down! And apologies for the coarseness of the second link — GitHub really needs to add a feature to let you filter by <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a>.</p><p>This release is paired with new libraries, developer tools, and infrastructure:</p>  HDI 0.3.6 and HDK 0.2.6 maintain compatibility with the WASM host API.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases/tag/v0.16.9?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client 0.16.9</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/releases/tag/v0.4.5?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust client 0.4.5</a> maintain compatibility with the conductor APIs, along with the usual bug fixes and code/API cleanups.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases/tag/v0.15.2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama 0.15.2</a> has been updated to JavaScript client 0.16 to give it compatibility with Holochain 0.2, and gets a new awaitDhtSync function, bringing back a useful feature Tryorama had back in the Holochain Redux days!  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/commit/ddb8b5a950e7be81d704000e662564696bef5d6b?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc-scaffold 0.2001.1</a> generates code that uses the latest HDI and HDK to maintain compatibility with 0.2.6.  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/hc-spin?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc spin</a>, a new dev tool, spins up one or more conductors with your hApp running in them, opens up your UI in an <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Electron-based container</a> (a sort of mini-Launcher), and runs local network services.

We’re moving our UI tools back to Electron, as we’ve found Tauri’s cross-OS compatibility isn’t quite there yet. hc launch, the Tauri equivalent, is still available.  The public bootstrap server bootstrap.holo.host has been updated.  There are two new servers for the new WebRTC networking, signal.holo.host for connection establishment and turn.holo.host for traffic proxying.  There’s a new dev tool command, hc run-local-services, that will run bootstrap and connection establishment services for machines on your local network.

				  Learn why building decentralized identity functionality into your existing solutions has never been simpler with the Indicio mobile SDK.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule was implemented in the Philippines in February&nbsp;2021.  There is no minimum threshold in the Philippines for the Travel Rule to kick in, as originating and beneficiary VASPs must collect and share names and account numbers/unique reference numbers of their customers for all transactions.  The extent of information that VASPs are required to collect and share increases substantially when the value of crypto transactions exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).  <p>In 2021, the Philippines joined the Asia-Pacific Group and became a member of FATF-Style Regional Bodies. The same year, Bangko Sentral NG Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s Central Bank, released <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">Circular 1108</a> to provide guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which included the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>With that, the FATF Travel Rule went into effect in February 2021 in the Philippines. As a result, crypto exchanges and service providers are now all required to follow the Philippines Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1742507280870822106">Image Source</a>)<p>This year, the Philippines has begun tightening Travel Rule requirements even further to strengthen the country’s AML and CFT measures against any illicit crypto transactions.</p> What is a VASP in the Philippines? <p>A VASP, according to BSP, is any entity that offers services facilitating the transfer or exchange of virtual assets and is involved in the following activities:</p>  Exchange between fiat currencies and virtual&nbsp;assets;  Exchange between different types of virtual&nbsp;assets;  Crypto transfer, and  Administration and/or safekeeping of crypto or instruments enabling control over&nbsp;crypto   Complying With the FATF Travel Rule in the Philippines <p>According to the country’s Central Bank, VASPs must share the following information with their corresponding VASPs for all crypto transactions, irrespective of the&nbsp;amount:</p>  Name  Account number or Unique reference number, if that is not available  <p>However, the extent of personally identifiable information that VASPs have to collect and share with their corresponding VASPs increases substantially when the amount of crypto transaction exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p><p>In such cases, VASPs are required to collect and share the following information:</p>  Name  Physical address  Date &amp; place of&nbsp;birth.  Account number  <p>Additionally, originating and beneficiary VASPs must establish and actively adhere to strict sanction screening procedures. They must also screen all transacting parties against terrorist financing lists and adverse media&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must perform necessary due diligence on the transfer of virtual assets to and from countries that haven’t implemented the FATF Travel Rule yet. They also have to exercise caution and perform enhanced due diligence when dealing with crypto transfers using unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>The Travel Rule is part of a broader set of recommendations by the global anti-money laundering watchdog, the FATF, which included the Philippines in its ‘grey list.’ As a result of this, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines have increased monitoring in order to maintain their trade relations and gain access to international finance.</p><p>Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, have already taken similar action and have tightened up regulations on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, several countries such as Singapore, Switzerland, Estonia, South Korea, Canada, Japan, the US, and the UK have also adopted the Crypto Travel Rule and require digital asset service providers to maintain customer information and establish procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT measures.</p><p>The Philippines’ Travel Rule threshold is in line with the FATF’s $1,000 limit and more or less in conformity with other countries. In Singapore, the threshold for collecting and recording sender and receiver information is SGD 1,500 (about $1,115), while in the United States, it’s $3,000. However, in Estonia and Malaysia, there’s no minimum amount requirement for gathering this information.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While the Philippines has taken significant steps to align with international standards by implementing the FATF Travel Rule for cryptocurrency transactions, these regulations have sparked a debate about their&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By setting requirements for VASPs to collect and share detailed information on transactions, the country aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the increasing regulatory measures, including the latest tightening of the Travel Rule, highlight the ongoing tension between ensuring financial security and maintaining the open, decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency.</p><p>This delicate balance continues to shape the landscape of crypto regulation both in the Philippines and around the world. Amid this, it’s crucial for both regulators and industry representatives to remember that user security and experience should always be a priority.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What Are VASPs Required to Do Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They must collect and exchange personal information for transactions exceeding ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p> Q2: Who Qualifies as a VASP in the Philippines? <p>Entities that facilitate the transfer or exchange of virtual assets, including exchanges between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</p> Q3: What Happens if VASPs Fail to Follow the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They may face regulatory penalties, including fines and revocation of their operating license, for non-compliance with the BSP’s guidelines.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>

<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Deletion Activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard deletion activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore activity &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Group &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore user  &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore application &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete administrative unit &nbsp;</p>


<p>(hard delete not possible) &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Administrative Unit &nbsp;</p>




<p>Remove service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard delete service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore service principal &nbsp;</p>




<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal  
$deletedGroups = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsGroup  
$deletedApplications = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsApplication  
$deletedAUs = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsAdministrativeUnit 

$deletedItems = @()  

$deletedItems += $deletedGroups  
$deletedItems += $deletedApplications  
$deletedItems += $deletedUsers  
$deletedItems += $deletedServicePrincipals  
$deletedItems += $deletedAUs  

if ($deletedItems.Count -eq 0) {  
    Write-Host "No soft deleted objects found." -ForegroundColor Green  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Users: $($deletedUsers.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Service Principals: $($deletedServicePrincipals.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted M365 Groups: $($deletedGroups.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Applications: $($deletedApplications.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Administrative Units: $($deletedAUs.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  

    $report = foreach ($item in $deletedItems) {  
        $deletedDate = Get-Date($item.DeletedDateTime)  
        $now = Get-Date  
        $hardDeletedInDays = 30 - ($now - $deletedDate).Days  

        [PSCustomObject]@{  
            Id                  = $item.Id  
            UserPrincipalName   = $item.UserPrincipalName  
            DisplayName         = $item.DisplayName  
            Deleted             = $deletedDate  
            HardDeletionIn      = $hardDeletedInDays  
        }  
    }  
    $report | Sort-Object 'Display Name' | Select-Object Id, DisplayName, Deleted, HardDeletionIn | Format-Table   
    $report | Export-Csv -Path "C:\temp\softDeletedObjects.csv" -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation  
}  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This script will generate a .csv file and provide a summary output:</p>

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>

 Further Testing &amp; Enhancement Underway in Collaboration with VRS Provider Community <p>NEWTOWN, PA — February 22, 2024 — <a href="https://ledgerdomain.com/">LedgerDomain</a> and Spherity, leading providers in digital credentialing services, today announced results from their latest performance testing, exceeding the current<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/"> Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a> requirements for the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Enacted in 2013, DSCSA requires end-to-end traceability for the vast majority of prescription drug products, preventing counterfeit or illegitimate products from reaching patients.</p><p>With OCI-compliant credentials, DSCSA stakeholders can digitally interact with each other, even if they have no prior business relationship and use different solution providers. These stakeholders include Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) as defined by the statute (i.e. manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, 3PLs, and dispensers) alongside federal and state authorities and ATP Equivalents.</p><p>With 4.9 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. each year, high performance is essential to ensuring supply chain resilience and security. In rigorous testing scenarios, both LedgerDomain and Spherity demonstrated performance speeds for their VP Generate and VP Verify API endpoints at least twice as fast as the baseline established by the OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria. Under the OCI specification, both calls should average no more than 1500 milliseconds.</p><p>OCI-compliant credentials integrate with the Verification Router Service (VRS), a network designed to pass drug package verification requests between trading partners. As the recognized digital method for secure electronic message interoperability, OCI-compliant credentials also integrate with other channels, such as email and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for&nbsp;tracing.</p><p>Both LedgerDomain and Spherity continue to work closely with VRS partners to further enhance performance times to ensure real-time security and reliability. This broader effort in collaboration with VRS providers encompasses end-to-end performance.</p><p>“During the course of the current FDA Stabilization Period, solution providers are tuning up their systems to deliver the speed and reliability that the supply chain demands. We’re collaborating closely with our partners to resolve variations in end-to-end verification performance metrics as the VRS scales up through the spring.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcolgan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYPCFwBxAVNlVQWIPRuC5SrU4qYiYIRJEQ&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BWkzq0kbvQEeBllraqJpiyA%3D%3D">Alex Colgan</a>, head of marketing and partnerships, LedgerDomain</p><p>“Interoperable networks like the VRS are only possible when all stakeholders pull together. We’re working hard to further scale our infrastructure with minimal latency and maximum throughput.” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswirrig/">Chris Wirrig</a>, customer success manager,&nbsp;Spherity</p><p>“Bringing enhanced drug distribution security under the DSCSA to life has been a decade-long effort, and the VRS is a cornerstone of this interoperable ‘system of systems.’ OCI-compliant credentialing adds a digital layer of secure authentication to the VRS, so that trading partners can exchange data with confidence.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwaldorf?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACVUfMBzqFzp5bfWQydohbDTd2khyK2kLs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BhLO9w2ecSbCTnQPjw44S6w%3D%3D">Elizabeth Waldorf</a>, Director, Global Traceability and Standards, TraceLink</p><p>This progress comes ahead of the upcoming Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) Distribution Management Conference (DMC) in March, where both LedgerDomain and Spherity will be present. For more information on the OCI DSCSA Interoperability Specification and its role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, visit <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">oc-i.org</a>.</p><p>About LedgerDomain</p><p>LedgerDomain is a decentralized solutions provider focused on healthcare supply chain assurance and visibility. Their XATP solution enables trading partners including global enterprises, health centers, and independent pharmacists to comply with DSCSA requirements for authentication, enhanced verification, tracing, and saleable returns documentation — helping prescription drugs remain safe and effective for patients.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p>Spherity is a pioneer in decentralized identity and data sovereignty solutions. Their innovative technology focuses on solutions for industry use cases, that automate processes by digitizing company or product certificates and the exchange of sensitive industry data. Spherity is offering solutions for the US Pharma Industry, the global automotive industry, and has a special focus on Digital Product Passport Solutions for all ESPR-regulated product categories.</p><p>About OCI</p><p>The Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative non-profit industry collaboration formed in April 2021 by a group of trading partners, solution providers, and standards organizations to support the pharmaceutical industry in adopting credentialing and digital wallet technologies to enhance supply chain security, and thus the protection of consumers.</p><p>Building on the DSCSA statute and FDA guidances, the Partnership for DSCSA Governance (PDG), GS1 US, Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA), and OCI are the organizations that have developed and published the business requirements, standards, and specifications that collectively define the DSCSA Enhanced Drug Distribution Security (EDDS) system. OCI provides open-source specifications built on interoperable standards defined by GS1, W3C, and NIST in close collaboration with industry stakeholders.</p><p>The OCI ecosystem is open to trading partners, solution providers, associations, standards bodies and others interested in contributing to future enhancements of the architecture and use&nbsp;cases.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/ledgerdomain-and-spherity-surpass-oci-performance-standards-in-latest-api-tests-4cf6fcd9ac23">Spherity and LedgerDomain Surpass OCI Performance Standards in Latest API Tests</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF78 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
 How does this affect my experience on Bluesky? 
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
 If my experience doesn’t change, why federate? 
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
 Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon? 
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
 
 A focus on the global conversation: On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted. 
 Composable moderation: Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon. 
 Composable feeds: We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds. 
 Account portability: We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts. 
 
 So how can I self-host and join the network? 
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. If you’re excited to jump in, checkout the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">PDS repo</a> on our Github, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/UWS6FFdhMe">PDS Administrators Discord</a>.</p>

<p>January was a whirlwind month for SpruceID, as we dove headfirst into a series of impactful events, each shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its implications for society.<br><br>Let's take a moment to recap the highlights from our events throughout January.</p> January 17th: Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day <p>The start of our year kicked off with Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day in DC, an event organized by Okta Ventures that explored the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and government service delivery.<br><br>Our CEO, Wayne Chang, was at the forefront, participating in a CEO panel discussion about restoring citizen trust in government institutions. Alongside Karine Mellata of Intrinsic AI and Matt Chiodi of Cerby, Wayne articulated SpruceID's commitment to empowering users to control their data on the web, a mission deeply intertwined with rebuilding faith in governmental processes. <br><br>SpruceID also had a booth at the conference where we had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with staffers interested in learning more about verifiable digital credentials.<br><br>We were honored to have kicked off our year with this exciting event, where we were able to help educate congressional staffers on digital identity, the risks of AI related to identity, and network with others in the space.</p> January 19th: New York State Digital Identity Roundtable <p>Next on our agenda was the New York State Digital Identity Roundtable, a thought-provoking forum delving into the landscape of digital identity in New York. The event was organized by Assemblywoman Solages, who sponsored Bill A01018 which paves the way for mobile driver's licenses in New York.<br><br>SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang opened the event with an overview of digital credentials, the risks and privacy concerns that should be considered, and the importance of verifiable digital identity with the increased sophistication of AI impersonations.<br><br>Round table participants, including members of the New York government, leading tech companies, and multiple privacy-oriented and civil liberties organizations, posed crucial questions surrounding privacy, security, and inclusivity in the digital identity landscape.<br><br>From concerns about bias and exclusion to discussions about democratic oversight, the conversations during this roundtable underscored the need for robust, transparent frameworks to guide the deployment of digital identity solutions. We were honored to participate in this roundtable and look forward to continuing the conversation on many of these important issues.</p> January 25th: Milan Digital Identity Observatory Workshop <p>Rounding out our month was the Digital Identity Observatory Workshop, a collaborative event to help chart the course for the future of digital identity. CIOs and digital transformation executives from leading European multinational corporations converged in Milan to explore emerging trends, opportunities, and challenges with verifiable digital identity. Through discussions and interactive sessions, participants charted a path forward grounded in privacy, security, and user empowerment principles.<br><br>SpruceID joined virtually with a brief presentation from Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, recapping our digital identity tech, national and global trends, and emerging best practices and use cases for verifying digital credentials in business workflows.<br><br>As we look ahead, SpruceID remains committed to driving the conversation around digital identity, advocating for solutions that prioritize the rights and well-being of individuals in an increasingly digital world.</p> Stay Tuned for What’s Next! <p>January was a busy month of community engagement and thought leadership for SpruceID. As we reflect on the insights gained and connections made during last month’s events, we remain eager in our mission to build a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions. Stay tuned for more updates as we join in on more exciting events in the coming months.<br></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

  <p>Over 800,000 organizations rely on Microsoft Entra to navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, ensuring their security while enhancing the productivity of their end users. Customers have frequently expressed their desire for greater transparency into their Entra usage, with licensing being a particularly popular request. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Entra license utilization portal, a new feature that enables customers to optimize their Entra ID Premium licenses by providing insights into the current usage of premium features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide an overview of Entra ID license utilization, including what it is, how it works, and how you can optimize your license to get the most out of your Entra ID Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Try the public preview 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The license utilization &amp; insights portal is available under the “Usage &amp; Insights” blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1. License utilization insights portal under Usage &amp; Insights blade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portal would provide you with insights into the top features you’re using that correspond with your Entra ID Premium P1 and P2 licenses (as applicable). You can leverage these insights to secure and govern your users along with ensuring you comply with the licensing terms and conditions. Here is a screenshot of feature usage view you can see in the Entra portal:</p>
<p>Figure 2. Entra ID Premium P1 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3. Entra ID Premium P2 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to extend this transparency into Entra usage and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability, as well as what would be most useful to you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode we talk with Phil Windley, Sr. Software Development Manager at AWS, Cofounder of IIW, former Chair of Sovrin Foundation. We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior. We hope this an interesting episode. We’re glad we got to tell a small part of the Sovrin story as we think a lot of today’s reusable ID projects have their roots in the movement Sovrin started—including Trinsic.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Phil you can visit his personal website <a href="https://windley.com/">https://windley.com/</a> where you'll find ways to contact him, and buy his new book.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

 An Anatomy of&nbsp;Hype Image generated by&nbsp;Dell-E-2<p>Writing 310 years ago, the essayist Jonathan Swift had this to say on the art of political lying.</p><blockquote>“It often happens, that if a lie be believed only for an hour, it hath done its work, and there is no further occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too&nbsp;late.”</blockquote><p>Swift’s essay was about how clever, devious people use political lies to get their way, leaving a trail of damage behind&nbsp;them.</p><p>Enter a new political lie about artificial intelligence and NHS&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s the usual breathless stuff. “The world is undergoing the fastest technological and scientific revolution in the whole history of human civilisation, with profound implications for the United Kingdom,” gush former prime minister Tony Blair and former leader of the Conservative Party William Hague in <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/3pN0p29FVT0XV1FV9Up4MV/d2eaa86f106369827c3eed1b113c92ff/Tony_Blair_Institute_A_New_National_Purpose_-_Leading_the_Biotech_Revolution_January_2024.pdf">a new report</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>“The challenge of responding to that revolution is so urgent, the danger of falling behind so great and the opportunities so exciting that we urged all political parties to make their response to it nothing short of creating a new national purpose. We set out how the UK could harness the power of technology and reimagine the state and public services by restructuring Whitehall, making better use of&nbsp;data”.</p><p>If ‘weapons of mass destruction’ was the political lie that achieved the objective of regime change (the overthrow of Saddam Hussein), here we have a new type of regime change in sight: deposing health data as a public and personal asset and its mass transfer to the control and benefit of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p> The hype&nbsp;machine <p>Hype is the main tool of the political lie. The trick with hype is to set an agenda by mesmerising people with AMAZING Opportunities!!! while deflecting their attention from on-the-ground realities until they can’t be avoided any&nbsp;more.</p><p>Here are some of the detailed tricks of skilful political lier.</p>  Present one small part — the part you are trying to promote — as if it is the whole picture, ignoring everything that doesn’t fit into your carefully crafted&nbsp;agenda.  Exaggerate the benefits of what you are proposing to the nth&nbsp;degree.  Skim over all its flaws, inconsistencies, risks and loopholes. (Make sure you mention them briefly to give the appearance that you have thought about them, but only to brush them aside as minor, technical details to be sorted out&nbsp;later.)  Use small elements of truth to tell the big&nbsp;lie.  Craft the way you present your arguments so that the conclusions you arrive at are inevitable, given the assumptions you’ve smuggled in along the&nbsp;way.  <p>Tony Blair’s agenda for an NHS data landgrab is a good case study of hype in the service of a political lie.</p> Present a part as the&nbsp;whole <p>If you believe Tony Blair, the future of the NHS — indeed the competitiveness of the country as a whole (!) — depends on the UK taking a lead in AI (see ‘exaggeration’ below). Taking the lead in AI depends on amassing huge amounts of data to train this AI&nbsp;… which means that we simply have to hand over the nation’s health data to the Big Data experts — the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>Tony Blair writes as if the insights generated by such AI will transform the provision of health and care services. This is nonsense.</p><p>Setting AI to work on big data sets does nothing to change those areas where treatments are already well developed and understood. It does nothing to improve the operational delivery of these treatments. In other words, it will not and cannot touch most of what the NHS actually does, day-to-day. Neverthless, it is being presented as if it is the answer to everything.</p><p>In reality, what the NHS needs to transform itself — to cut costs while improving quality — lies at the opposite end of the data spectrum. It lies in new data logistics capabilities: the ability to get exactly the right personal data to and from the right people at the right times, safely and efficiently, in a privacy protecting way.</p><p>Better data logistics enables better physical logistics — improving the ways in which work is organised; finding ways to reduce time and effort spent while improving outcomes. It’s about the practical, detailed work that takes place on the front line. Nothing to do with the statistical analysis of big sets of&nbsp;data.</p><p>But nowhere in his 72 page report does Mr Blair give this very real opportunity a single mention (or, for that matter, in any of his previous reports). After all, the whole point of the magician with his conjuring trick is to focus peoples’ attention on your trickery; to deflect their attention from what’s really going on behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p> Exaggerate the&nbsp;benefits <p>According to Tony Blair, Artificial Intelligence is “so urgent and important that how we respond is more likely than anything else to determine Britain’s future.” Wow! We had better drop everything else then! Focus everything we’ve got on&nbsp;it!</p><p>But this too is nonsense. AI will never water the Sahara, achieve world peace, feed the hungry or solve the challenge of Climate&nbsp;Change.</p><p>AI currently takes two main forms: machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms and Large Language Processing models like&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>The machine learning form of AI is very good at identifying patterns and correlations in huge amounts of data. That’s great. It can be a useful tool within a well managed research&nbsp;process.</p><p>But&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… that’s about&nbsp;it.</p><p>One drawback of this form of AI is that while it is very good at spotting correlations, a high proportion of them are meaningless false positives. To make things worse, spotting correlations has got nothing to do with understanding causation. Confusing correlation with causation can — and has already — set many damaging hares&nbsp;running.</p><p>Also, this form of AI is bound by the ancient ‘GIGO’ law of computing: Garbage In, Garbage Out. Machine learning outputs are only as good as the data they’ve been trained with (by humans), and very often this data is not very good. In fact, for almost every issue that a machine learning AI is set to work on, there is far more information out there in the world that is not contained in its training sets. This means the ‘insights’ it generates are always partial and contingent.</p><p>In addition, because of the way it works, there is no audit trail as to how it arrives at its conclusions (and it may arrive at different conclusions if it crunches the same set of data a second time). On top of this, no matter how good the analytics might be, what happens in the real world depends entirely on how any resulting actions are implemented. Which has got nothing to do with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>So machine learning isn’t half as transformational as people like Blair are making it out to be. Not by a very long&nbsp;shot.</p><p>The other Large Language Processing sort of AI (the one that drives ChatGPT and its rivals) works by brute number crunching. It analyses previous bits of text (that it has been fed with by humans) to calculate the most probable next letter in a word and the most probable next word in a sentence. It doesn’t understand the meaning of anything it spews&nbsp;out.</p><p>This sort of AI is quite good at providing summaries of conventional wisdoms (e.g. the words used in texts that have already been generated by&nbsp;humans).</p><p>But&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… that’s about&nbsp;it.</p><p>It has no awareness of ideas or information that are not in the data sets it has been trained with. It cannot use its (non-existent) understanding of content to produce any new ideas. Meanwhile, because it works only by brute number crunching without any idea of meaning, it can and does invent ‘facts’ and ‘statements’ that are simply untrue — what AI practitioners call ‘hallucinations’. So, yes, it can be useful for students wanting to cheat with essays or consultants wanting to streamline their report-writing. But change how the real world actually works? Not&nbsp;really!</p><p>AI is just another of a long line of tech bubbles. They all have a common pattern. The promoter’s trick is to dazzle people with promises of wondrous change tomorrow&nbsp;… to undertake a landgrab of today’s available resources. It’s worked many times before, and it’s being tried again&nbsp;here.</p> Skim over the flaws and&nbsp;risks <p>The trick here is to present something that is extremely difficult and fraught with risk as if it were safe and easy. This way, people aren’t put off by a realistic assessment of what’s really involved in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Tony Blair’s papers are a masterpiece of such skating on thin ice. He tells us that we don’t have to worry about privacy because all the data will be anonymised. But he doesn’t provide any chapter or verse as to how this will actually work, or if (for example) this data could be de-anonymised as quickly and easily as it was anonymised.</p><p>Meanwhile, many of the promises he makes are based not on the use of anonymised data for statistical analysis but on extreme personalisation. “Over the coming decades,” he says, “AI systems will be created that can understand each individual’s composition and lifestyle, and harness that information to provide highly personalised lifestyle and treatment suggestions on demand, with little marginal cost for each additional patient.” How is that going to work if the data is anonymised?</p><p>Most of his proposals are aimed at giving ‘researchers’ access to data about people. But he never defines what a bona fide researcher is. Cambridge Analytica could have passed themselves off as ‘researchers’.</p><p>Research, he tells us, “serves a dual purpose; it is both a public service enabling technological advances and a commercial opportunity.” He makes a big fuss about the NHS being able to ‘sell’ our data to the private sector, thereby helping to fund the NHS. Really? What proportion of the NHS budget would it cover? And how exactly will this commercial opportunity be realised? By Big Tech companies using NHS data to generate new treatments, and then draining the NHS of cash in charges for access to these treatments?</p><p>Nowhere are such questions worked through. All skimming. All about making it sound both wonderful and easy. All skating on very thin ice&nbsp;indeed.</p> Use a small element of truth to tell a big&nbsp;like <p>For hype to be credible it has to contain an element of truth. People have to be able to recognise what it says and say to themselves “Yes! That makes sense!” As soon as you get their heads nodding you can use their agreement to lure them into the much bigger lie that lies behind your truth-hook.</p><p>Tony Blair’s reports use this trick often. For example, he writes that today’s fragmented system of data collection prevents researchers from “understanding how different features of a patient — their lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology — relate to one another”. Absolutely spot on. According to the World Health Organisation, 60% of related factors to individual health and quality of life are correlated to lifestyle. And he’s right. Today’s fragmented approach to data collection and use makes it impossible to join the necessary data&nbsp;dots.</p><p>This is why individuals need personal data stores, so that they can collect all this data safely. So it can be used under their control, for their&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But that, of course, is not what he suggests. The undeniable truth of data fragmentation is just a useful hook to sell his bigger lie. Fragmentation, he continues, “is limiting efforts to generalise beyond the subjects studied and holding back the transformative potential of AI.” (Back to presenting a small part of the picture as if it were the whole). Therefore, rather than addressing this fragmentation by empowering individuals with their own data, we should build a massive new centralised database&nbsp;… and hand it over to Big&nbsp;Tech.</p> Assumption smuggling <p>This entire campaign is based on a particular set of assumptions. A paradigm. This paradigm tells us that wealth can only be created by private companies making products which they sell in markets using money&nbsp;prices.</p><p>But the NHS is living proof that the ‘firms-products-prices-markets-profits’ paradigm is not the only way to create wealth and deliver value. That’s why the Big Tech companies and free market ideologues hate it so much. Because it doesn’t fit into their mental straitjacket and doesn’t serve their vested interests. It’s why all these reports’ recommendations are framed in terms of markets and monetisation: selling (not sharing) the data; ‘commercial opportunities’ (not public service); ‘competitiveness’ (who on earth is the NHS actually ‘competing’ with?)</p><p>The end result is downright insulting. “Countries that are home to frontier laboratories not only provide cutting-edge training but also exert a powerful pull for the next generation of top entrepreneurs, researchers and other globally mobile talent,” the report declares. So what about the millions of people who are not ‘top entrepreneurs, researchers and other globally mobile talent’? In other words, what about the people who actually deliver the service, day in and day out? Clearly, for the hype merchants they amount to&nbsp;nothing.</p> Conclusion <p>Tony Blair’s reports are not particularly unique or special. They are one of a genre, all of which display the same core characteristics. They&nbsp;display:</p>  unquestioning obedience to the mythology that monetisation and markets are the only way to create&nbsp;wealth  a studied indifference to the day-to-day operational realities of actually providing services  endless displacement activity that obsesses with The New! And The Cool!!! where the further they are away from day-to-day operational realities the&nbsp;better  barely disguised contempt for the people who actually produce and use the services in&nbsp;question  all for the promotion of the barely-concealed agenda of asset stripping to line the pockets of the already rich and&nbsp;powerful  <p>All bandwagons flourish by presenting a part as if it were the whole, by exaggerating the part’s benefits and by making light of the difficulties. Bandwagoneers use this heady mix to manipulate people to their own ends — to spread political lies. Today, the message that ‘AI is our saviour’ is one such political lie.</p><p>We ended our last blog on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">the NHS data bandwagon</a> by saying the people of this country deserve better than this. They do. They deserve and need to be equipped with their own data and data tools to make their lives better — not to have their data and tools to be handed over to parasitic monopolists.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-an-anatomy-of-hype-be617e1d65a9">AI — An Anatomy of Hype</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Metadium Website Update&nbsp;Details <p>Dear Community,</p><p>We are pleased to announce the launch of our newly revamped website. This website update is part of our ongoing efforts to implement the new Metadium plans and reflect the growth and vision for&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Since the teaser release of Metadium 2.0, we have been diligently establishing concrete timelines for roadmap execution and striving to develop a more secure and reliable manner. Metadium 2.0 aims to expand the ecosystem by leveraging decentralized identity (DID) for enhanced security and prioritizing user protection.</p><p>Following the announcement of the 2.0 version, we have continuously progressed in bolstering the technical infrastructure to support the ecosystem. Various policies and technological mechanisms have been considered for this leap forward, overcoming numerous challenges during the development and testing phases. We now have all the foundational technologies to move forward into the new ecosystem, prompting us to renew our commitment to Metadium and convey a fresh perspective to our many observers.</p><p>Since the completion of Metadium version 1.0, the initial ecosystem has been established, and successful experiences have been gained. Subsequently, efforts have been made to develop the technical foundation to support the expanded ecosystem with the release of version 2.0. Various policies and technological mechanisms have been considered in these efforts, and overcoming numerous variables has been necessary throughout the development and testing&nbsp;process.</p><p>From our experiences and feedback, Metadium has laid the groundwork for how the 2.0 version will contribute to building and advancing a better ecosystem. We are now fully prepared for the next leap forward, and we would like to express our gratitude to our many observers for their support and convey a new mindset as we move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As the first step in Metadium’s new journey, we are pleased to introduce the revamped official website and our new&nbsp;goals.</p> Purpose of&nbsp;Renewal <p>There are several reasons why Metadium is redesigning its token&nbsp;economy:</p><p>Firstly, the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets are undergoing rapid changes. While generating revenue from a single platform used to be expected, the goal now is to connect different platforms to create a stable consensus structure and provide services.</p><p>Secondly, in the early days of the blockchain market, there were efforts to secure users by indiscriminately providing incentives. However, user motivation could have been smoother despite these efforts, necessitating improvements. Therefore, there is a shift towards paying ecosystem maintenance costs to users who contribute to the ecosystem, providing a better reward structure or usage&nbsp;method.</p><p>Thirdly, the Metadium blockchain has seen an increase in transaction volume proportional to the number of users based on various services. Continuous efforts are being made to improve this and maintain network security.</p><p>Furthermore, the project’s goals have changed. Previously, Metadium’s Identity Layer made efforts to penetrate the market, but now the goal is to adopt a verifiable structure within Metadium and across heterogeneous blockchains.</p><p>Lastly, Metadium aims to design a system where users can contribute to the ecosystem and receive rewards by increasing ecosystem volume and creating an environment where user tokens can be meaningfully used.</p><p>For these various reasons, Metadium has decided to renew its token&nbsp;economy.</p> Contents of Renewed&nbsp;Website <p>The new Metadium website has been transformed to reflect a fresh vision, aiming to provide users with a better experience through various improvements.</p><p>Firstly, the new website offers optimized screens for users regardless of their device, accompanied by design enhancements. It ensures smooth accessibility on desktops, mobile devices, and tablets.

<p>Remember the wise words of Charles Darwin? "It's not the strongest of the species that survives," he declared, "nor the most intelligent [...] – it is the one that is most adaptable to change." This rings especially true in today's financial services landscape, where digital disruption is no longer a whisper on the wind, but a full-blown hurricane tearing through legacy systems and traditional business models. Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>

 From romance fraud to investment scams, there are a multitude of ways that fraudsters use social media to target victims. Here, we explore some of the most common and speak to one man who almost lost it all. 



 



<p>In 2024, it’s safe to say that if you use the internet, you’re more than likely to also use social media. In fact, of the 5.35 billion active global internet users, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5 billion are regular social media users.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you want to look at photos of somebody you haven’t spoken to in 15 years, swipe on photos of somebody you’d like to speak to for the next 15 years, read about the latest conspiracy theory, or apply for a job, there’s a specific social media platform to connect with old and new friends alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beauty of social media is how easily you can connect with people. Unfortunately, the danger of social media is also how easily you can, without any substantial identity verification check, create an account and claim to be whoever you want to be. Simply choose a name, select a photo and hey presto – you have an account. With just a few clicks, you’re free to contact with anyone on the internet. Free to share cat photos, argue why the moon is made of cheese, send your CV, or steal money from a complete stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 It starts with a click. 



<p>In the first six months of 2023, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers#1">$2.7 billion was lost through social media fraud</a>. Massive numbers compared to the next most common fraud channel: website and apps, which claimed $2 billion, or emails, which were responsible for the comparatively low figure of just $900 million. Little wonder, then, that for one in four people who’ve been defrauded since 2021, the initial communication began on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, it’s likely that you have already been contacted via a scammer, and you may not even know it. Here are the top three types of social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Romance scam. 



<p>Romance fraud is a type of scam initiated through social engineering, where emotional relationships are created to obtain financial gain or services. Romance scammers often use dating apps, but reports show that social media platforms are becoming even more common. While some dating apps, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/tinder-is-expanding-id-verification-to-the-us-uk-brazil-and-mexico/">Tinder are beginning to introduce identity verification</a> steps into onboarding, many do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover how one woman is exposing romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Social media account takeover fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>37% of UK adults worry about social media fraud, according to our recently released <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024</a>. This fear is well founded, as someone who has access to your social media account can gather valuable information and photos about you and your family and friends for future fraud attacks. They can also post phishing attacks and links to investment scams from your account, lending the scam a convincing air of credibility and authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 Investment scam / pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common forms of social media fraud. Investment scams are typically ‘long con’ techniques that take place over a series of weeks or months, with the fraudster slowly establishing trust before presenting the victim with an investment opportunity. Although the website and payment portals shared may look genuine, any money that the victim sends is being transferred directly to the scammer. A variation of the investment scam is the pig butchering scam, which combines elements from romance scams, investment schemes, and crypto fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 “We just clicked.”&nbsp; 



<p>Anyone can be targeted by social media fraud. Young or old. Blue or white collar. After reading our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">‘Welcome to the fraud factory: Home of the pig butchering scam.’</a> IDnow was contacted by a German entrepreneur who realized that he had been defrauded. Below, we share his story:&nbsp;</p>



 Background. 



<p>I am an executive of a tech startup based in Europe, and 2023 marked a significant turning point for our company as it transitioned into a stock corporation. As the CEO, my primary responsibilities included securing financing, managing investor relationships, and selling shares to fuel the growth of the company. The second quarter of 2023 was particularly challenging, filled with numerous investor meetings and a determined push to promote our investment opportunities through Google Ads. It was during this period that I was contacted by a seemingly enthusiastic investor over LinkedIn, setting off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the company and my personal life.&nbsp;</p>



 The encounter.&nbsp; 



<p>In early May 2023, I received a message on LinkedIn from a young lady expressing her interest in investing in our stock corporation. Intrigued by her enthusiasm and apparent financial success, I engaged in a conversation with her. We quickly transitioned from LinkedIn to Telegram, and eventually she asked to switch to WhatsApp, and we exchanged phone numbers. She presented herself as a 37-year-old, successful investor in the art industry, with numerous investments in art galleries, including one in Hamburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our conversations continued, she began sharing details about her immense wealth and philanthropic endeavors, especially her interest in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs</a>). She frequently flaunted her account balance, boasting of having millions of USDT (cryptocurrency with a value that mirrors the US dollar) at her disposal. She assured me that investing in digital artwork would be a profitable venture for our struggling company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under her influence, I started investing in digital artwork on a platform called [removed], which frequently changed its domain. As she gained my trust, she probed for information about my net worth and assets, believing she was dealing with a financially stable partner. In reality, though, our company was facing dire financial straits, and I was desperate to secure the necessary financing to prevent bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The ‘golden opportunity.’ 



<p>Then came the golden opportunity. She suggested purchasing a highly valuable piece of digital artwork, similar to the popular ‘bored ape’ NFTs, with the intention of putting it up for auction. I agreed to the purchase, spending $850,000, with the expectation that it would be sold for a substantial profit. A week later, it was indeed sold for $8,129,000, bringing immense relief as it seemed like a way to recover our company’s financial troubles and my personal investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the moment I attempted to withdraw the funds, my joy turned to despair. I was asked to transfer 20% of the auction price, amounting to over $1.6 million, to a different wallet. Subsequently, they demanded an “advanced certification audit,” requiring me to provide extensive personal information, including bank statements, the source of my funds (my house and other assets), and a copy of my passport. A few days later, I received the shocking news that my account had been frozen due to suspicion of money laundering. To regain access, I was told to pay an additional $547,000 fee with a promise of a refund upon a positive outcome of the audit. Late September marked the realization that I had fallen victim to a complex and devastating scam known as pig butchering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aftermath. 



<p>Despair took hold, and I sought help from white hat hackers in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth and recover my investments. Unfortunately, I encountered fraudulent individuals who claimed to be white hat hackers and extorted thousands of dollars from me under the pretence of uncovering the fraud. Today, the company faces imminent administrative shutdown, forcing the dismissal of all employees, and I am left with no choice but to file for insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



 What happened next? 



<p>The anonymous reader lost €900,000 in total. In the months since discovering the deception, he has contacted lawyers, forensic hackers and the police, all to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawyer offered to trace and try to find the responsible company, but as you know, they are typically not registered and change their domains every three months.”</p>



<p>Although the forensic hackers did manage to locate the Wallet that contained the funds, they were unable to crack it, due to its Advanced Information Management Security Computer System (AIM), which was installed by a cyber security group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is therefore looking unlikely that he will ever be able to recover the funds, so for the time being, he is focusing on recovering and staying positive.</p>

 What’s so social about social media fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>With <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWiv_-gKiEAxUDUUEAHatSAXcQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F12%2Flinkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OOaCHGFxTZi5nUbm6kAb_&amp;opi=89978449">recent steps by LinkedIn</a> to introduce an identity verification step, could the era of social media anonymity, which inarguably leads to the proliferation of social media fraud, be coming to an end? Considering LinkedIn’s step is only encouraged and not mandatory, the answer is probably “no, not yet…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flaws and loopholes also exist in X (formally Twitter) and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2osmUgaiEAxUgV0EAHR9SAcUQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hootsuite.com%2Fmeta-verified%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vp0omcgNlBwL9v3MzxTnu&amp;opi=89978449">Meta’s verification strategies</a>, with only paid subscribers able to become verified. Identity verification only works if everybody participates; if it is not mandatory then it’s largely pointless. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Becky Holmes, the ‘romance fraud vigilante-turned-author’</a>, the decision to offer verification for a fee is a fraudster’s dream. “Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, what’s stopping a fraudster just paying for the premium service and benefiting from the associated prestige?&nbsp;</p>



 How to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of this year. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industries, including financial services, gambling, mobility, travel, and telecommunications have all embraced the potential of digital identity verification. Some industries, like financial services remain at the forefront of digital identity verification adoption, as they are required by regulations to have certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> and identity checks in place. While identity verification can help businesses meet compliance challenges and protect their business and customers from fraud, other industries are motivated more by its ability to optimize processes and scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, until social media platforms adopt meaningful and comprehensive identity verification, users should connect with caution. Here are three top tips to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



  Stay aware.  



<p>From the latest terms, like social engineering or deepfakes, it’s important to have a rudimentary understanding of what they include, so that you can remain vigilant, and know what steps to take if you are suspicious of a new contact.</p>



  Don’t just click.  



<p>Never click on links from your social media contacts, especially if they are new ‘friends.’ Only move to encrypted channels when you are totally sure that they are who they say there are, and of their intentions. If you suspect that your friend’s account has been hacked, contact them via a secure platform to make sure it’s them.&nbsp;</p>



  Don’t send.  



<p>Never send money to a social media contact. Regardless of how many times you’ve messaged, how well they know you, or how good the opportunity is. Beware of investment platforms, and crypto payment portals, as criminals are incredibly skilled in creating fake websites.</p>

 IDnow fraud survey reveals: 33% of Brits share sensitive ID documents unprotected online, with youth most at risk. 



 



  33% of Brits have shared scans or photos of an ID card, driving licence or passport via digital channels, such as social media or email, despite knowing that these ID documents could land in the wrong hands  The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about banking fraud  Over half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is, or the role it plays in fraud, with almost half not knowing what deepfakes are  



 



<p>London, February 20, 2024 – A major survey into attitudes and knowledge around fraud in the UK has been unveiled, with findings indicating a lack of knowledge around key tactics used by fraudsters, leaving Brits vulnerable to this crime, which is seeing exponential growth.</p>



<p>Commissioned by IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider, the YouGov survey of 2,264 people has uncovered that almost half (45%) of UK adults were aware that scans or photos of their ID documents could be obtained by criminals to be used to commit fraud – yet sent the documents via digital channels, such as email, social media and messenger apps anyway.</p>



<p>Such activity could lead to identity theft, which IDnow believes should be a concern to the UK public, especially given the rise in deepfake technology. Developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) mean deepfake technology can now be used to create hyper-realistic fake documents, as well as videos. However, the survey found that less than a third (31%) of Britons know what deepfake documents are and are aware of the potential risks posed by digitally generated images of physical documents.</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow, commented: “Many of us have seen the uncanny deepfake videos of celebrities that spread like wildfire across the internet, showing how easy it is to emulate the likeness of someone using AI. But worryingly, this research suggests that the UK public is not as concerned, or aware as they should be, of the risks associated with such digitally generated images or videos.</p>



<p>“The extraordinary leaps in AI technology mean it’s now almost too easy for a fraudster to carry out financial crimes. Consumers shouldn’t make it even easier for fraudsters though. Our advice is always to think twice before sending a scan or photo of your driving licence or passport into the digital ether via unencrypted channels, such as social media or email.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, 48% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed have shared ID documents via such risky channels, compared with just 21% of over-55s, highlighting the potential need to better educate the younger generation on digital fraud threats.</p>



 Is fraud front of mind? 



<p>The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking fraud</a>, when asked about the different areas of life where fraud could occur. An additional 37% of Brits are most concerned about fraud via social media channels.</p>



<p>With 54% of Brits unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, encompassing deceptive tactics such as phishing or smishing, the majority of the population remains vulnerable to potential fraud attempts. Social engineering, one of the most prevalent and hard to catch fraud typologies, sees fraudsters manipulating trust or fear, putting consumers at risk of divulging sensitive information or falling prey to malicious links disguised as trustworthy messages.</p>



<p>In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of crime, a fifth (21%) of Brits believe they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile. In fact, social media was the primary security concern for those aged 18- to 24-years-old, with each remaining age group citing their main worry as someone accessing their bank account through identity fraud.</p>



<p>Hence, for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, three quarters of Brits (75%) would be willing to go through a lengthier online onboarding process, if this made it safer. Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, explained: “Our findings show that banks in the UK do not always go far enough to make their customers feel safe and secure. They need to go further in terms of fraud prevention technology to meet their customers’ risk appetite, especially when their money is at stake. Because, and our research confirms this, if banks get it wrong, the majority of people (54%) would consider moving banks were they to become a victim of fraud. </p>



<p>“We hope these findings highlight the massive impact online fraud continues to have on British people. Because fraudsters work across industries, regions and use cases, it’s vital we all work together – financial services, technology providers, government, law enforcement and the public – to identify and stop fraudsters before it’s too late.”</p>



 



<p>About this study</p>



<p>This release is based on data from an online survey conducted by YouGov Germany, in which 2,264 people in the UK took part between 6 and 7 December 2023. The results were weighted and are representative of the UK population aged 18 and over.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The Era of Generative AI is upon us – there is no doubt about that. After over 50 years of academic research in artificial intelligence culminating in the development of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, and then another decade of building cybersecurity products based on those methods and trying to persuade customers to finally put their trust into them… The seemingly out-of-nowhere emergence of ChatGPT has managed to achieve that overnight.</p>
<p>Instead of a grumpy, suspicious crowd not willing to let AI automate their jobs, we now see a public craze that makes the Tulip Mania of the 17th century pale in comparison. Businesses are rushing to implement GenAI capabilities into all their processes and workflows. Vendors are struggling to come up with even more potential use cases to add generative capabilities to their products. But most importantly, literally everyone is happy to consume those capabilities again and again, disregarding potential risks and challenges (including being automated out of their jobs completely).</p>
<p>Even I couldn't resist asking DALL-E to create an illustration for the previous paragraph, and the result is quite impressive...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussing those risks for business applications of GenAI is a huge topic on its own. We already hear experts talking about lack of transparency, potential biases in training, compliance issues with leaking sensitive information to third parties, to say nothing about the massive costs of running LLM infrastructures. Still, the attempts of some organizations to outright ban ChatGPT usage on their premises have already been proven futile. Just like BYOD, this usage should be controlled by a combination of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/ai-regulation-challenges-and-opportunities">government-level regulation</a> and organizations’ own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-ai-acceptable-use-policy-aup-declan-van-esbeck-q9q6e/">acceptable use policies</a>.</p>
 Generative AI for cybersecurity practitioners 
<p>Still, today we want to focus on a more specific question: does the introduction of GenAI capabilities fundamentally change cybersecurity? What practical new functionality do they offer to security experts? And what are the challenges of developing and using security tools that rely on modern GenAI models?</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the most obvious use case doesn’t even require any additional interfaces between you and ChatGPT: it’s continuous education, an absolute must for every cybersecurity practitioner. Having a virtual assistant that can instantly answer any question and free you from doing your own research is a very alluring prospect indeed. You just have to remember that ChatGPT is not smarter than you. In fact, it works much more like a room full of hyperactive monkeys with typewriters, and not everything they produce is necessarily on par with Shakespeare. When an LLM does not know something, it will happily make up a completely wrong but still plausibly-looking answer, and it is entirely your responsibility to check its validity. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Trust but verify</a>!</p>
<p>Another related area is using LLMs for creating various materials for safe simulations of cybersecurity incidents. The idea itself is, of course, not at all new – tabletop exercises, incident response bootcamps and other kinds of training are a big part of every business continuity program, but using Generative AI does not just reduce the cost of such exercises but dramatically increases the degree of their realism – after all, real threat actors are already using very similar tools for their nefarious purposes. Again, just keep in mind that the cost of an error in this business is not at your advantage – a poorly crafted spear phishing mail will only leave a hacker with a bit of lost revenue, yet a poorly designed phishing awareness exercise might leave your entire company unprotected against multiple future attacks.</p>
<p>With the tremendous improvements LLMs are now making in generating not just natural language, but application source code as well, the idea of making new software “secure by design” by replacing human developers (that make so many coding mistakes and are impossible to teach to follow security practices!) with code generated directly by an AI model is getting more and more traction. In a similar way, LLMs can be used to create more sophisticated authorization policies, generate synthetic data for security testing, etc. In a slightly less radical approach, LLMs would not outright replace humans but serve as an additional filter in an existing CI/CD pipeline to improve its coverage and efficiency.</p>
<p>To be honest, looking at the results produced by current-generation tools, I’m somewhat skeptical about AI completely replacing human developers anytime soon, but the situation might change quickly. In any case, however, there is absolutely no reason to treat the code generated by AI as inherently error-free. You’ll still need to keep unit tests, static and dynamic code analysis solutions, and a lot of other security tools included in your development pipeline. Can you delegate all these activities to LLMs? Perhaps, but should you? In the end, it is still someone’s liability, and you cannot put than on AI…</p>
<p>But wait, someone reading this might say, what about arguably the most interesting application of Generative AI – specialized security-trained LLMs built into solutions like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>? Aren’t they the real future of cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Well, I cannot argue with that… to a degree. SIEMs, XDRs, and other security analytics solutions have been relying on various AI technologies for years, and the addition of GenAI does make them better in many ways. Providing better insights by cutting through the noise, helping to make critical incident response decisions faster, improving security analysts’ productivity – all these capabilities are great improvements, but they are not what makes a security tool reliable and scalable. Microsoft’s Copilot would never be so useful without the company’s existing vast telemetry network and threat intelligence database or their own cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even Charles Babbage, the inventor of the first programmable computer, already understood the principle that later became known as “Garbage in, garbage out” – not even the most sophisticated machine can make right decisions based on incomplete, flawed, or biased input data. For Generative AI, this applies to a much larger extent than anywhere else in IT. Perhaps, when you’re choosing the next best cybersecurity tool for your organization, looking at its GenAI-powered bells and whistles should not be on the top of your list of priorities.</p>
 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 
<p>In the end, we cannot deny the fact that Generative AI is indeed a game-changer in almost every industry, including cybersecurity. And yet it is critical for everyone to understand that GenAI does not do magic. It is just a tool - an extremely sophisticated, sometimes quite delicate, and very expensive one. A crucial part of integrating these tools into your security strategy is to clearly understand their capabilities and limitations (which tend to change literally on a weekly basis). Even more important is to be aware of how both the trailblazers and ordinary peers within your industry are using them to capitalize on their experience and avoid their mistakes.</p>
<p>And of course, there is no better platform to meet those people than the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">upcoming EIC 2024</a>, Europe’s prime conference on Digital ID, Security, Privacy and Governance in an AI-driven world, which will take place this June in Berlin, Germany. I hope to see you there as well!</p>

<p>Last Friday, we <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-step-by-step-guide-on-verifying-bitcoin-non-custodial-wallet-ownership-through-user-signing">published a blog post</a> that explained the user signing process on the Bitcoin network using Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. Today, we’re going to delve into the user signing process on the Ethereum network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the type of address you want to&nbsp;sign <p>First, we have to choose the type of cryptocurrency address to sign with, which is the Ethereum network in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 2: Connect Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Next, choose one of the four wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>If you don’t have a wallet account, tap on the “I don’t have a wallet” option on the left side of the screen. This will take you to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet#main-content">the Ethereum Foundations’ list of supported wallets</a>.</p><p>For this section, we chose&nbsp;Ledger.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Live <p>Now, you have to connect with Ledger Live, which you can do either through Ledger Live Mobile or the Ledger Live&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>For this guide, we will do it through the&nbsp;desktop.</p> Step 4: Connect to User&nbsp;Signing <p>You’ll then be prompted to connect to User Signing (dev.usersigning.shyft.network). Right click on both Ethereum and Polygon “Test on User Signing” options and click on the “Connect” button.</p> Step 5: Sign&nbsp;Address‍ <p>On this page, you will also see your selected Ethereum wallet address. Click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to a pop-up screen asking for your public key to continue the User Signing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Next, you have to open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p> Step 6: Open Your Ledger Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Now open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p><p>Next, on your Ledger device, you will be asked to confirm that you are the trust anchor of this public key and you own the given&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s it. You have now finished signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>After you sign the message, you’ll get a signature proof. This confirms that you own your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>We will now see a similar process on&nbsp;Trezor.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the Ethereum Network from the two available options — Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet‍ <p>Next, select from the four available wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and Trezor. For this segment, we will choose&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Scan&nbsp;Accounts <p>Now, click on the “Scan Accounts” button to get a list of your Ethereum wallet addresses. Doing so will take you to the next screen, where Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing&nbsp;service.</p><p>On this page, you have to click on the “Export” button. This helps you verify the address you own without exposing your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 4: Choose an Ethereum Wallet&nbsp;Address <p>Now, you will see a list of all your Ethereum addresses. From this list, choose the one address that you want to use for the User Signing process and click on the “Connect” button.</p><p>Once you do that, your Trezor wallet will be connected to Shyft User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>Here, you have to click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to the pop-up screen asking you to allow signing with your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>To sign the Ethereum message, click on the “Allow Once for This Session”&nbsp;button.</p> Step 6: Open Your Trezor Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Follow the instructions on your Trezor device and confirm that you are the trust anchor and own the given Ethereum wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>Next, your Trezor device will prompt you to confirm ownership of the address and verify you as the trust anchor for the public&nbsp;key.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>The verification is now complete, generating a signature proof. This confirms your Ethereum address ownership.</p><p>📽️ If you want to watch a video of the entire process, you can find it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), ensuring the legitimacy of transactions to comply with regulatory standards such as the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining user privacy is crucial. However, this was easier said than done until <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Shyft launched User Signing</a> in late December last&nbsp;year.</p><p>With Shyft User Signing, VASPs now have a user-friendly and secure way for users to prove ownership of their non-custodial wallets.</p><p>In this guide, we outline the user signing process on the Bitcoin network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>The first step in the user signing process is to select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. In this case, we are focusing on the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step is to choose the hardware device that you will use to connect to your Bitcoin wallet. For this section, we will proceed with&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Trezor&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connecting your Trezor device is straightforward. Once you’ve selected Trezor as your hardware wallet, you’ll be prompted to connect the device to your computer and enter your&nbsp;PIN.</p><p>The service will then communicate with your Trezor to prepare it for&nbsp;signing.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing service. This is a crucial step as it allows the service to identify which address you’re proving ownership of without compromising your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>With your public key exported, the next step is to sign a message. This is done through the Trezor interface, where you will see a prompt to sign a Bitcoin message. Follow the instructions on your Trezor device’s screen to complete this&nbsp;step.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>Upon successful signing, you will receive a signature proof. This is a cryptographic string that proves you have signed a message with the private key corresponding to your public Bitcoin&nbsp;address.</p><p>Now, we will see a similar process with Ledger, another popular hardware crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. We selected the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step involves selecting your hardware device, which was Ledger in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connect your Ledger device to your computer, enter your PIN, and open the Bitcoin application on the device. The interface will then establish a connection with your Ledger and prepare it for the user signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Your Ledger will now ask permission to export your public key to the user signing service. This step is essential for the service to verify your address ownership securely.</p> Step 5: Sign the&nbsp;Message <p>Once your public key is exported, sign the message using your Ledger. Here, you will see the details of the message to sign. Now, confirm the message on your Ledger device to complete the signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>After signing the message, you’ll receive a signature proof — a cryptographic verification that you have used your private key to sign the message without exposing it. This proof is used to confirm ownership of your Bitcoin address securely.</p> Conclusion <p>User signing is a must-have for VASPs to keep transactions secure and compliant. With this guide, VASPs can help their users confidently verify their non-custodial Bitcoin wallets, making sure everyone’s on the same page with clear and secure processes.</p><p>If you wish to check the video of this entire process, you can head over here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Presented by the Accumulate Core Committee</p>



<p>A long time ago in a blockchain far, far away…</p>



<p></p>



<p>EPISODE 2023: THE DAWN OF INNOVATION</p>



<p>In the vast expanse of the digital cosmos, the ACCUMULATE protocol and its infrastructure embarked on an epic journey of transformation and growth. The stalwart team, guardians of code and innovation, delved deep into the heart of technology to enhance the very fabric of the ACCUMULATE universe.</p>



<p>With a vision to streamline the galaxy of code, they embarked on a quest to refine the simulator, a tool of immense power, to conduct testing more effectively than ever before. In the intricate dance of programming, they honed the Command Line Interface (CLI), forging it into a tool of unparalleled precision, enhancing the experience of all who wielded it in the vast transactional cosmos.</p>



<p>Amidst the network of networks, ACCUMULATE witnessed a surge of internal progress. The use of synthetic transactions, the lifeblood of healing and anchoring within the digital realm, reached new heights of mastery. This era also heralded the rise of API v3, a beacon of customizable messaging solutions, empowering developers and users alike with its adaptable might.</p>



<p>The integration of libp2p, a force of connectivity, weaved its way into the P2P network, binding the galaxy together in a web of seamless interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the realm of the Wallet CLI, a new dawn arose with the support for multiple key vaults and the alliance with 1Password, merging security with ease. The introduction of an interactive mode transformed the art of transaction signing, simplifying the orchestration of multi-signature transactions across the vast stretches of the ACCUMULATE chain.</p>



<p>As the chronicles of 2023 unfurled, it was a time of both towering achievements and formidable challenges. The journey was marked by relentless pursuit to elevate system reliability, optimize celestial operations, and uplift the user experience to new dimensions. From the enhancement of testing methodologies to the streamlining of CI processes, from the meticulous overhaul of documentation to the introduction of advanced features like synthetic message types and API v3, each step was a leap towards the future.</p>



<p>The integration of libp2p and the advancements in the Wallet CLI Tool were not mere milestones; they were the beacons of our technological evolution. As the year drew to a close, the foundations laid and the lessons learned illuminated the path for future endeavors, highlighting realms waiting to be explored and refined.</p>



<p>Thus begins the next chapter in the grand saga of ACCUMULATE, where innovation meets legacy, and the future becomes now.</p>



<p>The journey continues…</p>



<p></p>



 Protocol Core Development 



<p>Reflecting on the past year, we have seen a steady progression in various aspects of the Accumulate protocol’s core development. While there have been advancements in enhancing core functionalities and refining operational processes, we also encountered challenges that required our attention and effort. This review aims to provide a balanced overview of our efforts in testing, continuous integration (CI), documentation, and other key areas.</p>



<p>Throughout the year, we achieved several advancements, albeit with accompanying challenges:</p>



<p>1. Testing Coverage Improvements: We placed a strong emphasis on enhancing our testing coverage, which has contributed to improving the reliability and robustness of our platform. However, the complexity and breadth of the protocol meant that this was an ongoing process requiring continual attention.</p>



<p>2. CI and Deployment Efficiencies: We made strides in optimizing our continuous integration process, streamlining our development and deployment pipelines. This effort helped in quicker delivery of new features and fixes but also highlighted areas needing further refinement for efficiency.</p>



<p>3. Documentation Refinements: Recognizing the importance of clear and accurate documentation, we made concerted efforts to improve it. This remains an area of ongoing development to ensure it keeps pace with our evolving platform.</p>



<p>4. Feature Introductions and Enhancements: Introducing new features and enhancing existing ones was a focus this year. Each development aimed to meet user needs and adapt to the changing technological landscape, though some features required additional refinement post-deployment.</p>



<p>5. System Refinements and Bug Fixes: Continuous system refinements and addressing bugs were a significant part of our work. Restructuring some core code segments was undertaken to support better maintainability and scalability.</p>



<p>6. Embracing New Technologies: We continued to incorporate new technologies and methodologies, striving to keep our platform innovative. This journey brought both advancements and learning experiences, underscoring the need for balanced integration of new technologies.</p>



<p>7. Challenges for 2024: One of our challenges has been integrating and stabilizing the various innovations. The protocol experienced significant outages, prompting a renewed focus on stability and an expansion of our testing processes.</p>



<p>Reflecting on this year, we acknowledge both our technical achievements and the areas where we faced difficulties. Our commitment remains steadfast to our users and to improving our platform. As we enter the new year, our focus will be on addressing these challenges, continuing our pursuit of innovation, and further developing our platform. We are cautiously optimistic about the future and remain dedicated to making the coming year one of steady progress and growth.</p>



<p></p>



 Feature Developments 



<p>This past year, our focus has been on enhancing the Accumulate platform through the addition of new features, each designed to contribute to the platform’s functionality and user experience. While these updates mark progress in our technology, they also brought with them a set of challenges that we have worked to address. Here’s a look at some of the key developments from 2023:</p>



 Advanced Synthetic Message Type for Healing 



<p>We introduced an advanced synthetic message type to improve our system’s healing capabilities. This development aimed to establish more efficient and reliable self-repair mechanisms within our system. Moving forward, a primary goal will be to enhance the reliability and stability of this messaging.</p>



 Block Hold Feature for Enhanced Transaction Security 



<p>Recognizing the importance of transaction security, we implemented a new feature that allows for holding transactions until a specified network height is reached. This feature is designed to provide a minimum review period for signers, thereby aiming to enhance transaction security.</p>

			  Fabio Espinosa is Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hello! I’m Fabio, originally from Colombia and currently living in Madrid. I work as a back-end software engineer at Tokeny. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology and how it has the potential to change people’s lives. Now, I think it is really cool to be able to work on technology myself.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as a tech lead at another startup and occasionally freelanced through Toptal.</p>
<p>I recognized a point in my career where my knowledge growth in programming had stagnated. Despite my experience in back-end, front-end, and dev ops, the work became repetitive, offering limited space for new things, and consequently, it was not so interesting anymore. Moreover, I was managing people, which was not giving me much joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this realization that made me curious to explore something new, particularly related to blockchain. Tokeny presented itself as an exciting opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Also, it’s widely recognized that tokenization is positioned for substantial growth—something that will take off. Such advancements hold significant potential, particularly for early entrants who typically experience disproportionate gains. This trend appears to be unfolding, as we are beginning to see growing interest from new investors wanting to join the market.</p>
<p>As Elon Musk says, “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it”. I chose the latter. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>I’d describe it as responsible freedom. The flexible work-from-home policy allows me to work from many locations, provided that expectations are met. This flexibility offers a great work-life balance.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a shared sense among the team that the industry is on the verge of taking off. While the exact timing remains uncertain, we are confident that it will inevitably happen.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokeny, a company is always about its people. In that regard, everyone at Tokeny is super awesome. We know how to have fun, connect, enjoy, share, learn, be there for one another, and share a good meme on the #random channel.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>It’s hard to find the thing I’m most passionate about. I can think of traveling, exploring cultures, writing, skiing, hiking, horse riding, creating things through code, enjoying food, music, spending time with family, and being there for my sisters, trips with friends.</p>
<p>But if I were to choose one, I’d say I’m most passionate about connecting with people. I live for interesting, deep conversations. When someone shares with me a bit of themselves they’d usually keep hidden or a strange, unique way to think about something, I honor it and feel connected.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream has always fluctuated over time. At some point, it used to be about money. I wanted to be as rich as not to have to work anymore and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see it differently. I mean, money will always be important, but my ultimate dream is to be constantly at peace with myself and aware enough to be in alignment with what is true to me the most I can.</p>
<p>On my deathbed, I want to look back and know that it wasn’t the external things that moved me, but the internal things, the really important ones.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>I’d say working from home is always a challenge. I’d advise creating an environment where you can both focus, and disconnect to take breaks. It’s funny how sometimes the most productive moments come after a long, nice break when you can look at the code with different eyes.</p>
<p>Let yourself be taken through the ride and try to develop consistency in your pace of work. Everyone is there to help you, so count on anyone; they all want to see you succeed.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>It excites me to work on something different from the usual corporate environment, within a small team, with significant upside potential, and contributing to beneficial technological progress for people.</p>
<p>I’m also super excited about the next team building event; they somehow keep getting better.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Graham Williamson</a></p>Efficient, effective management of access controls from infrastructure to applications remains an aspiration for enterprises. The main drivers of this goal include the need for strengthening the cybersecurity posture, efficiency gains in managing access controls, the need for consistency in access controls across multiple solutions and layers, and regulatory compliance. Most organizations today struggle with a mixture of point solutions for managing access controls, many of these relying on static entitlements causing massive work and tending to become inaccurate. A consistent, policy-based solution for managing access controls ensures that the right people have the right access, at the right time, from the right place.

This Leadership Compass features vendors offering policy-based access control solutions and provides guidance on aligning a vendor’s solution to common corporate access control requirements.

				 <p>The Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a change to drop overdraft fees to as low as $3. The average fee for overdrafts is over $26.</p>



<p>Why this matters: Financial institution’s bottom lines will be greatly affected. We are talking about the nation’s largest banks losing roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdraft-junk-fees-banking-biden-jpmorgan-cb8b19687264c0eed757d84911b44303">$8 billion.</a></p>



<p>Who does this affect: Only “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more will be affected.</p>



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">CFPB</a>) found that applying these rules to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more covers:</p>



 
 80% of consumer deposits 



 68% of overdraft charges 
 



<p>While smaller FIs won’t be directly affected by this rule, it is crucial to stay vigilant to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reactions:</p>



 
 The banking industry is gearing up to fight back with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banking-overdraft-junk-fees-cfpb-jpmorgan-3842af05c0197cba396a9552eb4b099c">multimillion-dollar marketing</a> and lobbying campaign. 



 Banks will need to start implementing new products or campaigns to make up for the revenue loss such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/">cyber safety</a>, secure ID verification, safe browsing, and other privacy tools. (We’ll cover more on that below 👀) 
 



 Dive Deeper 



<p>The financial landscape is on the brink of change. The new rules will reshape revenue streams for banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Overdraft lending: “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule”</p>



<p>The “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule” is part of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order</a> that “Established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.” This order’s initiatives create change across multiple industries, including health care, finance, technology, and more.</p>



<p>The Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule:</p>



 
 Was presented by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 



 Wants FIs to use overdraft fees to break even by either:  FIs calculate their own costs and losses using standards outlined in the proposal.  
 
 Using the benchmark overdraft fees of $3, $6, $7, or $14. 
 
 



 Only applies to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more. 



 Change Regulation Z to expand on the definition of open-end credit: “plan” and “finance charge.” 
 



<p><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">👀 You can read the full document from the CFPB here.</a></p>



<p>Other changes for the financial space from the executive order have included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Assessing-the-Impact-of-New-Entrant-Nonbank-Firms.pdf">The U.S. Department of the Treasury submitted a report</a> to the White House Council to show that fintech needs more regulations.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/">The CFPB proposed a new rule to lower credit card late fees.</a> 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/why-were-modernizing-how-we-collect-credit-card-data/">The CFPB is making credit card comparison more accessible.</a> 
 



<p>For all banks and credit unions, these new rules can have significant impact. The CFPB is setting new standards in the FI industry, which consumers will come to expect from all FIs, no matter the size.</p>



 The Overdraft Fee Changes: Making New Revenue Streams 



<p>The proposed regulations can significantly reduce overdraft fee revenue, prompting banks and credit unions to seek alternative revenue sources. While this presents a challenge, it also creates opportunities for proactive innovation and the maintenance of financial well-being.</p>



 Privacy Tools as Revenue Generators: A Win-Win Strategy

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Japan is&nbsp;US$3000.  It has been in effect in the country since June&nbsp;2023.  During its evaluation, the FATF praised Japan’s anti-money laundering efforts and called them effective while also noting areas for potential improvement.  <p>Japan was among the first countries to recognize the potential of the decentralized crypto ecosystem and took significant measures to position itself as the world’s crypto hub. One of the measures Japan took included the introduction of various crypto-related regulations, such as the FATF Travel Rule, aimed at preventing malicious entities from exploiting digital assets for illicit activities, including terrorist financing and money laundering.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan <p>Japan legally recognized cryptocurrencies in 2016 and further solidified their status by amending the Payment Services Act in 2019 to treat crypto assets as legal property. It led to the establishment of clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, including the need for strict anti-money laundering measures.</p><p>The country later introduced the Crypto Travel Rule in 2022, requiring exchanges to share transaction data to combat money laundering. FATF Travel Rule, however, did not become active in 2022 and instead <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">came into force in June&nbsp;2023</a>.</p><p>The current threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule applies to a crypto transaction in Japan is $3000. This means VASPS must transmit the required information only if the amount exceeds this&nbsp;limit.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Compliance Requirements <p>In line with FATF’s Recommendations, beneficiary and originator VASPs in Japan must obtain, hold, and make available on request to appropriate authorities the following information:</p><p>- Name and account number of the originator</p><p>- Place and date of birth of originator as well as address or national identity number, customer identification number</p><p>- Name and account number of the beneficiary</p><p>The information makes it possible for authorities to track the transaction routes of crypto assets and stablecoins.</p><p>Virtual Asset Service Providers, according to Japan’s financial regulation PSA, are those that are involved&nbsp;in:</p><p>- Purchase, sale, and exchange of crypto&nbsp;assets</p><p>- Intermediating, brokering, or acting as an agent for the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing customer’s money in connection with all the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing crypto assets for the benefit of another&nbsp;person</p><p>Now, a recent development seeks to refine this regulatory framework further, with <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/newsletter/weekly2024/573.html">the FSA proposing</a> to simplify the Crypto Travel Rule on January 26th this year. The new draft requires VASPs to report restricted crypto-assets to a certified payment service association and publicly disclose this information. The agency is currently receiving public comments on the proposal until February 26th,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Japan’s self-regulated crypto organization, JVCEA, also noted in its “2024 New Year’s Thoughts” <a href="https://jvcea.or.jp/news/main-info/20240101-001/">notice</a> that by revising the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) to implement the FATF Travel Rule, it has become the “first major developed country to do&nbsp;so.”</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Japan, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the FSA, which is responsible for overseeing banking, securities, and exchange sectors. Meanwhile, the Payment Services Act has been applied to all crypto exchanges operating in Japan since April&nbsp;2017.</p><p>Moreover, through amendments to its Payment Services Act, Japan already requires exchanges to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering (ML) measures. Under this, crypto exchanges need to provide customer due diligence procedures, maintain records, ensure customer assets are secure, and improve their security.</p><p>Now, with the Crypto Travel Rule in place, it further tightens these regulations for crypto exchanges in Japan, as they now have to assess the money laundering and financial terrorism risks for self-hosted wallets as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The APTCP also plans to update its rules, requiring VASPs to collect sender and receiver information for transactions involving self-hosted wallets or unregistered VASPs, including when these transactions occur in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule is not yet enforced.</p><p>Although Japan does not mandate covering transactions with counterparties in locations that haven’t yet implemented the Travel Rule regulations, VASPs must still evaluate the risks and gather necessary information. To aid this process, the FSA regularly updates its list of countries that meet Japan’s Travel Rule standards.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Global Context and Comparisons <p>Japan’s Travel Rule sets a US$3,000 threshold for cryptocurrency transactions, higher than Singapore’s SGD 1,500 and Canada’s CAD 1,000, and unlike many countries that have no threshold. This stringent threshold is part of Japan’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing strategy, which <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/countries/detail/Japan.html">the FATF has deemed effective</a> while also highlighting areas that could benefit from further improvements.</p><p>Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">PWC’s report</a>, Japan is among the only 23 countries that were engaged in advancing crypto-focused regulations and legislation in 2023 across all four key focus areas: Travel Rule compliance, stablecoin regulation, licensing and listing guidance, and crypto framework development.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In conclusion, Japan’s adherence to clear guidelines for crypto companies and global anti-money laundering standards, exemplified by initiatives like the Crypto Travel Rule, reinforces its standing in the crypto industry amid heightened global regulatory scrutiny.</p> Relevant Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Comprehensive Guide to Crypto Regulations and FATF Travel Rule in Singapore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Back in March of 1950, the FBI added Willie “The Actor” Sutton to their list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. During his tenure as an American bank robber, Sutton stole an estimated $2 million ($25 million in today’s dollars) and was known for using disguises. Police officer, maintenance worker, postal carrier, and telegraph messenger were a few of the roles the fraudster assumed to execute his heists.</p>
<p>When asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “because that’s where the money is.”</p>
<p>For a modern Willie Sutton, real estate seller impersonation might be considered the latest fraud method of choice. Fraudsters are focusing on compromising the identity of property owners to sell real estate they do not own. Their goal is to collect the funds a buyer intends to use for purchasing the property before other transaction participants realize the fraudster is not the legal owner.</p>
<p>Imagine owning a piece of land where you haven’t built anything yet, and one day as you drive past it you discover that there is a construction site on it. As you finally get to speak with the person in charge of the construction, you hear them claiming they rightfully own the land, with a perfectly valid deed of sale as proof.</p>
<p>How is this even possible in 2024, you may wonder? It’s simple: With the explosion of online business transactions over the last five years, technology has made it easy to buy and sell remotely – but not necessarily easy to do it securely.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for a bad actor to find leaked data online, and to spot weak identity verification methods in a remote real estate sales process. Personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to real estate owners, loan applicants, sellers, and real estate agents is valuable to bad actors looking to commit seller impersonation fraud.</p>
<p>Seller impersonation fraud follows a specific methodology, and understanding the nuances is critical in safeguarding your organization. Our latest white paper provides more details about how it happens, the challenges it creates, and best practices you can put in place to prevent these risks without negatively impacting your sales processes.</p>

<p>Biometric spoofing, also known as biometric spoof attacks or biometric presentation attacks, refers to the manipulation or falsification of biometric data to deceive a biometric authentication system.</p>
 What Is Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive:</p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking. 
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user. 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition system</a>. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information). 
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake. 
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence. 
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface.</p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data.</p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In Blogs 1–3 of this series we have been exploring the conceptual aspects of an alternative monetary system. In this final blog, we would like to shift gear and channel our thinking into a series of practical next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;four:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (B<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">log&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?  <p>Whilst writing this post, we began to feel a niggling sense of doubt. Something about it felt quite anticlimactic. In this initiative we started with a bold vision underpinned by some detailed research of the problem space. Now, as is so often the case we are grappling with the details of how to make things happen on the ground. In the messy reality of managing relationships, roles, time constraints and funding pressures, our suggestions for a way forward seem insubstantial. Rather than trying to pad them out or use technical language to shield the lack of clarity, we have decided to go ahead and share where we actually are, both in our thinking and in our aspiration for this&nbsp;work.</p> Questions we need to begin working&nbsp;on <p>We are publishing this Blog at an early stage of our thinking. At this point our ambitions far outweigh our intellectual ability and team capacity. This is overwhelming, exciting and humbling! To break through this paralysis we are sharing some open questions based on our initial internal brainstorming sessions and responses to the previous blogs (credited below). If you have reflections or questions of your own then then we would really welcome comments:</p>  What would a low tech, minimum viable proof of possibility look&nbsp;like?  How can we use existing technology meaningfully in different contexts (for example a rural area in the Global&nbsp;South)?¹  How can we account for different closed loop systems in their own rights without going down the data rabbit&nbsp;hole?  Can we build on the energy and intelligence of the Geospatial Community to leverage data in a richly contextual yet feasible&nbsp;format?²  How can we ensure that the idea of a Bioregion doesn’t perpetuate a fractured worldview?  How do we decide which cycles or measurements are the most important for a&nbsp;region?  What are we pegging a system’s health against? How can we estimate what the optimal regenerative potential might&nbsp;be?  What can people do with the individual tokens that they receive? Why would anyone want to take part in a&nbsp;project?  How will the main RegenCoins be exchanged both within and outside of the&nbsp;region?  What can we learn from previous attempts to implement local currencies such as those pioneered by the Transition Town Network?³  How can we make sure that the ability for different people to earn tokens is fair? For example, if somebody lives close to a river it might be easier to demonstrate acts of care than for somebody who lives further&nbsp;away.   Existing technology, tools and research that we can build&nbsp;on <p>We are both sure (and hugely relieved) that we are far from the first people to explore this subject. Many of the ideas outlined in the previous blogs have been inspired by the work of others, and we will continue to learn and incorporate as many diverse perspectives as possible. As we move towards our first prototype we have identified a number of initiatives that we think will provide invaluable insights:</p>  Using market based credit platforms as a basis for quantifying living systems: the level of data being collected is already significant. For example the<a href="https://seed-index.com/"> Seed Biocomplexity Index</a> has been developed to link geospatial satellite data with scientific literature. Another example is the <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> which describes itself as ‘a platform to originate and invest in high-integrity carbon and biodiversity credits from ecological regeneration projects’. Although we are categorically not looking to price elements of the bioregion, the research underpinning some of the Network’s projects (e.g. pollinator health) could be a powerful learning framework. We are also interested to learn from less established initiatives such as land trust tokens being linked to river basin resilience programmes in South&nbsp;Africa¹.  Taxes pegged to positive activities: we hope to learn from proposals for tax incentive schemes that are specifically designed to encourage stewardship activities. An example is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4524897">Malta Atlantica Restoration Currency</a> that is being proposed in&nbsp;Brazil.  Universal basic income / services pilots: there are a number of live and closed UBI/S pilots that we are intrigued to learn from. Of particular interest is to try to understand how people’s behaviour and perception of value is affected, when the link between monetary transactions and daily activities is less&nbsp;linear.³  Statistical forecasting models used in decision making: there is an exciting body of research emerging in the context of applying <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1128055/full">Bayesian forecasting techniques to environmental modelling</a>. We are imagining that this might link closely to crypto economic research currently being conducted at hubs such as WU Vienna and ETH Zurich⁴. Partnering with an academic centre to bring their research into our prototype will be a priority.  Relational, flow based technology: the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/">Holochain Community</a> has developed a number of different peer-to-peer tools and resources that have strong value alignment with this proposal. In particular, the <a href="https://hrea.io/">hREA value flows specification</a> could provide a scaffold to connect the different activities that we would like to&nbsp;explore.  Currency and token design: community experts such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artbrock/">Arthur Brock</a> and <a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/">Grace Rachmany</a> have deep knowledge and experience with alternative currency design. We would aim to consult and build on this expertise rather than trying to reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.  Thrutopia storytelling: the novelist and podcast host Manda Scott describes <a href="https://thrutopia.life/">Thrutopias</a> as ‘clear, engaging routes through to a world we’d all be proud to bequeath to future generations’. As we strive to test pathways in the present, we do not want to lose touch with the imaginative potential that we started to engage with in Blog 3. Prominent authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson⁵ and Yanis Varoufakis⁶ have explored ideas such as a carbon coin and free PerCap accounts within sci-fi narratives, and we will seek to engage with emerging writing in this&nbsp;field.⁷   A prototype proposition <p>As an initial call to action, we would like to partner with a community (or a number of communities) to build the foundations for the world’s first decentralised, bioregional bank. To make the project realistic we imagine that the areas involved will need to be small enough to make the data capture manageable. However they will also need to represent a number of different biophysical and social cycles to ensure a meaningful entangled value interaction is captured. It will also be important to engage with a supportive governance and legal environment for some stages of the work, to ground the prototype in the reality of the existing&nbsp;system.</p><p>We would invite interested communities and collaborators to self-select as high levels of trust and value alignment will be fundamental pillars of success. We will therefore be circulating these blogs and having conversations with a number of potential demonstrator locations. It feels important to clearly state that we do not have the financial resources at this point to pay people for their help. This is difficult and at times feels uncomfortable; the fear is that we may unwittingly perpetuate extractive behaviour in the pursuit of a regenerative goal. We are trying to balance our commitment to push this thinking forward, with a deep sense of respect for our ecosystem and will continually review the relationship between the two for signs of&nbsp;stress.</p>Credit: Eunji Kang, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs<p>The prototype will be designed as 7 interlinked stages:</p>  Value mapping: here we will select a number of elements to visualise. The mix will depend on the location but could include a combination of air and water quality, soil health, biodiversity resilience, equity, care and trust. The mapping is likely to combine geospatial data with interviews, surveys and participatory workshops.  Real time sensory data gathering: based on the value mapping we will investigate the best ways of capturing the relational flows that define our selected elements. For some flows, sensors will already be in place whilst for others the process will be participatory.  Multivalent currency design and use: once we have an understanding of how value is being both created and eroded in our ecosystem, we will attempt to design self-regulating currencies to represent these multivalent flows.  Building a probabilistic model based on data inputs: this stage will combine the data and knowledge gained to simulate how the different elements are impacting on each other. The model will be interactive and infer each forecast from an updated understanding of the underlying systems.  Linking the model to governance decisions: this phase will focus on the interaction between the living agents and the value simulation. It will involve using the model to process multiple data inputs to inform a number of decisions. The outputs will be tested with the community to assess how accurately their views and values are being represented.  Creating a feedback loop between decisions and currency levels: as the system becomes more refined, the collective decisions can be used to adjust the currency levels of the base elements.  Grounding the results in regulatory or policy instruments: we will strive to link the multi-sensory decision making capabilities that have been co-developed with the community, to real world impacts. We hope that this might be achieved by testing a cross boundary tax payable in one (or a blend) of the new currencies. Another idea is to link the currencies to specific policy issues to elevate the agency and collective voice of the community. This second point has a strong link to the work that we have been prototyping in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view?usp=sharing">Sweden</a>, Scotland and Canada to create multi-sensory, living indicators.  <p>We don’t know the exact details of how the above will be achieved but we are confident that the collective knowledge and tools are already available. The steps need not be taken consecutively and we imagine that different elements can be worked on across multiple contexts and time frames. A big part of this journey will be connecting people, ideas and technologies to work towards this common goal.

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>

 What is Customer Authentication? 



<p>Customer authentication is a critical security process that identifies and verifies users before allowing them access to digital accounts. It’s built on login credentials established during user onboarding, utilizing a blend of knowledge-based (passwords), possession-based (security tokens), and inherence-based (biometrics) authenticators. The adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become standard practice, requiring users to provide multiple identity proofs to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.</p>



<p>This security measure is essential for protecting against common threats like account takeover attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Despite the prevalence of password-based systems, their effectiveness is compromised by common security pitfalls, such as the reuse of passwords. Therefore, more advanced authentication methods, including MFA and adaptive authentication, are increasingly important. These methods assess risk levels and adjust security measures dynamically, improving the security posture without compromising user experience. New technologies like FIDO2 passkeys and biometric authentication pave the way toward more secure, passwordless authentication methods, emphasizing ease of use and improved security.</p>



<p>Customer authentication is a crucial building block gatekeeper for user data and access in digital security. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, customer authentication methods have also undergone significant advancements, aiming to strike a balance between robust security and user-friendliness. This balance helps to ensure that authorized users can easily access the digital world while maintaining the highest level of security measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

 System to achieve full compliance of Crypto Asset Service Providers and self-hosted wallets with AML regulations and the Transfer of Funds Regulation&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>



<p>“Bloom is excited to be collaborating with the partners in this consortium. This project will ensure our users and the crypto ecosystem can benefit from a self-hosted wallet that complies with EU regulations,” says Nicole O’Brien, Co-founder of Bloom Labs.</p>



<p>“We’re proud to be part of this groundbreaking consortium, leveraging SPYCE.5’s hybrid chain architecture to navigate the complex landscape of EU regulations. Our innovative approach ensures not only compliance but also maintains the integrity and efficiency vital in the crypto space,” says Holger Köther, Managing Director of SPYCE.5.</p>

<p>A campaign to privatise NHS health data — your data — is now under way and building momentum.</p><p>It started in earnest in November 2023, when the Government handed a £330m contract to the US spyware firm Palantir to build a ‘federated data platform’ that will enable NHS trusts and regional health systems to share confidential patient information. Then, last week, The Times ran a front page story calling for the creation of ‘digital health passports’ which would take this process much&nbsp;further.</p><p>The week before that, former prime minister Tony Blair and former Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague joined forces <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/3pN0p29FVT0XV1FV9Up4MV/d2eaa86f106369827c3eed1b113c92ff/Tony_Blair_Institute_A_New_National_Purpose_-_Leading_the_Biotech_Revolution_January_2024.pdf">in a report</a> calling for the creation of an NHS Data Trust. This Trust would gather individuals health data from many different sources (e.g. NHS Trusts, GPs, care services, pharmacists), assemble it in one place and sell it to Big Tech firms in the private&nbsp;sector.</p> How to build a bandwagon <p>Bandwagons wreak untold damage by following these basic four&nbsp;steps:</p><p>1) Admit there’s a problem with something you’ve been stubbornly ignoring for years. The NHS tells us that its new Federated Data Platform is needed because, historically, data was “held in different systems that didn’t speak to each other, creating burdens for staff and delays to patient care” and making it “difficult to work at scale and share information”. People (including us at Mydex) have been complaining about this for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>2) Wax lyrical about all the benefits that would flow if this problem was addressed. The NHS promises that improved data sharing will “bring big benefits for patients by ensuring more joined up care, greater choice and improved health outcomes”.</p><p>The Times <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24398476/times-health-commission_report_2024.pdf">Health Commission</a>, whose work is the subject of its front page article, tells us that by enabling patients to “have their health information digitally stored in one place any doctor treating them can access their records no matter where they are”. Patients would gain access to their own medical records, and be able to use the system as a gateway to book appointments, order prescriptions, view test results and contact&nbsp;doctors.</p><p>What’s not to like? We at Mydex CIC have been banging on about exactly these things for many years&nbsp;now.</p> Bait and&nbsp;switch <p>Then comes the crucial third step. 3) Propose a solution which seems to solve the problem but which doesn’t — which delivers an entirely different outcome instead. This is the crucial bait and switch; the secret sauce of every successful bandwagon.</p><p>The fourth step then follows so smoothly it’s almost automatic. 4) Use the excitement and enthusiasm generated for the benefits you are promising to implement the bait-and-switch solution — to deliver an entirely different outcome.</p><p>The likely end result in this case&nbsp;is:</p>  Huge amounts of available time, effort, energy and resources squandered on white elephant IT projects that never delivers their&nbsp;promise.  A raft of other ‘unintended’ consequences, such as handing over one of the country’s — and your — most valuable assets to big US tech monopolies.  <p>The trick with all such bandwagons is to exploit peoples’ best intentions — to harness their enthusiasm, commitment and energy — and to use this enthusiasm and energy for your own purposes, leaving them to suffer the consequences and clear up the&nbsp;mess.</p><p>In this case, it is absolutely right and necessary that available data is shared to generate more efficient joined up, seamless services that deliver better outcomes. But the solutions being proposed will do the exact opposite. Instead, they will neatly assemble our personal data into juicy packages and deliver them on a plate, ready and waiting for Big Tech vultures to&nbsp;pounce.</p> Real and pretend solutions <p>There are basically two different ways to share data: the centralised organisation-centric way, and the distributed, decentralised person-centric way.</p><p>This bandwagon is all about promising the benefits of the person-centric approach while delivering its opposite: recreating, deepening and extending the centralised approach that caused all of our current problems in the first place — only this time, at a higher, bigger&nbsp;level.</p><p>The organisation-centric centralised solution to the problem of data sharing has the following characteristics.</p>  It requires the Government to create vast new IT projects, which hand over hundreds of millions of pounds over to big US tech firms (such as Palantir). Such projects somehow never actually deliver what they were supposed to deliver, but always take far longer to complete and cost far more than their original projections.  It compounds rather than simplifies or eliminates the critical data logistics issues of how to move data from one provider to another (or provide access to this data) while a) ensuring its reliability and b) protecting the privacy of the individuals the data relates&nbsp;to.  It compounds rather than reduces the complexities and risks of managing consents, permissions and GDPR compliance, especially across borders. Proponents of these solutions always make a big point about patients being ‘in control’. But in reality, what they mean by this is that people will be bombarded with requests for permissions to access their data using processes that are both annoying and wide open to gaming — like the cookie pop-ups that plague our use of websites today. Meanwhile, they are disturbingly vague about who, exactly, would be able to access this data. (What do they mean, for example, by the word ‘researchers’?)  It limits the data that can be collected. As The Times Health Commission points out, one key problem with the current NHS Federated Data Platform is that it does not include GP or social care data, so even when it is implemented services will still not be properly integrated. The Health Commission therefore wants to go further, integrating data from GPs, NHS hospitals, pharmacies and social&nbsp;care.  <p>But even then, if your real goal is to address a person’s health, you would still be falling short. According to WHO, 60% of health outcomes are determined largely or mainly by lifestyle issues — data which health services do not collect. Which means that even if the Health Commission solution was implemented, many of its promises could never be realised.</p><p>But never mind. The bandwagoneers have an even better answer. In their proposals for the creation of an NHS Data Trust, Tony Blair and William Hague recognise this, talking of the need to integrate data about individuals’ “lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology”, all of which could go into the individual’s ‘personal health account’&nbsp;… and put up for sale to private sector ‘researchers’ for the purposes of ‘commercialisation’!</p><p>What started out as a promise of citizen empowerment and seamless service provision somehow ends up as a Big Brother agenda for Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  It limits the uses to which this data can be put. The biggest opportunity for improvement in health services today is not access to medical records per se but the organisation, coordination, planning, handovers and administration of all the activities that surround them. It’s about the ability to access and share exactly the right data at the right times. That requires a modular approach to data management, capable of instant and endless configuration and reconfiguration, that these centralised systems can never&nbsp;deliver.   Making real progress&nbsp;possible <p>Empowering citizens with their own data is the alternative approach to the problems the bandwagoneers are now claiming to address. Under this decentralised approach (which Mydex has been building for decades, and which is now live and operational) individuals are equipped with tools to collect all the data they need to manage their lives in their own database. This database remains directly under their control, in systems that work independently of the systems used by organisations that hold data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>These organisations deposit copies of key data in the individual’s personal data store. Individuals can choose to selectively share relevant portions of this data to service providers they trust and want to deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>This approach avoids all the problems associated with the new centralised systems now being campaigned for by the bandwagoneers.</p>  Far from requiring vast, expensive, time consuming new and risky IT contracts, the infrastructure already exists and can be implemented incrementally on a very low cost, case-by-case, test-and-learn basis.  It simplifies data logistics issues because it is designed at heart to enable automated data sharing (via APIs that create safe links between key data points) directly under the individual’s control (like a direct&nbsp;debit).  It simplifies issues relating to consents and permissions via standardised data sharing agreements that make it clear what data is being shared, with who, for what purposes. It builds implementation of human rights into the day-to-day operations of service provision.  It expands the range of data that can be collected, to include lifestyle data and data from other sources such as data from individuals’ own wearable devices. The only people able to see all of this data are the individuals themselves — because all the data is encrypted and only they have the encryption key that provides access to it. But they can share relevant bits of it whenever they need&nbsp;to.  It can simply be plugged into existing systems and services directly impacting operational delivery of health and care services, helping to heal the multiple flaws of the current organisation-centric approach.   Conclusion <p>It’s good that at last the great and good are beginning to acknowledge that instead of simply hoarding data, to streamline processes, create seamless services and deliver better outcomes, this data needs to be shared. The central question in health today is not whether we should do this, but&nbsp;how.</p><p>Elsewhere in Government, some genuine progress is being made. For example, the new UK Identity and Attributes Trust Framework envisages equipping people with their very own Personal Holder Service (personal data store) by which they can collect, receive, store and share data about their lives, where and when they want. These Holder Services give citizens agency and control while enabling safe, efficient, fit-for-purpose data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>What’s needed is new citizen-empowering data infrastructure such as this — infrastructure that tackles data sharing challenges at their root. But this is not what the bandwagoneers are proposing. Instead, they are simply offering more of the same, only at a different, higher level. Our health services and citizens need and deserve much better than&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">Beware!

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is rightly considered a security upgrade on single-factor approaches like a simple username and password. MFA does a great job of reinforcing traditional login credentials, and in turn, is very effective at stopping fraudsters who take advantage of easy prey – such as the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">12% of consumers</a> who use one single password for every account across multiple platforms. In situations like these, where fraudsters rely solely on stolen credentials to perpetrate their crimes, MFA methods like SMS and email OTPs are very effective at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/account-takeover-ato-fraud.html">preventing account takeover (ATO)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether. All of this means that, while MFA is a great way to reinforce login credentials like usernames and passwords, it may not be enough to stop the latest types of ATO.</p>

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions. By adopting these measures, organizations can further protect their critical systems and their existing IdP.</p>
<p>In addition to the above steps, organizations with on-premises environments can also secure their IdP with the use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/why-use-an-hsm">hardware security modules (HSM)</a> that provide enhanced security for securely storing keys, secrets, and tokens.</p>

<p>Modern card issuance operations have embraced advanced technology, replacing outdated manual methods like clipboard monitoring. Today, operators and managers no longer jot down notes as they walk the floor; instead, they use digital platforms. Alerts, achievements, and operational details are instantly communicated across locations, giving operations executives real-time data to monitor machine performance and critical issues without leaving their offices. The shift to automated data analysis allows operators and technicians to access information from tablets anytime, anywhere, ending the need for manual charting. Additionally, aggregated machine intelligence provides a comprehensive view of plant productivity and cost-effectiveness in real time across multiple sites for an entire corporation.</p>
<p>These advancements are commonplace today, as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a> cements itself in manufacturing history. It’s no surprise that digital intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution</a> is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. OEE is expressed as a percentage sum of three key production indicators: availability, performance, and quality. Let us take a closer look at each and how they bring a deeper understanding to issuance environments, focusing on net losses:</p>
 
 Availability 
 
 Availability is the percentage of planned production time the operation is available to run. It is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time and considers loss, which includes events that stop planned production. Run Time is defined as the total time when machines are used for production in a running state, excluding idle and pause. Planned Production Time is defined as the total calendar time for the measurement period minus planned downtime, such as maintenance tasks, changeover, holidays, and shift breaks. Availability Loss includes any unplanned stops such as idle time, equipment failure or material shortage, and planned stops as noted above. 
 
 Performance 
 
 Performance percentage is the actual total production output compared to theoretical perfect production output, which is calculated using the machine’s maximum cycle speed. A perfect performance score would mean machines are always running at maximum speed when active. Total Production is defined as the total number of cards processed, which includes both good and rejected cards. Maximum Machine Throughput is defined as the maximum machine speed in cards per hour, also considering that throughput could be reduced based on the total number of modules used. Performance Loss includes anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running. Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, inferior materials, line misfeeds, and jams. 
 
 Quality 
 
 Quality is the number of good units produced as a percentage of the total units started. A perfect quality score indicates that all products are good: successfully manufactured the first time, and no rejects were produced. Simply and more realistically, total production equals good production + rejected production. Quality Loss accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards as defined by the operation. Examples of Quality Loss include scrap and rework. 
<p>Net Losses</p>
<p>Net Losses for all three production indicators can be explored further here from <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-factors/">Vorne</a> as variations in issuance type, facilities, and machines contribute to loss variability. <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-six-big-losses/">The Six Big Losses</a> are also common in issuance operations and include: unplanned and planned stops, small stops, slow cycles, production rejects, and startup rejects.</p>
<p>To learn more about OEE and the three key production indicators, measurement &amp; analysis, and calculating speed and efficiency, read our white paper, <a href="https://go.entrust.com/production-analytics-solution-wp">“Understanding Production Efficiency in High-Volume Card Issuance Operations.”</a></p>
<p>The Future of Digital Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis. Next-generation Industry 4.0 subject matter experts will take the output from these technologies and use it to make improvements across operational architectures, building more efficiency into the process. Digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies by focusing on the three key production indicators.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Note: This episode isn’t an introduction to DIDs; for those new to the concept, we recommend revisiting <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/decentralized-identifiers-did-methods-did-documents-did-resolution/">Episode 52</a> of the SSI Orbit Podcast for a foundational understanding.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeper into the world of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), moving beyond the basics to explore the critical aspects that will influence their trust and adoption.</p>
<p>Today, joined by Marcus, we embark on a detailed discussion framed around a SWOT analysis of DIDs, examining their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive conversation that not only highlights the significant advantages of DIDs but also addresses the challenges and potential pathways to their widespread acceptance. We delve into the nuances of DIDs, aiming to contribute to the broader goal of promoting their adoption.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow the SWOT model, though it proved challenging at times due to the nuanced nature of many topics. Interestingly, what some may perceive as a strength could also be seen as a weakness, leading to a blend of perspectives. This complexity added depth to our discussion, making it particularly engaging!</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:47] Comparison of DIDs to Other Verifiable Identifiers: Exploring how DIDs contrast with other types of verifiable identifiers and their benefits over traditional identifiers like email addresses and phone numbers. 
 [11:50] How to trust a DID?: Identifying the technical and governance aspects necessary for trusting DIDs. 
 [15:46] Building Trust Around DID Methods: Discussing the challenges and approaches to building trust in various DID methods, considering technical integrity and governance. 
 [23:34] Multi-Factor Authentication for DIDs: Considering whether incorporating multi-factor authentication concepts into DIDs is a viable framing.

 Terminology 
<p>Digital Identity: An amorphous concept attempting the impossible job of capturing all that a human is in digital form, leading to many years of disappointing national projects and draft bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID: A single attribute or fact about an entity, represented digitally, that is relevant in one or more specific contexts.</p>
 A big little shift in terminology&nbsp; 
<p>The draft Australian federal <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">Digital ID Bill</a> no longer uses the phrase “digital identity”. The same shift in language has been made by the <a href="https://nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a> (NAB) in its year-long <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/digital-id-trust-who-you-choose-and-choose-who-you-trust/">multi-sector design collaboration</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the NAB and the Australian government now refer to Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is much more than semantics. I hope it reflects a recognition by government that identification is different from identity, and there is no universal way of identifying people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAB has highlighted that businesses and agencies are usually less interested in verifying “identity” than a particular attribute or eligibility. The bank’s <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">roundtable report</a> states “it is very rare that individuals need to prove who they are” and instead suggests a reframing of digital identity around “what do we need to know about an individual for a particular purpose”; that is, the process of identification in all its local variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what does Digital ID mean? Well, it’s just shorthand for a credential in a certain context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon everyone knows what it means to be asked to “show some ID”.&nbsp; We effortlessly interpret “ID” in context, whether it’s proof of age at a bar, a student card when sitting an exam, or an employee ID when entering the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the formal identification process carried out when opening a bank account or starting a new job. In these cases, we are generally asked to provide a number of IDs, from a pretty universal set of options including driver licence, birth certificate, Medicare card, passport and so on. And there are alternative forms of ID for people who need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Fresh thinking; new precision 
<p>None of these IDs constitute our identity. And that’s how we like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rule, we should ask for and reveal as little personal information as possible, within the requirements of the transaction we’re doing. As the Canadian digital identity leader <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma once said</a>, “I want my identity to be less than the real me”.</p>
<p>Digital ID is concrete, specific and familiar. But “digital identity” is abstract and open-ended. It means different things to different people. Invariably, digital identity is interpreted as a new universal means of proving who we are. But there is no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of imposing new identification standards and novel “digital identity” on Australians, the Digital ID Bill simply creates a governance regime to improve the quality and reliability of existing IDs when converted to digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will conserve the meaning of existing IDs and leave businesses and agencies free to conduct identification as they see fit. The Digital ID regulator is being tasked to create rules and technology standards, with a view to fostering a marketplace of vastly improved digitised IDs.&nbsp;</p>
 Best in class 
<p>I believe the AGDIS represents world’s best practice in digital identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AGDIS rules (to be developed after the Bill is enacted) will almost certainly embrace mobile phone digital wallets as carriers of Digital IDs. A large and fast-growing proportion of Australians are now familiar with using their payment cards in mobile wallets to “tap and pay” and “click to pay” (the Reserve Bank reports that <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">35% of card payments are now made via mobile wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent user experience of click-to-present any digital ID in context will be intuitive, widely available and vastly more secure than today’s plaintext handling of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be able to prove relevant facts about ourselves with the same security, safety and privacy as we prove our credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
 We’ve done this before 
<p>Smart payment cards (EMV chip cards) were introduced to replace magnetic stripe cards as they became vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Chip-assisted presentation of cardholder IDs replaced the plaintext of a mag stripe and, as a result, essentially eradicated physical card fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the speed with which smart credit card IDs cut payment fraud, we can expect mobile technology Digital IDs to dramatically reduce identity crime via stolen personal data and, as a result, neutralise the personal data black market. </p>
