  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Software supply chain security (SSCS) is a really curious subject. On the one hand, nearly everyone has an intuitive understanding of what SSCS means and how critical it can be for the success of a modern digital business. After all, we have seen the consequences of multiple large-scale incidents recently, which have all been labelled “supply chain attacks” by the press.</p>
 A bit of history 
<p>Perhaps the first widely known event of this kind was the notorious <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/understanding_solarwinds">SolarWinds hack</a> in 2020, when a malicious actor managed to inject malware into a popular IT management tool that was then deployed to thousands of clients and used as an attack vector in multiple security breaches. In late 2023, we had the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/neuenschwander/reflections-on-the-okta-breaches">breach at Okta</a>, a leading identity provider, that affected many of their enterprise customers, including several security vendors (who were, luckily, the first to raise the alarm). Finally, just a couple of weeks ago the entire world observed the catastrophic consequences of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/crowdstrikes-cyber-blackout">botched software update by CrowdStrike</a>, that literally grounded entire airlines and forced multiple banks and hospitals to halt their operations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there still seems to be no common agreement on what exactly defines an issue as a supply chain attack and consequently, who should be responsible for the damage. Consider, for example, the recent case of attempted compromise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor">XZ Utils</a>, when an unknown but possibly state-sponsored threat actor tried to infiltrate the open-source project and introduce a backdoor into a ubiquitous Linux utility.</p>
<p>Luckily, this attempt was not successful, but we do know how massive the potential consequences of an implanted backdoor could be – you need to look no further than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG">Crypto AG</a>, a Swiss cryptography provider that has posed as a front for a CIA operation for nearly 50 years. Multiple other vulnerabilities in popular open-source projects have been recognized as supply chain attacks as well: Heartbleed, Log4Shell, regreSSHion, etc. To be honest, the entire package management systems for popular languages like JavaScript or Python are currently such a mess that they can be considered huge attack vectors as well.</p>
<p>As a result, there seem to be a widespread opinion among not just the public, but industry experts as well, that software supply chain security is a field of cybersecurity that is entirely focused on dealing with dangerous open-source libraries and is thus primarily a responsibility of software developers. While there is definitely a grain of truth in this sentiment, it quickly becomes completely irrelevant when we try to come up with practical recommendations for organizations affected by an ongoing incident or just looking for measures to prevent a future one from happening. Most of those organizations are not directly involved in software development and simply want to be more resilient against problems caused by their suppliers.</p>
 What is software supply chain security anyway? 
<p>Software supply chain security involves managing risks associated with software acquired from third-party sources. In today's interconnected world, every organization uses third-party software, including operating systems, commercial off-the-shelf software, custom applications produced by contractors or, in some cases, even programs developed in-house. Ensuring the integrity and security of all these software components is paramount yet challenging, especially considering the confusion about the responsibilities of the multiple parties involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Organizations face increasing regulatory pressures, including NIS2 and DORA, which mandate constant risk management and supply chain risk assessments. These regulations require organizations to understand their entire supply chain, including indirect dependencies. Typically, end users lack in-depth knowledge about software development. They seek compliance with regulations without delving into the technical intricacies and often this can lead to costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest misconception about SSCS is that it falls under the responsibility of an organization’s cybersecurity team. What the CrowdStrike incident has clearly demonstrated is that having too much security can indeed be bad. Companies that were following the security best practices – deploying agents on every machine, automated deployment of patches, etc.- were in the end affected the most, having to deal with much more damage.</p>
<p>This reminds me again about the decade-long debate between the IT and OT security experts and people ridiculing the latter for placing process continuity and personal safety above the quick response to security breaches. Well, how the tables have turned… If the CrowdStrike incident is supposed to teach us anything, it should be that security is never the goal, but just a means for achieving better business resilience against catastrophic events and finding the right balance between security and availability should be the guiding principle for everyone.</p>
<p>So, how about calling it “Software Supply Chain Risk Management” instead?</p>
 The pragmatic approach 
<p>As analysts, we strive to offer practical advice to every organization. However, such advice would be substantially different for various organizations and stakeholders within them. For example, businesses with strong internal software development activities, such as CrowdStrike itself, obviously need to invest a lot into securing their entire software development lifecycle. The market nowadays offers numerous solutions ranging from universal application security testing platforms to highly specialized solutions, like the ones for managing secure artifact delivery or producing the software bill of materials.</p>
<p>Ever more important is to understand that the traditional view of the software development lifecycle within a single organization simply no longer reflects the reality of our interconnected world. The life of a software product does not end at the moment it is delivered to a customer – in fact, it only just begins. And since it no longer remains in the hands of one party, the responsibility must be shared properly among several stakeholders. We have figured this model out for cloud services already – why not adopt something similar for every software product?</p>
<p>In a sense, Software Supply Chain as a strategy, just like Zero Trust, cannot be bought off-the-shelf. It requires a combination of careful planning, changing the business processes, improving communications with your suppliers and customers and, of course, a substantial change in regulations. We are already seeing the first laws introducing stronger punishment for organizations involved in critical infrastructure, with their management facing jail time for heavy violations. Well, perhaps the very definition of “critical” must be revised to include operating systems, public cloud infrastructures, and cybersecurity platforms, considering the potential global impact of these tools on our society.</p>
<p>But how can end-user organizations influence these processes if they are not involved in developing the software they are using? My colleague Mike Small has already <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/crowdstrikes-cyber-blackout">published his recommendations</a> right after the CrowdStrike incident. To his practical advice I can only add another bit of philosophical musing: security is impossible without trust, but too much trust is even more dangerous than too little security.</p>
<p>Start utilizing the Zero Trust approach for every relationship with a supplier. This can be understood in various ways: from not taking any marketing claim at its face value and always seeking a neutral 3rd party opinion to very strict and formal measures like requiring a high Evaluation Assurance Level of the Common Criteria (ISO 15408) for each IT service or product you deploy. If you are looking for more information and practical advice, why not join us at the upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024/">cyberevolution 2024</a> conference in Frankfurt this December? Software Supply Chain Security, Cyber Resilience, and NIS2 and DORA regulatory compliance will be major topics presented by industry experts.</p>

  <p>In the past few weeks, we’ve announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra External ID and Microsoft Entra ID multi-tenant collaboration. We’ve received requests for more detail from some of you regarding licensing, so I’d like to provide additional clarity for both of these scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One person, one license 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Included in the first announcement of more multi-tenant organization (MTO) features to enhance collaboration between users, we stated that only one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multi-tenant organization. Expanding on that, the term “multi-tenant organization” has two descriptions: an organization that owns and operates more than one tenant; and a set of features that enhance the collaboration experience for users between these tenants. However, your organization doesn’t have to deploy those capabilities to take advantage of the one person, one license philosophy. An organization that owns and operates multiple tenants only needs one Entra ID license per employee across those tenants. The same philosophy applies to Entra ID Governance: the organization only needs one license per person to govern the identities of these users across these tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that this philosophy includes administrative accounts. In some organizations, administrators use standard user accounts for day to day tasks, and separate administrator accounts for privileged access. A person with a standard user account and an administrator account only needs one Entra ID Governance license for both identities to be governed. Of course, they could also leverage Entra ID Governance’s Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to temporarily elevate the access rights of a single account, instead of maintaining two accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate this scenario, let’s consider an organization called Contoso, which owns ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys. Mallory is hired by Contoso, which uses Lifecycle Workflows in Entra ID Governance to onboard her user account and grant her access to the resources she needs for her job. Her account receives an access package with an entitlement to ZT Tires’ ERP app, and she requests access to Tailspin Toys inventory management app. Because Mallory has an Entra ID Governance license in the Contoso tenant, her identity can be governed in the ZT Tires and Tailspin Toys tenants with no additional governance licenses – one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diego is an identity administrator whose user account is in the ZT Tires tenant. He uses a separate administrator account for privileged access tasks in Contoso, Tailspin Toys, and ZT Tires tenants. Because Diego has an Entra ID Governance license in the ZT Tires tenant, both his user and administrator identities can be governed in all three tenants with no additional governance licenses – again, one person, one license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Entra ID Governance in Microsoft Entra External ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other announcement covered Entra External ID, Microsoft’s solution to secure customer and business collaborator access to applications. In November, I&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">blogged</a> about the licensing model to govern the identities of business guests in the B2B scenario for Entra External ID and shared that pricing would be $0.75 per actively governed identity per month. Because metered, usage-based pricing to govern the identities of business guests is a different model than the existing, licensed-based pricing model to govern the identities of employees, I’d like to share more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A business guest identity in Entra External ID will accrue a single $0.75 charge in any month in which that identity is actively governed, no matter how many governance actions are taken on that identity. For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Contoso employee named Gerhart collaborates with Pradeep of Woodgrove Bank to produce Contoso’s quarterly financial statements. Contoso has deployed Entra External ID for its business partners such as Woodgrove Bank. In April, Pradeep accesses Contoso’s Microsoft Teams where Gerhart stores his quarterly reporting documents, but his Entra External ID has no identity governance actions taken on them, so it doesn’t accrue any charges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May, Pradeep receives an access package with an entitlement to Contoso’s accounting system, and Gerhart reviews Pradeep’s existing access to Contoso’s inventory management database, as well as to the Teams with the quarterly reporting documents. Because Pradeep’s identity in Entra External ID had identity governance actions taken on it, Contoso will accrue a $0.75 charge. Note that the charge is applied once, even though there were three identity governance actions taken during the month. Once that Entra External ID identity was governed in May, additional identity governance actions do not generate additional charges for that identity in May.</p>

 Where We Began <p>SpruceID’s mission, since the founding of our company, is to let users control their identity and data across the web. From a very early (still accurate) SpruceID blog, “Our ultimate goal [is to] enable a future where everyone has access to a secure, private, and highly portable set of credentials and data they can take with them across the digital universe. In this future, these credentials will be inalienably yours, to use when necessary to gain access to a given area or activity.”</p><p>In the early days, we found our roots (yes, tree puns never get old) within the Web3 developer ecosystem, building a suite of open-source libraries to connect on-chain and off-chain identifiers and activity. Our early branding reflected this developer audience focus, featuring a dark mode design with futuristic graphic imagery and technical language that resonated with developers deeply embedded in the Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>A version of our website from 2022.<p>We quickly learned that in addition to the tens of millions of people using cryptographic keys on Ethereum, there is another major audience actively using public-private keypairs that is already deeply entrenched in the business of issuing credentials to people – governments.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, SpruceID won a contract with the California DMV to build out a mobile driver’s license solution and wallet application for Californians. This project underscored the importance of privacy-forward, standards-compliant verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) that can be seamlessly integrated into both public and private sector systems​. We were, and continue to be, excited and honored to collaborate with true visionaries at the California DMV who have worked tirelessly to champion the privacy and security of users in the pilot program.&nbsp;</p><p>Since our initial foray into the public sector, we’ve found a strong foothold and have begun work on VDC implementation contracts with multiple state-level and national governments that are ideologically aligned with our values.</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce a significant rebrand that aligns with our expanded mission to serve not only Web3 enthusiasts but also governments and enterprises. Our updated look features lighter colors, more approachable and tangible design elements, and our messaging is crafted to be inclusive and easily understood by stakeholders at all levels.</p> The Evolution of Our Brand Identity <p>At the heart of every brand is a visual identity that resonates with its audience and communicates core values. We began our rebrand journey with the question: Who are we designing for? What do they care about? What motivates them? How do they like to learn?</p><p>Throughout this initiative, we relied heavily on research about our key audiences to ensure that all elements of our new brand (logo, colors, fonts, and tone) communicate the values most important to us and resonate with those with whom we build relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Read on to get an inside look at our creative process, led by our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/meet-the-spruceid-team-scotty-matthewman/">Sr. Designer, Scotty Matthewman</a>.</p> Establishing our Brand Values <p>At the start of this project, we distilled our values into 5 core attributes: trustworthy, inventive, pioneering, conscientious, and secure. These values influenced every aspect of our rebranding effort, from the tone of our communication to the visual elements of our identity.&nbsp;</p><p>We broke out our core values to brainstorm synonyms (below) that might spark visual reactions within our audience, and allow those experiencing our brand to feel heard and served by the solutions we offer. We ultimately aimed to create a brand that not only comes across as professional and reliable but also feels inclusive and innovative.</p> Bringing Our New Logo To Life <p>The evolution of our logo began with a focus on our core mission: empowering people to have greater control over their personal data. We explored many different iterations and directions, drawing inspiration from our design values while also trying to capture elements of identity, innovation, and security.</p><p>We liked the idea of many small elements, representing that people have many facets of their identity.</p><p>This direction felt representative of a few elements that resonated with us:</p><p>With a version we felt excited about, we decided to validate our hypothesis with real people within our key audiences. We surveyed a group of users to share feedback and preferences among three different logo iterations (see survey results below).&nbsp;</p><p>With positive user feedback on the logo direction, we shifted our focus to defining our brand colors, fonts, and imagery.</p> Color Palette: Balancing Trust and Innovation <p>Choosing the right color palette was important in setting the tone for our brand. We wanted a color that conveyed trust and safety, which is traditionally represented by blue. However, we also wanted to avoid the commonly used vibrant blue, so our solution was a muted blue with a slight lean towards purple, creating a balance that feels trustworthy, innovative and approachable.</p><p>The primary colors we landed on for our new brand are ‘Spruce’ blue, warm white, and black, complemented by warm neutrals with splashes of purple and green for vibrancy. This combination helps us stand out while maintaining a professional, inviting, and authentic appearance that resonates with our audience.</p> Font Choices: Merging Tradition with Modernity <p>In selecting our fonts, we aimed to balance modernity and readability. Initially, we experimented with sans-serif fonts, which are notoriously clear and accessible. We wanted something that was not extremely emotive or overly playful, but also that would allow us to be memorable and unique.</p><p>Our final choice includes Switzer for body text, known for its versatility and legibility, and Garamond for headers—a serif font that is also easily legible and adds a touch of traditional elegance. These design choices emphasize our commitment to humanizing technology.</p> Visual Assets: Clarity and Functionality <p>Our visual assets, including mockups, photos, and vector illustrations, play an important role in communicating complex technical concepts to those with varying levels of technical expertise. We prioritize real-world mockups over abstract representations, ensuring our visuals are clear and directly tied to our message.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach aligns with our value of inclusivity, making sure our content is accessible and understandable to all audiences.</p> A New Chapter for the SpruceID Brand <p>Evolving our look and feel as a company has allowed us to align more closely with our core values, while making a very technical industry less abstract and more approachable. As we continue to grow and innovate, our brand will remain an important tool in our journey to empower users and drive the modernization of digital identity. This is just the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for us.</p><p>If you want to see our new brand identity in practice, check out our newly redesigned website, <a href="http://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">spruceid.com</a>.</p>

				  Decentralized identity can deliver significant benefits to consumers and institutions alike: faster, smoother customer experiences, including passwordless login; enhanced cybersecurity, and securing call centers from AI-driven fraud. But how do we get started?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
 Mutually authenticated trust 
<p>Did you know that the Nigerian prince scam is <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-nigerian-prince-email-and-the-history-of-social-engineering-techniques">over a century old?</a> The earliest record can be traced back to 1910, when people would receive a paper letter claiming a wealthy nobleman had found himself in prison, and needed just a little help to bribe his way out, after which you would be handsomely rewarded. The root of this scam is that no one can verify identity through the mail, and this problem has stalked us into the age of the internet, with many different and effective kinds of phishing schemes.</p>
<p>Now, finally, we have a way to solve the root problem. With decentralized identity, users will have a way to share verifiable credentials through <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-didcomm-with-pictures/">DIDComm protocols</a> with each other before even beginning an interaction, allowing both the customer to confirm that it is their bank, and the bank to confirm it is their customer. These verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and issued by an authority, such as a government or financial institution. You can think of it as if you started every conversation with each party sharing their driver’s license or passport — you can be reasonably certain of who you’re talking to because you trust the government that issued them that document.</p>
<p>This confidence in who you’re interacting with will be the driving change that brings decentralized identity to banking.</p>
<p>Finance is a highly-regulated industry facing relentless identity fraud, exasperating customer experiences (because they have to make very sure their customer is who they claim to be), and costly inefficiencies (often because they often have to verify their customers multiple times). <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> are a solution that stops all this. They offer a simple, tamper-proof way to instantly prove your identity as an account holder (no more need for multi-factor authentication) and for the bank to prove that it is your bank and not a phishing attack.</p>
 Decentralized identity education 
<p>The customer experience for banking is paramount, <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/resources/video-increased-friction-banking-customers-under-40">especially among younger, more digital generations.</a> But, while <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/banking-trends-and-statistics/#:~:text=As%20of%202022%2C%2078%25%20of,prefer%20to%20bank%20in%20person.">78% of adults in the U.S. prefer to bank via a mobile app or website</a>, security is still a top concern, with <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/most-banking-customers-use-an-app-despite-security-concerns?utm_campaign=ct_prod&amp;utm_content=1269028&amp;utm_medium=wire&amp;utm_source=syndication&amp;utm_term=anne-stanleymarketwatch-com">42% of people who don’t use mobile banking apps</a> reporting it is because they simply don’t trust them.</p>
<p>This was echoed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinomaster/">Dan Gisolfi</a>, Head of Research and Development at <a href="https://www.discover.com/company/">Discover Financial Services,</a> when looking at regulations in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbnliMe1UfY">a recent discussion with Indicio.</a> Despite the benefits of decentralized identity, financial institutions are hampered by regulatory uncertainty —&nbsp;regulators either aren’t fully aware of the technology, or don’t fully understand it.</p>
<p>However, the European Union’s embrace of decentralized identity and digital identity wallets will force everyone’s hand. Many financial institutions are international and will have to adopt the technology to meet customer expectations and match competitors.</p>
<p>At the same time, information campaigns can show how decentralized identity is simply too useful and too powerful a security solution to be ignored. Because the technology is so simple to use, it will be fast to catch on, similar to how credit cards replaced checks, and then <a href="https://entreprenal.com/apple-google-pay-will-kill-visa-mastercard-f8330ea6c936">Apple and Google payment systems are slowly replacing credit cards</a>. Simplicity and security will win out.</p>
 So how will it affect you? 
<p>The good news is that your life as a customer will get a whole lot simpler and less stressful. With verifiable credentials you’ll be able to prove who you are to the bank, access services, and complete transactions faster and easier than ever before. You likely won’t even notice these technologies in your day to day interactions, but they’ll be there keeping you secure.</p>
<p>The biggest difference you will notice will be the lack of need for multiple manual document checks. As more institutions realize the value of trust through decentralized identity, physical driver’s licenses, passports, and other proof of identity will be largely unnecessary, resulting in faster customer service since an employee doesn’t need to manually double check everything.</p>
 Get ahead start by getting started now 
<p>Everyone wants to be ahead of the game when it comes to technology, and there are a few ways that you can start experimenting with decentralized identity for yourself right now.</p>
<p>The first way is by downloading a digital identity wallet. Indicio has one called <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a> that anyone can download for free on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holdr/id1620628623">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.indicio.holdrplus">Google Play</a>. Not only will this app let you start holding verifiable credentials, it will let you experiment with mutually authenticated communication through DIDcomm. All you need to do is scan each other’s QR code to connect.</p>
<p>There are many demonstrations of what this technology can do, including several from Indicio. While this technology is perfectly set up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvCNvWud3Ys">streamline customer authentication and transactions, </a>it can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaY0IPOphe0">hold all your information necessary for travel,</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4cVQa-4yQc">prove educational achievements,</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-BzikdwNSI">verify employment.</a></p>
<p>Or, if you’re an organization interested in potential adoption for your customers our team would be happy to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">discuss how that might look with you.</a></p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland – August 1st, 2024 – Dock announced today the launch of its Privacy-Preserving Credential Monetization feature within its <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Decentralized ID platform</a>. This cutting-edge innovation enables organizations to generate new revenue streams by charging for the verification of Digital ID credentials that they issue.&nbsp;</p><p>With this advanced feature, Dock's platform sets a new industry standard, empowering organizations to launch an ID Ecosystem for their partners to securely share and monetize verifiable credentials. This accelerates onboarding processes, enhances transaction speeds, and improves business efficiencies. Importantly, user privacy is protected, as issuers and ecosystem administrators cannot identify which specific user or credential has been verified.</p><p>Traditionally, issuing ID credentials has been a cost burden for issuers who make the investment to ensure credentials contain high-quality information. However, with Dock's new feature, ID companies can transform this expense into a new revenue stream by charging for credential verifications. Credentials are part of an ecosystem where verifiers must pay a price for each verification, making it easier for issuers to generate revenue from credential issuance. This innovation enhances the economic viability for all stakeholders within a Digital ID Ecosystem.</p><p>Dock's technology uses Keyed Verification Anonymous Credential (KVAC) cryptography to ensure that credentials can only be verified by members of an ecosystem with a billing relationship.</p><p>Privacy-Preserving Monetization</p><p>At Dock, privacy is our priority. Our Credential Monetization feature ensures that ecosystem administrators can track paid verifications but cannot identify which specific user or credential has been verified, preserving confidentiality and fostering a trust-rich environment. Users must give explicit consent for each verification, maintaining their control over their digital identity.</p><p>“In the past, a lack of ways in which organizations can generate revenue from verifiable credentials has significantly constrained adoption of this amazing technology. With the release of this new feature, clearly defined business models are now integrated into Dock’s issuance and verification platform enabling entities to roll out new products at scale.” said Nick Lambert, Dock’s CEO.</p><p>About Dock</p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock’s Decentralized Identity platform</a> enables companies to turn verified ID data into trusted Reusable Digital ID Credentials, instantly verify their authenticity and get paid when they are verified by third parties. It comprises an API, a Web App, an ID wallet and a dedicated blockchain. Dock has been a leader in decentralized digital identity technology since 2017 and trusted by organizations in diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education.</p>

<p>There is a Holochain app on mobile phones.&nbsp;</p><p>Shipping this fall, Volla Phone’s new Quintus model will have two Holochain apps preloaded on it. One of these is Relay. On its face, Relay is a simple chat app. But its impact is much deeper than that. Like Signal, Relay is fully encrypted. But unlike the industry standard for secure communication, Relay doesn’t use central servers, adding an additional layer of security and privacy. Relay also doesn’t need your phone number as it addresses its messages directly to your public key which acts as a decentralized digital identifier. Not only does Relay come preinstalled on the Quintus, but it will also be available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and all Volla devices including the Volla Tablet</p><p>But how did we get here? There have been calls for Holochain to be on mobile for awhile, but it took a set of synergistic needs to make it happen. Volla needed an alternative to the big cloud providers. darksoil studio needed a mobile version of Holochain. And the world needs open source tech.&nbsp;</p><p>No project, no technical development, springs up from thin air. It’s rather a process of many small steps and connections that come together to realize new possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To tell the story of Relay, we reached out to the people involved to give a full view into this process.</p> Volla <p>It was just over a year ago that community dev <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abedijoo/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hedayat Abedijoo</a> connected with Dr. Wurzer, bringing <a href="https://nickstebbings.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nick Stebbings</a> with him to the Volla Community Days where they demoed Holochain and made the first attempts at developing on mobile. Building on the fantastic early work of Nick and Hedayat, Holochain has been growing ties between Volla and our community since. Here is what Volla founder Dr. Wurzer has to say about their choice to integrate Holochain into their products:</p><blockquote>“The big picture of Volla is a secure and independent communication infrastructure. A smartphone is an elementary component. The cloud is another important element. The only way to prevent external influence is distributed, highly encrypted edge computing. As soon as we process or manage user data, access could be forced or our service sanctioned.” —Dr. Wurzer, founder of Volla Phone</blockquote><p>Volla’s respect for the privacy of their customers really sets them apart in the smartphone market. Following up on the above, we asked Dr. Wurzer what most excited him about the growing partnership with Holochain.</p><blockquote>“The message of Volla is freedom through simplicity and security. Simplicity in the sense of convenience. And this convenience also includes the cloud. That's why Apple is so popular with the iCloud and why Google also has this offering. Together with Holochain, we can now tackle the mass market with high-performance hardware that can compete with an iPhone. If we manage to reach the mass market, we will give back privacy, security and self-determination to many consumers who are overwhelmed by technical issues and trends. We bring the power back to the people. It's not just protected communication, but also free access to information, which — I can only speak for Germany and Europe — is already restricted.” —Dr. Wurzer, founder of Volla Phone</blockquote> Development <p>To develop Relay, Holochain brought in Aaron Brodeur and Tibet Sprague of <a href="https://www.terran.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Terran Collective </a>along with our very own Eric Harris-Braun. Here is what they have to say about the development process:</p><blockquote>“There was a steep learning curve at the beginning, not only deepening my understanding of&nbsp; Holochain development, but also working with a stack that is pretty new to me: SvelteKit, Tailwind, Skeleton, and of course the P2P Shipyard code that allows it to run on Android using Tauri Mobile. All in all things have gone quite well for such a cutting edge project. The biggest challenge in the Holochain universe is figuring out what bugs are coming from my code and what might be coming from Holochain itself or from the experimental Shipyard code, and keeping up with the many moving pieces. Not to mention also working with a fairly new and evolving platform in Volla Phone and Volla OS.” —Tibet Sprague of Terran Collective</blockquote><blockquote>“It's been a huge joy to work with Dr. Wurzer. He's a charming and brilliant entrepreneur with incredible attention to detail, but also a big vision of a phone free from entanglement with the big silicon valley services, allowing people to connect with one another safely and securely. The power of Holochain is obvious to him, and so it was consequently really easy to talk through and work around Holochain's unique affordances — the tradeoffs are worth it!” —Aaron Brodeur of Terran Collective</blockquote><p>What was the moment Relay came to life for you?</p><blockquote>“The moment we got it running on a Volla Phone for the first time, and Eric and I were successfully able to chat using it was incredible! P2P chat on big tech free phones is such a massively exciting accomplishment and we are going to pull it off.” —Tibet Sprague of Terran Collective</blockquote><blockquote>“I was on zoom with Eric Harris-Braun when he first showed me Relay working on the phone. There were many moments early on where we were not 100% sure what we wanted could work on the phone. None of this has ever been tried before! I know on the one hand it's just an app, and at that moment it was just a few lines of text on an empty screen... but I definitely felt like I was witnessing – and contributing to — a historic moment!” —Aaron Brodeur of Terran Collective</blockquote><p>What contribution to the Relay app are you most proud of?</p><blockquote>“I'm most proud of the brand. I wanted to make something that was adjacent to and compatible with Volla's brand, but distinct. It doesn't often work out like this, but it was the first name and logo I proposed. I love the name because it speaks to how the data is gossiped around within a group – each member of the group is relaying messages on behalf of the other members of the group. The icon is a network diagram in the shape of an R.” —Aaron Brodeur of Terran Collective</blockquote> p2p Shipyard by darksoil studio <p>Of course, none of this would have been possible if the hurdles to Holochain working on mobile weren’t solved. The highest applause goes to the team at <a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">darksoil studio</a> who did the heavy lifting of building a Holochain plugin for <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a> so that Holochain apps can be deployed to all the platforms Tauri supports: Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, and soon iOS (on the way). The <a href="https://darksoil.studio/p2p-shipyard/?ref=blog.holochain.org">p2p Shipyard</a> gives developers an easy method for converting their Holochain applications to a diversity of platforms. For the mobile context Holochain is set to its “zero-arc” configuration where mobile nodes don’t have to hold a portion of the DHT like a normal Holochain node would. This saves on battery life and helps the application meet app store requirements. (Volla is using a variation that actually does hold full nodes thanks to their custom designed OS which enables tighter integration with Holochain.)&nbsp;</p><p>p2p Shipyard was the key development that made Relay and our work with Volla really successful, but its potential affects the whole ecosystem. So let’s dig a bit deeper into their journey:&nbsp;</p><p>Can you tell us about the experience of making Holochain mobile ready?</p><blockquote>“It’s been a long road. We have been wanting Holochain on mobile for a long time, and ultimately, we needed it badly enough for ourselves that we went ahead and did it. The p2p Shipyard is our second tool to enable Holochain to work on mobile. Our first one, which used firebase, we knew wouldn’t work long term, but we needed to test our app with users, so we went ahead and did it and ultimately, the learnings from that process contributed to the p2p Shipyard. It’s been a challenging and empowering experience, and it’s not done yet! ” —Eric Bear of darksoil studio</blockquote><p>How do you see P2P Shipyard growing in the next year?</p><blockquote>“Over the next year we hope to see the p2p Shipyard get put to use! We’re hoping to see a number of Holochain apps ship and function across platforms over this next year, and we’re already working with a few projects in the Holochain ecosystem to help them get their hApps into people’s hands (literally). ” —Eric Bear of darksoil studio</blockquote> Get Involved <p>To be one of the first people using Relay, you can support Volla through their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/volla/volla-phone-quintus?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kickstarter campaign</a> where they are fundraising for their initial production run of the Quintus. They hit their funding goal in the first 3 hours, but thankfully you can still get a phone from them.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t know when Relay will be more widely available in app stores, but we expect that to be in the works.</p><p>And as for p2p Shipyard, they have a wonderfully innovative funding model which we hope to see more of as it models open source ethics and sustainable business practices all in one.&nbsp;</p> Support p2p Shipyard <p>darksoil wants open source development to be more sustainable, so with the p2p Shipyard, they’re using an experimental funding model called retroactive crowdfunding.</p><p>Basically, they went and built the software, and then are funding after the fact. Once their retroactive crowdfunding goal of $100k is met, the p2p Shipyard will be free and open source forever.</p><p>Currently, the p2p Shipyard is source-available, so the code is publicly visible to audit, but a license is needed to use it.&nbsp;</p><p>During the source-available phase, anyone interested in using the p2p Shipyard can <a href="mailto:%20hello@darksoil.studio">reach out to them</a> for a license; and all license fees will go towards the retroactive crowdfunding goal.</p><p>Once they meet the goal, and the p2p Shipyard is open source, they will continue to offer support services to maintain, improve, and adapt the p2p Shipyard to meet more people’s needs.</p><p>darksoil welcomes anyone invested in the Holochain ecosystem to support this infrastructure with a <a href="https://opencollective.com/darksoil/projects/p2pshipyard/contribute/open-source-it-the-p2p-shipyard-74756/checkout?interval=oneTime&amp;amount=80&amp;name=&amp;legalName=&amp;email=&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">donation</a>.</p>

			 Transaction Privacy: The Last Blocker for Massive Open Finance Adoption 
 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Open finance is a new approach to financial services, characterized by decentralization, open access, and innovation. It refers to financial activities and transactions that occur through decentralized infrastructures like blockchain networks. It enables transparency, speed, and interoperability, delivering exceptional efficiency and transforming the way financial systems operate.</p>
<p>The need to bring privacy to open finance</p>
<p>While transparency and reduced information asymmetry can greatly make finance more inclusive and better, not all data can be made public. Sensitive information, such as identities and confidential asset data must remain confidential. The challenge is to balance privacy with the need for transparency. The solution lies in sharing status credentials, such as confirming that a user is KYC-checked or that an asset is ESG-compliant, without exposing detailed data onchain.</p>
<p>Leverage status to ensure data privacy with ERC-3643</p>
<p>ERC-3643 offers a solution for maintaining data privacy by focusing on status verification. Instead of making actual asset or investor data public onchain, only the status credentials, so-called “claims” (e.g., ESG certificate proof, KYC check proof), are shared. Smart contracts can check these claims to confirm status (e.g., whether KYC proof has been obtained). This approach prevents the need for data reconciliation and avoids public exposure of sensitive information.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Addressing Transaction Privacy</p>
<p>Despite these advances, transaction and balance privacy remain concerns when using public blockchains. Large institutions want to keep their balance and transaction data private. Though stablecoin regulations are getting clearer (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenized-securities-unaffected-by-mica-utility-tokens-and-stablecoins-face-stricter-rules/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_u3CA2lYuc2x8ppu-_tNvkMNB2xmtmtMwefjep_DLYVs4mczFDibjL-nNurbvMVa2cYDFa">European MiCA regulation</a>), the need to hide trade prices to avoid market panic deters institutions from using onchain cash for tokenized securities. This makes atomic settlement unrealistic as the onchain cash leg is not used.</p>
<p>To tackle this, innovative solutions like Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) have emerged. At Tokeny, we are closely working with privacy solution providers who are building solutions with these cutting-edge technologies to address these issues.</p>
<p>It is just a matter of time before these innovations make transaction privacy a reality in open finance. Stay tuned as we continue to bring you updates on these exciting developments.</p>

 Identity and Migration — research update #2: Digital ID in&nbsp;Kenya <p>(Authors: Keren Weitzberg, Nora Naji, and Emrys Schoemaker)</p>Source: <a href="https://www.craftsilicon.com/">Craft Silicon&nbsp;website</a><p>In this post, we share an updates from our ongoing research project in Kenya, outlining emerging Digital Identity innovation around proxy verification and Sharia compliant identification</p><p>Agency banking and guarantors</p><p>As part of our research, we are exploring how migrants (including under- and undocumented people) access financial services. Irregular migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers (and even some regular migrants) often struggle to access the same kinds of banking and financial services as citizens. A common barrier is the lack of a foundational credential that global regulatory regimes, such as the Financial Action Task Force, require in order for service providers to enable access to things like SIM cards and bank accounts.</p><p>We are meeting people, however, who are trying to develop fintech for underserved populations and regions, and for people who lack these foundational credentials. One such organization is <a href="https://www.craftsilicon.com">Craft Silicon</a>, headquartered in Kenya. We spoke to their Head of Islamic Banking, who told us about a Sharia-compliant product, currently being rolled out in Yemen in partnership with a local bank, which will enable people to open up low-balance bank accounts in order to receive remittances. This product, which will soon include a mobile wallet, will be accessible to undocumented people, who will be able to onboard by registering with an agent using a guarantor. The guarantor will have to attest to the client’s identity and provide their biometrics during the registration process.</p><p>This is not the first product that uses a guarantor system, but it is arguably unique in its claim to be Sharia compliant. The use of guarantors can offer undocumented people, including migrants, basic banking services. However, such products also have limited utility (such as their low balances) due to the need to comply with a strict financial regulatory environment.</p><p>Providing fintech to the unbanked may not be a panacea for poverty (despite some of the more quixotic claims behind the financial inclusion narrative), but such services are nevertheless desperately needed. Often, these products are piloted successfully but then abandoned or never scaled. We hope to see that change in the&nbsp;future.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/identity-and-migration-research-update-2-digital-id-in-kenya-340243df365d">Identity and Migration — research update #2: Digital ID in Kenya</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Identity and Migration — research update #1: Digital ID in&nbsp;Kenya Source: <a href="https://x.com/JuliusKBitok/status/1803703841017213159">Julius Bitok, Kenya’s Principal Secretary, State Department for Immigration &amp; Citizen&nbsp;Services</a><p>(Authors: Keren Weitzberg, Nora Naji, and Emrys Schoemaker)</p><p>In this post, we share an updates from our ongoing research project in Kenya, outlining emerging Digital Identity initiatives and the implications of recent protests.</p><p>The Shirika&nbsp;Plan</p><p>Last year, the Kenyan government announced the “Shirika Plan” — an initiative promising to transform the country’s refugee camps, Dadaab and Kakuma, into integrated settlements, in line with the UN’s <a href="https://globalcompactrefugees.org/about-digital-platform/global-compact-refugees">Global Compact on Refugees</a> (Shirika means ‘coming together’ in Swahili). This plan seeks to better integrate Kenya’s approximately 600,000 refugees and asylum seekers into the economy and various national systems. On the surface, it represents a positive policy shift for a government that has often been hostile to refugees. In the past, the Kenyan state has threatened to close the Dadaab Refugee Complex, periodically suspended refugee registration, and even <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/04/kenya-somalis-placed-catch-amid-crackdown-refugees/">deported Somali refugees</a> in contravention of international law. Yet, as refugee rights advocates like Victor Nyamori of Amnesty International (interviewed <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/podcasts/2024/03/07/whats-unsaid-kenya-new-integration-plan-for-refugees">here</a> for The New Humanitarian) have suggested, this new plan may be hype, aimed at courting international donors, rather than meaningful policy&nbsp;change.</p><p>Why does this matter for those who follow digital identity developments?</p><p>Integrating migrants and refugees into national registration systems can have far-reaching effects — from ‘normalizing’ often discriminated groups to <a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/kenya-biometrics-double-registration/">problematizing legal status</a>. As Immigration and Citizenship Services Principal Secretary Julius Bitok explained during a roundtable at<a href="https://medium.com/@kweitzberg/the-digital-identity-wallet-from-cape-town-to-amsterdam-57e61718f967"> this year’s ID4Africa AGM in Cape Town</a>, the Shirka Plan will also entail the incorporation of refugees into Kenya’s newly launched (and controversial) digital identity project known as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/tag/maisha-namba">Maisha Namba </a>(Life Number). According to Bitok, refugees will receive Maisha cards and Maisha Nambas (unique identity numbers) alongside Kenyan citizens and residents. But what additional rights and services, if any, this will afford them is less than&nbsp;clear.</p><p>Time will tell how meaningful such developments are for the hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers living in Kenya, many of whom have been in the country for well over two decades. We will be following this issue closely as part of our empirical research in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Gen Z Protests and&nbsp;IDs</p><p>Another key development is the <a href="https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gen-z-protests-a-revolution-aided-by-technology--4669846">Gen Z protests in Kenya.</a> In June 2024, after the Kenyan Parliament passed a new and <a href="https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/economy/finance-bill-mps-drop-punitive-taxes-as-kenyans-protest-4661698">controversial finance bill</a>, Kenya erupted in nation-wide anti-government protests driven primarily by Gen Z (those currently between the ages of 12 and 27). They protested against unemployment, economic equality, and corruption, soon being joined by larger segments of the population. Kenya’s government responded to the protests with brutal measures, including abductions and extrajudicial killings.</p><p>Despite the waning of protests over the last weeks, pressure on the Kenyan government remains high. In July, activists published an Action Plan to monitor the Ruto government’s efforts to reform key areas affecting young people, which was widely circulated on <a href="https://x.com/Alvinmwangi254/status/1809223365590179931">social&nbsp;media</a>.</p><p>Notably, one of the action points in the document concerns the growing costs of identification. The Action Plan calls on the government to “ban the request of government issued documents for job seekers except for a national identification card; drop the replacement ID fee from KES. 1,000 fee to KES. 200; lower the drivers’ license renewal fee by 25% and make all licenses renewable every three&nbsp;years”.</p><p>In Kenya, where youth <a href="https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/number-of-jobless-kenyans-rises-to-2-97m-4184722">unemployment is at a record high</a>, young job seekers are increasingly frustrated with needing to provide extraneous documents, such as certificates of good conduct from the police or tax compliance certificates from the Kenya Revenue Authority, each with a requisite fee. Such demands are especially problematic for certain ethnic and religious groups in Kenya, particularly Muslims, who have faced historic <a href="https://www.justiceinitiative.org/voices/out-cold-vetting-nationality-kenya">discrimination</a> in access to IDs and legal documents. As <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/news/article/2001278496/why-certificate-of-good-conduct-is-a-ticket-to-jobless-corner">this article explains,</a> these various “certificates will cost a jobless Kenyan upwards of Sh5,000.” Add to that the new charges for national IDs. Last year, the government announced that ID cards, which were previously free, would cost new applicants 1,000 Kenyan shillings (roughly $6; £5) while the cost of replacing an ID would be increased 20-fold to 2,000 shillings, sparking widespread protests online. The price hikes were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67365053">eventually blocked </a>by the Kenya High Court. The government <a href="https://www.citizen.digital/news/govt-makes-u-turn-on-plan-to-increase-id-charges-to-ksh2000-n331308">u-turned</a>, lowering the costs for new IDs to KSh 300 and the fee for a replacement to KSh 1,000–still a marked rise over previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>The government may be trying to extract money from Kenya’s population and pay for its costly new digital identity project (Maisha Namba) by hiking fees. But amidst a cost-of-living crisis, these increased costs are not going down well with Kenya’s&nbsp;youth.</p><p>This controversy also reveals a key source of exclusion in Kenya and elsewhere: prohibitively high fees for mandatory government ID documents. As one Kenyan X user <a href="https://x.com/kenyamoja_/status/1814901690706854221?s=46&amp;t=Cujs2RrGJi7FtwEOS7uudA">commented</a>: “This fee undermines the constitutional right to identification, a fundamental necessity for all Kenyans.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/identity-and-migration-digital-id-in-kenya-ac2821f15086">Identity and Migration — Digital ID in Kenya</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>HONG KONG, 31th July&nbsp;2024 – <a href="http://hextrust.com">Hex Trust</a>, a leading provider of digital asset solutions for institutional finance, protocols, foundations, and the Web3 ecosystem, has announced a strategic partnership with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the pioneering onchain operating system for tokenized securities. Tokeny, with the custody integrations provided by Hex Trust, will deliver a streamlined tokenization process enhanced with fortified security measures for operations signings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custody solution providers are essential for institutions venturing into real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Through this partnership, Hex Trust’s multi-wallet architecture has been integrated into the Tokeny platform, enabling institutions already utilizing Hex Trust’s custody services to seamlessly manage their tokenized securities and securely sign operations using the same trusted wallet.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s platform offers an intuitive white-label platform and plug-and-play APIs that enable businesses and institutions to compliantly issue, transfer, and manage tokenized RWAs and securities. Tokeny has a fully integrated ecosystem, which includes necessary onchain and off-chain service providers required for seamless operations onchain.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    As large institutions embrace RWA tokenization, we’ve seen a surging demand from our clients for solutions that aggregate everything they need to operate onchain seamlessly. Tokeny provides exactly this with a proven track record. By integrating Hex Trust's custodial wallet infrastructure into the Tokeny platform, customers can start tokenizing and managing their onchain securities with the wallet they trust and are familiar with.  Alessio QuagliniCEO &amp; Co-Founder of Hex Trust    
	 
		 
			<p>Compliance and interoperability are key for tokenization projects to thrive, and Tokeny’s solutions ensure this by being fully compatible with the open-source identity-based ERC-3643 permissioned token standard. Token restrictions on investors and operations can be easily set and embedded into the token through Tokeny’s token compliance setup interface or APIs. While tokens can leave the operating platform to interact with any other application by default, only qualified investors can interact with them, and custom additional rules can be applied.</p>

		 
	 
    Custody of security tokens is about token issuers and their agents securely preparing and signing advanced smart contract operations. This process requires using a proper orchestration platform with guided business workflows and then signing the corresponding blockchain transactions via a secure wallet. By combining the technologies of Tokeny and Hex Trust, we offer institutions a comprehensive solution, enabling tokenization without the burden of technological concerns.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny

<p>We are announcing a rescheduling of our much-anticipated hard fork, initially set for July 2024. This decision highlights our dedication to providing a secure, compliant, and feature-rich platform. Our adjusted timeline now aims for August 2024. The new specifications and features of the hard fork will include the following:</p> Prioritizing Security and Compliance <p>To support various use cases like Security Token Offerings (STOs), we are integrating new compliance-related features into the mainnet. This includes functionalities such as contract whitelists and blacklists, designed to meet stringent regulatory requirements and enhance overall security.</p> Integrating Composable Transactions <p>One of the most exciting features we are adding is support for composable transactions. This enhancement, detailed in our<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/wiki/Composable-Transactions"> Composable Transactions documentation</a>, enables more intelligent blockchain use cases, including those leveraging machine learning(ML). Users will be able to call contracts using plain text, simplifying interactions. This transparency in on-chain smart contract usage and management will significantly streamline operations and improve usability.</p> Text-Based Smart Contract Deployment <p>We are also introducing a new feature for deploying smart contracts using plain text, as outlined in our<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/pull/361"> GitHub pull request</a>. By managing smart contract source code directly on-chain, we can better support intelligent blockchain use cases like those involving ML. This approach guarantees the generation of deterministic bytecode, thereby enhancing security. On-chain management of smart contract source code ensures transparency and reliability, which are crucial for advanced blockchain applications.</p> Developing On-Chain ML&nbsp;Models <p>Our team is developing ML models that can be used directly on our mainnet alongside smart contracts. Unlike large language models like ChatGPT, which require substantial resources and are not specifically designed for blockchain integration, we are benchmarking smaller models like Microsoft’s Phi-3. These models are optimized for on-chain use, ensuring they are efficient and suitable for enterprise and mainnet applications. This research aims to enable seamless integration of intelligent features within our blockchain environment. We will provide more details about these ML models soon, as they will play a crucial role in enhancing the Aergo platform.</p> Looking Ahead <p>While the delay may be disappointing, we will provide regular updates as we progress toward the new timeline. We focus on delivering a blockchain platform with the highest performance and security standards.</p><p>We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work diligently to bring these significant enhancements to life. Stay tuned for more updates, and thank you for being a vital part of our community.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hard-fork-timeline-update-8eee637df6d1">Hard Fork Timeline Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Introducing Decentralized Agnostic Paytags, a universal money address tied to Decentralized Identifiers

<p></p>
<p>"Dap me up!" is a colloquial term followed by a gesture used in Western cultures to greet people or express solidarity. At TBD, we're adding a new meaning to this phrase with Decentralized Agnostic Paytags (DAPs), an open source approach designed to simplify peer-to-peer payments across various applications.</p>
 Solving an Awkward Issue<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/simplifying-cross-platform-payments-daps#solving-an-awkward-issue" title="Direct link to Solving an Awkward Issue">​</a> 
<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) payment applications have existed since the late '90s, starting with tools like PayPal. With the rise of smartphones, innovative mobile apps like Venmo, Zelle, and Block's very own Cash App have made it easier to exchange funds directly from our phones.</p>
<p>However, a persistent issue remains: the sender and recipient must use the same app to complete a transaction. People have personal and valid reasons for choosing their preferred payment apps.</p>
<p>This situation creates an uncomfortable, unspoken battle when you need to pay a friend after dinner or a contractor for a service, only to discover that you use CashApp while they use Venmo. Now, you both face the dilemma of deciding who will download a new app, set up a new account, and link it to their bank account.</p>
<p>Instead, P2P payment apps can use DAPs—agnostic unique identifiers stored in a registry—to identify and route payments to the correct destination across different platforms. This allows you and the recipient to financially "dap each other up" regardless of which apps you prefer.</p>
 Introducing Decentralized Agnostic Paytags (DAPs)<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/simplifying-cross-platform-payments-daps#introducing-decentralized-agnostic-paytags-daps" title="Direct link to Introducing Decentralized Agnostic Paytags (DAPs)">​</a> 
<p>A DAP is a user-friendly handle for payments, structured as <code>@local-handle/domain</code>.</p>
<p>Here's an example: I love the handle blackgirlbytes. If I registered that handle on Cash App's DAP registry, my DAP would be <code>@blackgirlbytes/cash.app</code>. Similarly, if I registered that handle on DIDPay's DAP registry, my handle would be <code>@blackgirlbytes/didpay.me</code>.</p>
<p>Each DAP links to a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/decentralized-identifiers/what-are-dids">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> to help identify who you are, regardless of the platform. While your DID includes cryptographic keys for identity protection, it also contains your money address—a unique identifier that directs different payment systems where to send your funds.</p>
 Get Started with DAPs<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/simplifying-cross-platform-payments-daps#get-started-with-daps" title="Direct link to Get Started with DAPs">​</a> 
<p>The DAP ecosystem has two key actors: the payment platform that offers DAPs and the users who own the DAPs.</p>
<p>For Organizations: Any organization can enable users to create a DAP on their platform by setting up a DAP registry associated with their domain. This registry serves two main functions:</p>
 
 It allows users to sign up for DAPs. 
 It maps users' DAPs with their DID and money address. 
 
<p>For Users: Once a DAP registry is available on your preferred platform, you can sign up for a DAP using your chosen handle.</p>
<p>If you're eager to experiment with DAPs but your preferred payment platform hasn't implemented a DAPs registry yet, you can obtain a DAP via our <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/dap-registry-static">static DAP registry</a>.</p>
 Keep Up to Date<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/simplifying-cross-platform-payments-daps#keep-up-to-date" title="Direct link to Keep Up to Date">​</a> 
<p>DAPs debuted during a company-wide Hackathon at Block, where TBD, Cash App, and Square teams collaborated to bring this vision to life. As the DAP implementation continues to evolve, here are a few ways you can stay involved:</p>

<p>Here at Anonyome, we stay abreast of current thinking and conversation around <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">identity management</a>, from technology innovations to regulatory changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’re looking at the long-running issue of a potential US federal data privacy law because there’s been some significant movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can catch up on the story <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">here</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/04/3-things-to-know-about-data-privacy-laws-in-the-us-in-2023/">here</a>. You might also like <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/">The US Data Privacy Law “Floor”: What Deserves Basic Protections?</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest news on this simmering topic is that the draft <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-federal-privacy-law-legislators/">American Privacy Rights Act</a> was introduced on April 7, 2024. It’s a bipartisan US federal data protection law drafted by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA 5th District) and Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) that aims to give US citizens greater control over their personal data, limiting the ability of big tech firms to process, transfer and sell the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The draft American Privacy Rights Act also mandates that companies must meet stronger cybersecurity standards to protect the personal data they hold from being hacked or stolen and gives enforcement powers for violations to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), states and individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the draft bill’s <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-federal-privacy-law-legislators/">key provisions</a> are:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 Limiting the data that companies can collect, keep, and use about people to what those companies actually need in order to provide them with products and services &nbsp; 
 



 
 Boosting powers for citizens to control how companies use their personal data, such as preventing companies from transferring or selling their data, and opting out of data processing if a company changes its privacy policy&nbsp; 
 



 
 Requiring companies to obtain express consent before transferring sensitive data to a third party.&nbsp; 
 



<p>&nbsp;<br>In releasing the draft bill, Congresswoman Rodgers said: “This landmark legislation gives Americans the right to control where their information goes and who can sell it. It reins in Big Tech by prohibiting them from tracking, predicting, and manipulating people’s behaviors for profit without their knowledge and consent. Americans overwhelmingly want these rights, and they are looking to us, their elected representatives, to act.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rodgers and Cantwell <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-federal-privacy-law-legislators/">argue</a> that “… their draft legislation represents the best opportunity in decades to establish a national data privacy and security standard in the US.” It’s intended to enhance the <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">patchwork of legislation</a> that’s been knitted together at the state level in the US for several years, which will make data privacy protections more consistent for US citizens nationally and reduce <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/state-privacy-laws-consequences/">the compliance burden on businesses</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the draft American Privacy Rights Act is based on similar principles to the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR). The US is one of the only major global economies without strong national privacy laws <a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While there’s optimism for this bill, we’ve been at this point a few times with US national privacy legislation, most recently in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/new-bipartisan-federal-data-privacy-bill-in-the-us-but-will-it-pass/">2022</a>. And some question whether it goes far enough. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/about">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF) isn’t impressed, saying <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/04/americans-deserve-more-current-american-privacy-rights-act">Americans deserve more than the current bill</a>. Their position is that “a <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/committee-chairs-rodgers-cantwell-unveil-historic-draft-comprehensive-data-privacy-legislation">new federal bill</a> would freeze consumer data privacy protections in place, by pre-empting existing state laws and preventing states from creating <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/federal-preemption-state-privacy-law-hurts-everyone">stronger protections in the future</a>. Federal law <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/december-2018-preemption-letter">should be the floor</a> on which states can build, not a ceiling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EFF also wants portions of the bill strengthened:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Making it easier to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/you-should-have-right-sue-companies-violate-your-privacy">sue companies</a> that violate consumer rights&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Limiting <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/inside-fog-data-science-secretive-company-selling-mass-surveillance-local-police">sharing with the government</a> &nbsp; 
 



 
 Expanding the definition of sensitive data&nbsp; 
 



 
 Narrowing exceptions that allow companies to exploit consumer biometric information, so-called “de-identified” data, and data obtained in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/why-getting-paid-your-data-bad-deal">corporate “loyalty” schemes</a>.&nbsp;

<p>At Anonyome, we see the introduction of this bill as yet another moment on the long road to a federal data privacy law where we hope lawmakers don’t allow their desire for the perfect (and un-passable) law to get in the way of passing a good law that raises the bar for the approximately 30 US states and territories yet to pass privacy legislation. And we’ll watch closely when the lobbyists get to it: we expect more carve-outs, US state pre-emption concerns, and questions over whether it will get passed before November.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity verification is a fundamental part of our daily interactions, whether opening a new bank account, checking into a hotel, or making an online purchase, identity verification is essential. Indeed, traditional methods of verification are often slow, repetitive, and fraught with security risks. Enter reusable IDs — solutions which are designed to take on such challenges.</p> The Problem with Traditional Identity Verification   Repeated ID Requirements:  <p>Users are often required to present more than once their identities such as driver’s license, national id, or passport for KYC (Know-Your-Customer) checks when registering with any service provider(s).</p>  Costly Verification Processes:  <p>Business entities face higher cost (in terms of expense and time required) in confirming the identity of the same person across different platforms. According to industry reports, large financial institutions potentially spend in the range of $250 to $500 million annually on maintaining KYC and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance. For the top 10% of these institutions, this figure can reach about $100 million​. <a href="https://kpmg.com/mc/en/home/insights/2019/03/combating-financial-crime-fs.html">Source</a></p><p>According to a whitepaper published by Consult Hyperion, a single KYC verification can cost between $13 and upwards of $130. For example, if a customer is required to complete five separate KYC verifications for the same bank, the bank incurs a total cost of $65. However, by implementing reusable identity as a service, the bank only needs to verify the customer once, keeping the cost at $13 and saving significant resources. This not only reduces financial outlays but also frees up personnel for more strategic tasks.</p><p>Consider the impact on a bank with 100,000 customers:</p>  Without reusable KYC, verifying each customer five times costs the bank $65 per customer, totaling $6.5&nbsp;million.  With reusable KYC, the cost per customer is reduced to $13, resulting in a total cost of $1.3&nbsp;million.  <p>This translates to a potential savings of $5.2 million, illustrating the substantial financial benefits of adopting reusable KYC solutions on a large&nbsp;scale.</p>  Complexities in Online Verification:  <p>While in-person identity verification is straightforward, verifying identities online presents significant challenges. According to a <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/global-business-commercial-banking-market-sees-3-3-tn-in-losses-due-to-operational-inefficiencies-4576451.html">Moneycontrol</a> report in 2019, the global commercial banking sector suffered a significant loss of USD 3.3 trillion due to abandoned onboarding applications.</p>  Reliance on Physical Identification:  <p>Despite technological advancements, there is still heavy reliance on physical IDs, like birth certificates and driver’s licenses, in the digital&nbsp;world.</p> Introducing Reusable IDs: A Modern&nbsp;Solution <p>What Are Reusable&nbsp;IDs?</p><p>Reusable IDs are secure, portable and interoperable digital representations of a person’s verified identity. Instead of undergoing repeated verification processes for each service, users can verify their identity once and business entities can reuse this verified information across multiple departments. This innovation significantly enhances security, efficiency, and user experience.</p><p>How Do Reusable IDs&nbsp;Work?</p><p>Reusable IDs combined with advanced technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and digital wallets ensure secure and privacy-preserving identity verification. After a user proves their real identity through an ID verification service by submitting legal ID and taking a selfie, their verified identity is stored securely in a digital credential within a digital wallet&nbsp;app.</p><p>This clearly departs from traditional practices where every institution verifies new customers individually. This allows securely sharing of verified identity data across institutions with user consent and reduces redundancy to enhance operational efficiency and security.</p><p>The Advantages of Reusable&nbsp;IDs</p>  Enhanced Security:  <p>The advanced encryption and authentication technologies used in reusable IDs reduce risks of identity theft and other fraudulent activities that could arise from having multiple verification channels. It ensures privacy attributes through zero-knowledge proofs, selective disclosure, and other equivalents that allow the user to only disclose very relevant information while maintaining privacy.</p>  Streamlined Operations:  <p>By eliminating redundant verification steps, reusable IDs reduce administrative burdens and operational costs. Businesses can reallocate resources more effectively, improving efficiency and customer service. Standardized verification procedures also simplify compliance, ensuring consistent and reliable identity verification across different institutions.</p>  Improved User Experience:  <p>Reusable IDs offer a better user experience by making transactions much easier and simplifying onboarding processes. The ability to use just one verified identity across services promotes trust and loyalty with customers. Additionally, reusable IDs empower users to control their personal data, deciding who has access to their information and&nbsp;when.</p>  Sustainability and Alignment with&nbsp;SDGs:  <p>Implementing reusable IDs contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing the need for paper-based verification processes. By transitioning to digital identities, organizations can significantly decrease their paper consumption, which supports Sustainable Development Goal 12.5. This not only minimizes the environmental impact but also aligns with global efforts to promote sustainable practices and reduce&nbsp;waste.</p> Real-World Applications and&nbsp;Benefits   For Financial Institutions:  <p>Reusable IDs ease customer onboarding, saving time and resources spent on repeated identity checks. This enhances operational efficiency due to a reduction in time and resources spent on manual verification, improving customer satisfaction and experience. This also reduces the costs incurred from several verification events.</p>  For E-Government Services:  <p>Through digital channels, governments can increase value-added services such as e-filing of taxes, issuance of permits, and even voting. Using reusable identities, a citizen can securely engage in such services digitally through their pre-verified digital identities.</p><p>Rather than repeatedly providing and verifying personal information for each government interaction, citizens benefit from the simplicity of using their verified <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">digital identity</a>. This approach streamlines access to government services online, promoting efficiency and user convenience across diverse digital platforms.</p>  For Healthcare Providers:  <p>Reusable IDs enable quicker access to services by verifying patient identities swiftly and securely. This approach enhances patient care and simplifies compliance with privacy regulations that protect crucial medical information.</p>  Verifying Age for Online Services:  <p>With reusable identities, users can confirm their age for restricted online services, such as buying alcohol or viewing adult content, without revealing other personal details. This approach protects user privacy while meeting legal requirements, offering a secure and efficient solution for age verification.</p> Advantages of Reusable Identities for Businesses   Cost Effective Solution:  <p>Reusable identity solutions offer substantial benefits for both consumers and businesses. For businesses, they provide an effective cost solution for authenticating users without storing sensitive data.</p>  Enhanced user experience:  <p>A smooth user experience is crucial for customer acquisition, studies indicate that many potential customers abandon sign-up processes due to poor user experiences.</p><p>Simplifying the sharing of verified IDs with new service providers reduces friction, building on users’ initial efforts in document and facial verification. This streamlined approach not only boosts customer satisfaction but also enhances operational efficiency for businesses.</p>  Driving Revenue&nbsp;Growth:  <p>According to research by <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/from-touchpoints-to-journeys-seeing-the-world-as-customers-do">McKinsey</a>, even a slight improvement in customer satisfaction during onboarding — measured on a scale of ten — can lead to a 3% increase in customer&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>For a company earning $500 million from new customers, each incremental satisfaction point translates into an additional $15 million in potential revenue. This underscores the importance of prioritizing customer satisfaction during the initial user experience to drive substantial revenue&nbsp;growth.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5560195">Gartner Research</a>, over half a billion people will be using verifiable credentials by 2026, and the decentralized identity market is projected to be worth over $3 billion by 2031. This rapid growth in the market suggests significant opportunities for businesses that leverage reusable Identity softwares, positioning them to capture increased market share and drive substantial revenue&nbsp;growth.</p> Conclusion: Embracing the Future of Identity Verification <p>Reusable IDs represent a transformative shift in identity verification, offering unparalleled security, efficiency, and user convenience.

 First a gambling white paper, then a series of industry consultations, now a public survey. Is the United Kingdom Gambling Commission the industry’s most responsible regulator? 



<p>You know how it is. You wait for one significant regulatory change or shift in legislative focus and then they all come at once.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that the UK’s gambling industry has been in a state of turmoil for a few years now. In 2020, Boris Johnson launched a review of the Gambling Act 2005, raising concerns that the document might need to be updated to apply to the digital age. Indeed, it absolutely did, as at the time the 2005 Act was created, almost all gambling took place in brick-and-mortar betting shops, casinos and racetracks. Now, the industry makes more <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/taking-a-more-in-depth-look-at-online-gambling">than 40% </a>of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/26/gambling-uk-white-paper-online-casinos">£14 billion annual revenue</a> from online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1153228/1286-HH-E02769112-Gambling_White_Paper_Book_Accessible1.pdf">UK gambling white paper</a> (‘High Stakes: Gambling Reform for the Digital Age’) finally arrived. A series of consultations was carried out throughout 2023 and 2024 to address a) the gaming experience; b) support services and c) promotion of responsible gambling, including, of course, the implementation of the controversial affordability checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, following hot on the heels of the new and upcoming regulatory changes to the UK’s gambling environment, the United Kingdom’s Gambling Commission has released its first ever <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/statistics-on-gambling-participation-annual-report-year-1-2023-official">Gambling Survey for Great Britain</a> (GSGB).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Data in this report represents the first year of a new baseline, against which future changes can be compared and as such will prove invaluable in deepening further our understanding of gambling across the country,” said Tim Miller, Executive Director of Research and Policy.</p>



 Understanding the Great British public’s attitudes toward gambling. 



<p>Produced by National Centre for Social Research and the University of Glasgow and featuring responses from 9,804 participants, there are four main aims of the GSGB:&nbsp;</p>



  Identify who is gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  What types of gambling activities do they participate in.&nbsp;  



  Reasons and experiences for gambling&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Consequences of gambling, on both the player and their family.  



<p>“We welcome the UKGC’s efforts in gathering insights into the gambling habits of the UK market. This information will enable operators to better serve the gambling community and ensure the UKGC continues to be regarded as the industry’s most progressive and most forward-thinking regulator. We also applaud the steps taken by the UKGC since the release of the gambling white paper, especially regarding the implementation of affordability checks. </p>



<blockquote><p>At IDnow, we offer the industry’s most comprehensive affordability check to ensure the checks are carried out seamlessly for both those who need it and those who don’t.</p>Bruce Glover, UK Gambling Manager at IDnow.</blockquote>



 8 most interesting findings from the GSGB. 



  48% of adults aged 18 and over participated in some form of gambling over the last 4 weeks.<br>  Participants are more likely to gamble online (37%) than in person (29%).<br>  Most common reasons for gambling:<br>a) The chance of winning big money (86%)<br>b) Because gambling is fun (70%)<br>c) To make money (58%)<br>d) Because gambling is exciting (55%)  



 Consequences from gambling. 



<p>While the vast majority of those who gamble do so recreationally, spending an average of just £2.70 per week, there are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age">300,000 people</a> estimated to be engaged in problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial risk checks, formerly known as affordability checks in the UK, were essentially designed to protect players from gambling online with money they cannot afford to lose. Operators conduct them to ensure they are not encouraging problem gambling, and that their products and services are being used responsibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in concept to the ability-to-pay checks conducted by financial service providers of credit cards and loans, financial risk checks run in the background, ultimately satisfying the operator that the gambler has sufficient funds to continue placing bets safely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assessing the size and scale of problem gambling in the UK was deemed an important part of the survey. No topic has been more polarizing to the gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks. Read our two blogs, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">‘Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2.’</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/arguments-against-affordability-checks-gambling/">‘Worth the risk. Arguments against affordability checks in gambling.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GSGB outlines <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/report/gambling-survey-for-great-britain-annual-report-2023-official-statistics/gsgb-annual-report-executive-summary">two different consequences</a> from problem gambling:</p>



 
  
 
 
 Definition of severe adverse consequences: 
 

<p>– Losing something of significant financial value (home, job, business etc).</p>
<p>– Relationship breakdown with spouse or family members.</p>
<p>– Experiencing violence or abuse.</p>
<p>– Committing crime to fund gambling or gambling debts.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Definition of potential adverse consequences: 
 

<p>Reducing or cutting back spending on everyday items like food, clothing and bills.</p>
<p>– Using savings or increasing credit.</p>
<p>– Experiencing conflict or arguments with friends, family and colleagues.</p>
<p>– Feeling isolated from other people, left out or alone.</p>
<p>– Lying to family and others to hide extent of gambling.</p>
<p>– Performing poorly at work or study.</p>

  Most common (1.6%) severe consequence of gambling was relationship breakdown.&nbsp;  



  Most common adverse consequences were reducing spending on everyday items (6.6%), lying to family (6.4%) and feeling isolated (5.5%).&nbsp;  



  Male participants who had gambled in the past 12 months (3.5%) were more likely than female participants (2.1%) to experience at least one severe consequence due to gambling.&nbsp;  



  5.9% of adults aged 18-34 were likely to experience at least one severe consequence from gambling compared to just 0.7% of adults aged 55 and over.&nbsp;  



  3.2% of adults who’d gambled in the last 12 months had sought support.  



 The Great British balancing act. 



<p>Creating a marketplace that is attractive for competitors to operators yet safe and secure enough for players to gamble responsibly is no easy feat. In launching the inaugural annual GSGB (which is due to double in size and scope next year), the UKGC is taking significant steps towards achieving this aim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our highly configurable <a href="http://platform%20for%20identity">platform for identity in the gaming market</a> allows operators to keep abreast of constantly changing regulations and new fraud schemes and scams, while ensuring a safe and secure gaming experience, from the UK to LATAM. With our latest round of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, we now offer UK-specific data checks, and financial risk checks, which provide operators with insights into affordability indicators to online gamblers and comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Okta is one of the most widely-used single sign-on (SSO) providers, making authentication more convenient for organizations and their users alike. We at HYPR use Okta. This convenience, however, comes at a price. Okta deployments are both highly targeted by and, as repeatedly demonstrated, highly vulnerable to attacks.

<p>Okta is one of the most widely-used <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/single-sign-on">single sign-on (SSO) providers</a>, making authentication more convenient for organizations and their users alike. We at HYPR use Okta. This convenience, however, comes at a price. Okta deployments are both highly targeted by and, as repeatedly demonstrated, highly vulnerable to attacks.</p>  
<p>Perhaps the most notorious incident in recent years were the 0ktapus attacks. Over the course of several months, hackers were able to bypass Okta security processes to log into <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twilio-hackers-hit-over-130-orgs-in-massive-okta-phishing-attack/">scores of corporate SSO instances</a>, including Twilio, MailChimp and DoorDash. Okta customers were also the target of a <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/okta-customers-social-engineering-attacks/692851/">string of social engineering attacks</a>, where cybercriminals convinced IT help desk staff to reset MFA credentials of super admin accounts.</p> 
<p>Okta's new passwordless authentication option, Fastpass, promises to mitigate these security weak points, but <a href="https://www.rezonate.io/blog/bypassing-oktas-passwordless-mfa-technical-analysis-and-detection/">a recent analysis</a> showed that it too can be bypassed. Moreover, most Fastpass implementations fall back to a password plus a less secure factor. While this helps minimize lockouts and disruptions, it opens another pathway in for attackers.</p> 
 How Attackers Breach Okta Security Defenses  
 Phishing and Credential Theft  
<p>Okta provides its customers with multiple forms of authentication for services so that organizations can enforce MFA. The most widely used forms include temporary codes delivered over SMS through Twilio or via authenticator apps. However, as demonstrated time and again, even with these MFA options enabled, attackers <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">can break in fairly easily</a>, gaining wholesale access to connected accounts and applications. This is because the standard Okta security approach is predicated on shared secrets, which can be phished or intercepted through a number of different techniques.</p> 
<p>In the case of the 0ktapus attacks, <a href="https://blog.group-ib.com/0ktapus">security researchers from Group-IB</a> found that the threat campaign targeted employees of companies that use Okta SSO, sending them text messages containing links to phishing sites that spoofed the Okta login page of their organization. Many of the phone numbers were obtained from a previous successful <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/twilio-customer-data-breached-via-sms-phishing-employees-a-19734">hack of cloud communications provider Twilio</a>, which itself was hacked using the same methods.</p> 
<p>Upon entering their login details and 2FA code, the attacker performs a simultaneous login process on the actual Okta page, gaining a session token and access. From there, attackers have wide-ranging potential for further escalation.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Illustration of the 0ktapus attack flow</p> 
 Help Desk Social Engineering  
<p>The IT service desk is another vulnerable point in most organizations. Without strong identity verification processes in place, fraudsters can impersonate legitimate employees to gain access. For example, they may claim they lost their phone and need to reset their multi-factor authentication factors. This is what happened to multiple Okta customers in an orchestrated social engineering campaign linked to the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-320a">Scattered Spider</a> threat group. Malicious actors phoned the company’s IT help desk and convinced staff to reset the MFA settings of highly privileged Okta platform admin accounts. They went on to use their privileged access to compromise other applications across victim organizations.</p>

 &nbsp;  
 Tips to Improve Okta Security  
<p>These Okta security flaws show why more robust identity security protocols , that can resist phishing, interception and social engineering attacks, are necessary across all IAM procedures. Here we'll look at some actions you can take to strengthen Okta security in your organization.</p> 
 1. At a Bare Minimum, Enable MFA on All User Accounts  
<p>Multi-factor authentication is enabled by default for admins under Okta security protocols and it should be the minimum authentication standard set for all users. As we’ve seen, however, traditional MFA can be easily breached, especially when phishable factors are used, such as passwords and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one-time passwords (OTPs)</a>. SMS is particularly vulnerable — if traditional MFA is used, disable SMS as an option. Ideally you should deploy <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant MFA</a> (see tip #6).&nbsp;</p> 
 2. Use Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)  
<p>Regular reviews of what accounts have access to and strictly limiting admin-level powers to relevant users can reduce the impact of possible breaches. RBAC also sees account access checked and changed according to a user's current needs rather than maintaining past or previous access requirements. Keep the number of Super Admins — the highest level of admin privileges to an absolute minimum. This decreases the possibility of an attacker gaining access to these highly privileged accounts and causing even greater damage.&nbsp;</p> 
 3. Set Session Lifetime Rules  
<p>Enforcing stricter session lifetime rules on inactive sessions reduces the possibility of legitimate sessions being hijacked by attackers. This is especially important given that many employees now work outside the protected office environment.</p> 
 4. Enable User Event Notifications  
<p>Important activity on a user’s account, such as sign-ins from a new device or changes to factors used on an account, can be flagged through Okta security notifications. This way, notifications can be quickly escalated by the user or admin. Beware, however, that users can develop fatigue from the number of notifications they receive from various accounts, so they may not give them the attention they deserve.</p> 
 5. Don’t Use Your Identity Provider To Log In to Your Identity Provider  
<p>One of the most effective methods of relieving pressure on Okta security is by completely removing the authentication burden from the SSO in the first place. SSOs are effective services for easing workflows and managing access to a user's suite of applications; however, this places a significant target on its back for attackers seeking access to those user privileges. Separating the authentication providers from SSO providers and using a more <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/is-passwordless-authentication-secure">secure passwordless authentication</a> solution makes it more difficult for attackers to bypass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 6. Use Phishing-Resistant Passwordless MFA  
<p>The single most effective method to strengthen your SSO’s security posture is to use IdP-agnostic, phishing-resistant, multi-factor authentication. One of the major Okta security issues is how easily attackers can phish, intercept or bypass MFA that uses SMS, OTPs or push notification. By removing passwords and phishable factors, and authenticating using biometric identifiers and public key infrastructure (PKI), you eliminate the potential for phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">MFA bombing</a> and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.</p> 
  
  To learn more about what to look for in a passwordless solution read our <a href="https://get.hypr.com/passwordless-mfa-security-evaluation-guide">Passwordless Security Evaluation Guide</a>  
  
 7. Implement Measures to Protect Desktop Login and Offline Users  
<p>Unfortunately, the more secure Okta options do not easily extend to desktop login, VPN access or remote situations. Specific employee groups, such as those working in clean rooms, on the factory floor or in the field may also have access and device limitations. Make sure you have identity security processes in place to cover all your use cases and user populations.</p> 
 8. Deploy Automated, Continuous Identity Verification  
<p>For most organizations, comprehensive identity verification is limited to specific points in time, such as employee onboarding. But there are other times when identity verification is equally critical, such as resetting a credential or registering a new device. The standard identity checks tend to be knowledge-based answers or calling the helpdesk — which, as evidenced, are prone to social engineering. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/ai-attack-prevention">Generative AI and deepfake technology</a> have made these processes even more vulnerable to attack.&nbsp; Multi-layered, risk-based identity verification combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 Make Your SSO More Secure With HYPR  
<p>Recent attacks underscore the need for organizations to thoroughly scrutinize the security of their Okta deployment. The best approach to defend Okta and other SSO deployments is to integrate an end-to-end identity security system that strengthens the weakest and most vulnerable points.</p> 
<p>HYPR, a <a href="https://www.okta.com/partners/hypr/">trusted Okta partner</a>, works in conjunction with Okta so your employees gain an optimized, frictionless experience and your organization gains a security-first identity strategy. HYPR integrates phishing-resistant passwordless authentication, adaptive risk mitigation, and automated identity verification to detect, prevent, and eliminate identity-related risks at every point in the identity lifecycle. It operates seamlessly with all major SSO providers, creating a single-action desktop-to-cloud authentication flow, with no password-based fallbacks.</p>

  We explore the potential of digital identity solutions to enhance privacy through selective disclosure, highlight the risks of verifier abuse, and propose a reasonable disclosure framework to standardize and safeguard data-sharing practices.

<p>As we’ve previously discussed on this blog, new digital identity solutions, such as mobile drivers’ licenses, have incredibly exciting promise in terms of upgrading both security and privacy of the identity holder. In this post, I want to highlight yet another area where we, as an industry, still have work to do to make that promise of privacy a reality.</p> Promise of privacy-preserving disclosure <p>Digital identity specifications allow for the concept of “selective disclosure,” where ID holders can decide exactly what personal information they want to pass along to someone verifying their digital ID. The classic example is at a US bar with an over 21 age restriction – currently, a person presents a conventional physical driver’s license to prove their age, which also shows the bartender their name, address, and full date of birth. No bouncer needs to know all of that information just to confirm someone is able to responsibly enjoy a tasty beverage. A digital ID with selective disclosure, on the other hand, could allow you to prove you’re over 21 without revealing any other irrelevant or personal information.</p><p>There are scores of other examples where this concept of selective disclosure could be of benefit. An insurance card could now prove a person seeking health care has valid coverage, without revealing that person’s employer. An asylum seeker with a work permit form can prove their employability without having to reveal their country of origin. Digital identities can serve just as many purposes as their analog versions, but we benefit from them by reducing (or entirely removing) unnecessary data oversharing and leakage.&nbsp;</p> Risks of power imbalance <p>However, there are also potential downsides to this model. While selective disclosure appears to put the power in the hands of the credential holder to choose what information they want to share, there is potential for abuse by the other entity in the disclosure transaction, namely the verifier.</p><p>Every credential data request involves both a verifier – the person seeking information, and an ID holder – the person with the information being sought. The verifier asks to confirm information about the holder, and the holder then “presents,” or sends, the requested digital data with an authenticating signature.</p><p>An unethical verifier might demand to see all information associated with a digital credential, not just the data needed for a particular transaction. They might be able to obscure a verification request in a way that an ID holder wouldn’t be made aware of all the data that was being requested or wasn’t given the opportunity to decide whether the request was reasonable prior to granting consent. Particularly given the nascency of this new model of interaction, holders of digital identity credentials will need help from industry practitioners to stay safe.</p> Reasonable Disclosure Framework <p>To that end, we see the potential for creating, socializing, and committing to standardized formats for common use cases, which we’re calling a Reasonable Disclosure Framework.</p><p>This shared format for data requests would give future users the full power of digital ID technology by ensuring data requests are transparent and that overreaching or deceptive requesters can be flagged. Moreover, since it would be based on an open standard, the framework would enable any organization to release a set of disclosure standards tailored to protect the privacy of their members or constituencies.&nbsp;</p><p>One example might be a filter offered by an organization dedicated to the rights of retired Americans, which could be designed to be vigilant against threats of exploitation against identity scams often run against the elderly. Whereas another filter, created by a computer science professional organization, might opt to give its expert users more personal discretion.</p><p>These disclosure filters would be attached to a digital wallet, similar to common browser extensions. A user could install more than one filter, creating a composable and layered approach to disclosure control.&nbsp;</p><p>This could look like a user installing a fairly permissive default disclosure filter, then specific, narrower filters for their individual habits and circumstances: an ecommerce-specific disclosure filter from a trusted eCommerce watchdog, and a medical information filter from a privacy foundation. These organizations would have specialized knowledge in particular niches, meaning they would be best equipped to track, evaluate, and flag excessive or malicious data requesters in that niche.</p> Informed Data Sharing <p>Each filter could set a level of disclosure that would be considered acceptable for the particular use case, including the types of data being requested and for what purpose. If a verifier exceeded these acceptable parameters, a user would be presented with a warning message or popup similar to what web browsers now use to warn us away from insecure websites. The message could be something as simple as “This request may lead to misuse of your personal information.”</p><p>This would allow an average holder at least a fighting chance to be aware of when and how their data was being collected, and to opt out of transactions that went against a documented standard of reasonable trust.</p> Enforceable Responsibility <p>This proposed system could also create accountability for deceptive credential requests and data misuse. Verification requests and usage disclosures would be cryptographically signed by requesters, just the same as digital IDs. Digital wallets would keep full records of these signed data requests and usage disclosures, so users could have detailed and accurate records of what information was asked for and disclosed in response to a specific request.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, anonymized statistical analysis of signed request records could be used to identify verifiers that mispresented their data needs or usage. One such use case might be an online store that was found to have sold user data to advertisers. Trust organizations that publish reasonable disclosure filters could bring consequences to verifiers who are prone to abuses. This would allow enforcement of acceptable data practices to be more directly driven by entities closer to the specific credential scenarios.</p><p>These standards for reasonable sharing, warnings of excessive requests, and punitive measures against deceptive disclosures would be the primary variables set by the diversity of disclosure filters enabled by this proposed framework.</p> Interoperable Protocols <p>The most important feature of the digital identity standards currently emerging from industry and government efforts is that they are open and interoperable protocols. That is, they are based on a set of technical and data standards that allow any party to issue, receive, or present a credential. Building off this guiding principle, any organization would be able to build and distribute a disclosure filter.</p><p>We hope you see the potential in this proposal to protect consumers and bring reasonable transparency to the fore as digital identities rise in usage and prominence.

<p>"Verifiable Credentials seem niche. Only a small group of technologists would be interested in this," a conference attendee declared after I enthusiastically described my company's work in the Global Payments and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystem.</p>
<p>This comment gave me pause. Less than a year ago, I first encountered <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/verifiable-credentials/what-are-vcs">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> - a W3C standard for digital credentials that state specific facts about individuals, organizations, or entities. My initial reaction was similar to the conference attendee’s response. However, after interviewing SSI builders on a weekly livestream, my perspective changed dramatically.</p>
<p>While VCs are relatively new and primarily explored by SSI enthusiasts, their benefits extend far beyond this group. Many of the services and products you use today already rely on them – even if you don't realize it.</p>
<p>From healthcare to content creation, finance to travel, VCs are changing how we share and verify information. Here's a look at seven real-world applications of VCs that may surprise you:</p>
 1. Mobile Driver’s Licenses<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/7-ways-we-use-vcs-today#1-mobile-drivers-licenses" title="Direct link to 1. Mobile Driver’s Licenses">​</a> 
<p>If you often misplace your wallet like me, there's good news — your state may support the use of Mobile Driver's Licenses (mDLs). Louisiana was the <a href="https://envoc.com/case-study/the-nations-first-digital-drivers-license/#:~:text=July%202018%3A%20LA%20Wallet%20is,as%20fishing%20and%20hunting%20licenses.">first state to implement mDLs</a> in 2018. Since then, mDLs have been <a href="https://www.aamva.org/jurisdiction-data-maps#anchorformdlmap">gaining traction</a> across the United States.  With mDLs, residents of participating states can store a digital version of their driver's license on their smartphones. This allows users to leave their physical ID at home and use their phones for identification in various situations, including travel, age-restricted services, voting, and law enforcement interactions.</p>
<p>VCs are the technology behind mDLs because they offer features like revocation, authentication, expiration, and tamper evidence. If you use an mDL, you're using VCs!</p>

 2. The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/7-ways-we-use-vcs-today#2-the-pharmaceutical-supply-chain" title="Direct link to 2. The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain">​</a> 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-carsten-st%C3%B6cker-1145871/">Dr. Carsten Stöcker</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, introduced me to a fascinating application of VCs in the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmacies often trade medicines with each other to maintain their stock, but this exchange requires complex verification processes. They must verify the legitimacy of three key elements:</p>
 
 the medicine, 
 the organization they're trading with, 
 the provider making the trade 
 
<p><a href="http://caro.vc/">Caro.vc</a>, a Spherity company, employs VCs to simplify this process and reduce errors. Their solution allows pharmacies to quickly and securely verify all these elements, ensuring the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>

 3. Content Creation and Generative AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/7-ways-we-use-vcs-today#3-content-creation-and-generative-ai" title="Direct link to 3. Content Creation and Generative AI">​</a> 
<p>Content creation has played a considerable role in our online lives for the past few years. For some, it has become a career, launching individuals into fame. However, whether you're an artist, seamstress, or photographer, people often steal and claim work that you made.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new form of content creation has hit the scene: generative AI. While many use it for productivity, others exploit it to spread misinformation or generate false images and videos in the likeness of others.</p>
<p>Organizations like Adobe, BBC, Microsoft, Sony, and Nikon formed the <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> and the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> to address these issues. These groups developed Content Credentials, which use VCs to tackle the challenges of content theft and misuse of AI-generated content, aiming to protect creators’ rights.</p>

 4. Music Copyright<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/7-ways-we-use-vcs-today#4-music-copyright" title="Direct link to 4. Music Copyright">​</a> 
<p>Musical artists typically don't own their masters, meaning they lack full control over their recordings when signing a record deal. Today, more musical artists are opting to own their masters to regain control over the distribution of their work. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colesdavis/">Cole Davis</a> describes the publishing and distribution of music as a "music supply chain" and observed a disjointed process involving agreements through text messages, scattered emails between lawyers, and inconsistent procedures.</p>
<p>To address these issues, Davis built <a href="https://www.switchchord.com/">Switchcord</a>, using VCs to provide cryptographic proof of who was involved in creating a song, when it happened, and what contracts were signed. This ensures all participants receive proper credit and compensation, preventing false claims.</p>

 5. Loan Applications<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/7-ways-we-use-vcs-today#5-loan-applications" title="Direct link to 5. Loan Applications">​</a> 
<p>The U.S. credit system requires residents to accumulate debt as a prerequisite for obtaining loans, leading to more debt. Recent<a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/credit-access#/experiences-credit-demand1"> data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a> underscores this systemic issue, revealing that 1 in 5 applicants for mortgages, car loans, or other loans were rejected — the highest rate in five years.</p>
<p><a href="https://formfree.com/">FormFree</a> is addressing this problem using the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/">Web5 SDK</a> to provide VCs for loan borrowers through their <a href="https://www.formfree.com/passport/">Passport</a> product. Their approach involves creating an anonymized, tamper-proof credit profile as a VCs for lenders to review and make offers, aiming to put power back in the hands of the borrower.</p>

 6. Online Marketplaces and Catfishing<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/7-ways-we-use-vcs-today#6-online-marketplaces-and-catfishing" title="Direct link to 6. Online Marketplaces and Catfishing">​</a> 
<p>Unfortunately, online marketplace scams are common. From purchasing a car to renting a home or adopting a pet, you can buy and sell almost anything online. However, there's no foolproof mechanism to ensure the seller is trustworthy.</p>
<p>With the rise of social media, catfishing — where a person pretends to be someone they're not while online dating — has also increased dramatically. While many believe they're not susceptible, <a href="https://wifitalents.com/statistic/social-media-catfish/">23%</a> of online dating participants reported being catfished, and <a href="https://wifitalents.com/statistic/social-media-catfish/">41%</a> of catfish victims are between the ages of 18 and 34.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-alan-schwartz">Jeffrey Schwartz</a> created <a href="https://www.dentity.com/">Dentity</a> to reduce the frequency of scams and catfishing incidents. Dentity uses VCs to verify individuals on any platform, from dating apps to online marketplaces.</p>

<p>Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are designated areas within a country that operate under different business and trade laws than the rest of the nation. These zones typically offer incentives like tax breaks and simplified regulations. <a href="https://www.catawba.com/">The Catawba Indian Nation</a> established their own SEZ called the <a href="https://catawbadigital.zone/">Catawba Digital Economic Zone</a>, with the goal of driving economic development, attracting businesses, and creating opportunities for tribal members.</p>
<p>The Catawba Digital Economic Zone is using the <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/">Web5 SDK</a> to grant VCs to members. These VCs allow users to prove their identity and achieve regulatory compliance within the zone.</p>

<p>The rise of online gaming and gambling has ushered in new challenges, particularly concerning underage access. T<a href="https://commonwealthbeacon.org/by-the-numbers/poll-indicates-young-people-arent-betting-on-sports-as-much-as-feared/" title="">raditional age verification methods are proving inadequate</a>, often breaching privacy or failing to prevent minors from accessing restricted content. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), or decentralized identity technology, emerges as a powerful solution to bolster age verification processes while upholding privacy standards.</p>



 <a href="https://nationalcollege.com/news/online-gambling-and-young-people-understanding-the-risks" title="">Current Challenges in Age Verification</a>: 



 
 Ineffective Measures: Many platforms rely on easily manipulated self-reported data for age verification. 



 Privacy Risks: Traditional methods compel users to disclose sensitive personal data, raising serious privacy concerns. 



 Regulatory Complexity: Compliance with diverse international regulations complicates operations for global platforms. 
 







 The Growing Concern of Child Gambling and Gaming Accessibility: 



 
 Ease of Access: The widespread availability of digital devices gives minors easy access to online gambling and gaming sites. 



 Targeted Marketing: Many sites deploy marketing strategies that resonate with younger audiences, inadvertently attracting minors. 



 Inadequate Controls: Parental control features often fall short in effectively barring persistent minors from accessing age-restricted platforms. 
 



 SSI’s Role in Streamlining Age Verification: 



<p><a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/self-sovereign-identity-ssi/" title="">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> offers a transformative approach to managing digital identities that can significantly enhance the enforcement of age restrictions:</p>



 
 Protecting User Privacy: SSI enables the verification of a user’s age without disclosing additional personal details. A verifiable credential could confirm a user is over a certain age limit without sharing their exact date of birth. 



 Building Trust through Security: Leveraging blockchain, SSI ensures that identity credentials are secure and immutable, fostering trust between users and platforms. 



 Universal Application: Once issued, SSI credentials can be reused across multiple platforms, simplifying compliance with varying global regulations. 
 



 Steps for Effective Implementation: 



 
 Integrating Technology: Seamless integration of SSI with existing digital platforms requires cooperation between technology developers, regulatory authorities, and platform operators. 



 Promoting User Adoption: Widespread user adoption of SSI is crucial and can be encouraged through education and clear benefits over traditional methods. 



 Regulatory Support: Regulatory bodies need to recognize and support SSI as a legitimate verification method, facilitating its broader acceptance and implementation. 
 



<p>The urgency to address underage access in online gaming and gambling necessitates a shift towards more reliable and privacy-centric verification methods. Self-Sovereign Identity holds promise in meeting these demands, offering robust solutions for platforms to enforce age restrictions effectively while safeguarding user privacy.</p>

  <p>We’re pleased to announce significant updates to the Sign-ins workbook in the Microsoft Entra admin center, a crucial tool for organizations transitioning from Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries (ADAL) to Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL). These updates aim to streamline the ADAL migration process by providing comprehensive insights into your ADAL-application-related data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is this Important? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">announced</a> ADAL end of life in June 2020 and stopped supporting any security updates as of June 2023—which means applications using ADAL can’t utilize the latest security features, leaving them vulnerable to future security threats.&nbsp;&nbsp; We strongly recommend migrating any application using ADAL to MSAL to improve the security posture and resilience of authentication and authorization of your client applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSAL supports the latest security features for Microsoft Entra ID like managed identity, Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE), passkeys, and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/msal-migration#why-switch-to-msal">many more</a>. The updated Sign-ins workbook is an essential tool in this transition, providing the necessary insights and data to make informed decisions to execute migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What's new in the Sign-ins workbook? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sign-ins workbook is redesigned for admins needing a centralized and more detailed view of applications using ADAL within their tenant. These additional insights can help them identify, investigate, and validate the ADAL applications to successfully migrate to MSAL.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect with the latest enhancements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Comprehensive sign-in log aggregation: The workbook now consolidates logs from various types of sign-in events, including interactive, non-interactive, and service principal sign-ins. 
 Enhanced data visualization: We updated the report with new aggregated metrics to enable an all-up view of sign-ins across ADAL applications. To aid in your specific analytical needs, the workbook supports the application of custom filters and queries. This flexibility enables you to focus on the information that matters most to your ADAL migration efforts. 
 Integration with Microsoft Entra recommendations: You can now directly access this Sign-Ins workbook from the ADAL to MSAL recommendation page to dive deep into the list of ADAL applications listed on the recommendation details page. To use the workbooks for Microsoft Entra ID, you need a Microsoft Entra ID tenant with a P1 license.

Image credit: Madelyn&nbsp;Capozzi<p>ChatGPT is everywhere. The AI chatbot exploded into the mainstream almost overnight, reaching 100 million monthly users just two months after it was launched back in November 2022 (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">Reuters, 2023</a>). Since then, ChatGPT has been <a href="https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts">enlisted to do nearly everything</a>, from writing code, to passing high school exams, to even<a href="https://x.com/tqbf/status/1598513757805858820?lang=en"> crafting a Bible verse about how to remove a peanut-butter sandwich from a VCR</a>. OpenAI — and Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and a handful of startups — built these impressive machine learning systems, yet they didn’t do it alone: it wouldn’t have been possible without the wealth of data from our digital commons (and the hard, extractive and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots">invisible labor</a> of thousands of data labelers). In fact, your comments on Reddit or X may have been critical in building ChatGPT and will likely be used to build more AI systems in the future. This calls into question the usage of property rights as a framework for data and our digital economies: should you get a share of the profits from the tech innovations your data helped create? Can you say no to your data being used for certain purposes? How do we balance individual rights with collective responsibilities?</p><p>This blog explores the knotted problem space of data governance, and how traditional property rights frameworks are increasingly ill-suited to deal with the distributed contributions, impacts, and risks of data and the emerging technologies it makes possible. It argues that rather than governing data, we need to shift towards democratic governance of access to data and what it is used for to unleash its full potential to deliver for public&nbsp;good.</p><p>This is Part 2 of our deep dive into property rights (in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/diving-deep-into-the-deep-code-unraveling-the-knotted-problem-spaces-of-housing-data-87e595e8919b">Part 1 we peeled back the layers of the housing crisis</a>) in which we explore its role and potential in dealing with today’s systemic challenges. We do this by looking through the lens of affordances and disaffordances: what do our property systems allow us to do, see, be and imagine? What incentives do they create and what priorities do they assign? And consequently, how could their redesign recast our relationship with each other and with our natural and built environments, and create a pathway to systemic thriving?</p><p>These blogs are intended both as an exploratory journey and a rallying cry to policymakers and strategic risk holders to deepen their commitment to systemic innovation and invest in compelling new visions for the future to be able to overcome political and institutional lock-ins and match the necessity of the contexts we&nbsp;face.</p><p>DATA GOVERNANCE: A KNOTTED PROBLEM&nbsp;SPACE</p><p>Everything is made of data. Data has become and will continue to be at the very heart of our societies. As Bing Song stated, “<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/big-data-as-the-next-public-good/">it is much like the air we breathe, water we drink and electricity we depend on</a>”. The immense social and economic importance of data presents one of the most important governance challenges of our time, yet to many, the nature of the problem space remains opaque.(1)</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,</a> Shoshana Zuboff likens our inner lives to a pre-Colonial continent, invaded and strip-mined of data by Big Tech, driven by an insatiable profit motive that demands the extraction of all data, from all sources, by any means possible. This entails the datafication and “surveillance of people, places, processes, things, and relationships among them” (<a href="https://ojs.library.queensu.ca/index.php/surveillance-and-society/article/view/datafication">van Dijck, 2014</a>). Data is used to profile and target people, to optimize systems, to control outcomes. This might be as “harmless” as personalized ads or diet trackers. Or, as worrying as police using cameras with facial recognition software. Or, as dystopian as Amazon using wristbands to track where their warehouse workers are at all times and provide <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-patents-wristband-to-track-hand-movements-of-war-1822590549?IR=T">haptic feedback when they work inefficiently</a>.</p><p>Our view is that the problem with data is not datafication per se — although we recognize that seeing the world in a way that asserts everything is data shapes how we understand and interact with the world in ways that “sort it into categories and norms, to render it legible and observable, to exclude other metrics and methods of knowing it” (<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/monograph/4738/Sorting-Things-OutClassification-and-Its">Bowker and Star, 2000</a>). Rather, we think that data’s potential to deliver collective value is currently curtailed by extractive and exclusive property and ownership logics that optimize for private financial value, control, and rent-seeking. By trying to govern data through property rights, we have done it and ourselves a disservice, limiting the actions, behaviors and social imaginaries it has allowed for, and resulting in the worrisome reality of Big Tech, Big Brother and “<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1057/jit.2015.5">Big&nbsp;Other</a>”.</p><p>UNTANGLING THE&nbsp;KNOT</p><p>So what precisely are the actions, behaviors, and social imaginaries that property and ownership afford us when it comes to our data and digital economies? What are the knotted challenges of how we govern data&nbsp;today?</p><p>Current data governance allows for the privatization of public value and contributions&nbsp;…</p><p>The introduction already hinted at it, but if there’s one thing that property is inherently bad at it is accounting for multiple, interconnected contributions and value flows. Nowhere is this more evident than with machine learning systems like ChatGPT. Property affords only a reductive mode of information processing and organizing in which complexity and entanglement are reduced to systems of low information burdens. Historically, property rights were designed to provide security, encouraging the development of land and resources by clearly delineating boundaries between owners and non-owners and communicating rights and entitlements. After all, “the earth would not produce her fruits in sufficient quantities, without the assistance of tillage: but who would be at the pains of tilling it, if another might watch an opportunity to seise upon and enjoy the product of his industry, art, and labour?” (<a href="https://lonang.com/library/reference/tucker-blackstone-notes-reference/tuck-301/">Blackstone, 1803)</a> Yet this mechanism is inadequate when the value produced comes not from an individual owner but from the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">collective intelligence</a>” of humanity. Machine learning models use vast databases of information (text, code, images) scraped from the internet — all of which is part of the digital commons contributed to by many. While much of the value derives from the commons (2), the profits of the models and their applications are disproportionately — if not singularly — captured by those who create them, rather than being reinvested into the commons. Current property rights do not create obligations towards third parties or entitlements for those who contributed, failing to ensure that value from our digital economies benefits the broader community.</p><p>… and fails to recognize data is not about individual actors but relationships among&nbsp;them</p><p>To address the private capturing of data’s value many have hailed individual data ownership as a precondition to return “control” to the individual. Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) introduced the “<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s806">Own Your Own Data Act of 2019</a>,” which declares that “each individual owns and has an exclusive property right in the data that individual generates on the internet” and requires that social media companies obtain licenses to use this data, while <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/1230352135335940096">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also argued for data ownership as a solution to inequality,</a> tweeting: “the reason many tech platforms have created billionaires is [because] they track you without your knowledge, amass your personal data &amp; sell it without your express consent. You don’t own your data, &amp; you should.” The problem is that solving data governance through individual property rights is like trying to force a square peg in a round hole. Data’s inherent qualities make it impossible to be treated like any other asset under property rights. Data’s intangibility and ubiquity mean that it has little use or exchange value in the form of small amounts of raw information. Data’s value is derived from economies of scale. That means data is always about relationships, not the individual. Information is useful (or harmful) because it can be used to infer insights about — and thus make decisions affecting — multiple people. This inherent relationality means that property rights, with their singular lens of bounded individualism, cannot effectively nor legitimately govern data. Therefore, Matt Prewitt from RadicalxChange has argued that, “<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/a-view-of-the-future-of-our-data/">data cannot be owned, but must be governed</a>.”</p>Our individual data, like a single gust of wind, says little on its own. Its true value comes from its role in observable patterns across larger datasets. Once interpreted, these patterns can be used to inform all kinds of interventions, including new forms of top-down&nbsp;control.<p>Current data governance prioritizes exchange value over use value&nbsp;…</p><p>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/diving-deep-into-the-deep-code-unraveling-the-knotted-problem-spaces-of-housing-data-87e595e8919b">our blog on the housing crisis,</a> we saw that house prices are largely driven by land values, and that these have risen at a much faster rate than incomes in nearly all advanced economies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century">Piketty, 2014</a>). The consequence has been increasing rentier returns to land- and homeowners on the one hand, and a major housing affordability crisis on the other. Increasingly, we are seeing that our digital economies are getting trapped in similar cycles of “data rentiership”. While value extraction in housing happens through access to scarce resources, i.e. land, in digital economies it happens through control of the innovation process (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/final_iipp-wp2020-13-theorising-and-mapping-modern-economic-rents_8_oct.pdf">Mazzucato, Collins and Gouzoulis, 2020</a>). Big Tech has been able to monopolize ownership and control over personal data, extracting financial value without creating any additional use value. Aggregation and accumulation of data has become a business model in itself (Zuboff, 2018). Property rights have allowed companies to extract rents from the use of their monopolistic platforms, either through service providers or consumers, without creating an incentive to deliver innovation that benefits society. The result: more value is being extracted from our data economies than added to&nbsp;it.</p><p>… and has permitted the centralization of control, and thus&nbsp;risk</p><p>Another parallel we can draw between land and data governance is by looking at how property rights have permitted small privileged classes of “owners” to exercise control. Data is not just a means of wealth, it is also a means of governance. Data ownership has systematically disempowered everybody except for a handful of companies that amass the most data. The risks concomitant with this power asymmetry are felt as micro-massive impacts in our daily lives, our democracies, and our economies. Think of <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/tool/mass-surveillance-and-monopolization-of-data">Cambridge Analytica </a>and how it leveraged the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent for political advertising purposes to try to influence future political, and economic, outcomes. Meanwhile, centralized systems of control, verification and storage are also more vulnerable to large-scale data breaches, with downstream effects that may cause mass destabilization, creating ripple effects across global supply chains and disruptions to essential services and infrastructure, such as healthcare and food systems. The <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/tool/cyberwarfare-and-digital-weapons-of-mass-destabilization">WannaCry Ransomware Attack</a>, for instance, disrupted over a third of NHS Trusts in England, forcing emergency rooms to divert patients and cancel surgeries.</p>Image credit: Webroot/BBC<p>Data has unleashed a new kind of power that cannot be adequately governed by centralized public or private&nbsp;systems</p><p>Property rights have long been the primary mediator between public and private power. Yet with the rise of the predictive and market-making power of data we are seeing that the state’s role, as both guarantor and regulator of property, is becoming increasingly unworkable. States are not only overpowered by the property interests of tech companies, they also are struggling to intelligently and effectively regulate the increasingly complex systems underpinning our digital economies. While intellectual property rights owe their existence to law and the willingness of states to back them with their coercive powers and render them enforceable, the power of data is not dependent on the state. Companies have mostly relied on technological barriers to limit access to the data they have amassed. In fact, they have benefited precisely from the inability of the state to regulate, taking advantage from the ambiguity that has surrounded data ownership. This new reality in which the power of data has emerged as a wholly new form of institutional power, outside of the full control of state or private actors, calls for new governance capabilities that ensure this power is held accountable and directed towards public&nbsp;good.</p><p>CRAFTING PATHWAYS TOWARDS NEW AFFORDANCES</p><p>This process of untangling the knot of challenges surrounding data governance shows how property and ownership are increasingly insufficient. It shows the need for new institutional mechanisms that provide a wider scope of affordances, allowing for new ways of relating to our data and governing what it is used for. This would need to involve decoupling data from both control and extractive dynamics in favor of stewardship, responsibility, and relationality to ensure it delivers new levels of public value and innovation in ways that are all-together more equitable, accountable, and distributed.</p><p>At the heart of this shift in governance is fundamentally a different way of thinking about data itself. Because data is always about relationships among actors, our assumption of individual rights needs to make way for collective responsibilities and agency. In this way, the inequality and power asymmetries that have emerged in today’s data landscape are not about reclaiming control or individual repayment, but about the collective determination of outcomes for which data is developed and used. Rather than optimizing for individual and singular interests — of “data owners” or “data subjects” — we need to recognize and balance the full spectrum of overlapping and at times competing interests, risks, and value flows implied in data governance and optimize for the potential of data itself. As such, data can be transformed for what is now a “dead” financial asset into a generative agent, which unlocks value not just for the very few but for our collective well-being.</p><p>In this new paradigm, data can be thought of as a river flowing through our digital economies. It emerges as an active agent in a complex web of relationships, with the autonomous ability to effect change — both positively and negatively — thus creating inherent responsibilities. Governing these rivers of data is akin to the nonexclusive rights riparian owners have over a river that runs by their land. The interdependence between those upstream and downstream requires us to take into account conflicting interests and needs, and implies imposing certain restrictions for the public good. Organizations that want to benefit from the bounty of these rivers must act as stewards. Rather than hoarding the water or excluding others from its use, their role is to support the river’s full potential to deliver the broadest possible value. While property rights once made data governance a matter of control, this new paradigm shifts the focus to collective care.</p><p>There are <a href="https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets">numerous examples </a>of public data sets and new approaches that center distributed governance and seek to unlock data’s potential for public good. <a href="https://www.barcelona.cat/digitalstandards/en/data-management/0.1/objectives">Barcelona,</a> for instance, has implemented a civic data trust to manage its data commons, allowing citizens to have a great say over what data is collected and for which purposes while also <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/bartlett_public_purpose/files/new_data_deal_barcelona_fernando_barns_kattel_and_bria.pdf">supporting experiments in citizen-led decision-making through open-source platforms</a>. Or <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a>, a network that has dedicated itself to developing and distributing free geospatial data in ways that would not easily be accomplished by individual mappers&nbsp;alone.</p><p>Adding to this work, Dark Matter Labs has been exploring the potential of self-owning data governed through a network of digital micro-trusts with <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/6b4e4cbf820032a2c10d9c780c9f35123d162045.pdf">Care Sense</a>, a new Proof of Possibility developed as part of <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a>. We are envisioning self-owning urban sensing infrastructure, such as street cameras, that leverage data to dynamically assess and respond to contextual care needs in the city, by either enabling direct responses (e.g. alerting emergency responders) or generating insights that other stakeholders can act upon (e.g. revised road policies). By making the sensing data self-owning, we allow it to flow more freely across the system, unlocking broad public value and reducing risk through distributed governance, verification and accountability mechanisms. The foundational infrastructure for this self-ownership is built on a network of digital micro-trusts which automatically release permissions for data access, manage use cases, and maintain registries of permissions.</p><p>OUR CALL TO&nbsp;ACTION</p><p>Just as with the housing crisis, the knotted problem space of data demands a deep-code perspective to reveal how seemingly discrete challenges are in fact interrelated and interdependent, and are rooted in an outdated systems-logic based on individual ownership. What becomes abundantly clear is that property rights in their current form are insufficient to address the privatization of public value, to deal with the inefficiencies of use and rent-seeking behaviors in our digital economies, or to manage distributed contributions and value flows of emerging technologies. Privacy regulations like GDPR or proposals for individual data ownership are welcome intermediate solutions but fail to recognize that the challenge of data governance can simply not be resolved through the lens of individual rights and control logics. To allow data to be used to their full potential, and support the democratization of our digital economies and better governance of today’s complex realities, we are in urgent need of new institutional capabilities (governance frameworks, legal mechanisms, interfaces) that allow us to relate differently to data as a relational and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Notes</p><p>(1) A critical part of the problem space we are choosing not to cover in this blog is that of AI’s environmental impacts — and that of tech and data economies more generally — and the governance challenges surrounding this. We recognize that the growing demand for data and AI tools carries <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/google-s-emissions-shot-up-48-over-five-years-due-to-ai">immense environmental costs</a>, from the extraction of critical minerals for the development of hardware, to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption">enormous energy consumption for the training of AI models</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-gpt4-iowa-ai-water-consumption-microsoft-f551fde98083d17a7e8d904f8be822c4">water usage for cooling data servers</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heatherclancycollins_artificialintelligence-activity-7213953764993499137-mbQ8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">Google and Microsoft </a>both have reported significant increases in emissions as they have integrated AI throughout many of their core products. There is a real risk that big data and tech companies are on the path to become greater emitters than fossil fuel companies; not just from their direct environmental impacts but from the second and third order effects of AI on total global consumption from higher overall productivity. The planetary-level challenges surrounding AI require a deep and nuanced exploration that is beyond the scope of this&nbsp;blog.</p><p>(2) We recognize that the value of AI systems does not just come from the digital commons, but also from the algorithm that is able to process high volumes of data, the servers which work on instant speed to respond to requests, the design used to teach AI English or filter out violent and abusive content, the tedious labor involved in filtering through and labeling data, and much much&nbsp;more.</p><p>Did this blog resonate with you and are you interested in getting involved?

 Verida’s credentials library helps developers future proof their applications and master digital&nbsp;identity True Web3 Ownership Starts With Verifiable Credentials<p>The world is moving online at a rapid pace, and with this transition comes the need for new processes and standards to identify ourselves. Verida harnesses Web3 infrastructure to empower people with verifiable, self-sovereign identities, removing the reliance on centralized organizations.</p><p>To understand how Verida achieves this, we first need to know what credentials are and how they’re&nbsp;managed.</p> Society and credentials <p>From ancient civilizations, to the digital worlds of Web2 and Web3, it’s impossible to navigate the world without trustworthy credentials. Typically speaking, you need physical documents such as diplomas, certificates, and identity cards to access products and services in modern society. Venture back a little further and people used stone tablets, wax seals, and papyrus scrolls to prove identities and convey authority.</p><p>In order for a reliable credential system to work, there are multiple elements that need to be in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Issuers are the recognised authorities that can provide such documents, be it a government authority in the case of an ID card, or an educational institution for degrees and diplomas. Not only are these recognised by law, their concepts are well-known and understood in all societies around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Holders are the people, businesses, organizations, and institutions, who receive and use credentials to access products and services or to prove specific facts and achievements. Holders typically have little say over their choice of credential method and how the underlying system&nbsp;works.</p><p>Verification occurs when a credential is controlled. For most of humanity, this has been a manual process, one that’s only as reliable as the person or system that’s doing the controlling.</p>Photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@liamtruong"> Liam Truong</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com">&nbsp;Unsplash</a><p>As computers came on the scene, and the internet gained adoption, a digital transformation began to occur. Trust began to be built in the online world. Issuers moved online, bringing a new world of digital certificates, signatures, and identification.</p><p>From the stone tablets of ancient civilization to single sign-ons with Google, a number of factors have remained fairly constant. Striving for a faster and easier way to issue and verify credentials brings with it an increasing number of tradeoffs in security and privacy. Falsification has gotten easier, while centralized platforms continue to become targets for corruption, data breaches and internal&nbsp;misuse.</p> Enter Web3 and verifiable credentials <p>As the internet moves from Web2 to Web3, so too does it enter the “Own” era of “Read-Write-Own”. In order to allow the Web3 ecosystem to truly flourish, self-sovereign ownership of money and digital assets must be accompanied by self-sovereign ownership of personal credentials.</p><p>To tie down decentralized blockchains to physical documents would be counterproductive to their progress, while continuing to rely exclusively upon centralized systems defeats the purpose of self-sovereignty.</p><p>When implemented correctly, Web3 can be complemented by verifiable credentials: A suite of decentralized solutions to help us navigate the increasingly blurred lines of the physical and the virtual worlds, in a safe and secure&nbsp;manner.</p> Key use cases for Web3 verifiable credentials <p>Verifiable credentials offer the possibility to generate an undeniable proof that you, the person signing a document, requesting a service, or purchasing a product, have at one point in time proven your identity, or ownership of a particular asset, and that this document is still&nbsp;valid.</p><p>In practice, the act of providing this proof without granting access to sensitive information should be more than enough to allow for secure digital interactions to take&nbsp;place.</p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/VC_triangle_of_Trust.svg">VC triangle of Trust</a> by Daniel H Hardman, licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA&nbsp;4.0</a><p>There are various use cases for verifiable credentials; the following are complementary to an empowered self-sovereign Web3 user experience.</p> Reusable KYC and KYB for crypto&nbsp;projects <p>How many companies have you entrusted with your sensitive personal data? Doesn’t it leave a weird feeling in your stomach once you start counting them all&nbsp;up?</p><p>Most of these companies don’t need to know your date of birth, your personal ID number, or your home address. But they are required to follow protocol and ensure they’re not dealing with people linked to illicit activity. There’s a lot that can be improved here simply by abstracting the sensitive data away from the fact that someone’s credentials are legitimate.</p><p>As regulations weigh down on the crypto industry, a single, reusable zero-knowledge Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) proof would enable traders to hop between exchanges at ease, streamlining their user experiences and downscaling the risk of sensitive data being mishandled.</p> Proof of real world&nbsp;assets <p>How many people have unlawfully lost their properties and possessions during times of war? And what assurances did they have of regaining their land, or the value of their assets, once new borders were drawn up. Under a centralized structure, the new power in control can easily neglect or deny the contents of previous property&nbsp;records.</p><p>An open, decentralized blockchain-based ledger could fix this as it would provide an undeniable, timestamped proof of ownership. It’s the perfect platform to store and access proofs of verifiable credentials.</p><p>The use case of proving ownership of real world assets is of course not limited to times of war. Many institutions are beginning to navigate the world of asset tokenization, and verifiable credentials provide the ideal digital structure to safeguard their integrity.</p> Proof of personal data and reputation <p>Misinformation and impersonation are age-old human problems. More recently, these issues have been inflated due to the rise in popularity of social media platforms, with far reaching impact on political scenes around the world. Add to this the growing threat of AI-generated deep fake content and the line between what’s real and what’s fake becomes impossible to&nbsp;discern.</p><p>Human beings linking their accounts to verifiable credentials is potentially the only way to move forward in a digital world increasingly shared with bots, scammers and manipulative organizations.</p> How Verida empowers builders with verifiable credentials <p>Think of Verida as a base layer upon which a variety of other networks, blockchains and applications can tap into for solutions linked to identity and verification.</p><p>The advantage of this modular flexibility is that users can navigate both Web2 and Web3 applications and services while receiving, storing and even sharing credentials all in one place: their <a href="https://www.verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a>. Just as the leather wallet in your pocket might hold your cards, tickets, photos, and receipts, as well as your cash, the Verida wallet aims to bring far more personal utility to your digital experiences than what a typical crypto wallet might&nbsp;offer.</p><p>The ability to access multiple identity networks and even bridge credentials between applications and blockchains is made possible thanks to Verida’s <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/extensions/credentials/verifiable-credentials#verifiable-credentials-developer-sdk">Verifiable Credentials Developer SDK</a>.

				  Bank and financial institution call centers are on the frontline in technology’s latest battle over identity fraud. Decentralized identity provides a low cost, low friction, high benefit solution.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Biometrics —&nbsp;using facial, voice, and other physiological characteristics to authenticate a person — was supposed to save customers from the risk of their passwords being stolen. Our biometric characteristics provide a much tougher security profile to crack and can be used to manage mobile and online banking services, payments, ATMs, KYC and AML requirements, and even to remotely onboard customers.</p>
<p>Now, the promise of seamless and secure authentication has been hit by a shapeshifting wrecking ball: deepfake phishing.</p>
<p>In January 2024, an employee of a multinational company, Arup, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/arup-deepfake-scam-loss-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">was duped</a> into sending $25 million to fraudsters after she participated in a video conference call with what she thought was a real, senior executive. The executive who told her to make the payment turned out to be, an AI-generated “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/69009887">deepfake</a>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deloitte’s Center for Financial Services <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2024/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html">estimates</a> that AI-driven fraud could cost the United States alone between $20 and $40 billion dollars by 2027.</p>
<p>While Arup grabbed global headlines with the scale of the loss, the reality is that attacks using AI are more often focused on defrauding customers with bank and financial call centers on the frontline.</p>
<p>Using AI to mimic the voice of a person, a hacker can generate hundreds of robo calls to different bank call centers, each attempting to reset the passwords of different accounts so as to gain access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The burden on call center staff and interactive voice response (IVR) authentication systems to identify a virtual fake from a real customer is enormous. But customers are also at risk of being phished by a deepfaking their financial institution’s IVR system.</p>
<p>Proposed solutions such as abandoning voice recognition or using more sophisticated AI to detect deepfakes are either extreme or likely to trigger an endless AI arms race.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity offers a much simpler approach to mitigating the problem. We have already shown how a verifiable account credential radically simplifies authenticating a customer (and a customer authenticating their bank) before access is given. And it provides passwordless login to deter regular phishing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a bank can also use the communication features of a verifiable credential to rapidly double check identity. This is because a communication channel with the customer can be created during credential issuance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trusted channel can’t be accessed by another party or faked. And it allows the bank call center to automatically verify a caller by sending a message over the channel asking the customer to “please confirm we are on a call right now.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advantage over multifactor authentication is that using a verifiable credential is faster, more secure, and it works in both directions. It’s not just a simple way for banks to authenticate customers, it’s a simple way for customers to authenticate their banks.</p>
<p>Curious as to how you could protect your call center with verifiable credentials?&nbsp;</p>

 Comparing Linear SVM vs Lasso (L1) vs Ridge Regression (L2) vs ElasticNet (L1-L2), and Calibration of Classifier Probabilities  Summary <p>This post describes benchmarks on Ocean Predictoor simulations across various approaches: Linear SVM (ClassifLinearSVM) and Linear Logistic Regression models (ClassifLinearLasso, ClassifLinearRidge, ClassifLinearElasticNet) to determine the effects of (a) linear regularization, and to (b) calibrating the models’ output probabilities.</p><p>It then proceeds to do a walk-through of each of the benchmarks for predictoor/trader profit, and comparison plots for the models &amp; their calibrations.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 What is Classification? <p>Classification models (“classifiers”) predict the category or class label of an input. For example, in email spam detection, a classifier might predict whether an email is Spam or Not Spam. Since it has just two possible categories, this makes it a binary-valued classification model (True or&nbsp;False).</p><p>To compare, regression models (“regressors”) predict a continuous-valued output. In an email spam application, a regressor might predict the number of spam messages per&nbsp;day.</p> 1.2 What is Regularization? <p>“Regularization” is a technique in fitting models that aims to reduce the uncertainty of future predictions. (“Minimize volume of future predictions confidence ellipsoid.) There are many approaches to regularization. When learning linear models, they occupy a spectrum&nbsp;from:</p>  L1 / Lasso: Try to get sparse models with few parameters.  L2 / Ridge Regression: Allow each variable to have a weight, however&nbsp;small.  ElasticNet: Shades of gray between L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2.   1.3 What’s Calibration of Classifier Probabilities? <p>Beyond just predicting True or False, classification models can also output their estimated probability of True or False (or more general category).</p><p>Probabilities fall out naturally with some classifier formulations, such as logistic regression. However, SVMs, including linear SVMs, do not produce probability estimates. Instead, they produce a decision boundary and classify data points based on which side of the boundary they fall on. Calibration of a linear SVM’s classification involves converting the raw decision scores (which indicate the distance from the decision boundary) into calibrated probabilities that reflect the true likelihood of the classification.</p><p>We can “calibrate” output probabilities by warping the model’s estimated probability to a training set. This means its probability estimates can be more trustworthy. Some techniques include: None, Isotonic, and&nbsp;Sigmoid.</p>  None calibration: Uses the model’s raw, uncalibrated probabilities.  Isotonic calibration: Maps predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities by dividing the probabilities into classes using a fitted piecewise constant, non-decreasing function.  Sigmoid calibration: Maps predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities by transforming the raw scores using a sigmoid function, which has an S-shaped curve, squeezing the input values into the range [0,&nbsp;1].   1.4 Ocean Predictoor, Classification, and Benchmarks <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn&nbsp;$.</p><p>Classification models are used to predict whether the next BTC/USDT close value will go UP or DOWN. (Or ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, etc.)</p><p>We developed a simulation tool (“pdr sim”) for data scientists to run simulations of their predictoor &amp; trader bots to benchmark which modeling strategy, trading strategy, parameters, etc., on $ made by predicting or trading. The simulator also outputs classifier accuracy, f1 / recall / precision, and other classifier performance metrics.</p> 1.5 Benchmarks Outline <p>To help users in setting parameters, we ran benchmarks using the “pdr multisim” tool, which invokes the simulator in a loop across various parameter settings. This blog post describes the results of those benchmarks.</p><p>We run benchmarks on each of the approaches:</p>  ClassifLinearLasso — L1 regularization  ClassifLinearRidge — L2 regularization  ClassifLinearElasticNet models — spectrum between L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2.  ClassifLinearSVM — L2 regularization  <p>And for each of those approaches, we run the three calibration approaches (None, Isotonic, Sigmoid).</p><p>All the plots for ClassifLinearLasso, ClassifLinearRidge, and ClassifLinearElastic net models is shown in the Predictoor benchmarks series first blogpost, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor-benchmarking-on-regularized-linear-classifiers-with-calibration-770d4edd51c9">“Predictoor Benchmarking On Regularized Linear Classifiers With Calibration”</a>.</p> 1.6 Experimental Setup <p>These parameters were defined in our my_ppss.yaml file, a customized version of the ppss.yaml file of the pdr-backend repo:</p>  ClassifLinearRidge, ClassifLinearLasso, ClassifLinearElasticNet, and ClassifLinearSVM ML models were tested with None, Isotonic, and Sigmoid calibrations.  Models predicted 5min candle UP/DOWN feeds for BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT for 5000&nbsp;epochs.  Models were trained on historical Binance 5min close candle data using either a BTC-USDT training set or both BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT training set from January 1, 2024, to June 30,&nbsp;2024.  The # of training samples (max_n_train) tested were 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000,&nbsp;15000.  Autoregressive n = 1 and 2 were tested. (Number of candles in the past to build models&nbsp;from.)  Trading fees were set to&nbsp;0%.  The predictoor bot stake was set to 100 OCEAN per&nbsp;epoch.  Other predictoors’ accuracy was set to 50.001% (barely better than&nbsp;random).   2. ClassifLinearSVM <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearSVM model is a Python scikit-learn support vector classifier with a linear kernel trick implemented for binary classification &amp; L2 regularization.</p> 2.1 ClassifLinearSVM Benchmarks  2.1.1 Predictoor Profitability <p>At 5831.64 OCEAN, the ClassifLinearSVM model achieved the greatest Predictoor profit of all the previous benchmarks and was trained on 5000 samples of BTC-USDT data with None calibration. The previous best benchmark for Predictoor profit was achieved by the linear regression model ClassifLinearRidge at 4937.0429 OCEAN on the BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT training data at 5000 iterations. The max Predictoor profit also surpasses the profitability achieved by the ClassifLinearLasso &amp; ClassifLinearElasticNet models.</p><p>Predictoor Profit Tuning ClassifLinearSVM</p><p>Additional tuning of the ClassifLinearSVM model boosted profits greatly at max_n_train = 10000. At 6879.16 OCEAN achieved with BTC-USDT training data and 6122.31 OCEAN on BTC &amp; ETH-USDT data, Predictoor profits from the ClassifLinearSVM at 10000 training samples hit all-time highs for the&nbsp;model.</p> 2.1.2 Trader Profitability <p>While the ClassifLinearSVM model excelled in Predictoor profits, it did not outperform the previous maximum trader profit benchmark of $268.4489 USD achieved by the ClassifLinearLasso model.</p><p>Trader Profit Tuning ClassifLinearSVM</p><p>Nor did ClassifLinearSVM trader profit improve with tuning the max_n_train amount to 10000 &amp; 15000 samples. The max trader profits for ClassifLinearSVM occurred around 5000&nbsp;samples.</p> 3. Comparison Analysis  3.1 Highest Predictoor Profits <p>The ClassifLinearSVM model emerged as the top performer for maximizing Predictoor profits and outperformed the ClassifLinearLasso, ClassifLinearRidge, and ClassifLinearElasticNet models across all Predictoor profit benchmarks.</p> 3.2 Highest Trader&nbsp;Profits <p>Despite the impressive Predictoor profits, the ClassifLinearSVM model fell short in maximizing trader profits. The ClassifLinearLasso model remained the winner from prior benchmarks at a maximum trader profit of $268.4489 USD achieved with an Isotonic calibration, autoregressive_n =1, and 5000 samples of BTC-USDT training data. This suggests that while the ClassifLinearSVM model is highly effective in making accurate predictions, the logistic regression models’ calibrated probabilities better support confidence-based trading strategies.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>The benchmarking results highlight the strengths and trade-offs between Linear SVC and Linear Regression Classifier models for predicting crypto price movements in the Ocean Predictoor platform. The ClassifLinearSVM model with None calibration achieved the highest Predictoor profits, showcasing its superior predictive power in identifying profitable trades. However, for trader profitability, the ClassifLinearLasso model with Isotonic calibration continued to achieve max profits, emphasizing the importance of well-calibrated probabilities for trading&nbsp;success.</p><p>These insights encourage benchmarking of more models to optimize both prediction accuracy and trading profitability. The results show that while SVMs are powerful for prediction, linear logistic regression models with proper classifier calibration remain crucial for confidence-based trading strategies.</p> 5. Appendix: Tables  5.1 ClassifLinearSVM Data&nbsp;Table <p>The data for the ClassifLinearSVM model shows the maximum Predictoor profit at 5831.64 OCEAN, which surpasses all of the previous Predictoor Profit benchmarks. To achieve this, the model was trained on 5000 samples of BTC-USDT data with None calibration.</p> 5.2 ClassifLinearLasso Data&nbsp;Table <p>The data for ClassifLinearLasso evidences the maximum trader profit of $268.4489 USD in the row with Isotonic calibration, autoregressive_n = 1, and max_n_train = 5000 trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;data.</p> 5.3 ClassifLinearRidge Data&nbsp;Table <p>The ClassifLinearRidge data contains the previous maximum Predictoor profit benchmark of 4937.0429 OCEAN in the row containing Sigmoid calibration with autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples on BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT data. Notice that this model also demonstrated strong trading&nbsp;profits.</p> 5.4 ClassifLinearElasticNet Data&nbsp;Table <p>The ClassifLinearElasticNet table demonstrates similar patterns seen in the ClassifLinearLasso and ClassifLinearRidge benchmarks, which makes sense because this model is regularized with both L1 &amp; L2 penalties.</p> 6. Appendix: Details on Linear SVC Regularization <p>Linear SVC is a Support Vector Machine model with classification and a linear hyperplane. It includes two main parts: the first part minimizes the hinge loss, and the second part involves regularization, which can be either “L1” or “L2”. In these benchmarks, we used the default L2 regularization.</p> 6.1 L2 Regularization <p>L2 regularization minimizes the sum of the squared hinge loss errors and includes an additional penalty proportional to the sum of the squared values of the model parameters (weights). The L2 term prevents the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature by penalizing large weights. This helps in preventing overfitting and enhancing the model’s generalization to new&nbsp;data.</p><p>Mathematically, L2 regularization is represented as:</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

			  Omobola Giwa is Marketing Intern&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>Hello, I am Omobola (most people prefer Bola because it’s shorter). I come from the vibrant city of Lagos, Nigeria, and I am married to my birthday mate—a delightful coincidence that makes our shared celebrations even more special. Now, we’re a trio with the addition of our lively and adorable 2-year-old son, who fills our lives with joy and laughter.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I started my career in the legal field, having obtained a law degree from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, but the fast-paced world of business soon piqued my interest hence I transitioned into business development and project management roles, and spent a few fulfilling years doing these.</p>
<p>Upon relocating to Luxembourg, I seized the opportunity to deepen my business acumen by enrolling in a master’s program in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the University of Luxembourg. As part of this program, I undertook a 3-month internship working in the marketing team at Tokeny, a decision that has proven to be both strategic and rewarding.</p>
<p>Choosing Tokeny for my internship was driven by a desire to explore new frontiers. Firstly, I craved uncharted territories. Fintech, especially tokenization, is a cutting-edge frontier, and I wanted to be a part of it! Secondly, the marketing role offered a fresh challenge. While I had engaged in marketing activities in my previous roles, I had never dedicated myself solely to this discipline. Finally, after exploring Tokeny’s website and employee testimonials, I was struck by the company’s people culture. The stories I read reflected a supportive and inclusive environment, perfect for professional growth. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>My experience of working at Tokeny can be described as a unique blend of challenging work and supportive colleagues. Challenging because, even as an intern, you are entrusted with significant autonomy. You tackle diverse tasks, encouraging you to take ownership and innovate. This environment pushes you to grow and develop new skills continuously.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tokeny is incredibly supportive. The company fosters a safe space where you are encouraged to give your best without fear of judgment. The sense of value and backing from the team is palpable. Colleagues are open, quick to acknowledge mistakes, and always ready to provide constructive feedback and assistance.</p>
<p>This culture of trust and collaboration not only boosts your confidence but also instills a strong commitment to excel and contribute meaningfully to the company’s success. It’s an environment where I felt empowered to go above and beyond.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Children are my greatest passion. Their innate curiosity, honesty, and unfiltered joy never ceases to amaze me. I am captivated by their simplicity and the way they view the world with such wonder and trust. Having children around brings me immense joy, and their genuine nature is both inspiring and heartwarming.</p>
<p>However, I am also deeply concerned about their vulnerability. I dream of one day establishing an entity that is dedicated to supporting underprivileged children, providing them with the basic needs and opportunities they deserve.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream is to live a life filled with happiness and to be able to look back with no regrets. I aspire to create a meaningful and fulfilling life, both personally and professionally, where I can cherish every moment and be proud of the impact I’ve made.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Embrace the challenges and opportunities that come your way. Tokeny is a place where you can grow and thrive if you are willing to take initiative and be open to learning. </p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Tokenization is the future and Tokeny is part of the creators of that future—that in itself is exciting! We’re building the future of finance, and I can’t wait to see what incredible things Tokeny achieves next.</p>

Among many other things, Ian helped set up the <a href="https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-analytics-centre">NSW Data Analytics Centre</a>, he led the development of a series of superb papers on <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/Industry_Insights_Frameworks_and_Controls_for_Data_Sharing.html">data sharing</a> and the <a href="https://www.acs.org.au/insightsandpublications/reports-publications/data-and-the-digital-self.html">digital self</a> at the Australian Computer Society, and he represented Australia in the development of the new <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81745.html">international standard for Data Quality, ISO 8000</a>.</p>
<p>We covered a lot of ground, but I especially liked our discussion with Ian about the value of data and monetisation of digital assets.</p>
<p>It’s almost a taboo topic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">Surveillance capitalism</a> has come to dominate and poison how people regard data monetisation yet there are legitimate interests in realising the value of data.</p>
<p>So we asked Ian about making data value a respectable idea; how do we make it governable?</p>
<p>In conversation, Ian highlighted the problem that “no one’s really sure how [data is] valuable”.</p>
<p>“We are, to this day, still without an accounting standard which values data. We don’t have a way of measuring it from a finance perspective”.</p>
<p>Yet we all know that data is an asset. Data contributes the majority of the value of digital companies like Facebook and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>So how do we measure data quality? Ian explains that “it’s not about simple things like format. It’s about the entire governance process of data. How does data flow into your organization? What are the controls and the chain of custody, the chain of authorizing frameworks?”</p>
<p>With government being the source of so much critical foundational data, George and I have been trying to conceptualise distribution networks to make verifiable data accessible at scale. Ian shares his practical experience about change management and the role of government.</p>

<p>Holochain 0.3.1 is the newest recommended release for you to build your hApps on. It comes with a raft of performance improvements and bug fixes, and not too many breaking changes. The happy news with this release is that validation is considerably more performant, hitting fewer dependency deadlocks. (There’s other big news that developers need to know about — read below.)</p><p>This release also comes with a companion Launcher, which returns to Electron for the UI. This should help front-end devs have a more predictable development and debugging experience.</p><p>In the ecosystem, our friends at <a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">darksoil studio</a> have come out with <a href="https://github.com/darksoil-studio/p2p-shipyard?ref=blog.holochain.org">p2p Shipyard</a>, a super powerful tool for building self-contained installables of your hApp for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android (and iOS in the future)!</p><p>And finally, you can see what others are doing with Holochain on mobile; at the very end I’ll share a demo video of Relay, an Android messaging app that’ll ship on <a href="https://volla.online/en/index.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla Phone</a>’s upcoming <a href="https://www.vollaquintus.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Quintus</a> flagship smartphone.</p> Holochain 0.3.1: Validation performance, isolated and authenticated app interfaces, HDI/HDK changes <p>Release date: 11 June 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.4.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.3.x<br>JavaScript client compatibility: 0.17.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.5.x<br>Tryorama compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Scaffolding tool: 0.3000.1<br>Launcher: 0.300.1</p><p>You should notice a decent improvement in the time it takes for published data to appear in the DHT, especially data that has lots of validation dependencies. That’s because the validation workflow has been rewritten. What’s changed? There’s now a single validation thread per DHT space, rather than multiple threads, which means that the validation queue can more intelligently prefetch dependencies and avoid deadlocks due to missing dependencies. There are other tweaks to validation as well, such as reducing the op validation retry timeout and making it adapt to the number of dependencies the op is waiting for.</p><p>There are some breaking changes to the P2P protocol and the database structure, meaning that peers using 0.3 won’t be able to communicate with peers using 0.2 or import an 0.2-based application’s database.</p><p>But that’s okay, because there are some breaking changes to the HDI and HDK anyway. There aren’t too many, and they should be easy to update your code for. Our core team has written a great <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.3/?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.2 → 0.3 upgrade guide</a> to help you out.</p><p>Lastly, there’s a big change to the application API: There is now only one app API WebSocket port, and each UI must pre-request an authentication token and supply it when it establishes a session. The UI will only have access to the one app it requested access for.</p><p>Fortunately most of this change has been abstracted away for you by the new releases of the JavaScript and Rust clients, and if your UI is deployed in the Launcher it’ll get an access token behind the scenes. (In fact, connecting to an app interface requires fewer parameters now — see the upgrade guide for the changes you need to make.) But if you’re writing your own client, you’ll need to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop-0.3/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#holochain-030-beta-dev47">get familiar with what these changes mean</a> for establishing an authenticated connection.</p><p>If you want to read the changes in detail, read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.3.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">changelog</a> all the way back to the 20230503.003735 release.</p><p><a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Get it via Holonix</a> or <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.3/?ref=blog.holochain.org">upgrade your existing app</a>.</p> JavaScript client 0.17.0 and 0.17.1, Tryorama 0.16.0, Rust client 0.5: Updates for Holochain 0.3 <p>The header says it all! This line of releases makes the client libraries and testing framework compatible with the preauthentication and per-app binding of the app API’s new security model. There’s also a small bugfix in the JS client to address a bug in the hash utility functions.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop-0.3/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#holochain-030-beta-dev47">changelog for the Rust client</a> for details on what’s changed — the process of preauthenticating a client connection is a little more manual than for the JavaScript client.</p><p>You can get the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client?ref=blog.holochain.org">JS client</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama</a> from NPM and the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_client?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust client</a> from crates.io by updating the dependency in your <code>package.json</code> and <code>Cargo.toml</code> files, then following the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.3/?ref=blog.holochain.org#update-the-holochain-client">upgrade instructions</a> for your UI code.</p> <code>hc-scaffold</code> 0.3000.1: Streamlined flow, React and headless templates, simplified CSS <p>This release contains more than just an update to Holochain 0.3. A lot of polish has gone into this release, and as a sometime code reviewer I feel like this tool is coming into maturity. The developer UX has been tweaked in a lot of little ways that make it a pleasure to work with — particularly the newly streamlined “I only want a single-zome web app” flow. Now, when you run <code>hc scaffold web-app</code> you’re asked if you want to create a DNA and an integrity/coordinator zome pair.</p><p>The templates, which traditionally used Material UI to make it look nice, now use a single, clean, basic stylesheet build with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tailwind CSS</a>. The intention is that this will be easier to work with, and easier to just delete and replace with your own stylesheet.</p><p>Alternative package managers are now supported via a new <code>-p</code> or <code>--package-manager</code> flag — in addition to npm , you can also scaffold a project that uses pnpm, yarn, or bun to run all of the building, testing, and UI tasks in its <code>package.json</code> files.</p><p>The codebase has also been cleaned up a lot. What does this mean for you? Well, if you’d like to try creating your own template, you don’t have to do everything from scratch or copy any non-UI templates — the common templates (like Tryorama tests) are now shared among UI templates.</p><p>This scaffolding tool is now available in the Holonix dev environment, so all you need to do to use it in a new project is go</p><p><code>nix run github:/holochain/holochain#hc-scaffold – web-app</code></p><p>(once you’ve <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/?ref=blog.holochain.org">installed</a> Holonix, of course).</p><p>I’m still updating the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Getting Started guide</a>, so it’s a bit out of sync with the current state of the scaffolding tool. But honestly, it’s so easy to use that you probably won’t need my guide anyway.</p> Launcher 0.300.0: It’s smaller on the outside <p>When my colleagues showed me the latest Holochain Launcher, I was kinda startled. The Launcher I was familiar with was gone, replaced by… less. Much less. And I rather liked it!</p><p>You can tell that a lot of user experience work has gone into this Launcher. The startup UI consists of a tray icon and a little search box, similar to Spotlight on macOS.</p><p>That’s it!</p><p>I don’t have any apps installed right now, so I’ll try looking for something.</p><p>Not much there yet, but Kando looks useful, and I see a nice green ‘Verified’ badge (note: this helps protect you from accidentally installing a malicious HoloFuel lookalike that steals all your fuel — the Holochain team will be vetting all apps for now, but you can still sideload ‘unverified’ apps manually or find them in the hApp store, and there will eventually be a more scalable verification process).</p><p>The downloading spinner is simpler and easier to understand. This’ll matter less as Holochain gets faster, but at any stage of maturity it’s nice feedback.</p><p>The installation dialogue is easier to understand too. The network seed field has been renamed with less jargon, and a handy tooltip tells you what it does.</p><p>Nice, now I’ve got a kanban app installed!</p><p>I know from talking to my colleagues that there’s a lot more planned to make Launcher even nicer to use. Pretty excited about the direction things are heading.</p><p>And everything — App Store searches, app installation, and the KanDo app itself — feels a little snappier. It’s hard to measure this sort of thing as an end-user, but it feels like Holochain 0.3 is just faster and lighter on resources.</p><p>If you’re a developer, you can check that gear icon in the upper right corner, go into ‘System settings’, and install the developer tools. This lets you help host the DevHub package repository that powers the App Store, and you can also add a new hApp to the repository with only a couple clicks. (Note that we’re also working on a DevHub CLI that gives you more power over things like sharing reusable components.)</p><p>And one more thing for developers — this version of Launcher reverts back to Electron for all the UI stuff. You may remember that we replaced Electron with a similar library Tauri a year or two ago, and while it seemed to hold promise, the reality wasn’t as great as expected. The biggest issue was the webview — Tauri uses your OS’ system webview, which might be ancient and out of date with current web standards. This was <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-5-released/#known-issues-1">causing a lot of debugging headaches</a> for devs, because they didn’t know which browser their UI needed to target. Electron comes with a recent chromium binary, which means there’s a stable front-end target for you to work with.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.300.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Get Launcher 0.300.0</a> from GitHub, give it a spin, and let us know what you think!</p><p>If you’re on Ubuntu 24.04, take note: this version of Ubuntu made some annoying changes to protect you from malicious apps. You’ll need to follow <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/install-advanced/?ref=blog.holochain.org#fixing-the-suid-sandbox-error-in-ubuntu-24-04">our recommended steps</a> to get the Launcher to run. (The binary you want to target is <code>/opt/Holochain Launcher (0.3)/holochain-launcher-0.3</code> for the deb package and <code>&lt;path-to-your-app-image&gt;/holochain-launcher-0.3-0.300.0.AppImage</code> for the AppImage package. In the future we’ll ship an AppArmor profile in the deb package to fix this problem.</p> p2p Shipyard: build your hApp for mobile and desktop OSes <p><a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">darksoil studio</a> is a small dev shop building core infrastructure for Holocain and “simple peer to peer apps for groups of people to meet their non-digital needs”. And, in order for those apps to meet people’s needs, they have to be available in ways that work for them. Nowadays, that often means an app that you can download from an app store. And mobile is a must.</p><p>So darksoil studio set out to make Holochain ready for mobile. It required a huge amount of work, but now, by bridging Holochain and <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>, they’re able to bundle Holochain, a hApp, and a UI into an Android APK that can be submitted to the Play Store or <a href="https://f-droid.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">f-droid</a> (and EXEs for Windows, DMGs for macOS, and AppImages for Linux too).</p><p>This is pretty huge. We’ve long recognised it was necessary to get Holochain working on mobile, but needed to focus our energy on getting Holochain itself (and Holo Hosting) ready for general use. So it’s fantastic that a dev team in the ecosystem has done the work to build the critical infrastructure.</p><p>Now you can build your hApp with the tool they created, <a href="https://darksoil.studio/p2p-shipyard/?ref=blog.holochain.org">p2p Shipyard</a>, and start testing it on (almost) all the OSes. It’s not Open-Source — yet — but it is Source-Available, so anyone can audit the code for security. Towards patterns for sustainable Open-Source development, darksoil is running an experiment with something they’re calling “retroactive crowdfunding”. Here’s what they’re promising and asking:</p><blockquote>The p2p Shipyard is currently<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software?ref=blog.holochain.org"> Source-Available</a>, and once the retroactive crowdfunding goal is reached, it will be<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software?ref=blog.holochain.org"> Free and Open Source</a>, Forever.<br><br>Until then, a license is needed to use it, with all license fees going towards the crowdfunding goal. If you’d like a license to use the p2p Shipyard for your project, <a href="mailto:%20hello@darksoil.studio">get in touch with us here!&nbsp;</a></blockquote><p>Here’s what’s been done to make Holochain ready for mobile, if you’re curious:</p>  Mobile nodes can be set to have ‘zero-width arcs’ — that is, they’re full DHT peers but don’t contribute to the storage of other peers’ data. (This means you’ll want to set up something to keep the DHT available — if your userbase is big enough, the number of desktop users might be sufficient, but otherwise you may want to establish a cultural practice of asking people to leave their computer running so their peers can still get data. darksoil is also working on a local-server solution and, of course, <a href="https://holo.host/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holo hosting</a> will also be an option soon.)  p2p Shipyard uses <a href="https://tauri.dev/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>, which is currently the most viable way to integrate Holochain and a UI into a native Android or iOS app. (You can’t do it with Electron.) The darksoil team have built it as a Tauri plugin which you can fit into your build pipeline.  There’s been work to make <a href="https://wasmer.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">wasmer</a>, the WASM VM that Holochain uses, ready for mobile. Holo itself has contributed some funds to the wasmer project to get it working in iOS, which will make it possible to build iOS apps using p2p Shipyard in the future.  The darksoil team have done a lot of work to get Holochain building for Android and iOS — experimenting, wrestling build systems, equipping Holonix to do the right thing, reporting bugs, fixing them, and of course creating p2p Shipyard as a way to reproducibly build binaries for these OSes.  <p>Here’s a couple screenshots of my colleague Eric using p2p Shipyard to bundle up two hApps his <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">spinoff dev shop</a> has been building.</p><blockquote><p>And here are two more (kando &amp; emergence)!...  Check out <a href="https://t.co/GeVWNgqrE7?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://t.co/GeVWNgqrE7</a>  tooling for building and deploying decentralized Holochain based applications on both desktop AND mobile.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/holochain?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">#holochain</a> <a href="https://t.co/BJhgBA4CW5?ref=blog.holochain.org">pic.twitter.com/BJhgBA4CW5</a></p>— Eric Harris-Braun (@zippy314) <a href="https://twitter.com/zippy314/status/1798749799694381080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
<p>And speaking of mobile…</p> Holochain on the Volla Phone Quintus <p>You’ve probably seen this already, but here’s a demo of a hApp running on a smartphone from Volla, a small German manufacturer who are passionate about serving their customers — as in, the people who buy their phones, not the ad companies peering through the airwaves at them. This means privacy-respecting alternatives to what we’re stuck with now.</p><p>The app isn’t anything ground-breaking — it’s just a chat app — but what’s amazing is that it’s running fully peer-to-peer (Volla opted to have the phone owners be active DHT participants, hosting each other’s data rather than using the zero-width arc strategy). It’s going to be accompanied by a backup app, and probably more apps in the future.</p><p>And it was made possible thanks to the wonderful community Holochain finds itself in – particularly <a href="https://github.com/HedayatAbedijoo?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hedayat Abedijoo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nick-stebbings?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nick Stebbings</a> who instigated a relationship with Volla, and darksoil who produced p2p Shipyard!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@hdbernd?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Bernd 📷 Dittrich</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-tug-boat-in-the-water-next-to-a-large-cargo-ship-LKvT6sCkuPU?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/doc/emerging-technologies-and-trends-impact-radar-excerpt?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=EVT_APAC_2024_GTR_PD_DS1_CALAOCPMAX&amp;utm_adgroup=&amp;utm_term=&amp;ad=&amp;matchtype=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiJ7lm7nthAMVez-DAx1qcgddEAAYBCAAEgLF7fD_BwE">2024 Gartner Emerging Tech Impact Radar</a> confirms that Anonyome Labs’ enterprise solutions are among the highest impact technologies for gaining a competitive business advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The latest annual impact radar nominates privacy and transparency as one of four emerging tech themes with the most potential to disrupt a broad cross-section of markets. Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">market leading solutions</a> fit squarely within this theme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gartner then pinpoints decentralized identity (DI) and privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) as two emerging technologies within that theme that product leaders should be factoring into their strategic and investment planning. Anonyome Labs’ offers both DI and PETs solutions through its B2B solutions.&nbsp;</p>







<p>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/doc/emerging-technologies-and-trends-impact-radar-excerpt?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=display&amp;utm_campaign=EVT_APAC_2024_GTR_PD_DS1_CALAOCPMAX&amp;utm_adgroup=&amp;utm_term=&amp;ad=&amp;matchtype=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiJ7lm7nthAMVez-DAx1qcgddEAAYBCAAEgLF7fD_BwE">Gartner</a>, “Increasing digitization of assets, information and experiences and the usage of AI are making privacy and transparency issues increasingly important by increasing opportunities for bad agents to mimic, disrupt and intercept our activities. They are also intensifying concerns around negative consequences of AI tools and techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Rapid innovation in critical enabling technologies, like Web3, scalable vector databases and neuromorphic computing are creating new possibilities for IT solutions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through that lens, Gartner recommends, “Stimulat[ing] growth while mitigating risk and restrictive regulation by building user trust via systems such as decentralized identity and behavioral analytics and applying human-centered AI and responsible AI principles … [and] support[ing] your strategic product roadmap by identifying relevant emerging technologies and business values that they can enable and identifying relevant innovation tech partners.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gartner describes <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/decentralized-iam/">DI</a> or self-sovereign identity systems as technologies that address privacy and transparency challenges with traditional identity systems, and <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/sudo-digital-identities/">PETs</a> as robust approaches that allow the processing of information while protecting underlying personal data. See below for further reading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gartner says all 30 emerging technologies and trends are critical for product leaders to evaluate as part of their competitive strategy. And it seems many have already started in the privacy and transparency themed space: More than <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a> of US companies plan to incorporate a DI solution into their operations, with <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a> likely to do so by June 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Learn how 1Kosmos bridges gaps in the Microsoft ecosystem, providing a unified, secure experience for users across platforms.</p>
  
<p></p>
<p>Hi, welcome to our latest blog. My name is Rob MacDonald, I’m VP, Product Marketing, here at 1Kosmos, and I’m joined today by Vikram. Hey Vikram, how are you doing? Why don’t you introduce yourself?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Hello everyone, I’m vikram Subramanian, Vice President of Solutions at 1Kosmos. Just lead a bunch of mad scientists who put solutions together. So Rob, excited to be here.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, have a listen, I’m glad that you could take your time away from holding this place up to come and talk to us today. So Vik, today I want to talk to you a little bit about Microsoft. So I think as we know, as an industry, Microsoft is in about 98% of all Fortune 2000 organizations, they’re everywhere. And traditionally, they’ve been on-prem, over the last number of years they’ve been moving into the cloud with Azure, which has now been rebranded to Entra, or Entra, and Entra ID. So in that transition, it was difficult to connect into the Microsoft stack. But they’ve recently made a couple of changes that now enables organizations to become an authentication method into these platforms. So why don’t you tell us a little bit about what’s going on in the Microsoft world and what that means to us as an industry?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. So, Entra and Microsoft have really become partner-friendly now. I think a lot of our clients have been requesting Microsoft to do this for quite some time. The primary use case has always been that a lot of our clients want their single sign-on solution to be Microsoft Entra. With the movement of Active Directory from on-premis to Entra, then at that point in time, they want all of their users to come in, go and jump off into other applications through Entra.</p>
<p>However, we as 1Kosmos have always been advocating for passwordless authentication. Users every day, yes, passwordless is great, but you can’t move all users with a snap of a finger. So what do you do? You have to slowly start migrating them. This was not possible earlier. The only MFA factors that were possible to introduce to the end user was a select set of vendors, Microsoft themselves being one of them, and it was a difficult proposition for our clients to combine the usage of Entra as well as 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>So now, with external authentication methods, what they have done is they have allowed for external vendors to come in and offer up their MFA solutions as one of the options and really provide Entra administrators an easy way to configure this into their platform. And it’s all standards-based, so which means, now end users can do the first factor authentication in Entra, do the second factor in 1Kosmos, and off they go to the applications that they want to go ahead and authenticate into.</p>
<p>Secondly, the other big thing that has come out, of course, that is very interesting to me, so if you have a Windows 11 machine and a certain subscription of Entra, that point in time, what Microsoft has enabled is the web sign-in method. With 1Kosmos supporting standard federation protocols like OIDC as well as SAML, what you have the capability of doing, is now doing QR code based sign-in natively in Microsoft without installing any agent on the endpoint. So it’s agentless, passwordless authentication that 1Kosmos can offer through our integration with Entra.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Well, that’s pretty exciting. So, that’s a substantial shift in what we’ve seen over the last number of years, specifically with Microsoft, and then even within our customers themselves. So Vik, what happens if an organization has Entra and an on-prem AD? Do those two things work together easily? Is there one authentication method from Microsoft that organizations can use to leverage that, or is there a different way that organizations have to go about doing it? And does this help them in that hybrid type environment, that maybe some organizations are in, as they move things to the cloud?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Correct. Yeah, I think the biggest usage of 1Kosmos is going to be for organizations that are stuck in the middle now. I mean, they have regular on-prem AD joined machines, they have a hybrid Azure AD or hybrid Entra AD joined machines, as well as pure Entra joined machines. So the combination of this environment presents a number of challenges for them to offer a unified experience to the end users. Don’t get me wrong, experiences can be offered individually, and just by retaining all the methods that Microsoft can offer. But if you want to perform or provide a unified experience across your entire user population, that’s where 1Kosmos comes in. And we provide variety of methods of integrating with Entra.</p>
<p>So primary method is, we can become the IDP within the organization, get all your applications, retain your investment in Entra, get all your applications embedded within Entra and integrated with them. And now, our latest update, we have support for the WS-Fed protocol, which is a legacy protocol that Entra requires, and we are able to support that, which means that now you can run conditional access within Entra, but really, offload the authentication to 1Kosmos, where the user can do passwordless and password and OTP-based authentication through our 14 different factors that we offer.</p>
<p>Then along with that, what we also support is on-prem Active Directory joined machines, where our agent can be installed and users can do passwordless. For hybrid Azure joined or pure Entra ID joined machines, you have the web sign-in method and the users can utilize the same QR code. So unified experience, log into the workstation and the same experience can happen on the web also. This means what the end user has is a single experience, single place to go to do everything and a single authenticator to use for everything, which means less help desk tickets, right?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, absolutely. So let’s talk a little bit about the everything. So when you look at enterprises, we know that they’ve got, obviously Windows machines, I’m sure they’ve got Mac, Linux, they’ve got a variety of different, maybe VPN, they may have other things that maybe don’t have Microsoft in front of it, in terms of what a product is. So with what Microsoft has done, does that now enable Microsoft to authenticate more easily into them, or is it still the Microsoft’s capabilities are still fit for the Microsoft products, but anything outside of that is still a bit of a problem so you still need that standardization in terms of experience and capabilities to fulfill, maybe some of those gaps that Microsoft might introduce?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>I’m very sure that folks are going to read the latest blog or the white paper that you’re going to put out, Rob, on this. But the core of it is, really, I think where 1Kosmos fits in, is everything within the Microsoft ecosystem utilize Microsoft. And I think, integrate your applications with Microsoft, we’re not going to challenge that. And the idea would be that to authenticate into the ecosystem of Microsoft, you can utilize 1Kosmos. Why? Well, there are things that you cannot do with Entra, that you cannot do with any other single sign-on solution out there, which is to integrate with legacy applications such as Radius applications, or VPNs, or Linux systems, Mac systems. What are you going to do for all of those? And are you going to provide a different or a completely separate user experience to all of those guys?</p>
<p>I think that’s where enterprises need to weigh the pros and cons and really, I think everyone has erred on the side of, “Hey, I want a unified experience.” If you want that, definitely 1Kosmos is the answer, while you are able to leverage the investments that you’ve already made in Entra. So Intune, the conditional access policies, anything that you have integrated in terms of APIs. All of those things can happen, but you’re not restricted to utilizing only Microsoft authenticators.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. Now, looking at the Microsoft environment, are users still required to start that engagement from the moment they open up their laptop at the very first point in time with a password? Is the starting spot still with Microsoft, using your password? If yes, what about resetting those passwords? Because obviously that’s going to be problematic down the road. Maybe what could something like that look like going forward, Vik?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>That’s a great segue into our proofing capability. I think everyone knows it begins with the password in the Microsoft ecosystem. And even in order to set a PIN or in order to set up your Windows Hello, you are going to have to enter the password the first time around. So the password seems to be the entry point in the beginning. So what are you going to do to reset the password? What are you going to do to maintain the password? The easiest way to do it, is with the 1Kosmos app, where you don’t answer any KBAs, rather authenticate with biometrics and we can reset that.</p>
<p>The secondly, the big thing that has come out of course, is the Scattered Spider attacks, which I think you spoke about in the last IBA, or a couple of IBAs ago, was how do we prevent the attacks such as the ones that have been launched by Scattered Spider? So we are able to do identity proofing in a matter of 10, 15 seconds for the end user, same time that you would spend on a call, and then go ahead and provide the service desk the capability to really know who’s behind the phone call. And once that’s done, they’re able to reset the password.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>And looking at the Scattered Spider, and for those of you that, or those that maybe are watching this, that have not seen those previous ones, how do you go about verifying the identity to do that? And does that add value to what Microsoft’s offering, so when you integrate us in with Microsoft? What’s the value that that could bring to a Microsoft shop, essentially?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>The reason Scattered Spider has been in the news so much, is because they were able to socially engineer the service desk, and just by answering a few questions that’s available online, and then getting access to some privileged accounts. And after that, of course, they wreaked havoc. So truly what we are still answering is, from an authentication standpoint, who’s really behind the phone call? And are you who you say you are? And one of the ways that we can prove that in the physical world is, of course, taking a physical document, government-issued ID and then proving ourselves.</p>
<p>But it was not possible in the digital world, and now what we have enabled is through our identity proofing capabilities, we can truly provide the information to the help desk as to who’s the person who’s calling in and how have they verified themselves by, say for instance, taking their driver’s license. We scan the front, we scan the back, then we take a selfie, match the selfie against the document, match the information that’s there from the back of the document to the front of the document, and then really, we’re able to truly verify that the person is who they say they are. And if you need additional verification, we can go back to the issuing agencies and then get that information.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Wow, okay, so that’s pretty powerful and certainly an elegant way to help support the investment that organizations have already made into the Microsoft environment. Vik, last question, I know that things like remote desktops and virtual machines, and things along those lines, have always been relatively tricky to secure. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the way in which any of these changes from Microsoft may support that from a Microsoft perspective? And then maybe even talk about ways in which we could help organizations solve that as well, assuming we can?</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>So, these changes themselves, potentially could allow an end user to log into their workstation. However, remote desktops or anything to do with something that is not your workstation, those use cases are not going to necessarily benefit through the changes that Microsoft has made. However, 1Kosmos does have a solution for that. We offer MFA, we offer passwordless login into remote desktops, or really, if organizations want to protect holistically all of the use cases that they want to do with Microsoft, we have MFA for that. But I would say from what the changes that I have seen, are really geared towards the end user and not a power user. The end user who’s trying to log into their workstation and really get on with their day and log into machines and log into some websites and web applications, for them, these changes are really amazing.</p>
<p>And with integration with 1Kosmos where we are bringing in the MFA, where people could literally just log in with their face, or log in with their fingerprint, those are all things that we can definitely bring into the picture, and now offer it up to even Entra ID customers, who are pure Entra ID joined.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Oh, that’s very exciting. Listen, Vik, I appreciate you coming by today and talking about how organizations that are modernizing their IAM infrastructure with Microsoft Entra. Obviously it’s a big step forward for a lot of these organizations to help secure logins, prevent fraud. But as we know, there are gaps and areas of improvement and all those things that 1Kosmos can certainly help with. So I appreciate you taking the time today, coming in and filling us in on some of those changes and how we can help organizations going forward. Appreciate it, Vik.</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Thank you for having me over, Rob.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>We’ll see you again.</p>
 
<p>Vikram Subramanian:</p>
 
<p>Thanks guys.</p>

        <p>Recent studies have uncovered alarming levels of toxic metals such as arsenic and lead in tampons. Notably, lead concentrations were higher in non-organic tampons, while arsenic levels were higher in organic tampons. This raises significant health concerns given the high absorption potential of the vaginal mucosa​ (<a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/news-media/research-highlights/first-study-to-measure-toxic-metals-in-tampons-shows-arsenic-and-lead">Berkeley Public Health</a>)​​ (<a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/first-study-measure-toxic-metals-tampons-shows-arsenic-and-lead-among-other-contaminants">University of California</a>)​.</p>
<p>Jenni A. Shearston, a postdoctoral scholar at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, highlighted the importance of testing: “I really hope that manufacturers are required to test their products for metals, especially for toxic metals. It would be exciting to see the public call for this, or to ask for better labeling on tampons and other menstrual products”​ (<a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/news-media/research-highlights/first-study-to-measure-toxic-metals-in-tampons-shows-arsenic-and-lead">Berkeley Public Health</a>)​​ (<a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/first-study-measure-toxic-metals-tampons-shows-arsenic-and-lead-among-other-contaminants">University of California</a>)​.</p>
             <p>How UNISOT’s Technology Ensures Safety</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Asset Traceability Platform and Digital Product Passports provide essential tools for ensuring the safety of menstrual products. By leveraging blockchain technology, these tools offer an immutable record of the entire supply chain, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing processes. This transparency allows consumers to verify the safety and quality of the products they use, ensuring they are free from harmful toxins.</p>
<p>Addressing Arsenic in Organic Tampons</p>
<p>A key finding from the study was that the arsenic found in organic tampons can increase the risk of cancer, reproductive and developmental health, cardiovascular diseases, neurological effects, endocrine disruption, kidney and liver damage. It likely comes from natural fertilizers used in cotton farming. This highlights a significant issue of due diligence within the supply chain. UNISOT’s Supply Chain Due Diligence (<a href="https://unisot.com/solutions-2/modules/supply-chain-due-diligence-mapping/">SDD</a>) tool is designed to address this challenge by automating and securing the process of mapping a company’s supplier network across multiple tiers upstream.</p>
<p>SDD protects supplier trading secrets by anonymizing company names within the supply chain network. This ensures that sensitive commercial information remains confidential while still allowing for a comprehensive mapping and analysis of the supply chain. This level of transparency and protection is crucial for identifying and mitigating sources of contamination, such as arsenic from natural fertilizers, and ensuring that only safe products reach consumers.</p>
         <p>Addressing Lead in Non-Organic Tampons</p>
<p>The discovery of higher lead concentrations in non-organic tampons is particularly concerning due to the severe health risks associated with lead exposure, including neurological damage, reproductive issues and increased cancer risk. Lead can enter the cotton used in tampons through various environmental pathways, such as contaminated soil, water or air, often near industrial sites or due to the use of certain pesticides.</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Asset Traceability Platform can help address this issue by providing detailed insights into every step of the supply chain. By tracking the origins of raw materials and monitoring manufacturing processes, the platform can identify and mitigate sources of lead contamination. This includes ensuring that cotton fields are in safe, uncontaminated environments and that any chemicals used in the cultivation or processing of cotton are free from harmful substances.</p>
<p>Moreover, by implementing UNISOT’s Supply Chain Due Diligence, companies can continuously monitor and verify their suppliers’ compliance with safety standards. This proactive approach not only helps in identifying potential contamination sources but also ensures that suppliers adhere to stringent safety protocols, thereby reducing the risk of toxic contamination in tampons, guaranteeing that all menstrual products are safe for women to use.</p>
<p>Women deserve to have access to products that are completely free from harmful toxins, ensuring their health and well-being.</p>

<p>The term metadata has become rather loaded. Perhaps even poisoned, for its association with telecommunications surveillance. But I want to sing its praises for it is metadata that tells us if any given information is accurate or reliable, Or trustworthy, fit for purpose, valuable.</p>
<p>National security hawks advocating stronger surveillance powers, have tried to <a href="https://www.uow.edu.au/media/2014/what-is-the-meaning-and-what-is-the-use-of-metadata-retention.php">whitewash metadata collection</a>. They liken telecomm metadata to the visible details on an ordinary envelope and insist it’s innocuous compared with the contents of the message.</p>
<p>On the other hand, U.S. General Michael Hayden, former head of the National Security Agency, <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2014/05/10/we-kill-people-based-metadata/">once stated</a> plainly and simply “we kill people based on metadata” (although he denied that any telecommunications metadata collected on regular citizens was used for that).</p>
 Data and metadata: same but different 
<p>From a privacy perspective, metadata should certainly not be distinguished from data in general.</p>
<p>As I understand prevailing principles-based privacy law, if a piece of metadata is personally identifiable, then it constitutes personal data and falls within the scope of such law.</p>
<p>So from one perspective, metadata is merely more data. Nevertheless, I find it useful to distinguish data and metadata, because the properties of data that make it valuable or reliable (or unreliable) are often codified in metadata.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 the age of a cell phone number or email address can suggest it may be a burner account being used in a fraud 
 data presented online for identification purposes or in card-not-present payments really needs to be “<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/ciao-baby/">original</a>” in the sense that it’s presented by the rightful subject 
 watermarks generated within digital camera hardware can prove that an image is genuine, rather than AI-generated 
 clinical trial results should be based on patient data collected under proper consent conditions. 
 
<p>We might argue that the value of any data lies in the metadata.</p>
 Verifiable credentials are really about metadata 
<p>This distinction between data and metadata also illuminates how verifiable credentials convey rich data quality signals.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are tools that convey machine readable assertions made by a third party about a subject — which is usually a human but <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/google-and-indicio-progress-verifiable-credentials-cloud">verifiable credentials for non-human subjects such as IoT devices</a> are expanding fast.</p>
<p>The important elements of verifiable credentials (and verifiable presentations) are:</p>
 
 they name (or point to) the subject of the credential 
 they name the issuer of the credential 
 they bear the digital signature of the issuer — which gives the credential provenance 
 the presentation bears the signature of the subject (ideally generated within in a secure wallet) — which indicates their consent or control 
 the credential carries a range of administrative metadata, such as validity date, applicable terms &amp; conditions, and details of the device carrying the credential. 
 
<p>The digital signature on a verifiable presentation is typically created automatically in a wallet or chip. The signing process uses a private key embedded in the firmware, unique to the subject, but not visible to them.</p>
<p>The issuer of a credential is one of the most important factors used to determine whether to accept that credential or not. That is, the issuer confers value; some issuers are valued more than others.</p>
<p>So the name of the issuer of the credential is metadata of the credential: it is something that a first party wants to know about a second party before deciding to do a transaction.</p>
 About the credit cards in the banner graphic 
<p>The banner at the top of this blog shows some favourite images from my archive, from the very first charge card in 1955 through a series of technological innovations. First, the printed cardholder details were coded on a magnetic stripe for automated reading; tougher plastic cards supported antifraud measures like holograms and guilloche printing; the magnetic stripe was superseded by smart chips that prevent copying; and smartcards gave way to smart phones with biometrics to further protect the cardholder.</p>
<p>This evolution is really all about metadata!</p>
<p>Cards and phones, as far as the card payment system is concerned, are just data carriers. They store details about the card holder (in particular the Primary Account Number or PAN) and facilitate the presentation of that data to a merchant. The move from mag stripe to chip was the most important security measure in sixty-odd years; the chip provides signals about the originality of the PAN and the consent of the cardholder to each presentation.</p>
<p>Every major upgrade of credit card technology has improved the metadata that protects the primary data. All along, over several decades, the primary data has remained the same. But it has got better, thanks to metadata,</p>
<p>I analysed the evolution of cards in more detail here: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cmm-personal-data-carriers-stephen-wilson/">A CMM for personal data carriers and digital wallets</a>.</p>
 “Attributes” and “Claims” 
<p>The late great Kim Cameron — author of the prized <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">Laws of Identity</a> — carefully used the term “claim” in defining digital identity. The words claim, attribute and assertion might seem interchangeable but <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=208">Kim singled out claim</a> as “an assertion of the truth of something, typically one which is disputed or in doubt”.</p>
<p>He stressed that there is always uncertainty in the real world, and when authenticating another party, there is always going to be doubt over important attributes.</p>
<p>The trick is to reduce that doubt to acceptable levels. A relying party will always reserve the right to decide for itself if its doubts have been resolved.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials technology provides multiple mechanisms for doing just that.</p>
<p>For one thing, a verifiable credential bears the name of the credential issuer. In many cases, there is a natural issuer of a credential of interest: driver licences are issued by government departments of motor vehicles, employee numbers are issued by employers, credit card numbers are issued by banks. When verifying a credential, one of the most important things to check is the issuer.</p>
 The familiarity of metadata in real life 
<p>This coupling of data and metadata is routine in the analogue world.</p>
<p>In courtroom dramas, stories turn on facts and evidence. &nbsp;The facts tendered in a court case are only as good as the evidence. There are rules of evidence governing how information is obtained and safeguarded.</p>
<p>Facts and evidence in court procedures correspond to claims and proofs in digital identity. It’s all data and metadata.</p>
 How do you know? 
<p>In science, it’s not just what you know that matters but how do you know. What is the source of a statement or claim? Where is the evidence?</p>
<p>Children know this instinctively. As they develop a sense of how knowledge and trust are fluid, plucky kids will challenge the things they are told, with the riposte “How do YOU know?”.</p>
 Metadata and the stories behind the data. 
<p>Metadata can tell the story behind the data, a story that is increasingly important in all things digital.</p>
<p>As data supply chains become ever more complicated, we need enhanced abilities to interrogate the information we receive and depend on — whether that’s a news report, an photographic image, a student’ essay, a CV, the results of an automobile’s emissions test, or a scientific report on climate change.</p>
<p>Where did a given piece data come from? Who and/or what contributed to it?</p>
<p>The products of generative AI are starting to be watermarked, but that’s only a start. It will be important to know more, like which algorithms and version numbers were used, where did the models run, how were they trained, and was the training data audited?</p>
 Looking at signatures as metadata 
<p>With this orientation, everywhere I look now, I see metadata!</p>
<p>For example, a less obvious example of metadata is digital signatures.</p>
<p>A digital signature is a data value (technically a “cryptogram”) usually calculated by hashing and/or encrypting a record using a private key controlled by some actor. Note that I’m referring here to asymmetric or public key digital signatures.</p>
<p>The signature on a record can be checked at any future time to verify that a particular actor had something to do with that record, such as creating it or agreeing to it.</p>
<p>There are many different applications for digital signatures — but they are all used to create evidence that a given record at a certain time was touched in some way by a certain actor. That is, the signature tells a story about the history of a record. The digital signature is more metadata.</p>

<p>In this webinar with the Consumer Bankers Association from April 25, 2024, Mastercard’s Ben Soccorsy and Jenny Ziegler tackled the impact open banking regulation will have on banks and the opportunity having a regulated ecosystem provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the basics of open banking data and how consumers can access their data from any of their financial institutions to the way that data can be used for lending, financial management, wealth management, and payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can learn how the regulatory environment is accelerating the shift towards open banking. CFPB Dodd Frank Section 1033 is intended to break down barriers to accessing financial products, jump-start competition between financial institutions and fintechs and provide consumers more control and access to their financial data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulation will mandate that data providers must share their financial data with third parties or consumers via APIs safely and securely. The compliance deadline varies depending on the size of the financial institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For banks, this means being on top of API enablement, consent management, information security, third party risk management, risk and compliance, data governance and data monetization strategies.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>Some years ago, the book Blackout by Marc Elsberg described the impact on society of malicious software infecting the electricity supply network in Europe. Last week the whole world experienced the consequences of a faulty software update to the security software CrowdStrike Falcon. According to Mr. Kurtz, the CEO of CrowdStrike, this was not a malicious act. However, the impact of this error was considerable.</p>
 We Are All Now Dependent on Digital Systems 
<p>I can understand the feelings of the CrowdStrike team. When I was VP of development of security software, I remember very clearly how I felt when one night I was called and told that our security software was preventing clinicians in a paediatric hospital from accessing the systems and that unless they regained access within the hour, babies would start to die.</p>
<p>Developing security software places an extra burden on the development teams. This software is intended to protect organisations from malicious actors, however by its very nature that security software can also prevent the systems it is intended to protect from operating.</p>
<p>Over the past several years governments have recognised the increasing dependence of society on IT systems and how this brings the need for greater resilience of these systems. In Europe, this has resulted in legislation that includes NIS2 and DORA. The best control to ensure resilience is diversity. However, in the world of IT, most organisations are heavily dependent on systems that or delivered by a few suppliers. This is especially true for desktop systems, where Microsoft is the dominant supplier, and for cloud services, where AWS, Google, and Microsoft have the lion’s share of the market.</p>
<p>In this instance, the problem was that an update to security software caused the systems that were running it to crash, and the fix required a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">significant amount of manual intervention</a> on each affected machine. The end users had no control over the deployment of this patch, as the security vendor pushed it out to all endpoints across the world within a very short period of time. The issue affected all CrowdStrike customers running Windows-based systems including PCs, servers, kiosks and other forms of specialist terminals.</p>
<p>This is actually not the first time it has happened – in fact, CrowdStrike had a similar issue with the Linux version of its software <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/crowdstrike-broke-debian-and-rocky-linux-months-ago-but-no-one-noticed/">just a few months ago</a>. An update incompatible with the latest version of Debian Linux was released, causing servers to crash and refuse to boot. Back then, it took the company weeks to acknowledge the issue and reveal that Debian Linux wasn’t covered by their test procedures, despite being officially supported.</p>
<p>Other cybersecurity vendors, including McAfee, Sophos, and Symantec, had similar issues over the last two decades, although they have never had such a global impact.</p>
 What an End User Organisation Must Do 
<p>Since this occurred through a defect in security software, the normal advice relating to the use of up-to-date security software is not very helpful. Additionally, these are infrequent but high-impact events which make planning hard. Here are some actions that organisations can take:</p>
<p>Include this in your Business Continuity Plan – Consider this kind of risk as part of your business continuity planning. Remember that as your organisation goes digital, it becomes more dependent upon IT, and cyber risks require special treatment. Cyber incidents spread very rapidly across interconnected components, so moving to another physical location does not help.</p>
<p>Resilience through Diversity – The most powerful control to ensure resilience is diversity, but this is difficult to achieve given the dominance of a small number of major suppliers. Consider this kind of risk in your business continuity planning. Consider whether the trade-off between cost and ease of management against risk of cyber failure due to dependence upon a single IT environment is acceptable for your critical business systems. &nbsp;For life-critical systems, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80843/eu-digital-operational-resilience-act-dora">best practice requires three different software elements</a> provided by three different suppliers to minimize risk. This is impractical for most situations, but you could consider deploying security software from multiple vendors across different parts of your IT estate.</p>
<p>Evaluate Vendor Risk – When choosing security software, include consideration of this kind of risk in your vendor assessment process. Evaluate the kinds of controls that the vendor has to prevent and mitigate this kind of error. These can include the software design and development processes, including testing and deployment. Does the vendor phase the deployment of updates with inbuilt feedback? Does the vendor allow you any control over the deployment of updates, and can updates be selectively deployed to groups of systems? Does it follow the standard-based practices of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80876/sbom-as-a-core-element-of-cyber-resilience">software supply chain security</a>?</p>
<p>Incident Plan – Have a well-tested incident response plan and include this kind of event in your planning. Include and test how you would manage having to reimage or reboot a large portion of your IT estate. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80209/responding-to-cyber-incidents">Do you have the tools and skills to manage this</a>? Don’t forget that you need to verify whether you have <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80804/cloud-backup-for-ransomware-protection">backed up your data</a> and are able to restore it in time.</p>
<p>Keep Calm and Carry On – Unfortunately, a lot of cybercriminals and even a handful of security vendors have already recognized this massive incident as an opportunity to exploit victims’ insecurity and vulnerable state. We can already observe a massive increase in phishing and other criminal activities focusing on CrowdStrike’s and Microsoft’s products. Some vendors are trying to push their own products as “more resilient” alternatives. However, the best thing you can do now is to avoid making rash decisions. Focus on addressing the immediate consequences of the outage and start looking for neutral expert guidance for adjusting your long-term security strategies, architectures, and portfolios. Focus on methods that can be proven and validated and avoid snake oil at all costs.</p>

				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>When it comes to verifiable credentials, <a href="http://writes%20travel%20expert%20Mitra%20Sorrells">writes travel expert Mitra Sorrells</a>, “there is little doubt that travel – as well as many other parts of everyday life – is on the verge of a fundamental, radical shift.”</p>
<p>For travel, that means a special kind of verifiable credential, called — unsurprisingly — a <a href="https://indicio.tech/travel-hospitality/">Digital Travel Credential</a> or DTC. A DTC is based on standards from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for creating digital equivalents of a passport.</p>
<p>In essence, a DTC is a digital version of a passport that a passenger creates by scanning their passport with an app on their smartphone. The app reads the information on the photo page of the passport in order to read the data in the passport chip and then checks the cryptographic information that proves it was issued by a bona fide passport authority. In addition, the app asks the passport holder to perform a biometric and liveness check that is then checked against the digital image in the passport’s chip. Only after all this checks out is a traveler issued a DTC.</p>
<p>The combination of cryptographic verification and biometric binding means that a government can be confident that the digital version of a passport is authentic, and belongs to the passport holder.</p>
<p>This is only a first security step. When a DTC is built on a verifiable credential it gains privacy and security superpowers (and this is why anything claiming to be a DTC that isn’t a verifiable credential isn’t really a DTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">verifiable credential</a> is 1) a way of “sealing” information such that if the information is altered, the seal breaks, and 2) a way of sourcing information so that you can be absolutely certain of where it originated and who it came from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically, there are new <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-standards/">global standards and protocols</a> and multiple layers of cryptographic wizardry — complex math —&nbsp;triangulating digital information so it can’t be copied, altered, or used by someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is the most powerful digital identity anyone has yet created –&nbsp;one that meets the standards of security that governments expect when it comes to protecting borders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what can we do with this power? We can simplify the way information is used and verified so that processes and operations that were complicated, stressful, or just too difficult to do because of the risk, now become easy, instant, and secure.</p>
<p>Here are three ways a DTC simplifies travel:</p>
<p>The journey: Because airports, airlines, and governments can be confident that a person presenting a DTC is who they say they are, anything that once required manual checking can be automated. Travelers can be authorized to travel long before they leave for the airport. Airlines can quickly board passengers, certain that they are allowed to visit their destination. Borders can be crossed in seconds. All the congestion that currently slows down and stresses out travelers can be smoothed away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy: DTCs and verifiable credentials do something radical that was previously impossible: they allow people to hold their personal data on their mobile device in a way that only they can access. Until now, personal data had to be stored in centralized databases by verifying parties in order to authenticate a person’s identity. This has turned into an enormous privacy and a security risk. But because a verifiable credential means you can be certain of the source of information and that it hasn’t been tampered with, this centralized model of identity access management is no longer needed, addressing many of the critical issues in data privacy and protection laws like GDPR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security: Governments can do security and immigration checks ahead of travel. Airlines can be certain that all their passengers are allowed to visit the countries they are flying to, avoiding fines and repatriation. Manual document checks are replaced by cryptography.&nbsp; And, of course, the risk of centralized data storage has been mitigated.</p>
<p>There are two other important opportunities that this technology creates. By removing friction and lines, airports can increase flow and capacity without increasing resources. This is critical as air travel is projected to keep growing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials also expand the scope of customer personalization. In addition to being trusted digital identities, verifiable credential technology comes with its own way of communicating. It’s direct, one-to-one, and encrypted. This means each DTC has a consent-based way to create a secure trusted relationship with a traveler and take loyalty programs and service integration to the next level (again, this is why it’s important to make sure DTCs are verifiable credentials and not just fancy digital certificates).</p>
<p>In short, DTCs and verifiable credentials benefit everyone in the travel and tourism sector. And that’s because they rewire the way information travels so that it gets us to where we want to go, faster, more smoothly, and more securely.</p>

  Zero-knowledge technology (ZK) enhances blockchain privacy and scalability.  Recent innovations include ZK verifiers for Bitcoin and improved ZK protocols.  Future ZK developments will focus on speed, usability, and efficiency.  <p>Blockchain technology has transformed the world with its inherent transparency, immutability, and security. However, amidst the rising dominance of a few tech companies, concerns about increasing centralization and censorship underscore the need for enhanced&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>This is where zero-knowledge technology comes into play. It not only offers improved privacy but also provides a better solution to blockchain’s scalability issues.</p><p>Zero-knowledge is a broader category of cryptographic methods designed to preserve privacy by allowing one party to prove to another cryptographically that they possess knowledge about a piece of information without revealing the actual underlying details.</p><p>In blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) use algorithms to process data and confirm its truthfulness.</p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs focus on three main criteria:</p>  Zero-knowledge: The verifier cannot access the original input but can only confirm the statement’s validity.  Soundness: The protocol cannot validate invalid input as&nbsp;true.  Completeness: The protocol always validates the statement, provided the input is&nbsp;valid.  <p>So, a basic zero-knowledge proof consists of three components. A witness who provides the secret information; a challenge, in which the verifier selects a question for the prover to answer; and a response, in which the prover answers the question.</p><p>There are several types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs&nbsp;(ZKPs):</p>  Interactive ZKPs: These require several exchanges between the prover and the verifier.  Non-interactive ZKPs: Once set up, these do not require any further interaction between the prover and the verifier.  SNARKs and zk-SNARKs: SNARKs provide brief proofs that can be quickly verified, while zk-SNARKs are a more advanced type of&nbsp;SNARK.   ZKPs Taking Center&nbsp;Stage <p>While the basic concept of cryptographic primitives has existed for the past couple of decades, its development accelerated substantially only after the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum due to the technology’s ability to scale blockchains.</p><p>By enabling one person to demonstrate to another that a computation was performed correctly without redoing the work or sharing the data used, ZKPs streamline and speed up the verification process.</p><p>This efficiency reduces costs and accelerates transactions on blockchains like Bitcoin, as it eliminates the need for every node to re-execute each transaction.</p><p>Instead, a single node handles the processing and then uses a ZKP to prove its accuracy, while the other nodes only need to verify this proof. Thus, ZKPs facilitate the development of a financial system that, unlike traditional finance, does not depend on social&nbsp;trust.</p><p>With the help of zero-knowledge technology, crypto users can also maintain their anonymity on public blockchains, where all the transaction history is for everyone to see, track, and&nbsp;monitor.</p><p>The tech actually allows for private identity verification, allowing for compliance while eliminating the need to reveal the data itself. This way, it even takes the load off the blockchain, offering scalability benefits.</p><p>In the crypto world, teams like <a href="https://polyhedra.network/">Polyhedra</a> and <a href="https://lambdaclass.com/">Lambda Class</a> are actively exploring this topic. The venture studio and investment firm Lamda Class sees SNARKs having a significant impact on shaping our world. Earlier this year, they proposed a simple and modular bridge that uses multi-storage proofs.</p><p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, too, has expressed his support for implementing zero-knowledge (ZK) technology to achieve user privacy, censorship resistance, and autonomy. He believes in the future, all rollups, a solution to improve blockchain scalability, will actually be&nbsp;ZK.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/EDCON2024/status/1659909050698547200">Image Source</a>)<p>“zk-SNARKs will be as important as blockchains in the next ten years,” Buterin said last year. He has long been a proponent of this cryptographic tech to help overcome the problem of scalability and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Not just crypto but also ZKPs will become essential in verifying whether AI-generated content is produced by AI models or not. Moreover, in the coming decades, ZKPs are likely to play a key role in enhancing efficiency, securing devices, and ensuring national security.</p> The Latest Developments <p>Over the past few years, zero-knowledge proofs have been widely used to scale Ethereum. Now, they are also recognized as a crucial element for unlocking Bitcoin’s programmability. Weikeng Chen, a PhD graduate from UC Berkeley and sponsored by infrastructure company Starkware, achieved the first implementation of a zero-knowledge verifier using Bitcoin&nbsp;script.</p><p>The historic milestone came after three months of exploring the possibilities of the technical proposal “OP_CAT” to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by introducing smart contract functionality to the network. StarkWare’s ZK verifier marks the first large-scale practical application of the proposal’s opcode on the testnet, Bitcoin&nbsp;Signet.</p><blockquote>“This was a tremendous effort and took a significant amount of time,” said Chen in an interview. “We started with nothing… We had to build the full stack, which eventually led to the implementation of the STARK verifier.”</blockquote><p>While challenges remain, contributors at Starkware believe the project’s success represents “a monumental leap forward” towards Bitcoin scaling solutions that can use its ZK roll-up technology.</p><p>Other developments in the space include Polygon Labs’ latest version of its ZKP, Plonky3, which aims to enhance efficiency and security in distributed networks. While its previous versions had limitations in flexibility and adaptability, Plonky3 will empower developers to leverage ZK technology to build their own zkVM or zkEVM virtual machines.</p><p>With Plonky3, which has undergone auditing, the goal is to encourage innovation and community collaboration. Its versatility stems from its capability to adapt to various finite fields such as Goldilocks, BabyBear, and Mersenne31, as well as hash functions such as Keccak-256, BLAKE3, and Poseidon.</p><p>This development comes a month after Polygon Labs acquired the tech firm Toposware, the third ZK tech-based team. So far, the organization has invested $1 billion in zero-knowledge technology.</p><blockquote>“ZK is easier, not only from a development perspective but for users and user experience too,” a Polygon spokesperson told local&nbsp;media.</blockquote><p>These efforts by Polygon Labs aim to enhance interoperability. Yet, ZK-based technology struggles with compatibility issues within EVM networks and requires a Type 1 Prover to confirm the validity of a transaction to a blockchain. In response, Polygon Labs and Toposware are jointly developing such a&nbsp;Prover.</p><p>In April this year, VC giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) unveiled the release of its zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) to help its portfolio companies scale their operations. a16z is also an investor in Matter Labs, a leading zkEVM&nbsp;maker.</p><p>ZK Proofs, according to the firm’s researcher and associate professor at Georgetown University, Justin Thaler, scale blockchains by doing the hard work off-chain. Not all nodes have to do all the work, but they get the guarantee that the work was done correctly.</p> The Future of Zero-Knowledge Tech <p>With scalability continuing to be a big challenge for blockchains, zero-knowledge technology has vast potential in the crypto space. For now, the implementation of ZK tech is in its early stages. However, the growing demand for privacy on public blockchains is expected to lead to growth and advancement in this technology.</p><p>The future of this tech focuses on prioritizing speed, improving developer tooling, reducing hardware requirements, enhancing flexibility, and widening support. With these advancements, we’ll truly see ZK’s transformative potential, leading to a more scalable and secure blockchain world.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://unmitigatedrisk.com/?page_id=2&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ryan Hurst</a> (SpruceID Advisor, former Google/Microsoft), <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Dan Boneh</a> (Stanford), <a href="https://shelat.khoury.northeastern.edu/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Abhi Shelat</a> (Google/Northeastern), <a href="https://www.baldimtsi.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Foteini Baldimtsi</a> (GMU), and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dickhardt/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Dick Hardt</a> (Hellō) for reviewing the technical approach in this article, and providing several suggestions which improved the work.&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across the web. We build systems based on Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) to make the online and offline worlds <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-advancing-digital-identity-is-critical-to-u-s-national-security/">more secure</a>, while protecting the privacy and digital autonomy of individuals.</p><p>Developing models to implement this VDC future requires carefully thinking through every risk of the new model–including risks in the future. One of the edge-case risks privacy researchers have identified is sometimes known as “linkability.”</p><p>Linkability refers to the possibility of profiling people by collating data from their use of digital credentials. This risk commonly arises when traceable digital signatures or identifiers are used repeatedly, allowing different parties to correlate many interactions back to the same individual, thus compromising privacy. This can create surveillance potential across societies, whether conducted by the private sector, state actors, or even foreign adversaries.</p><p>In this work, we explore an approach that adds privacy by upgrading existing systems to prevent linkability (or “correlation”) and instead of overhauling them entirely. It aims to be compatible with already-deployed implementations of digital credential standards such as ISO/IEC 18013-5 mDL, SD-JWT, and W3C Verifiable Credentials, while also aligning with cryptographic security standards such as FIPS 140-2/3. It is compatible with and can even pave the way for future privacy technologies such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) or zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) while unlocking beneficial use cases today.</p> Why This Matters Now&nbsp; <p>Governments are rapidly implementing digital identity programs. In the US, 13 states already have live mobile driver’s license (mDL) programs, with over 30 states considering them, <a href="https://www.aamva.org/jurisdiction-data-maps?ref=blog.spruceid.com#anchorformdlmap">and growing</a>. Earlier this year, the EU has approved a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/agenda/briefing/2024-02-26/14/meps-to-approve-new-scheme-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet?ref=blog.spruceid.com">digital wallet framework</a> which will mandate live digital wallets across its member states by 2026. This is continuing the momentum of the last generation of digital identity programs with remarkable uptake, such as India’s Aadhaar which is used by over 1.3 billion people. However, it is not clear that these frameworks plan for guarantees like unlinkability in the base technology, yet the adoption momentum increases.</p><p>Some think that progress on digital identity programs should stop entirely until perfect privacy is solved. However, that train has long left the station, and calls to dismantle what already exists, has sunk costs, and seems to function may fall on deaf ears. There are indeed incentives for the momentum to continue: demands for convenient online access to government services or new security systems that can curb the tide of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/">AI-generated fraud</a>. Also, it’s not clear that the best approach is to design the “perfect” system upfront, without the benefit of iterative learning from real-world deployments.</p><p>In the following sections, we examine two privacy risks that may already exist in identity systems today, and mitigation strategies that can be added incrementally.</p> Digital ID Risk: Data Linkability via Collusion <p>One goal for a verifiable digital credential system is that a credential can be used to present only the necessary facts in a particular situation, and nothing more. For instance, a VDC could prove to an age-restricted content website that someone is over a certain age, without revealing their address, date of birth, or full name. This ability to limit disclosures allows the use of <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/types-id-systems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">functional identity</a>, and it’s one big privacy advantage of a VDC system over today’s identity systems that store a complete scan of a passport or driver’s license. However, even with selective disclosure of data fields, it is possible to unintentionally have those presentations linkable if the same unique values are used across verifiers.</p><p>In our example, if a user proves their age to access an age-restricted content website (henceforth referred to simply as “content website”), and then later verifies their name at a bank, both interactions may run the risk of revealing more information than the user wanted if the content website and bank colluded by comparing common data elements they received. Although a check for “over 18 years old” and a name don’t have any apparent overlap, there are technical implementation details such as digital signatures and signing keys that, when reused across interactions, can create a smoking gun.</p><p>Notably, the same digital signature is uniquely distinguishable, and also new signatures made from the same user key can be <a href="https://keymaterial.net/2024/06/15/reconstructing-public-keys-from-signatures/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">correlated</a>. This can all work against the user to reveal more information than intended.</p> Verifier-Verifier Collusion <p>To maximize privacy, these pieces of data presented using a VDC should be “unlinkable.” For instance, if the same user who’d proven their age at a content website later went to a bank and proved their name, no one should be able to connect those two data points to the same ID holder, not even if the content website and the bank work together. We wouldn’t want the bank to make unfair financial credit decisions based on the perceived web browsing habits of the user.</p><p>However, VDCs are sometimes built on a single digital signature, a unique value that can be used to track or collate information about a user if shared repeatedly with one or more parties. If the content website in our example retains the single digital signature created by the issuing authority, and that same digital signature was also shared with the bank, then the content website and the bank could collude to discover more information about the user than what was intended.</p><p>The case where two or more verifiers of information can collude to learn more about the user is known as verifier-verifier collusion and can violate user privacy. While a name-age combination may seem innocuous, a third-party data collector could, over time, assemble a variety of data about a user simply by tracking their usage of unique values across many different verifiers, whether online or in-person. At scale, these issues can compound into dystopian surveillance schemes by allowing every digital interaction to be tracked and made available to the highest bidders or an unchecked central authority.</p> Cycling Signatures to Prevent Verifier-Verifier Collusion <p>Fortunately, a simple solution exists to help prevent verifier-verifier collusion by cycling digital signatures so that each is used only once. When a new VDC is issued by a post office, DMV, or other issuer, it can be provisioned not with a single signature from the issuing authority that produces linkable usage, but with many different signatures from the issuing authority. If user device keys are necessary for using the VDC, as in the case of mobile driver’s licenses, several different keys can be used as well. A properly configured digital wallet would then use a fresh signature (and potentially a fresh key) every time an ID holder uses their VDC to attest to particular pieces of information, ideally preventing linkage to the user through the signatures.</p><p>Using our earlier example of a user who goes to a content website and uses their VDC to prove they are over 18, the digital wallet presents a signature for this interaction, and doesn’t use that signature again. When the user then visits their bank and uses a VDC to prove their name for account verification purposes, the digital wallet uses a new signature for that interaction.</p><p>Because the signatures are different across each presentation, the content website and the bank cannot collude to link these two interactions back to the same user without additional information. The user can even use different signatures every time they visit the same content website, so that the content website cannot even tell how often the user visits from repeated use of their digital ID.</p> Issuer-Verifier Collusion <p>A harder problem to solve is known as “issuer-verifier” collusion. In this scenario, the issuer of an ID–or, more likely, a rogue agent within the issuing organization–remembers a user’s unique values (such as keys or digital signatures) and, at a later time, combines them with data from places where those keys or signatures are used. This is possible even in architectures without “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoning_home?ref=blog.spruceid.com">phone home</a>” because issuing authorities (such as governments or large institutions) often have power over organizations doing the verifications, or have been known to purchase their logs from data brokers. Left unsolved, the usage of digital identity attributes could create surveillance potential, like leaving a trail of breadcrumbs that can be used to re-identify someone if recombined with other data the issuer retains.</p> Approaches Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs <p>Implementing advanced cryptography for achieving unlinkability, such as with Boneh–Boyen–Shacham (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">BBS</a>) signatures in decentralized identity systems, has recently gained prominence in the digital identity community. These cryptographic techniques enable users to demonstrate possession of a signed credential without revealing any unique, correlatable values from the credentials.</p><p>Previous methods like <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/anoncreds?ref=blog.spruceid.com">AnonCreds</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/u-prove/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">U-Prove</a>, which rely on RSA signatures, paved the way for these innovations. Looking forward, techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof?ref=blog.spruceid.com">zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs</a>, which when implemented with certain hashing algorithms or primitives such as lattices can support requirements for post-quantum cryptography, can offer potential advancements originating from the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>However, integrating these cutting-edge cryptographic approaches into production systems that meet rigorous security standards poses challenges. Current standards like <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final?ref=blog.spruceid.com">FIPS 140-2</a> and <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final?ref=blog.spruceid.com">FIPS 140-3</a>, which outline security requirements for cryptographic modules, present compliance hurdles for adopting newer cryptographic algorithms such as the BLS 12-381 Curve used in BBS and many zk-SNARK implementations. High assurance systems, like state digital identity platforms, often mandate cryptographic operations to occur within <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program?ref=blog.spruceid.com">FIPS-validated</a> Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). This requirement necessitates careful consideration, as implementing these technologies outside certified HSMs could fail to meet stringent security protocols.</p><p>Moreover, there's a growing industry shift away from RSA signatures due to concerns over their long-term security and increasing emphasis on post-quantum cryptography, as indicated by recent developments such as <a href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/google-chrome-adds-support-for-a-hybrid-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithm/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Chrome's adoption of post-quantum ciphers</a>.</p><p>Balancing the need for innovation with compliance with established security standards remains a critical consideration in advancing digital identity and cryptographic technologies.</p> A Pragmatic Approach for Today: Provably Forgotten Signatures <p>Given the challenges in deploying zero-knowledge proof systems in today’s production environments, we are proposing a simpler approach that, when combined with key and signature cycling, can provide protection from both verifier-verifier collusion and issuer-verifier collusion by using confidential computing environments: the issuer can forget the unique values that create the risk in the first place, and provide proof of this deletion to the user. This is implementable today, and would be supported by existing hardware security mechanisms that are suitable for high-assurance environments.</p><p>It works like this:</p>  During the final stages of digital credential issuance, all unique values, including digital signatures, are exclusively processed in plaintext within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing?ref=blog.spruceid.com">confidential computing</a> on the issuer’s server-side infrastructure.  Issuer-provided data required for credential issuance, such as fields and values from a driver’s license, undergoes secure transmission to the TEE.  Sensitive user inputs, such as unique device keys, are encrypted before being transmitted to the TEE. This encryption ensures that these inputs remain accessible only within the secure confines of the TEE.  Within the TEE, assembled values from both the issuer and user are used to perform digital signing operations. This process utilizes a dedicated security module accessible solely by the TEE, thereby generating a digital credential payload.  The resulting digital credential payload is encrypted using the user’s device key and securely stored within the device’s hardware. Upon completion, an <a href="https://confidentialcomputing.io/2023/04/06/why-is-attestation-required-for-confidential-computing/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">attestation</a> accompanies the credential, verifying that the entire process adhered to stringent security protocols.  <p>This approach ensures:</p>  Protection Against Collusion: By employing confidential computing and strict segregation of cryptographic operations within a TEE, the risk of verifier-verifier and issuer-verifier collusion is mitigated.  Privacy and Security: User data remains safeguarded throughout the credential issuance process, with sensitive information encrypted and managed securely within trusted hardware environments.  Compliance and Implementation: Leveraging existing hardware security mechanisms supports seamless integration into high-assurance environments, aligning with stringent regulatory and security requirements.  <p>By prioritizing compatibility with current environments instead of wholesale replacement, we propose that existing digital credential implementations, including mobile driver’s licenses operational in <a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">13 states</a> and legislatively approved in an additional 18 states, could benefit significantly from upgrading to incorporate this technique. This upgrade promises enhanced privacy features for users without necessitating disruptive changes.</p> New Approach, New Considerations <p>However, as with all new approaches, there are some considerations when using this one as well. We will explore a few of them, but this is not an exhaustive list.</p><p>The first consideration is that TEEs have been <a href="https://sgx.fail/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">compromised in the past</a>, and so they are not foolproof. Therefore, this approach is best incorporated as part of a defense-in-depth strategy, where there are many layered safeguards against a system failure. Many of the critical TEE failures have resulted from <a href="https://www.riscure.com/tee-security-samsung-teegris-part-3/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">multiple things that go wrong</a>, such as giving untrusted hosts access to low-level system APIs in the case of blockchain networks, or allowing arbitrary code running on the same systems in the case of mobile devices. </p><p>One benefit of implementing this approach within credential issuer infrastructures is that the environment can be better controlled, and so more forms of isolation are possible to prevent these kinds of vulnerability chaining. Issuing authorities are not likely to allow untrusted hosts to federate into their networks, nor would they allow arbitrary software to be uploaded and executed on their machines. There are many more environmental controls possible, such as intrusion detection systems, regular patching firmware, software supply chain policies, and physical security perimeters.</p><p>We are solving the problem by shifting the trust model: the wallet trusts the hardware (TEE manufacturer) instead of the issuing authority.</p><p>Another consideration is that certain implementation guidelines for digital credentials recommend retention periods for unique values for issuing authorities. For example, <a href="https://www.aamva.org/assets/best-practices,-guides,-standards,-manuals,-whitepapers/mobile-driver-s-license-implementation-guidelines-1-2?ref=blog.spruceid.com">AAMVA’s implementation guidelines</a> include the following recommendations for minimum retention periods:&nbsp;</p>Source: AAMVA Mobile Driver's License Implementation Guidelines, r1.2<p>To navigate these requirements, it is possible to ensure that the retention periods are enforced within the TEE by allowing for deterministic regeneration of the materials only during a fixed window when requested by the right authority. The request itself can create an auditable trail to ensure legitimate usage. Alternatively, some implementers may choose to override (or update) the recommendations to prioritize creating unlinkability over auditability of certain values that may be of limited business use.</p><p>A third consideration is increased difficulty for the issuing authority to detect compromise of key material if they do not retain the signatures in plaintext. To mitigate this downside, it is possible to use data structures that are able to prove set membership status (e.g., was this digital signature issued by this system?) without linking to source data records or enumeration of signatures, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Merkle trees</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulator_(cryptography)?ref=blog.spruceid.com">cryptographic accumulators</a>. This allows for the detection of authorized signatures without creating linkability. It is also possible to encrypt the signatures so that only the duly authorized entities, potentially involving judicial processes, can unlock the contents.</p> Paving the Way for Zero-Knowledge Proofs <p>We believe that the future will be built on zero-knowledge proofs that support post-quantum cryptography. Every implementation should consider how it may eventually transition to these new proof systems, which are becoming faster and easier to use and can provide privacy features such as selective disclosure across a wide variety of use cases.</p><p>Already, there is <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/issues/201?ref=blog.spruceid.com">fast-moving research</a> on using zero-knowledge proofs in wallets to demonstrate knowledge of unique signatures and possibly the presence of a related device key for payloads from existing standards such as ISO/IEC 18013-5 (mDL), biometric templates, or even live systems like <a href="https://github.com/anon-aadhaar/anon-aadhaar?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Aadhar</a>. In these models, it’s possible for the issuer to do nothing different, and the wallet software is able to use zero-knowledge cryptography with a supporting verifier to share attributes without attribution.</p><p>These “zero-knowledge-in-the-wallet” approaches require both the wallet and the verifier to agree on implementing the technology, but not the issuer. The approach outlined in this work requires only the issuer to implement the technology. They are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible to have both approaches implemented in the same system. Combining them may be especially desirable when there are multiple wallets and/or verifiers, to ensure a high baseline level of privacy guarantee across a variety of implementations.</p><p>However, should the issuer, wallet, and verifier (and perhaps coordinating standards bodies such as the IETF, NIST, W3C, and ISO) all agree to support the zero-knowledge approach atop quantum-resistant rails, then it’s possible to move the whole industry forward while smoothing out the new privacy technology’s <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/11/29/specialized-zero-knowledge-proof-failures/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rough edges</a>. This is the direction we should go towards as an industry.</p> Tech Itself is Not Enough <p>While these technical solutions can bring enormous benefits to baseline privacy and security, they must be combined with robust data protection policies to result in safe user-controlled systems. If personally identifiable information is transmitted as part of the user’s digital credential, then by definition they are correlatable and privacy cannot be addressed at the technical protocol level, and must be addressed by policy.</p><p>For example, you can’t unshare your full name and date of birth. If your personally identifiable information was sent to an arbitrary computer system, then no algorithm on its own can protect you from the undercarriage of tracking and surveillance networks. This is only a brief sample of the kind of problem that only policy is positioned to solve effectively. Other concerns range from potentially decreased accessibility if paper solutions are no longer accepted, to normalizing the sharing of digital credentials towards a “checkpoint society.”</p><p>Though it is out of scope of this work, it is critical to recognize the important role of policy to work in conjunction with technology to enable a baseline of interoperability, privacy, and security.</p> The Road Ahead <p>Digital identity systems are being rolled out in production today at a blazingly fast pace. While they utilize today’s security standards for cryptography, their current deployments do not incorporate important privacy features into the core system. We believe that ultimately we must upgrade digital credential systems to post-quantum cryptography that can support zero-knowledge proofs, such as ZK-STARKs, but the road ahead is a long one given the timelines it takes to validate new approaches for high assurance usage, especially in the public sector.</p><p>Instead of scorching the earth and building anew, our proposed approach can upgrade existing systems with new privacy guarantees around unlinkability by changing out a few components, while keeping in line with current protocols, data formats, and requirements for cryptographic modules. With this approach, we can leave the door open for the industry to transition entirely to zero-knowledge-based systems. It can even pave the path for them by showing that it is possible to meet requirements for unlinkability, so that when policymakers review what is possible, there is a readily available example of a pragmatic implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope to collaborate with the broader community of cryptographers, public sector technologists, and developers of secure systems to refine our approach toward production usage. Specifically, we wish to collaborate on:</p>  Enumerated requirements for TEEs around scalability, costs, and complexity to implement this approach, so that commercial products such as Intel SGX, AMD TrustZone, AWS Nitro Enclaves, Azure Confidential Computing, IBM Secure Execution, or Google Cloud Confidential Computing can be considered against those requirements.  A formal paper with rigorous evaluation of the security model using data flows, correctness proofs, protocol fuzzers, and formal analysis.  Prototyping using real-world credential formats, such as ISO/IEC 18013-5/23220-* mdocs, W3C Verifiable Credentials, IMS OpenBadges, or SD-JWTs.  Evaluation of how this approach meets requirements for post-quantum cryptography.  Drafting concise policy language that can be incorporated into model legislation or agency rulemaking to create the requirement for unlinkability where deemed appropriate.  <p>If you have any questions or interest in participation, please <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">get in touch</a>. I will be turning this blog post into a paper by adding reviews of related work, explanations, and some other key sections.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

				  Research firm says over half-a-billion people will be using verifiable credentials by 2026 and the decentralized identity market will likely be worth over $3 billion by 2031.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research firm Gartner says the market for decentralized identity is rapidly evolving and that decentralization will fundamentally change how we manage identity, privacy, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As conventional identity access management continues to struggle with identity authentication, data breaches, and privacy issues, decentralized identity, says Gartner, is now a viable market solution.</p>
<p>And with the European Union forging ahead with digital identity <a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/">(eIDAS 2.0)</a> and specifications for a digital identity wallet <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-regulation">(EUDI),</a> hundreds of millions of people will soon be able to use verifiable credentials to seamlessly access government services from simple digital wallet applications on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>These insights and more come from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5560195">Gartner’s 2024 Market Guide for Decentralized Identity</a>, which lists Indicio as a representative vendor. Indico is the first company specializing in decentralized identity technology to have a complete solution —&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a> — available in both <a href="https://indicio.tech/amazon-web-service/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/google-cloud/">Google Cloud Marketplace,</a> and we have customers around the world deploying solutions. Indicio is also the first company to create certified training in all aspects of decentralized identity technology with <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy.</a></p>
<p>But to underscore just how rapidly the technology is evolving, the Market Guide omits several emerging sector use cases and technical developments driving adoption and innovation.</p>
<p>Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) based on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for digital passports are now being used by a government — Aruba — and multiple airlines (this is a key area for <a href="https://airportindustry-news.com/sita-and-indicio-partner-to-develop-digital-travel-credentials/">Indicio and our partner SITA;</a> in collaboration, we successfully launched the world’s first DTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a DTC, a traveler is able to create a “government-grade” digital identity from their passport and can be preauthorized for border crossing before they leave home (thus enabling the actual border to be crossed seamlessly, in a few seconds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the power of a DTC as a digital identity, it can be used for much more than border crossing. As Phocuswire’s Mitra Sorrells recently <a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/how-verifiable-credentials-and-digital-id-will-tranform-travel">noted</a>, the result of this technology is that “Travel… is on the verge of a fundamental, radical shift.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are also being used to verify more than a person’s identity. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/299025266/">New Zealand’s Digital Farm Wallet</a> project is using verifiable credentials to authenticate devices and sustainability claims in agriculture, so that farmers can easily and repeatedly prove compliance requirements in order to access funding and meet other needs.</p>
<p>Given the number of connected devices and their uses, verifiable identity means verifiable data. It’s not just about identity management; it’s about being able to create seamless operations and processes based on trusted data.</p>
<p>One particularly powerful aspect of decentralized identity that many businesses and governments are not yet aware of is the ability to add a secure communications channel between decentralized identities. Decentralized Identifier Communication, or DIDComm, enables trusted secure communication, such that a bank is able to seamlessly authenticate a customer and a customer their bank before any data is shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature provides a simple, cost-effective way not only to implement zero-trust security but to manage the threat of generative AI identity fraud, aka “deepfake phishing.” A bank can use the trusted channel to confirm that the call center caller is, in fact, their customer.</p>
<p>DIDComm has significant business value beyond security in that it enables rich, consent-based communication between businesses and customers, which when combined with verifiable credentials allows for an entirely new level of trust. At the recent KuppingerCole European Identity and Cloud Conference, DIDComm was the emergent protocol, notably through ID Union’s project to make it work with the European Union’s favored protocols, OID4VC.</p>
<p>The key takeaway from the Gartner report) is that this technology is gaining traction a lot faster than you (and even Gartner) think. So what should you do if you are interested in learning more?</p>

<p>At Extrimian, we use Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) to enhance data management and security. Our approach ensures that sensitive information is accessible when needed, especially in critical situations where immediate and active authorization is not possible.</p>



<p>This blog post will explain how to use DWNs to manage access to private information, highlighting our solutions and the vital role of authorization protocols in emergency scenarios.</p>



 Emergency Access Use Case 



<p>Imagine being involved in an accident and losing consciousness. Emergency responders need instant access to your medical records to provide optimal care. With a DWN setup, this can be efficiently managed through pre-authorized access to specific health information for emergency services.</p>



 Authorization Protocols: 



 
 Pre-Defined Permissions: Users can pre-authorize emergency services to access their medical records stored in DWNs. This is facilitated by granting access based on credentials issued by recognized authorities, verifying the identity and purpose of the requester. 



 Seamless Data Access: Once authenticated, emergency personnel can swiftly access the necessary data, ensuring they have the information required to treat you effectively, even in the absence of active authorization. 
 



 Additional Scenarios for Authorization Protocols 



<p>The versatility of DWNs extends beyond emergency scenarios, offering pre-authorized access in various other contexts:</p>



 
 Health Applications: Health monitoring applications can periodically access medical data to provide personalized recommendations, thanks to pre-set authorization protocols. 



 Financial Services: Financial advisors or applications can securely access financial records for tasks like tax filing or investment management without requiring repeated manual permissions. 



 Travel and Safety: Travelers can authorize applications to access travel documents, vaccination records, and emergency contacts, ensuring assistance is readily available when needed. 
 



 Detailed Functionality of Extrimian’s DWN Technology 



 Decentralized Data Storage 



<p>DWNs provide a decentralized storage mechanism, where data is encrypted and distributed across various nodes, ensuring no single point of failure. This architecture enhances data security and availability.</p>



 Granular Access Control 



<p>Users have fine-grained control over who can access their data and under what conditions. Authorization protocols can be tailored to specific use cases, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized entities can access sensitive information.</p>



 Interoperability 



<p>Extrimian’s solutions are designed to be interoperable with various identity management systems and applications. This ensures seamless integration and functionality across different platforms and services.</p>

 DPI or Digital Transformation? Three takeaways from a Caribou Digital — UNDP convening to identify DPI-specific risks Credit: AI generated<p>Caribou Digital and UNDP recently held a convening of practitioners and scholars to explore the distinction between digital public infrastructure (DPI) and mainstream digital transformation, and the specific risks and safeguarding requirements of DPI. As a ‘Chatham House’ style convening of practitioners, policy makers and academics, this blog contains three key takeaways from the discussion.</p><p>Digital public infrastructure (DPI) is, as defined by the <a href="https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/CPV/G20-New-Delhi-Leaders-Declaration.pdf">G20 New Delhi Leaders Declaration</a>, made up of ‘secure and interoperable digital systems that enable the delivery of public services, together with an enabling governance environment and public value goals.’ The UN Secretary General’s Office of the Special Envoy on Technology (OSET) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) convened the <a href="https://www.dpi-safeguards.org/">DPI Safeguarding Initiative</a> to support the <a href="https://www.undp.org/news/interim-report-digital-public-infrastructure-safeguards-open-public-comment">development of a safe, inclusive, and rights-protecting DPI framework</a>. The initiative includes the <a href="https://www.dpi-safeguards.org/wg-members">DPI Safeguarding Initiative Working Groups</a>, convened by OSET and UNDP to support the development of the framework.</p><p>This convening brought together leading stakeholders from the digital development academic and practitioner communities to consider four scenarios that present DPI and ‘generic’ approaches to common aspects of digital transformation. Participants’ discussion was structured around two specific questions:</p>  What distinguishes a ‘digital public infrastructure approach’ from a ‘generic’ approach to digital transformation?  What are the specific risk profiles of a ‘digital public infrastructure’ approach to digital transformation?  <p>Takeaway 1: Countries don’t think of DPI; instead, they think of systems. So the distinction between DPI and ‘generic’ digital transformation is more of a ‘how’ difference rather than a ‘what’ difference.</p><p>One of the recurring themes throughout the conversation was that, from a purely technology perspective, there is not much difference between a DPI and generic approach to digital transformation. The various components or attributes of DPI are not in themselves new. It’s a policy perspective and implementation approach — the ‘how’ — where DPI’s distinction lies.</p><p>One of the main characteristics of a DPI perspective is the idea of ‘thinking horizontally, rather than vertically’ so that systems work across ministries or sectors, rather than vertically siloed in one — for example, enabling a single registration to verify identity and eligibility for multiple systems and services. One of the main attributes that characterize this is the interoperability necessary to enable the horizontal flow of data. Interoperability is of course not new, and there is a wealth of literature and knowledge around mitigating the risks of interoperability that the DPI Safeguarding Initiative Working Groups and wider DPI community can draw&nbsp;from.</p><p>Another dimension that participants flagged was that ‘how’ questions are also often normative questions; that is, they introduce considerations of rights and inclusion. Examples include the policy dimensions of identification systems and the rights and entitlements that identification brings: in other words, what legal rights does being identified grant holders of that identity?</p><p>Takeaway 2: The distinction of DPI is the implications for development pathways and&nbsp;choice.</p><p>The second takeaway was DPI’s significance for development pathways and choice, namely in two dimensions. First, some participants discussed how DPI could strengthen states to make sovereign choices about their digital transformation path. Once DPI reduces digital transformation, from a technical architecture-systems perspective, to minimal building blocks and their core functionality, it opens a conversation about the importance of control for those blocks, instead of a conversation about a pre-selected system and its features. Participants felt this was particularly significant in the context of countries in the Global South who often depend on external financing for their development trajectory and are often forced to adopt the path of their funders. This is particularly the case in the context of donors who provide financing or investment for specific sectors or silos such as health, education, or welfare. Focusing on a DPI approach instead can put power back in the hands of the government.</p><p>The second aspect of sovereignty and choice was focused on individuals. Some participants highlighted how in some cases making systems mandatory — such as identification systems — can force users, whether they want to or not, to adopt systems that may serve state interests before individual interests. This consideration introduced another way of thinking about DPI risk: the risk of doing it too well, which could enable authoritarianism and autocracy, or not well enough, which could lead to service failure and a loss of trust and confidence in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>Takeaway 3: DPI’s complex business models present risks to both owners and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Another takeaway from the discussion was the significance of DPI’s business models. One of the challenges that participants flagged was around the ownership of systems. For example, if DPI is government led, this can have implications for the business case of systems — for example around the necessary internal capacity to build or buy systems, and manage technical development and procurement. Another challenge that participants flagged was around the scaling of business models. Scaling competitively, and thus justifying public investment, was as important to consider as the potential for scale that the system introduced.</p><p>The characteristics of DPI also lead to other dimensions of business model risk. For example, interoperability introduces challenges for commercial suppliers of systems, as interoperability (should) make DPI elements (identity, payments, data sharing) commodity services. This is significant because, historically, companies prefer to make profits rather than compete on price in a commodity service&nbsp;market.</p><p>Another risk of DPI that participants flagged is its emphasis on open source. A number of participants flagged the challenge of open source and ‘abandonware’ — systems and technologies that are developed by a community (or lone developer) and then abandoned. This is a key risk for critical infrastructure and requires governments to develop the relevant capacity to mitigate the risk of infrastructure failure.</p><p>Reflection: Evaluation is key. How do we know if an intervention is a DPI approach, and what difference does DPI&nbsp;make?</p><p>A more general reflection on this discussion is the importance of monitoring and learning: establishing the basis for evaluating impact and whether a particular initiative is actually DPI in nature. What are the distinctive aspects of a deployment that can tell us whether it is upholding the principles and values of DPI? If DPI is an approach and a policy shift, how can we measure whether an approach and policy agenda is DPI in&nbsp;nature?</p><p>At Caribou Digital, we have a particular focus on monitoring, evaluation, and learning. We’re often asked to assess the impact of interventions. So we find it striking that in the conversation around DPI there has been very little attention paid to the difference a DPI approach makes, compared to a generic approach to digital transformation. Being clear about that difference is important on its own terms, but also to justify investments and to support the case for a DPI approach to policymakers and decision-makers, especially elected representatives.</p><p>The work to unpack distinctions between DPI and generic digital transformation is critical to developing appropriate safeguards, and to the broader effort to advance the case for and understanding of DPI. The work of developing instructive scenarios to break down the differences will confirm, and there is an open invitation to provide feedback that helps refine the existing scenarios, and to suggest and contribute new&nbsp;ones.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/dpi-or-digital-transformation-identifying-dpi-specific-risks-in-a-caribou-digital-undp-convening-ba3ccd9a5adc">DPI or Digital Transformation?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Scott David</a></p><p>Trust is an emotional state and belief held by human beings that is built upon a sense of reliability and predictability regarding future interactions.&nbsp; The concept of trust is broadly applied to cover relationships among people, or between people and organizations.&nbsp; The concept of a legal trust extends and formalizes the reliability of future interactions to create legally enforceable fiduciary obligations to elevate the subjective emotions and beliefs to become trustworthy, objective, reliable and actionable for future relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of trust is not, however, usually applied to relationships AMONG organizations.&nbsp; It seems naive to assert that one company (or any other purely legal person) trusts another.&nbsp; At that point, the concept of reliability and predictability is more usually characterized as risk, rather than trust.&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizations have developed myriad metrics for assessing risk across business, operating, legal, technical and social (BOLTS) domains as surrogate signals in the absence of human trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations do not have qualia, emotions, or beliefs, and therefore cannot be said to trust something.&nbsp; However, as noted above, the reverse is not true, i.e., humans can trust organizations, and that is the source of brand loyalty (companies) and patriotism (countries), etc.</p>
<p>Trust is built on consistency of behaviors through time and space, and is encoded in signals associated with consistent behaviors.&nbsp; With the advent of networked interaction and information systems (the Internet), the signals and behaviors upon which trust is built became mediated by multiple unseen layers, attenuating trust.&nbsp; The caption of a well-known cartoon from the early Internet years: “On the Internet no one knows you’re a dog,” speaks to the challenges of trust in such unfamiliar, intangible domains.</p>
<p>With the advent of myriad systems and applications of so-called Artificial Intelligence, the signals, behaviors, and interactions online are rendered even more remote and unfamiliar, which further challenges human trust.&nbsp; How can we trust interactions with AI (and mediated by AI) if we don’t even know what to expect of it?&nbsp; The AI black box problem is not just confined to internal AI processing steps, it is also present in online interactions (and the information associated with such interactions) where AI is involved.&nbsp; The advent of “agentic” AI systems, i.e., multi-step and AI P2P interactions, will create vast interaction complexities that will, in effect, enclose all online interactions in a black box rendering control to be stochastic at best, and illusory at worst.</p>
<p>In fact, the concept of trust with AI is a trap.&nbsp; AI is a form of computational intelligence that processes human (mostly English) text purely computationally.&nbsp; AI does not, at present, have any sense or understanding of the content or concepts that it is processing.&nbsp; Putting aside the remarkable phenomenon that computational intelligence can produce outputs that reflect content and style familiar to humans, AI merely processes, it does not understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, AI’s ability to computationally derive such subtle, textured, and human-like patterns from text alone, supports the notion that a significant portion of human cognition (thinking) takes place in language (and material culture) itself, and not in the wet-ware organ of the brain.&nbsp; The brain is just tuned to the mind that actually resides in language.&nbsp; From this perspective, AI is a computational mind reader when it processes human text.&nbsp; That possibility is at the same time creepy and beautiful, for it suggests a future hybridization of humans and AI systems into virtual chimera through a process that is most closely associated with symbiogenesis (from which eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts are derived), but in an intangible form that might be called “sym-info-genesis.”</p>
<p>To put a finer point on this, human survival depended in part on overfitting perceptions of risk vectors from the environment.&nbsp; Individual humans who perceived a lion hiding in the tall grass tended to live longer than humans that did not perceive the lion, even if the lion was not always there.&nbsp; This quality of pareidolia (pattern detection in the environment) is responsible for humans perceiving AI output as presenting readable text and capturing author styles, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is frequently said that AI hallucinates.&nbsp; It is, in fact, the humans that are hallucinating AI outputs, not just the AI systems themselves.&nbsp; In fact, human perception of meaning and content from AI system outputs is akin to predators (mis)perceiving that the eyespots on moth wings are the eyes of a much larger animal.&nbsp; It is hallucination prompted by mimicry prompted by evolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of AI, the source of the mimicry is not evolution but computation AND human preference in selecting more useful forms of output.&nbsp; Of course, when humans marvel at the efficacy and beauty of AI outputs, they are also creating a (virtual) fitness landscape, and selecting for those systems that are most evolved for survival in that (human interaction/information) landscape.&nbsp; We were not around at the time that fish first crawled onto land, but humans are privileged to be able to watch the evolution of a new (non-physical) living form as AI evolves its way into the human trusted interaction landscape.</p>
<p>What are the implications for trust in the future internet where computational intelligence, i.e., AI, can mimic all sorts of content in ways that can benefit or harm interacting parties?&nbsp; At <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2024">cyberevolution</a> in Frankfurt this December, we will explore the implications of these and related phenomenon, with the intention of understanding the dynamics at the crossroads of trust and risk.&nbsp; We hope that you can join us.</p>

 Comparing Lasso (L1) vs Ridge Regression (L2) vs ElasticNet (L1-L2), and Calibration of Classifier Probabilities  Summary <p>This post describes benchmarks on Ocean Predictoor simulations across various approaches to (a) linear regularization, and to (b) calibrating the models’ output probabilities.</p><p>It then proceeds to do a walk-through of each of the benchmarks for predictoor/trader profit, and comparison plots for the models &amp; their calibrations.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 What is Classification? <p>Classification models (“classifiers”) predict the category or class label of an input. For example, in email spam detection, a classifier might predict whether an email is Spam or Not Spam. Since it has just two possible categories, this makes it a binary-valued classification model (True or&nbsp;False).</p><p>To compare, regression models (“regressors”) predict a continuous-valued output. In an email spam application, a regressor might predict the number of spam messages per&nbsp;day.</p> 1.2 What is Regularization? <p>“Regularization” is a technique in fitting models that aims to reduce the uncertainty of future predictions. (“Minimize volume of future predictions confidence ellipsoid.) There are many approaches to regularization. When learning linear models, they occupy a spectrum&nbsp;from:</p>  L1 / Lasso: Try to get sparse models with few parameters  L2 / Ridge Regression: Allow each variable to have a weight, however&nbsp;small  ElasticNet: Shades of gray between L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2  <p>The appendix holds details of&nbsp;each.</p> 1.3 What’s Calibration of Classifier Probabilities? <p>Beyond just predicting True or False, classification models can also output their estimated probability of True or False (or more general category).</p><p>Probabilities fall out naturally with some classifier formulations, such as logistic regression. Here we are using logistic regression.</p><p>We can “calibrate” output probabilities by warping the model’s estimated probability to a training set. This means its probability estimates can be more trustworthy. Some techniques include: None, Isotonic, and&nbsp;Sigmoid.</p>  None calibration: uses the model’s raw, uncalibrated probabilities.  Isotonic calibration: maps predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities by dividing the probabilities into classes using a fitted piecewise constant, non-decreasing function.  Sigmoid calibration: maps predicted probabilities to calibrated probabilities by transforming the raw scores using a sigmoid function, which has an S-shaped curve, squeezing the input values into the range [0,&nbsp;1].   1.4 Ocean Predictoor, Classification and Benchmarks <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn&nbsp;$.</p><p>Classification models are used predict whether the next BTC/USDT close value will go UP or DOWN. (Or ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, etc.)</p><p>We developed a simulation tool (“pdr sim”) for data scientists to run simulations of their predictoor &amp; trader bots to benchmark which modeling strategy, trading strategy, parameters, etc on $ made by predicting or trading. The simulator also outputs classifier accuracy, f1 / recall / precision, and other classifier performance metrics.</p> 1.5 Benchmarks Outline <p>To help users in setting parameters, we ran benchmarks using the “pdr multisim” tool, which invokes the simulator in a loop across various parameter settings. This blog post describes the results of those benchmarks.</p><p>We run benchmarks on each of the regularization approaches</p>  ClassifLinearLasso — L1 regularization  ClassifLinearRidge — L2 regularization  ClassifLinearElasticNet models — spectrum between L1 &amp;&nbsp;L2.  <p>And for each of those approaches, we run the three calibration approaches (None, Isotonic, Sigmoid).</p> 1.6 Experimental setup <p>These parameters were defined in our my_ppss.yaml file, a customized version of the ppss.yaml file of the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> repo:</p>  ClassifLinearRidge, ClassifLinearLasso, and ClassifLinearElasticNet ML models were tested with None, Isotonic, and Sigmoid calibrations.  Models predicted 5min candle UP/DOWN feeds for BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT for 5000&nbsp;epochs.  Models were trained on historical Binance 5min close candle data using either a BTC-USDT training set or both BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT training set from January 1, 2024 to June 30,&nbsp;2024.  The # of training samples (max_n_train) tested were 1000, 2000,&nbsp;5000.  Autoregressive n = 1 and 2 were tested. (Number of candles in the past to build models&nbsp;from.)  Trading fees were set to&nbsp;0%.  The predictoor bot stake was set to 100 OCEAN per&nbsp;epoch.  Other predictoors’ accuracy was set to 50.001% (barely better than&nbsp;random).   2. ClassifLinearLasso <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearLasso model is a Python scikit-learn logistic regression model implemented with Lasso regularization (L1).</p> 2.1 ClassifLinearLasso Benchmarks  2.1.1 Predictoor Profitability Predictoor Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataPredictoor Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Sigmoid calibration of ClassifLinearLasso generated the best results for the Predictoor bot’s profitability at 5000 training samples using either of the training sets. However, None calibration outperformed Sigmoid &amp; Isotonic at only 1000 training samples of BTC-USDT, demonstrating that the calibrations are most effective when generalizing patterns over larger datasets.</p> 2.1.2 Trader Profitability Trader Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataTrader Profits using ClassifLinearLasso Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>While Sigmoid calibration generated the highest Predictoor profits, indicating accurate predictions, Isotonic calibration improved trader profits better than both Sigmoid and None. This suggests that an Isotonic calibration fits a confidence-based trading model better. High accuracy is great — but it’s not enough to reliably make $ because high accuracy with low confidence can still yield trading&nbsp;losses.</p><p>Why can trading losses occur even when prediction accuracy is&nbsp;&gt;50%?</p><p>Losses occur when the magnitude of the losses for DOWN candles is greater than the gains for the UP candles. Calibrations can differ in how they conserve losses better or net bigger gains, but adding confidence intervals to the models can help increase returns regardless of fixed or variable trade&nbsp;sizes.</p> 3. ClassifLinearRidge <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearRidge model is a Python scikit-learn logistic regression model implemented with Ridge regression (L2).</p> 3.1 ClassifLinearRidge Benchmarks  3.1.1 Predictoor Profitability Predictoor Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataPredictoor Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Sigmoid calibration of the ClassifLinearRidge model generated the greatest profits and even outperformed the ClassifLinearLasso model’s max profit. None calibration at 1000 training samples also demonstrated good profitability when trained on BTC-USDT data, as was seen in the ClassifLinearLasso benchmark, but this one was significantly more profitable.</p> 3.1.2 Trader Profitability Trader Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataTrader Profits using ClassifLinearRidge Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Sigmoid &amp; Isotonic calibrations of ClassifLinearRidge performed similarly in generating trader profits - both calibrations achieved trader profits above $200 USD training on either of the data sets. Isotonic calibration, however, generated the max profit of all the benchmarks when the ClassifLinearRidge model was trained using BTC-USDT data&nbsp;only.</p> 4. ClassifLinearElasticNet <p>Ocean Predictoor’s ClassifLinearElasticNet model is a Python scikit-learn logistic regression model implemented with Elastic Net classification.</p> 4.1 ClassifLinearElasticNet Benchmarks  4.1.1 Predictoor Profitability Predictoor Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataPredictoor Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>The Predictoor profit benchmark for ClassifLinearElasticNet has a very similar behavior as the ClassifLinearLasso &amp; ClassifLinearRidge benchmarks, including the Sigmoid as the best performing calibration &amp; the None calibration performing well at 1000 training samples of BTC-USDT data. This is somewhat to be expected because ClassifLinearElasticNet includes both L1 &amp; L2 penalties from the Lasso &amp; Ridge models in its&nbsp;formula.</p> 4.1.2 Trader Profitability Trader Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataTrader Profits using ClassifLinearElasticNet Trained on both BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data<p>Isotonic calibration, as in the previous two trader profit benchmarks, generated the best profits. The consistently profitable Isotonic calibration should be benchmarked with other logistic regression models — SVC, Gaussian, Xgboost, etc. to see if it continues to generate good profits &amp; can be a natural fit for pairing with confidence intervals in a trading optimized model.</p> 5. Comparison Analysis  5.1 Highest Predictoor Profits Similar Performance Among All Three Models With Sigmoid Classification Using BTC-USDT&nbsp;DataClassifLinearLasso Model Beats Both ClassifLinearRidge &amp; ClassifLinearElasticNet When Training on BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT&nbsp;Data 5.1.1 The Winning Combination for Predictoor Profit <p>The max Predictoor profit was 4,937.0429 OCEAN and was generated by the ClassifLinearRidge model. The model was tuned with a Sigmoid calibration, a lookback of 1 (autoregressive_n=1), and 5000 training samples (max_n_train=5000) from a data including both BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT.</p><p>In all the Predictoor profit benchmarks, Sigmoid calibration resulted in the best accuracy &amp; Predictoor profits. The inclusion of ETH-USDT data to the training set improved profits for ClassifLinearRidge and ClassifLinearElasticNet too.</p> 5.2 Highest Trader&nbsp;Profits  5.2.1 The Winning Combination for Trader&nbsp;Profit <p>The highest trading profit was $268.49 USD and was gained by the ClassifLinearLasso model. Tuning included Isotonic calibration, a lookback of 1, and 5000 training samples of only BTC-USDT data. In five of the six most profitable results, Isotonic calibration was used, so this calibration should be tested in future logistic regression benchmarks that optimize trader profit. The 6 most profitable models &amp; tunings all clustered around $250&nbsp;USD.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>The ClassifLinearRidge model with Sigmoid calibration emerged as the top performer for maximizing Predictoor profits (4,937.0429 OCEAN profit) by having the highest accuracy predictions of all the models &amp; tunings. Including ETH-USDT data in the training set further boosted profits for both ClassifLinearRidge and ClassifLinearElasticNet models, highlighting the importance of diversifying the data to improve model performance.</p><p>In contrast, the ClassifLinearLasso model with Isotonic calibration achieved the highest trader profits ($268.49 USD profit), showing that while accuracy is crucial to making $, the confidence in predictions plays an important role in trading success. Isotonic calibration provided the highest trader profits across all three models, suggesting that Isotonic calibration might be a natural fit for confidence-based trading strategies.</p><p>In sum, while Sigmoid calibration optimizes for predictive accuracy and Predictoor profits, Isotonic calibration enhances trader profits by offering better-calibrated probabilities, making it suitable for confidence-based trading models. These results encourage more Predictoor benchmarking tests of logistic regression models, especially with more iterations, to see how to make the most&nbsp;$.</p> 7. Appendix: Tables  7.1 ClassifLinearLasso Data&nbsp;Table <p>The data for ClassifLinearLasso evidences that Sigmoid calibration generates the highest Predictoor profits consistently. Notably, the table also includes the maximum trader profit of $268.4489 USD in the row with Isotonic calibration, autoregressive_n = 1, and max_n_train = 5000 trained on BTC-USDT&nbsp;data.</p> 7.2 ClassifLinearRidge Data&nbsp;Table <p>The data for ClassifLinearRidge also shows consistently high Predictoor profits for Sigmoid calibration, especially around 5000 training samples. The data contains the maximum Predictoor profit of 4937.0429 OCEAN in the row containing Sigmoid calibration with autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples on BTC-USDT &amp; ETH-USDT data. Notice that this row also demonstrated a strong trading&nbsp;profit.</p> 7.3 ClassifLinearElasticNet Data&nbsp;Table <p>The ClassifLinearElasticNet table demonstrates similar patterns seen in the previous two tables, but has the notable difference of generating all the 2nd best Predictoor &amp; trader profits regardless of the training set. This is congruent with the model being balanced between both L1 &amp; L2 penalization. The 2nd best Predictoor profit is 4,808.649 OCEAN in the row with Sigmoid calibration, autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples of BTC-USDT &amp; USDT data. The 2nd best trader profit is $246.8255 USD in the row for Isotonic calibration, with autoregressive_n = 1, and 5000 training samples of BTC-USDT&nbsp;data.</p> 8. Appendix: Details on Regularization Approaches  8.1 Lasso Regularization <p>Lasso is an optimization formulation to learn the parameters of a linear model. It has two parts. The first part minimizes sum-squared errors. The second part is the “L1” regularization” part. The absolute-value term has the effect of driving small weights to zero. Therefore</p><p>drives out weights of zero or near-zero. It does this by mathematically applying a penalty (L1) explained below. This helps in identifying the most relevant features and often enhancing predictive performance on new&nbsp;data.</p> 8.2 Ridge Regression <p>Ridge regression is an optimization formulation to learn the parameters of a linear model, just as Lasso is. However, whereas Lasso drives negligible parameter values to zero, ridge regression lets most variables stick around with some weight. Ridge regression’s formulation is called L2 regularization.</p><p>The penalty is equivalent to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients, does not exclude features (as Lasso does) but shrinks all coefficients, maintaining all features in the model with smaller weights for less important ones. This approach encourages the model to prioritize features that contribute the most to the prediction, leading to better performance on unseen data. Below is the mathematical explanation for the L2&nbsp;penalty.</p> 8.3 ElasticNet <p>Elastic Net is an optimization formulation to learn the parameters of a linear model. Just like Lasso and Ridge Regression, its first term is to minimize least-squares error. Then its second term combines both the Lasso term (absolute values of weights) and the Ridge Regression term (square of weights). The “lambda” parameter weights the latter against the former; this means one can choose something closer to Lasso, or to Ridge Regression, or in&nbsp;between.</p><p>The Elastic Net penalty is defined&nbsp;as:</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Banking fraud becomes costlier each year, and the threat of generative and adversarial AI technologies being misused adds additional approaches and sophistication of attack vectors never experienced before. Identity fraud is a major contributor to the rise in overall bank fraud, driven by many factors including an explosion in identity theft, with experts believing there is a new victim of identity theft every 22 seconds, and total fraud and identity theft cases up 47% from the previous year to $10.2 billion according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Meanwhile, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has released a Financial Trend Analysis in January 2024 that reveals approximately 1.6 million, or 42% of around 3.8 million total Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reports, equivalent to $212 billion in suspicious activity, were related to identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These government agencies are sounding the alarm because banks and other financial institutions are increasingly challenged by sophisticated, motivated cybercriminals who are constantly finding new and creative ways to commit fraud. At the same time, customer demands mean that financial institutions are under significant pressure to provide Open Banking APIs and other new federated connections with business partners, despite the fact that this significantly increases their attack surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, new technologies and architectures are now available that can help banks counter the traditional attacks and future-proof against new and enhanced AI-based attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Compromised Identity Is Central to Banking Fraud 
<p>Identity crimes often precede the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/bank-fraud.html">many types of fraud common in banking</a>. Whether fraudsters are aiming to open new accounts or apply for loans or new credit cards under a stolen or synthetic identity, or are seeking to gain access to existing accounts in order to make fraudulent transfers or harvest sensitive information, they must commit identity fraud first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unsurprising, then, that the cost of identity fraud in banking as well as the volume of fraud cases related to identity continues to go up. Andrea Gacki, Director of FinCEN revealed in June 2024 some preliminary results of an early assessment of the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from 2022 and 2023. Director Gacki revealed that in just two years, the percentage of the 4.7 million reported SARs tied to some impersonation, circumvention or compromise of identity has jumped from 42% (2021 assessment) to 75%. Director Gacki said, “Based on initial indications, by 2023, identity-related SARs accounted for around half of value and almost three quarters of volume.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 AI Has Created New Threat Vectors 
<p>The development in artificial intelligence technologies has been a book to fraudsters, who can now use generative AI to <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/9491/612251">commit fraud more effectively and at scale</a>. As just one example of how this might play out, many European banks and regulators have instituted remote video interviews as a requirement to opening a bank account. However, what our eyes see and our ears hear can no longer be relied upon thanks to generative and other AI technologies being exploited by adversaries. Rapid implementation and usage tools now available as layers on top of the AI core tech enables video and audio deep fakes to be created and injected into a digital interaction with little effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud departments already struggle to keep up with the number of cases that need their attention, and AI is likely to make this problem much worse. Ping recently surveyed 700 IT decision makers from around the world about the topics of AI, fraud, and decentralized identity, and found that only 52% of respondents felt fully confident that they could detect a deepfake of their CEO. Meanwhile, AI emerged as the top area of significant concern among the professionals surveyed, and 54% of organizations admitted to being extremely concerned that AI technology would increase identity fraud.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Digital and Open Banking Increases Attack Surface 
<p>Digital and online banking continues to increase at a rapid pace with customer demand to execute routine financial transactions driving adoption. 81% of users in the US surveyed say they have linked their bank account to third parties online. Regulation from governing authorities demanding Open Banking so as to not lock customers into one bank and enabling them to move between banks has added additional pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling access using traditional methods like server-side APIs and federation (such as OIDC) does not lend itself to increasing security. Every time account access APIs are published for consumption by third parties or federated integrations are created between the bank and a third party, the attack surface of the bank increases, making it more vulnerable and statistically more likely to experience an attack that must be mitigated. As sophistication increases with generative and adversarial AI, securing these connections and mitigating attacks will become increasingly expensive with a higher probability of failure to mitigate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 New Technologies and Architectures Open Up New Protective Fronts to Fight Fraud 
<p>Fortunately, new technologies and architectures are now available that can help banks counter the traditional attacks and future-proof for the fast-approaching AI-based attacks. One such solution is the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/lp/ac/pingone-neo.html">PingOne Neo product suite</a>, which includes identity verification with liveness and data injection detection (deep fake protection), verifiable credentials, and decentralized identity and integration.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see how these technologies can help, let’s examine some of the functional areas requiring protection in banking and how these new technologies can help.</p>

 A Focus on the Trust Triangle for Digital Identity 



<p>In a previous article, <a href="https://medium.com/@ancestral_alien/functional-analysis-for-implementing-self-sovereign-identity-ssi-in-your-business-ff102c47c015">Functional Analysis for Implementing Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in Your Business</a>, we discussed how decentralized identity is transforming digital identity management. It offers users complete control over their personal data and emphasizes the importance of a detailed functional analysis for successful implementation. In this article, we will focus on the main use cases within an SSI ecosystem, exploring the interactions and roles between the key players.</p>



 What is the SSI Trust Triangle? 



<p>The trust triangle is a fundamental concept describing the trust relationship among three actors in the SSI ecosystem: the issuer, the holder, and the verifier. This trust triangle ensures that digital credentials are issued, managed, and verified securely and reliably.</p>

 Issuer: The entity that issues digital credentials based on certain attributes or information of the holder and digitally signs them. Examples include universities issuing digital diplomas, governments issuing digital IDs, or companies issuing employment certificates. 



 Holder: The person or entity that receives and possesses the digital credential. The holder stores these credentials in their identity wallet and presents them when needed. They have full control over who can view and verify their credentials, ensuring privacy and control over their identity. 



 Verifier: The entity that verifies the authenticity and validity of the digital credential presented by the holder. They ensure that the credential was issued by a trusted issuer and that the information contained in the credential is valid. Examples include employers verifying employment certificates, airlines verifying digital passports, or financial institutions verifying customer information. 
 



 Credential Issuance 



<p>Credential issuance involves the issuer and the holder and can be initiated in two ways:</p>



 1. User-Initiated Request 



<p>The holder initiates the action by requesting the issuer to generate a credential. This process can be done through an application provided by the issuer. Once the request is approved, the credential is sent to the user’s identity wallet.</p>



 2. Automatic Issuance 



<p>Automatic issuance occurs without an explicit request from the user. It happens when a specific action within a system triggers the issuance of a credential, which is then sent automatically to the holder’s identity wallet without requiring additional confirmation.</p>



 Credential Reception 



<p>The holder receives credentials either through mobile applications or web applications.</p>



 Mobile Identity Wallet 



<p>If the holder initiates the credential issuance request, the issuer’s site or application generates a credential embedded in a QR code or a deeplink.</p>



 
 QR Code: The holder scans the QR code with their phone’s camera or the wallet’s integrated camera. This initiates the Wallet and Credential Interactions (WACI) flow, involving a message exchange with the SSI backend. The user accepts and saves the generated credential in their wallet. 



 Deeplink: The holder accesses the deeplink received from the issuer, automatically initiating the WACI flow. The user accepts and saves the generated credential in their wallet. 
 



 Web Identity Wallet 



<p>For web wallets, the reception can be automatic. The generated credential appears directly in the wallet without needing user confirmation. This process also involves the WACI protocol.</p>



 Credential Presentation and Verification 



<p>Credential presentation involves both the holder and the verifier. The verifier can be a web or mobile application, adapting to the user’s and verification context’s needs.</p>



 Presentation Methods: 



 1. QR Code Scan 



<p>The verifier presents a QR code that the user scans with their device. The user selects the credential they wish to present and can choose to use Selective Disclosure, showing only the necessary data from the credential or presenting the entire credential.</p>



 2. Automatic Presentation 



<p>The user can select the credential they wish to present from their web wallet and choose the verifier to whom they wish to present it.</p>



 Verifier Validations 



<p>The verifier validates the credential, ensuring it is current, valid, and issued by an authorized issuer. After validating the credential, specific business rules of the verifier are applied. The validation results are shown to both the user and the verifier.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>These use cases highlight the flexibility and control that decentralized identity offers, allowing users to manage their credentials securely and efficiently. Understanding these flows and the information exchange between SSI ecosystem actors is crucial to appreciating the benefits and innovation brought by this system.</p>

 In the rapidly transforming digital landscape, ensuring secure and seamless customer authentication has become a critical priority for businesses across various sectors. Customer authentication is essential for optimizing user experience (UX) and security. Companies striving to implement robust customer authentication encounter significant challenges that can impact their bottom line. Outdated account recovery methods, persistent reliance on passwords, and the growing threat of phishing and fraud present considerable obstacles. However, integrating advanced customer authentication solutions offers promising avenues for mitigating these issues and achieving substantial cost savings. 



 







 



 The Importance of Customer Authentication 



<p>Customer authentication solutions are integral to regulating user access to online applications, digital resources, and transaction flows. Historically dependent on passwords and knowledge-based methods, contemporary solutions now employ various passive and active authentication techniques to confirm identities and secure login attempts. Businesses invest in these solutions to protect against account takeover attacks and to ensure that only authorized users can access their digital platforms. Furthermore, regulatory influences like the second Payment Services Directive for online transactions drive the adoption of these advanced authentication methods.</p>



 Challenges in Implementing Customer Authentication 



<p>Despite the availability of sophisticated authentication technology, businesses continue to rely on legacy solutions. Though familiar to consumers, these solutions create challenges in implementation and efficacy. Traditional account recovery methods remain costly, friction-filled, and vulnerable to phishing attacks. According to recent surveys, 59% of authentication practitioners are dissatisfied with their current account recovery capabilities, which heavily rely on passwords. This dissatisfaction leads to higher operational costs, increased call center volumes, and elevated fraud risks. Additionally, educational gaps and legacy systems hinder the widespread adoption of passwordless solutions, with 41% of businesses acknowledging these barriers.</p>



<p>Another significant issue is balancing user experience and security in authentication flows. While 49% of businesses prioritize enabling convenient user experiences, 51% place greater emphasis on preventing unauthorized access. This delicate balance often results in trade-offs that frustrate users and compromise security.</p>



<p>The complexity of the customer authentication landscape further complicates the situation. The market is crowded with over 50 companies offering various solutions, from global tech giants like Google and Microsoft to specialized vendors like 1Kosmos and Curity. Each vendor presents unique capabilities and approaches, making it challenging for businesses to select the most suitable solution. For instance, while some companies provide end-to-end authentication platforms, others focus on niche areas like passkeys, OTPs, or biometrics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, manual risk decisioning, idiosyncratic authorization methods, and unprotected one-time passwords (OTPs) prevent current authentication solutions from realizing their full potential. Although 93% of practitioners seek AI-based adaptive or continuous authentication capabilities, few vendors leverage AI and machine learning to produce real-time automated recommendations based on context and risk levels. Similarly, without standard protocols and frameworks, deploying customized access control policies is complex, limiting the effectiveness of fine-grain authorization capabilities.</p>



 The Cost of Inadequate Customer Authentication 



<p>Businesses also struggle with the high costs associated with not successfully authenticating customers. The average cost per successful phishing attack is $5,285, and the cost per successful telephone fraud attack is $792. Additionally, 29% of call center volumes relate to account recovery, contributing to significant operational expenses. These factors underscore the need for more robust and efficient authentication solutions.</p>



 Advanced Customer Authentication: A Path Forward 



<p>Leading customer authentication solutions offer a path forward by addressing these challenges and providing substantial benefits. By adopting advanced authentication methods like FIDO2 passkeys, standardized protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, and expanding native capabilities, businesses can enhance security and user experience.</p>



<p>FIDO2 Passkeys: Emerging as a phishing-resistant replacement for passwords and OTPs, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO2 Passkeys </a>address account recovery challenges by ensuring the authentication process remains entirely on the user’s device. This hardware-based authentication method uses strong cryptography and biometrics, reducing the need for easily compromised static credentials.</p>



<p>Standardized Protocols: Standardizing authentication and authorization protocols through <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/">OpenID Connect</a> promotes interoperability among customer authentication solutions. OAuth 2.0 provides secure delegated access, allowing third-party services to request resources on behalf of users without exposing credentials. OpenID Connect adds an authentication layer to verify user identity, ensuring secure and compatible integrations between service providers, identity providers, and authentication providers.</p>



<p>Expanding Native Capabilities: Vendors are broadening their capabilities beyond managing daily customer access by integrating fraud detection, prevention, and identity verification into their platforms. Emerging orchestration capabilities enable businesses to customize authentication flows with pre-integrated partners, starting with basic MFA and adding third-party authenticators as needed to optimize user flows.</p>



<p>Cost Savings and Efficiency: Businesses adopting leading customer authentication solutions can achieve significant cost savings. For instance, prevention of account resets directed to call centers can reduce call center volumes by 38%. Intuitive passwordless authentication and self-service account recovery can decrease call center labor requirements by 60%. Additionally, these solutions can reduce customer churn by 13% and successful phishing attacks by 12%.</p>



<p>Integrating advanced customer authentication solutions enhances security and user experience and drives substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies. As businesses navigate the complexities of the authentication landscape, embracing these innovative solutions will be crucial for staying ahead of evolving threats and maintaining competitive advantage.</p>

<p></p>  Name: Scotty Matthewman<br>Team: Design<br>Based in: New York City   About Scotty <p>Applying my industrial design background to tech products, I have worked in the startup and agency worlds and, most recently, in corporate innovation. After finding my way into Blockchain tech and innovative tech in general, decentralized and digital identity became a very interesting area to explore.</p><p>I was excited to join SpruceID because I’d have the opportunity to design things that have never been designed before, and both the company and industry's values align with the impact I’d like to have: improving accessibility and inclusion through experience optimization.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I am the Senior Designer on the team, so I work on product design, website design, brand and marketing materials, demo prototypes and videos, and communication artifacts. In addition to design work, my role involves product strategy discussions and user research.</p> What advice would you give to a designer who is early in their career? <p>I would say that being genuinely curious is necessary. You have to seek out how things work or why things are the way they are if you want to make educated decisions in your designs; otherwise, you’re just shooting in the dark.</p><p>I think the life of a professional designer is a lot different than that of a design student. Nothing is as simple as it is when you receive an assignment, so you will always have to go out and proactively understand the constraints, capabilities, business value, etc., of anything you’re working on.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it’s way easier to spend a lot of time on something when it’s interesting to you, so find what’s interesting, and you’re more likely to find a great path. In my opinion, every other skill in design stems from curiosity and wanting to learn. </p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>The obvious answer is all the tech behind our product. I’m not an engineer, but understanding the moving parts, at least at a high level, helps me make more educated decisions in the designs.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>Our team offsite in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil was an awesome experience. I had just recently joined SpruceID, and because we had the majority of the team in one place, I got to know many people early on. I think in-person experiences like this can help build rapport and chemistry in a team, which can enable them to work quickly and effectively.</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>Success in my role is taking abstract problems and delivering the most intuitive, effective solutions. </p><p>These may not be official measurements, but it’s a big win when someone says, “Oh! Yeah, that would work!” because you bring a new, creative way of designing something.</p><p>You feel like you solved the puzzle. It’s very gratifying and promising when your chosen solution feels like the obvious choice.</p> What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>I have really enjoyed being on a team made up of very smart people who are all trying to make ambitious strides. It is clear how great everyone is at what they do, so I am humbled to be included in this group.</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?: I like to play basketball, walk through NYC, spend time with friends, go to comedy shows, surf when I can, and take singing classes, which have been such a fun part of living in New York.</p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: I would be a maple tree. I used to make furniture, and I always loved using maple. The color and grain are so pretty and clean, and it gives very clean, Nordic and Japanese vibes</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p>Want to work with us? Check out our <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">open roles here.</a></p>

<p>Identity verification has traditionally played an important but limited role in the world of identity and access management (IAM). To establish someone’s identity, you need to prove that they are who they say they are, linking&nbsp; their digital identity to their real-world identity. For employees, this verification typically occurs during onboarding; for customers, it happens when they open a new account. Once validated, they receive credentials, are granted appropriate authorizations, and enter the vast identity access flow universe — with identity verification rarely called upon again.</p> 
<p>This system is fundamentally flawed.</p> 
<p>Help desk social engineering, synthetic identities and AI-powered attacks are exploiting inadequate identity verification systems to completely circumvent IAM security. The $100 million attack on <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">MGM resorts</a> occurred when attackers impersonated an employee, convinced the IT help desk to reset credentials, and then escalated privileges until gaining control of the entire system. Just a few months later, a finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into wiring out $25 million when cybercriminals posed as senior executives using video and audio deepfakes. In fact, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/2024-state-of-passwordless-identity-assurance-report-recap">78% of organizations</a> were targeted by identity-related attacks last year.</p> 
 Unmasking Social Deception  
<p>The industry urgently needs to evolve its approach to combat these modern threats. Multi-factor verification (MFV) offers the answer. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-have-entered-era-multi-factor-verification-mfv-susan-morrow-1ibse/">A recent article</a> by Susan Morrow makes the case&nbsp; eloquently — I highly recommend the read. Multi-factor verification moves beyond relying on authentication as the primary gatekeeper, making identity verification that uses multiple verification factors and risk assessment, an intrinsic part of daily access flows.</p> 
<p>This transformation is the next step in identity security maturation, similar to authentication’s progression from passwords, to multi-factor authentication, to phishing-resistant MFA and passkeys. Authentication had to adapt to combat escalating phishing and password-related attacks. Multi-factor verification is essential to stem the onslaught of sophisticated social engineering threats.</p>

 The Current State of Authentication vs. Verification  
<p>To understand what makes multi-factor verification such a powerful tool, it’s helpful to go back to IAM basics.</p> 
 What Is Authentication?  
<p>In the digital world, authentication is the process of confirming the identity of a user before allowing them to access a device or account. Note that I say user, not person, because that’s what they are in this process — a user in the system. Common authentication factors are something the user knows (like a password), something the user owns (like a mobile phone or hardware security key) or something the user is (biometric data like a fingerprint). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires two or more factors from different categories to confirm identity.</p> 
 What Is Identity Verification?  
<p>Also referred to as identity proofing, identity verification makes sure a person is who they claim to be, and that the identity is genuine. Verification can be done in person or digitally, using various methods, depending on the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">level of identity assurance</a> required. Methods include location checks, comparing user-supplied person information against official databases, examining government issue documents, matching a selfie against an official ID and personal interactions, among others.</p> 
 Authentication vs. Verification  
<p>In a nutshell, verification involves establishing a legitimate, proven user identity in a system. Authentication is about keeping unauthorized users out of the system.</p> 
 What Is Multi-Factor Verification (MFV)?  
<p>Today, access to an organization’s systems and resources is primarily controlled by the authentication process. Yes, there are variations and layers — adaptive authentication, risk-based authentication, access controls like RBAC and PAM — but essentially the act of providing the right combination of credentials gets you through the door. Multi-factor verification (MFV) brings deeper identity verification checks and risk assessment into this daily access process.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor verification integrates multiple verification factors dynamically and contextually throughout the user session. This approach combines continuous verification with authentication mechanisms so that you are not just validating the user, you are validating the human.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication vs. multi-factor verification</p> 
 How MFV Works  
<p>Today, comprehensive identity verification checks are generally performed only at specific points in time, such as when opening a new account or beginning a job. At other critical moments, such as resetting a credential or registering a new phone, most organizations rely on knowledge-based answers or calling the helpdesk, which are notoriously vulnerable to social engineering.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Anatomy of the Help Desk Social Engineering Attack on MGM Resorts</p> 
<p>By contrast, MFV continuously verifies the person's identity based on a combination of factors such as behavior, context, and biometrics. This dynamic verification adapts in response to behavior anomalies, device telemetry, environment and other risk signals, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit. By integrating these factors in real-time, MFV offers a secure, fast and less intrusive verification process.</p> 
 Benefits of Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>Nearly 4 in 10 organizations name identity verification as a top identity security challenge. MFV addresses their pain points on multiple fronts.</p> 
<p>Stop Social Engineering and other Identity Threats: &nbsp;Last year saw a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">71% increase in attacks abusing valid accounts</a>. MFV's continuous verification significantly reduces the risk of ATO, session hijacking and other attacks. By continuously adapting to the user's behavior and context, multi-factor verification provides greater resistance to sophisticated threats, ensuring that only legitimate users can maintain access.</p> 
<p>Improved User Experience: Most organizations struggle with real-time verification, spending more than <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/report-recap-workplace-identity-security-trends-in-2024">two hours verifying identity</a> during employee onboarding, when replacing a device, recovering an account or during other high-risk scenarios. MFV provides a seamless and less intrusive verification process, with basic checks conducted behind the scenes. Additional forms of proof are only required at times of increased risk, creating a smoother and more personalized experience.</p> 
<p>Scalability and Flexibility: MFV is easily adaptable to different industries and use cases. Its flexibility allows integration with existing identity stacks, making it a scalable solution for organizations of all sizes.</p> 
 How HYPR Uses Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>Multi-factor verification is core to HYPR’s Identity Assurance Platform. The HYPR Platform unifies&nbsp; phishing-resistant passwordless authentication, adaptive risk mitigation and automated identity verification into a seamless, user-centric access flow. Organizations can easily choose and configure the identity verification processes that suit their environment and use cases. For example, secure self-service options at times of low risk, with additional steps such as live video chat in higher risk scenarios or when security anomalies are detected. They can also enforce a range of phishing-resistant authenticators including device-bound <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a>, hardware keys and smart cards.</p> 
<p>Example Multi-Factor Verification Flow With HYPR</p> 
 Toward Identity-Centric Security With MFV  
<p>Organizations worldwide have an identity problem. The vast majority of breaches today are related to identity issue. As Gartner’s Cybersecurity Chief of Research, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4v4cA6OG14g3GSZF0Ld4d8">Mary Ruddy, pointed out</a><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4v4cA6OG14g3GSZF0Ld4d8?si=28033054b3824035">,</a> “Digital security is reliant on identity whether we want it to be or not. In a world where users can be anywhere and applications are increasingly distributed across datacenters in the multi-cloud, identity IS the control plane.</p> 
<p>Current access processes are no match against attackers’ nimble and incessant tactics. Initiatives like FIDO’s recently announced <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/identity-verification/">identity verification certification</a> program bring critical advancement, but are just part of the answer. Multi-Factor Verification (MFV) marks a major leap forward in identity security, offering stronger protection and a better user experience. As organizations plan to build a more identity-centric security approach, it’s imperative they include MFV in their identity security protocols. Emerging technologies like decentralized identity systems hold promise for even more secure and efficient verification methods. Continuous innovation will drive MFV’s evolution, ensuring it remains a strong defense against emerging threats.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Traditional identity verification methods show their age, often proving susceptible to data breaches and inefficiencies. Blockchain emerges as a beacon of hope in this scenario, heralding a new era of enhanced data security, transparency, and user-centric control to manage digital identities. This article delves deep into blockchain’s transformative potential in identity verification, highlighting its advantages and the challenges it adeptly addresses.</p>
 
What is Blockchain? 
<p>Blockchain technology represents the decentralized storage of a digital ledger of transactions. Distributed across a network of computers, decentralized storage of this ledger ensures that every transaction gets recorded in multiple places. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that no single entity controls the entire blockchain, and all transactions are transparent to every user.</p>
 <br>
Types of Blockchains: Public vs. Private 
<p>Blockchain technology can be categorized into two primary types: public and private. Public blockchains are open networks where anyone can participate and view transactions. This transparency ensures security and trust but can raise privacy concerns. In contrast, private blockchains are controlled by specific organizations or consortia and restrict access to approved members only. This restricted access offers enhanced privacy and control, making private blockchains suitable for businesses that require confidentiality and secure data management.</p>
 
Brief history and definition 
<p>The concept of a distributed ledger technology, a blockchain, was first introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Initially, it was the underlying technology for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The primary goal was to create a decentralized currency, independent of retaining control of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable, and immutable way. Over time, the potential applications of blockchain have expanded far beyond cryptocurrency. Today, it is the backbone for various applications, from supply chain and blockchain identity management solutions to voting systems.</p>
 
Core principles 
<p>Blockchain operates on a few core principles. Firstly, it’s decentralized, meaning no single entity or organization controls the entire chain. Instead, multiple participants (nodes) hold copies of the whole blockchain. Secondly, transactions are transparent. Every transaction is visible to anyone who has access to the system. Lastly, once data is recorded on a blockchain, it becomes immutable. This means that it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of most of the blockchain network.</p>
 
The Need for Improved Identity Verification 
<p>Identity verification is a cornerstone for many online processes, from banking to online shopping. However, traditional methods of identity verification could be more challenging. They often rely on centralized databases of sensitive information, making them vulnerable to data breaches. Moreover, these methods prove identity and often require users to share personal details repeatedly, increasing the risk of data theft or misuse.</p>
 
Current challenges in digital identity 
<p>Digital credentials and identity systems today face multiple challenges. Centralized systems are prime targets for hackers. A single breach can expose the personal data of millions of users. Additionally, users often need to manage multiple usernames and passwords across various platforms, leading to password fatigue and increased vulnerability. There’s also the issue of privacy. Centralized digital identities and credentials systems often share user data with third parties, sometimes without the user’s explicit consent.</p>
 <br>
Cost of identity theft and fraud 
<p>The implications of identity theft and fraud are vast. It can lead to financial loss, credit damage, and a long recovery process for individuals. For businesses, a breach of sensitive information can result in significant financial losses, damage to business risks, reputation, and loss of customer trust. According to reports, the annual cost of identity theft and fraud runs into billions of dollars globally, affecting individuals and corporations.</p>
 
How Blockchain Addresses Identity Verification 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain offers a fresh approach to identity verification. By using digital signatures and leveraging its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature, blockchain technology can provide a more secure and efficient way to verify identity without traditional methods’ pitfalls.</p>
 
Decentralized Identity 
<p>Decentralized identity systems on the blockchain give users complete control over their identity data. Users can provide proof of their identity directly from a blockchain instead of relying on a central authority to keep medical records and verify identity. This reduces the risk of a centralized data breach and gives users autonomy over their identities and personal data.</p>
 
Transparency and Trust 
<p>Blockchain technology fosters trust through transparency, but the scope of this transparency varies significantly between public and private blockchains. Public blockchains allow an unparalleled level of openness, where every transaction is visible to all, promoting trust through verifiable openness. On the other hand, private blockchains offer a selective transparency that is accessible only to its participants. This feature maintains trust among authorized users and ensures that sensitive information remains protected from the public eye, aligning with privacy and corporate security requirements.</p>
 Immutability 
<p>Once identity data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered without consensus. This immutability of sensitive, personally identifiable information ensures that identity data remains consistent and trustworthy. It also prevents malicious actors from changing identity data for fraudulent purposes.</p>
 
Benefits of Blockchain Identity Verification 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Blockchain’s unique attributes offer a transformative approach to identity verification, addressing many of the challenges faced by the traditional identity systems’ instant verification methods.</p>
 
Enhanced Security 
<p>Traditional identity verification systems, being centralized, are vulnerable to single points of failure. If a hacker gains access, the entire system can be compromised. Blockchain, with its decentralized nature, eliminates this single point of failure. Each transaction is encrypted and linked to the previous one. This cryptographic linkage ensures that even if one block is tampered with, it would be immediately evident, making unauthorized alterations nearly impossible.</p>
 
User Control 
<p>Centralized identity systems often store user data in silos, giving organizations control over individual data. Blockchain shifts this control back to users. With decentralized identity solutions, individuals can choose when, how, and with whom they share their personal information. This not only enhances data security and privacy but also reduces the risk of data being mishandled or misused by third parties.</p>
 
Reduced Costs 
<p>Identity verification, especially in sectors like finance, can be costly. Manual verification processes, paperwork, and the infrastructure needed to support centralized databases contribute to these costs. Blockchain can automate many of these processes using smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and manual interventions and leading to significant cost savings.</p>
 
Interoperability 
<p>In today’s digital landscape, individuals often have their digital identities and personal data scattered across various platforms, each with its verification process. Blockchain can create a unified, interoperable system where one’s digital identity documents can be used across multiple platforms once verified on one platform. This not only enhances user convenience but also streamlines processes for businesses.</p>
 
The Mechanics Behind Blockchain Identity Verification 
<p></p>
<p>Understanding its underlying mechanics is crucial to appreciating the benefits of the entire blockchain network’s ability for identity verification.</p>
 
How cryptographic hashing works 
<p>Cryptographic hashing is at the heart of the blockchain network’s various security measures. When a transaction occurs, it’s converted into a fixed-size string of numbers and letters using a hash function. This unique hash is nearly impossible to reverse-engineer. When a new block is created, it contains the previous block’s hash, creating a blockchain. Any alteration in a block changes its hash, breaking the chain and alerting the system to potential tampering.</p>
 
Public and private keys in identity verification 
<p>Blockchain uses a combination of public and private keys to ensure secure transactions. A public key is a user’s address on the blockchain, while a private key is secret information that allows them to initiate trades. Only individuals with the correct private key can access and share their data for identity verification, ensuring their data integrity and security.</p>
 
The role of consensus algorithms 
<p>Consensus algorithms are protocols that consider a transaction valid based on the agreement of the majority of participants in the network. They play a crucial role in maintaining the trustworthiness of the blockchain. In identity verification, consensus algorithms ensure that once a user’s identity data is added to the blockchain, it’s accepted and recognized by the majority, ensuring data accuracy and trustworthiness.</p>
 
Conclusion 
<p>Through its unique attributes, blockchain presents a compelling and transformative alternative to the pitfalls of conventional identity management and verification systems. By championing security, decentralization, and user empowerment, it sets a new standard for the future of digital and blockchain identity and access management solutions. To understand how this can redefine your identity management and verification processes, book a call with us today and embark on a journey toward a more secure security posture.</p>

<p></p>        <p>In light of the recent <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/11/europe/italy-olive-oil-seizure-scli-intl/index.html">significant seizure of counterfeit olive oil by Italian authorities</a>, &nbsp;the need for robust traceability and authenticity in the olive oil industry has never been more critical. Italian authorities confiscated nearly €900,000 worth of fake extra virgin olive oil – that’s about 42 ton – highlighting the pervasive issue of olive oil fraud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some of the 42 tons of oil was already packaged ready for sale. Authorities confiscated 71 tons of what was referred to as an “oily substance” in plastic tanks, as well as 623 liters of chlorophyll, a component of extra virgin olive oil that was being added to oil of a lesser value.</p>
<p>They found packaging equipment, labels purporting that the oil was “extra virgin” when it was clearly not, and commercial documentation including 1,145 customs excise duty stamps that are being studied for forgery, the statement said.<br>
– Barbie Nadeau – CNN”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fraudulent activity not only undermines consumer trust but also poses serious health risks. UNISOT’s Asset Traceability Platform can play a crucial role in preventing such fraudulent activities.</p>
                      <p>One of our AgriOnChain customers is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/az_agricola_francesco_pepe/">Az. Agricola Francesco Pepe</a>. Francesco has successfully implemented UNISOT’s Digital Product Passports to secure his supply chain. This implementation has been instrumental in proving and maintaining his reputation for producing exceptional olive oil, winning numerous awards, and achieving recognition in the Olive Oil Bible FlosOlei. By using UNISOT, he has ensured that his products remain authentic and traceable, reinforcing consumer confidence and loyalty.</p>

</blockquote>
               How UNISOT’s Asset Traceability Platform can help   <p>COMPREHENSIVE TRACEABILITY</p>
<p>UNISOT’s Platform ensures complete traceability of olive oil from the grove to the consumer. Every step of the production process, including harvesting, pressing and bottling, is securely recorded, digitally signed and timestamped on the blockchain. This transparency ensures that every bottle of olive oil is traceable back to its origin, making it extremely difficult for counterfeit products to infiltrate the supply chain.</p>
<p>PRODUCT AUTHENTICATION</p>
<p>Utilizing unique digital identities and QR codes, UNISOT allows consumers to verify the authenticity of Agricola Francesco Pepe’s olive oil instantly. By scanning the QR code on the bottle, consumers can access detailed information about the product’s origin, production process and quality certifications.</p>
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRITY</p>
<p>Our platform enhances the integrity of the supply chain by enabling real-time monitoring and alerts for any anomalies. This capability helps in early detection of potential fraud and ensures that only high-quality olive oil reaches the market.</p>
<p>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE</p>
<p>With increasing incidents of food fraud, consumer trust is paramount. AgriOnChain not only protects the reputation of premium producers like Agricola Francesco Pepe but also assures consumers of the product’s authenticity and superior quality. This trust is vital for sustaining and growing market share in a highly competitive industry.</p>
<p>COMBATING DOCUMENTATION FRAUD</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring product authenticity, AgriOnChain can also help prevent fraud related to commercial documentation. The recent case involving 1,145 customs excise duty stamps suspected of forgery underscores the need for secure and verifiable documentation. By leveraging UNISOT’s <a href="https://unisot.com/sdc-secure-document-collaboration/">Secure Document Collaboration</a> solution, every document related to the production, distribution and sale of olive oil can be securely recorded and verified. This reduces the risk of forgery and ensures that all commercial documents, including excise duty stamps, are legitimate and traceable.</p>
            <p>The recent olive oil fraud cases underscore the urgent need for effective measures to safeguard the authenticity of olive oil. UNISOT’s <a href="https://unisot.com/truth-transparency-trust-and-olive-oil/">AgriOnChain</a> provides a comprehensive solution to combat fraud, enhance traceability and build consumer trust.

<p>Elliptic has conducted <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/resources/ai-enabled-crime-in-the-cryptoasset-ecosystem">separate research</a> into deepfakes and their role in the crypto romance scams that such groups are notorious for facilitating. The good news is that, despite their experimentation with AI, the actual use thereof currently appears to be low. Elliptic has not identified the use of AI tools to enhance on-chain obfuscation of pig butchering proceeds, although there is a small but growing indication of AI-generated content being used to initiate these scams.</p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>For those who missed the AMA on July 15th with Nick Lambert (CEO) and Elina Cadouri (COO), here are the key highlights:</p><p>1. Nick and Elina expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the community for their support, especially during the recent challenges with the Binance delisting. They emphasized how much the community's loyalty means to them.</p><p>2. Binance Delisting: What happened with the Binance delisting?</p>  DOCK was delisted from Binance without any prior warnings and only 7 days after being added to the Monitoring List.  Even though Binance did not provide one specific reason for adding DOCK to the Monitoring List, the team believes it could have been due to trading volume or liquidity given that all of the other reasons do not apply to the project. Dock had already been in the process of hiring a&nbsp; Market Maker to improve the liquidity aspect who began working on this immediately. But Binance, without warning, delisted DOCK after only a week whereas projects are typically given months or even a year to work on removing the monitoring tag  Despite this setback, the fundamentals of DOCK remain strong, and the team is committed to moving forward.  <p>3. How is the team ensuring the stability and growth of the project?</p>  We increased validator rewards to support and encourage network stability.  Engaged a regulated Market Maker to ensure liquidity for the DOCK token.  We are exploring additional exchange listings to broaden DOCK’s availability and reach.  Dock’s platform currently serves enterprise clients and client acquisition remains a top priority.  <p>4. Strategy and Goals: What are the main goals and strategies for the next year?</p>  Continuing to execute the published roadmap with exciting new developments.  Filed a patent for "Verifier Pay Issuer", a feature that enables issuers to charge for the verification of a credential, showcasing DOCK’s innovative approach to decentralized identity.  Several partnership announcements are anticipated, which will drive adoption and demand for the DOCK token.  <p>5. Community: How can the community help support DOCK?</p>  Community members can share and amplify DOCK’s social media content to create awareness.  It is important to keep positive engagement and constructive feedback.  Dock remains transparent and accessible for any concerns or questions from the community.  <p>6. Roadmap for 2024: What can we look forward to in the second half of 2024?</p>  Dock will develop the ability to verify eIDAS 2.0 and mDL credentials, launch a Cloud Wallet Beta, integrate Biometric-bound credentials, launch an Embeddable Wallet SDK, and roll out support for the OpenID4VC standard.  <p>7. Adoption and Token Demand: Why is client acquisition important for DOCK?</p>  Every transaction on the DOCK network uses DOCK tokens, driving demand as more companies adopt the technology.  DOCK is working to ensure that even companies without technical expertise can easily integrate and benefit from their innovative solutions.  <p>8. Audience questions: Are team members personally invested in DOCK?</p>  Yes, several team members hold DOCK in their personal portfolios and has received tokens as part of their compensation.  <p>9. When will DOCK Wallet staking be available?</p>  DOCK Wallet staking will be launched soon, with ongoing efforts to integrate with Nova Wallet.  <p>10. Is there a chance of being relisted on Binance?</p>  The likelihood of being relisted on Binance is low. The team is focusing on other growth opportunities and new exchange listings.  <p>Thank you all for your continued support. We are excited about the future and look forward to sharing more updates soon!</p><p>You can watch the entire AMA here: <a href="https://youtu.be/mfn6jVKaN60?ref=blog.dock.io">https://youtu.be/mfn6jVKaN60</a></p>

  Layer 2 solutions enhance scalability by resolving the high fees and slow processing times associated with Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  By bundling transactions, L2s significantly boost transactions per second, improving speed and reducing&nbsp;costs.  Increasing cryptocurrency adoption is driving L2 innovation and investment, leading to diverse technologies and substantial capital&nbsp;inflow.  <p>Time and again, we have seen popular L1 networks — from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Solana — have been clogged with pending transactions, especially during periods of high activity. This not only leads to a significant increase in transaction fees but also prevents users from capitalizing on opportunities in&nbsp;time.</p><p>Such occurrences show us that speed and cost remain the biggest technical challenges in the crypto world. The root cause is the blockchain trilemma, which involves trade-offs among the technology’s three most critical aspects: decentralization, security, and scalability.</p><p>Layer 1 blockchains prioritize security and decentralization, achieved through a distributed, global network of participants. However, there’s also a downside to Layer 1 blockchain, as they often face scalability issues.</p><p>At the largest annual European Ethereum event, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/07/10/vitalik-buterin-reflects-on-strengths-weaknesses-of-ethereum-hardening-the-blockchain/">the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC), Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin</a> highlighted Ethereum’s limitations, including its struggle to handle high volumes of transactions. This issue often results in increased fees and delays. He also pointed out the complexities newcomers face when interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) and the challenges associated with becoming a network validator.</p><p>To resolve these issues, scalability in particular, developers have taken to building layer 2 solutions.</p><p>Layer 2 blockchains are off-chain solutions built on top of L1s. Some of the current popular L2 solutions are Lightning Network, Stacks, Merlin Chain for Bitcoin and Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, and zkSync for Ethereum, to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>Unlike L1, where every transaction has to go through the distributed network for processing and broadcasting, L2s take the load off by performing most of the functions off-chain. This is how popular payment platforms like Visa work. Instead of managing thousands of daily transactions separately, which ends up clogging the network, they batch the transactions for final settlement.</p><p>Similarly, L2 solutions offload the burden of managing thousands of transactions from the mainnet. To achieve this, L2s bundle a large number of transactions into a single transaction, which increases the throughput, i.e., transactions per second (TPS). For instance, Bitcoin has a TPS of 5 while Ethereum has 7, and in comparison, the L2 solution boasts tens of thousands in&nbsp;TPS.</p><p>Higher throughput helps increase speed and lower fees on these layer 2 solutions. Higher TPS and lower fees improve user experience and enhance the utility. Meanwhile, by settling transactions on the mainnet, they also retain security and decentralization.</p><p>L2s, however, aren’t of just one type. They utilize different technologies. Rollups tech is a popular one where transactions are executed off L1 and then rolled into a single piece of data before it gets posted back to the mainnet, where it is reviewed. There are even variations to rollups, such as Optimism and ZK rollups. Then, there are sidechains that work as independent blockchains and run parallel to the main blockchain. To interact with L1, sidechains utilize&nbsp;bridges.</p> A Massive Wave of&nbsp;L2s <p>With crypto adoption rising significantly, the need for greater TPS is more important than ever. As of 2024, over half a billion users currently own crypto, and this number is projected to double by the end of this&nbsp;decade.</p><p>So, the greater the number of crypto users, the higher the number of transactions happening daily, and the greater the need for higher network capacity. Hence, there is an increasing need for and interest in&nbsp;L2s.</p><p>Today, there are <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-1">over a hundred projects</a> working on enabling improved scalability if we go by Coingecko’s data alone. Top L1 coins are worth <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-1">$1.8 trillion,</a> with Bitcoin alone accounting for $1.16 trillion of it. L2 coins, meanwhile, have a combined market cap of almost <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-2">$20 bln</a>. To go further into it, top sidechain coins are worth <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/sidechain">$1.43 bln,</a> while top Bitcoin sidechains have a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/bitcoin-layer-2">$2.6 bln</a> collective market size. Top rollup coins, on the other hand, have a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/rollup">$11.8 bln</a> market&nbsp;cap.</p><p>According to <a href="http://l2beat.com">L2Beat.com</a>, more than $40 billion worth of capital is locked (TVL) across L2 projects.</p><p>The data clearly shows that a lot is happening in the L2 space, but this is just the beginning. As their usage and capital inflow continue to surge, many exciting things are coming&nbsp;up.</p><p>Some of the exciting developments currently happening in the sector include L2 network Starknet introducing staking on its ecosystem before the year is over. For scalability, it produces STARK proofs off-chain and then sends them on-chain. In the future, Starknet users will be able to lock their tokens for a 21-day period and earn rewards in proportion to the STRK tokens staked. Its CEO, Eli Ben-Sasson, called this “an important step in building the staking community and technology, offering new opportunities for users and developers.”</p><p>Popular Bitcoin L2 Stacks is currently preparing for a big upgrade called Nakamoto to honor the trillion-dollar crypto asset’s pseudonymous creator. With this upgrade, the L2 solution aims to decouple the Stacks block production schedule from that of Bitcoin to solve the congestion issues.</p><p>Hong Kong’s licensed crypto exchange operator, HashKey Group, is also planning to launch its Ethereum layer-2 solution, HashKey Chain, in Q4. Even meme coins like Shiba Inu have launched their very own L2 called Shibarium to handle a greater number of users and bring additional value to their ecosystem.</p><p>Then, new waves of L2s are entering the space. Blockchain platform Celo is launching its Dango Layer 2 testnet, for which it is utilizing Optimism’s OP Stack. Bitcoin and Ethereum-powered hybrid L2 project BOB raised $1.6mln in a funding round led by Ledger Cathay Fund and contributions from BlackRock, Rarible, Ordinals, Aave, Curve, Magic Eden, Mechanism, Injective, and&nbsp;Babylon.</p><p>While Solana boasts a high TPS, projects like Rome are raising funds from Polygon Ventures, HashKey, and angel investors, including Solana’s Anatoly Yakovenko and Austin Federa, to allow Ethereum-based rollups to use Solana as a shared sequencer.</p><p>Given L2’s focus on allowing higher throughput and, as a result, greater transaction inclusion, it makes sense everyone is onboarding the L2 train. However, it’s important that equal efforts are being made to attract users to engage on these platforms. For that, we need to focus on simplifying user onboarding and providing a more seamless user experience.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 We sit down with the Director of Strategic Solutions at Cifas – the UK’s largest not-for-profit fraud prevention service – to discuss what changes the company would make to the UK’s fraud strategy, the importance of a whole-of-system solution to a whole-of-system problem and much more. 



 



 Beginning on a personal note, you seemed to have spent most of your career in fraud prevention in some capacity. What was it that first attracted you to the industry?&nbsp; 



<p>What attracted me to the fraud prevention community initially was the rewarding nature of keeping people safe and, more importantly, trying to stay one step ahead of an adversary that has no moral boundaries. Feeling like you have really made a difference to people’s lives at the end of each working day is what gets me out of bed in the mornings too.&nbsp;</p>



 Perhaps a good place to get into this is with the UK’s fraud strategy, released in 2023. Do you think the earmarked £100 million and 400 new specialist fraud officers is enough to help reduce fraud by 10% by 2025? How likely do you think it will be to achieve?&nbsp; 



<p>Fraud represents almost 40% of all crime in England and Wales and has more than doubled in Scotland over the past nine years. It’s the most prevalent crime in the UK that devastates individuals financially and emotionally, damages business reputations, and targets the public purse meaning wider communities miss out on critical resources and support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the publication of the government’s Fraud Strategy in 2023 was a positive first step, we must do more to turn the tide on the fraud epidemic sweeping the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want a future without fraud so welcome the additional investment and extra resources. However, we also recognize we can’t arrest our way out of the problem. The focus needs to be on prevention – that means clear focus on intelligence-led responses that go beyond traditional policing and builds on the premise of organizations working together.&nbsp;</p>



 What would you say are the most common forms of fraud (e.g. money mules, social engineering fraud) in the UK?&nbsp; 



<p>The latest data recorded by our 750-plus membership to the Cifas National Fraud Database (NFD) revealed that account takeover – where a criminal utilizes compromised personal data to hijack an existing account or product – rose by 13% in 2023 compared to 2022. Additionally, we saw a 5% increase in account abuse (often referred to as ‘misuse of facility’). Identity fraud also remained our most dominant case type, accounting for 64% of all 374,000-plus NFD cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Filings to the Cifas Insider Threat Database continued to increase and was up 14% in 2023 compared to the year before. Just under half of these (49%) related to dishonest action by employees.</p>

 On May 15, Cifas delivered its ‘Fraud Pledges 2024’ to Number 10 Downing Street. What areas of the government’s approach to tackling fraud do you think need to be improved? What was the reaction and have any next steps been agreed?&nbsp; 



<p>As our <a href="https://www.cifas.org.uk/insight/public-affairs-policy">Cifas Fraud Pledges</a> make clear, there is no silver bullet for tackling fraud. It is a whole-of-system problem requiring a whole-of-system solution. However, we think a good starting point for the next government would be to appoint a Minister for Economic Crime to drive proper cross-system leadership on this issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond this, it is essential we invest properly in fraud policing and the criminal justice response as well as harness the capabilities of the private sector, through enhanced data-sharing, to disrupt fraud and financial crime and act as the first line of defense.&nbsp;</p>



 Cifas is advocating for social media companies to collaborate more to combat fraud. As social media fraud is such a huge arena, spanning almost every platform, from job search platforms to dating platforms, which parties do you think should be collaborating? And, as many platforms offer a very light-touch identity verification process, how important is it to ensure all users are required to undergo a thorough customer onboarding process?&nbsp; 



<p>No one sector can single-handedly tackle fraud. It is an issue which cuts through industries and across the public and private sectors. The only way we can tackle the problem is by breaking down cross-sector barriers, finding meaningful ways to collaborate, and sharing data and intelligence to ensure there is no weak link in the chain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is essential that the biggest online platforms and services most abused by criminals join the counter-fraud community and multi-sector data-sharing initiatives, and including where appropriate, to ensure robust customer screening.&nbsp;</p>



 With most fraud in the UK happening online, across every medium and industry, how can people and companies best protect themselves?&nbsp; 



<p>At Cifas, our whole purpose is to eradicate fraud in the UK. To do so, we must build products and services that help organizations, and their customers fight economic crime and protect themselves against fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re rolling out several preventative solutions to help businesses scale their counter-fraud efforts and keep people safe. One currently being developed is a consumer-based app that proactively protects consumers from identity fraud and puts them in complete control of their personal information, effectively making stolen data worthless. It’s in beta testing and on track to launch in 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More generally, people and companies must work collaboratively to gain maximum protection against the threats of fraud because criminals will always find new ways to exploit weaknesses, particularly when they’re able to hide in relative anonymity online. We would always urge individuals and companies to stay vigilant and think if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>



 What dangers does AI pose to UK’s fraud landscape? What steps can business, government and the local public take to weather the storm?&nbsp; 



<p>Technology and AI are going to be critical in how we deal with the threat posed by criminals’ use of AI and other technologies – it presents both opportunities and challenges to the UK’s fraud landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, criminals exploit weaknesses and rely on panic and urgency to get personal information and/or financial details. Both businesses and consumers should take a moment and challenge where a piece of communication has come from. Where possible, getting a second opinion is incredibly important and if something doesn’t look right, report it at the earliest opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, eradicating fraud is not down to one individual, industry, the government or law enforcement – it’s a collective effort. Our mission at Cifas is to create the largest counter-fraud community that shares data, intelligence and knowledge – all of which can be used to create products and services that protect everyone. To do so, we want to be a central component of a new and more effective UK-wide, data-sharing architecture that unlocks cross-sector collaboration across the public, private and law enforcement domains.&nbsp;</p>



 How have fraud attacks changed over the last 20 years and how do you envision it changing in the next 20?&nbsp; 



<p>Today, you no longer need a complex piece of malware to trick a consumer into handing over key personal data. All that’s required is a mobile phone, a few vague details about an individual and some social engineering for an attack to be successful time and time again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel that fraud will evolve with AI over the next 20 years in such that the AI component, whatever that may be, will automate a lot of the attack vectors we see today and make them even more scalable and lucrative for criminals to execute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, it comes back to cross-sector collaboration – if we create the right data flows, safeguards, and frameworks to share real-time risk data, we can defeat fraud.</p>

				  The ability to seamlessly share and trust information is the key to a new era of safe, secure travel.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Technology transformations start slowly and then seem to go so fast that they rapidly become just how things are done almost without noticing. When friction dissipates, we rapidly cross into a new normal. This is the case with decentralized identity. For years, people talked about what could be done with the technology, now companies are implementing it to drive digital transformation, with <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">air travel leading the way</a>.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks, our partner <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a> — the world’s leading specialist in air transport communications and information technology — will explain how decentralized identity is driving this transformation in digital travel, from border crossing to passenger loyalty programs to baggage and beyond.</p>
<p>Here, I’d like to give a brief overview of the technology. Most people have no idea what decentralized identity means let alone what it can do and why it will transform how we share data, prove our identities, enable privacy, do business, and — of course —&nbsp;travel.</p>
<p>Much like our physical landscape of roads, rail lines and rivers, we connect, digitally, through an infrastructure of APIs, databases, emails, SMS, and webpages. To share information, we need a way to travel from one point to another and an identity, like a passport, to prove who we are when we get there.</p>
<p>But our digital journeys are filled with friction and danger. Digital identity is easily faked, passwords are guessed, access credentials are stolen, databases are plundered, connections between disparate systems are complex and costly to create, you can’t be sure that information hasn’t been altered, and you don’t know who is tracking you or what they’re doing with your information. Security solutions like multifactor authentication and privacy solutions like GDPR just add more complexity, cost, and friction — and they don’t actually solve the underlying problems.</p>
<p>Our current system relies on checking in with a source to establish proof of identity or the veracity of data. You have multiple digital identities held as accounts accessed and verified by logins and passwords: multiple accounts for airlines, booking sites, hotels, event ticketing —&nbsp;in addition to employment, school, social services, utilities, ecommerce, and social media. The assumption is that when you need to use these services, you can prove you created your account. Sometimes, you can use one account for several services (as in social media logins), but all these accounts store personal data about you, making identity theft and fraud a constant risk and making data tracking a challenging privacy issue.</p>
<p>What if we could declutter this mess without having to rip it up and start over? What if we could take our digital landscape of roads and borders and identities and streamline it so that we can go from anywhere to anywhere — any system to any system — and prove that we are who we say we are and that the data we present hasn’t been altered?</p>
<p>This is what decentralized identity does.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity uses decentralized identifiers — a new global standard for identity — cryptography, and verifiable digital credentials to prove that you and only you are at one end of a secure communication and that the person or organization or device at the other end — your airline, bank, hotel, — can only be who they claim to be. A verifiable credential is like a digital container that can seal any kind of digital information. You always know the source of the container. You can’t alter the contents of the container without breaking the seal. If you trust the source of the container, you can trust the contents.</p>
<p>In practice, this means no more logins, passwords, third-party identity providers, multifactor authentication, or direct integrations. It means we can hold and share our data in a secure, consent-based way to anyone or any system with the software to verify it. It means our mobile devices can have the functionality of APIs but with a significantly better security profile.</p>
<p>Removing the key sources of data insecurity and identity fraud —&nbsp;centralized databases, user accounts and passwords— makes it a game changer. But there’s a bigger picture: The more easily information can be shared and the more it can be trusted, the faster and more efficient market decisions can be. This decluttering is a significant cost and time saver. Once information is issued in a verifiable format, it can be confidently reused over and over again.</p>
<p>At a certain point in this digital transformation, the combination of decreased friction and increased speed and scale will spark innovation. Think about how the telegraph went in a few decades from wiring messages over a few miles to enabling rail networks, expanding markets, and to wiring money.</p>
<p>This is the rapidly changing landscape we’re seeing as decentralized identity accelerates. <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-aruba-demonstrate-how-physical-passports-can-be-held-as-a-digital-identity-on-your-mobile-device/">Companies like SITA</a> see how a digital identity that can be trusted by governments everywhere can be used in myriad ways to simplify operations for airlines, airports, and passengers. As the technology can be easily integrated with any existing system, there’s no need for costly infrastructure upgrades. And, because data authentication, sharing, and consent is now technically easy, airlines and airports can integrate new partners to provide new services to passengers.</p>
<p>Because the technology frees airlines and airports from having to store and manage huge amounts of passenger personal data, it also makes compliance with emerging data protection and privacy policies like eIDAS, GDPR, CCPA, vastly simpler: companies don’t have to hold people’s personal data for verification. There is a genuine mechanism for people to consent to share their data.</p>
<p>We also see decentralized identity as essential to the successful deployment of AI (combating deepfakes) and, in the longer term, something that will have just as much, if not more, impact. This is because the ability to instantly and seamlessly trust identity and data simplifies markets and allows for much more complex interactions at minimal cost. Whenever, in history, people can trust each other to share information that can be trusted, we see rapid innovation and increasing prosperity.</p>
<p>In an age of fragmentation, mistrust, fraud, and friction, decentralized identity is both the solution we knew we urgently needed and the path to opportunities. Some of those opportunities are quickly coming into view: seamless digital travel will reshape the air travel, the tourist sector, and passenger experience, as SITA will explain.</p>
<p>But behind the absence of friction, the simplicity of authentication, the capacity to consent, and the respect for privacy, there’s a transformation in the way our data and our identities move, connect, and interact across digital infrastructure. That’s the hidden travel story, and it will change everything.</p>

<p>This week in the Boston Globe, Mike Orcutt writes about how old arguments over coding as free speech are being revisited.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/11/opinion/code-is-speech-tornado-cash/?s_campaign=8315">A First Amendment fight for the future of the internet: </a>Is computer code a form of speech? A case emerging from the wreckage of a cryptocurrency heist is putting that question to the test.</p>
<p>“[For] nearly three decades US courts have recognized software code as protected speech”,</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">crypto wars</a>” were raging in 1995 when I started in <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/library/pki/">PKI</a> (and “crypto” didn’t mean cryptocurrency at that time!).</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/about/">Bruce Schneier</a> first published his classic textbook “<a href="https://www.schneier.com/books/applied-cryptography/">Applied Cryptography</a>” in 1993, he was prohibited from including a floppy disk containing executable encryption programs. But the First Amendment enabled him to include the C code for the algorithms as appendices in the printed work. As a middle finger to the NSA, the publishers included extra indicia marks to make the pages easier for OCR.</p>
<p>The court ruling that printed human readable code could be distributed but executables could not became known as the “Terrorists Can’t Type” interpretation.</p>
<p>I can see the free speech nuance.</p>
<p>Some high-level programming is highly creative. There can be non-obvious ways to write a program; recursive solutions can be quite sublime for their elegance and the strange intuition needed to draft them. I suspect there might be an infinite number of possible programs to implement most given specifications, so it’s certainly plausible to see programming as a form of expression. [I’m using “program” here to mean code written in a high-level language such as Python, C++ or Lisp].</p>
<p>But OTOH at the machine level, code is literally just a matter of throwing switches. Compiled software in memory connected to a processor looks a lot like a machine; indeed, at that level, there is little or no difference between programmed and wired logic.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer but as I understand the right to free speech, I am largely free to write a book that describes bomb making for example, but I may not be allowed to make the bomb. So there are differences between text (and thought) and action. We can regulate actions but not thoughts.</p>
<p>Similarly, maybe the action of throwing switches is not protected. That is, compiled machine code is not speech. It’s certainly not the sort of speech that humans freely produce!</p>
<p>Both books and high-level computer programs are capable of being translated into actions.</p>
<p>Books can be read in different ways; a book about making a bomb doesn’t necessarily lead to the bomb being made let alone used. But there is only one intended reader of a computer program — the computer. And it’s only going to read the program one way.</p>

<p>Like most other global regions, European countries have strict guidelines and compliance standards regulating the activities of banks and financial service providers. Specifically in today’s digital world, the European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of enacting cybersecurity and data privacy regulations, more so than the rest of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, regulatory bodies like the EBA, ESMA, ESRB, EIOPA, and the European Commission have supported, proposed, and implemented Identity-centric legislation. This legislation helps to protect consumers’ digital identities while securing financial transactions and ensuring fairness and transparency throughout the markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll provide an overview of identity-centric regulations impacting the finance industry in Europe and the regulatory bodies that influence and oversee their implementation.</p>

   I have thoughts on FedCM and the challenges of creating a good technical specification. It's not that easy!

<p>The <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management API</a> (FedCM), a specification currently under development through the W3C’s standardization process, was originally scoped to make sure federated authentication would still function in a world where third-party cookies didn’t exist. The problem statement as defined during a workshop in 2021 stated it this way:</p>



<blockquote><p>Non-transparent, uncontrollable tracking of users across the web needs to be addressed and prevented.<br>Many applications and services need to work through the browser to support SSO/federated login, and yet federated login and tracking tools use the same features and are indistinguishable from the browser’s perspective.</p></blockquote>



<p>One of the ongoing challenges, however, is that people who implement and design federated authentication services don’t think of those services just in terms of cookies. As soon as you start talking about federated authentication, those people also think about all the different web primitives like website redirects and long URLs.</p>



 Balancing a Specification: Focus vs Practicality 



<p>Let’s step back for a moment and think about creating a technical specification. If you ask me (and it’s my blog, so I get to say) a good specification is focused on a very specific problem. If you try to solve too many things in one spec, you’re going to limit innovation, miss important use cases, or create something too complicated to implement.</p>



<p>That said, if you don’t consider how a spec will actually be implemented, it probably won’t be of any practical use. Solving for one piece of the larger architecture without any idea as to how the other pieces will be treated is as bad as creating too broad a spec.</p>



<p>A spec can and should allow for extensions as people find new use cases that need a solution, or profiles that tighten the spec down where required. But at its core, the problem being solved should be clear and specific.</p>



<p>That’s the challenge facing FedCM right now: staying within the scope of a very specific problem when people are Very Concerned about what else will need to change to prevent non-transparent, uncontrollable tracking of users across the web.</p>



 The FedCM Specification 



<p>Coming back to FedCM, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community Group</a> in the W3C just published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/2024/07/12/navigating-federated-authentication-the-scope-of-fedcm/">blog post</a> that talked about some of the problems FedCM doesn’t solve. (Full disclosure: I held the pen on that post as one of the co-chairs, with input from several members of the group.) FedCM originated from the need to preserve the functionality of third-party cookies when used in a federated authentication scenario. But there are more web primitives than cookies used for federated authentication. Should the specification consider those as well? Is it worth implementing at all if it doesn’t solve (or at least offer some direction) on how to handle the other web primitives (like redirects) that are also used for tracking on the web?</p>



<p>I think it comes down to a subtle lack of alignment and/or understanding of the problem being solved. Is FedCM supposed to solve for the deprecation of third-party cookies or is it supposed to solve for tracking across the web? When we first started, it was clearly just solving for the third-party cookie problem. Over time, however, there is confusion even within the groups working on the spec whether they are aiming for the larger problem.</p>



 Implementation Decisions 



<p>So, what are implementers to do? They could implement the specification (which, to be clear, is NOT a standard and does NOT have consensus yet in the groups working on it) to get ahead of what the browser vendors are doing, but have to deal with breaking changes as the spec evolves. They could wait and suddenly find out that their federated authentication infrastructure is breaking because they missed the latest changes as the specification gets closer to standardization.</p>



 Adapting to an Evolving Web 



<p>If there was an easy answer, we wouldn’t be talking about standards and tech. There are too many competing use cases, threat models, business considerations, and architectures to take into consideration. My only advice is to get involved in the standards process if you can or pay attention to developer sites (like <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fedcm-developer-newsletter">this one</a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/">this one</a>) and the people involved. The way the Internet and the web works is always evolving; designing your business or service to adapt to change is the only way to be successful.</p>



<p>I want to help you go from overwhelmed at the rapid pace of change in identity-related standards to prepared to strategically invest in the critical standards for your business.

  <p>Today, we <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> the general availability of the Microsoft Entra Suite which brings together identity and network access controls to secure access to any cloud or on-premises application or resource from any location. It consistently enforces least privilege access to achieve your governance requirements while improving your employee experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies today have good reason to focus on security. On one hand, we’re reaping the advantages of increased scalability, efficiency, and cost reductions, including all the benefits gained from generative AI’s large language models. However, these advantages also make it possible for malicious actors to exploit advanced technologies to create malware, target network vulnerabilities, and generate phishing attacks that put organizations’ data and reputations at higher risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When identity and network access solutions operate in isolation and not in tandem, they can lead to increased complexity, inconsistent policies, and a lack of unified context across standalone solutions. This can unintentionally result in a fragmented security posture and vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit, potentially disrupting business continuity and compromising the user experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither identity nor network security controls alone can protect all your access scenarios, highlighting the need for you to adopt a holistic strategy to counteract evolving threats and protect your critical assets—no matter where the users and resources are located.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The case for unified security: A strategic imperative 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the Microsoft Entra Suite general availability, we also <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution general availability, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>. These two products coupled with our SaaS security-focused CASB—<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-cloud-apps">Microsoft Defender for Cloud apps</a>—comprise Microsoft's Security Service Edge solution, a cloud-delivered, identity-centric networking model that transforms the way you secure access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE solution is all about helping you eliminate security gaps in your defenses, extending Conditional Access and continuous access evaluation to all your applications and resources, whether they’re on-premises or in any cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to any app or resource, from anywhere, with an identity-centric Security Service Edge (SSE) solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, in more detail, are the key advantages of Microsoft’s SSE solution to your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eliminate security loopholes caused by identity and network access silos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE Solution ensures that your <a href="https://sponsored.bloomberg.com/article/microsoft-security/Time-to-Break-the-Silos-Between-Identity-and-Network-Security">identity and network access solutions work together</a>. By unifying these separate elements, your security teams can bolster your organization’s security stance in the face of emerging threats. No more deciding which tool works for each app or how to bridge the policies your identity and network teams created. Now you can secure access with an easy-to-manage, unified, identity-centric approach to any application, resource, or destination—and not sacrifice user productivity due to complex, disjointed security controls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplify access and improve end user experience at a global scale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s SSE solution is delivered from one of the largest global private networks: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft’s Global Wide Area Network</a>. The network connects Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/">data centers</a> across 61 Azure regions with more than <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/global-network/#features">185 global network POPs</a> and a vast array of growing SSE edge locations strategically placed around the world. This helps you optimally connect your users and devices to public and private resources seamlessly and securely, improving performance and boosting productivity by offering your people a fast, consistent, hybrid work experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Activate side-by-side, flexible deployment options with other SSE and networking solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access can be deployed standalone or side-by-side with other SSE solutions. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-clients">Global Secure Access client</a> allows control over network traffic at the user endpoint device, giving you the ability to route specific <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/concept-traffic-forwarding">traffic profiles</a> through Microsoft’s SSE solution. The client for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client">Windows</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-android-client?tabs=device-administrator">Android</a> operating systems are now in general availability, and for iOS and Mac operating systems, in public preview. With flexible deployment options, the Global Secure Access client could acquire traffic based on the traffic forwarding profiles you configure for Private Access, Internet Access, and Microsoft traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you can configure Private Access profiles anywhere you replace your third-party legacy VPNs—with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution. You can also configure your Microsoft profile to enable improved performance for Microsoft applications, while you keep your private and internet traffic protected with the SSE solution of your choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A closer look at Microsoft Entra Private Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access is an identity-centric ZTNA solution that helps you secure access to all private apps and resources for your users—located anywhere.

  <p>Today we <a href="https://aka.ms/ZeroTrustBlog-July2024">announced</a> the general availability of Microsoft Entra Suite - the industry’s most comprehensive secure access solution for the workforce. The Microsoft Entra Suite delivers the most comprehensive Zero Trust user access solution and enables organizations to converge access policy engine across identities, endpoints, and private and public networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Microsoft Entra Suite?&nbsp; 
<p>The Microsoft Entra Suite delivers a complete cloud-based solution for workforce access. It brings together identity and network access that secures employee access to any cloud or on-premises application and resource from any location, consistently enforces least privilege access, and improves the employee experience.​&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new offering advances our vision for the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/31/secure-access-for-a-connected-worldmeet-microsoft-entra/">Microsoft Entra</a> product line that can serve as a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/08/how-implementing-a-trust-fabric-strengthens-identity-and-network/">universal trust fabric</a> for the era of AI, securely connecting any trustworthy identity with anything, from anywhere. In a recent blog post we also shared the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/06/04/the-four-stages-of-creating-a-trust-fabric-with-identity-and-network-security/">four stages</a> of creating such trust fabric for your organization, starting with foundational Zero Trust controls, and extending it to protecting access for your workforce, protecting access for your customers and partners, and protecting access in any cloud. The Microsoft Entra Suite delivers the complete toolset for the second stage of this journey – secure access for your workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra Suite includes the following products:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> – an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access that secures access to private apps and resources and reduces operational complexity and cost by replacing legacy VPNs.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a> – an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) for SaaS apps and internet traffic that protects against malicious internet traffic, unsafe or non-compliant content, and other threats from the open internet.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-governance">Microsoft Entra ID Governance</a> – a complete identity governance and administration solution that automates identity and access lifecycle to&nbsp;ensure that the right people have the right access to the right apps and services at the right time.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> – an advanced identity solution that blocks identity compromise in real time using high-assurance authentication methods, automated risk and threat assessment, and adaptive access policies powered by advanced machine learning (also included in Microsoft Entra ID P2).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a> - a managed verifiable credentials service based on open standards that enables real-time identity verification in a secure and privacy respecting way. Included in the Microsoft Entra Suite are premium Verified ID capabilities, starting with Face Check.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra Suite enables you to:&nbsp; 
 
 Unify Conditional Access policies for identities and networks.&nbsp; 
 Ensure least privilege access for all users accessing all resources and apps.&nbsp; 
 Improve the user experience for both in-office and remote workers.&nbsp; 
 Reduce the complexity and cost of managing security tools from multiple vendors.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the Microsoft Entra Suite introductory video below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unify Conditional Access policies for identities and networks&nbsp;</p>
<p>You only have to manage one set of policies in one portal to configure access controls for both identities and networks. Conditional Access evaluates any access request, no matter where it’s coming from, performing real-time risk assessment to strengthen protection against unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure least privilege access for all users accessing all resources and apps&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can automate the access lifecycle from the day a new employee joins your organization, through all their role changes, until the time of their exit. No matter how long or multifaceted an employee’s journey, Microsoft Entra ID Governance ensures that your employees have the right access to just the applications and resources they need, helping prevent an adversary’s lateral movement in case of a breach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improve the user experience for both in-office and remote workers&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can ensure that employees enjoy a faster and easier onboarding experience, faster and more secure sign-in via passwordless authentication, single sign-on for all applications, and superior performance. Using a self-service portal, your employees can request access to relevant packages, manage approvals and access reviews, and view request and approval history. Face Check with Microsoft Entra Verified ID enables real-time verification of your employee's identity, which streamlines remote onboarding and self-service recovery of passwordless accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the complexity and cost of managing security tools from multiple vendors&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since traditional on-premises security solutions don’t scale to the needs of modern cloud-first, AI-first environments, organizations are seeking ways to secure and manage their assets from the cloud. With the Microsoft Entra Suite, you can retire multiple on-premises security tools, such as traditional Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), on-premises Secure Web Gateways (SWGs), and on-premises identity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Suite is currently priced at $12 per user per month. Microsoft Entra P1 is a licensing and technical prerequisite. Please refer to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra Suite pricing page</a> for more detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, the cybersecurity world was rocked by another <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/06/snowflake-breach-exposes-165-customers.html">significant breach</a>, this time involving Snowflake, a major player in the data storage and analysis industry. The breach, orchestrated by the hacking group Shiny Hunters, exploited a weakness in customer account security, bypassing the need for a direct vulnerability within Snowflake’s platform itself.</p>
 What Happened? 
<p>The hackers managed to gain access by exploiting unencrypted usernames and passwords stored on a worker’s machine and in a project management tool called JIRA. These credentials were used to access several Snowflake customer accounts, including those of Ticketmaster and Santander. Shockingly, none of these accounts had multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, making it easier for the hackers to infiltrate.</p>
 The Data Compromised 
 
 The breach resulted in the theft of extensive customer data: 
 Over 30 million bank account details, including 6 million account numbers and balances. 
 28 million credit card numbers. 
 Personally identifiable information about staff. 
 
<p>Other potential victims mentioned by the hackers include LendingTree and Advanced Auto Parts, indicating the broad scope of this data theft.</p>
 Lessons Learned 
 
 Enable MFA: This breach underscores the critical importance of multi-factor authentication. Despite its limitations, MFA adds a crucial layer of security that can deter many unauthorized access attempts. 
 Secure Third-Party Access: The initial compromise occurred through a third-party contracting firm, emphasizing the need for robust security measures extending beyond your organization. Ensure that all third parties adhere to stringent security protocols. 
 Encrypt Sensitive Data: Unencrypted usernames and passwords were a key vulnerability. Encrypting sensitive data can prevent it from being easily exploited if accessed. 
 Awareness and Training: Regularly train and remind employees about security best practices, such as the importance of not storing unencrypted sensitive information on personal devices or project management tools. 
 
 Looking Forward 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we continually strive to enhance security and protect our clients from such breaches. While no system can be completely immune, implementing comprehensive security measures, including MFA and strong data encryption, can significantly mitigate risks.</p>
<p>As we navigate through the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, staying informed and proactive is crucial. The Snowflake breach serves as a reminder of the continuous need for vigilance in protecting sensitive data.</p>

  <p>The established players have vast resources and tend to leverage their global footprint to deliver projects in the North American market. These vendors support all known service offerings and IAM technologies along with a vast network of strong partnership with leading technology vendors. However, large firms come with their own set of challenges.</p>
<p>Boutique firms, on the other hand, are focused on specialized offerings as per their capacity. They have limited resources but are agile for that same reason. These firms can be very quick off the line to understand the project scope and provide initial support. Despite having these advantages over big firms, the boutique firms have their own set of challenges. However, there are certain vendors in North America that have limited resources compared to big firms, but they are successfully managing millions of identities and supporting most of the major IAM technologies.</p>
<p>Nitish Deshpande, Research Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will discuss the types of IAM systems integrators vendors in the north American market space. Additionally, Nitish will also address the role of systems integrators and some of their core capabilities. &nbsp;In his recent research, Nitish conducted a thorough analysis of the current vendor landscape and identifies industry leaders based on their commitment to innovation, market presence, and overall service capabilities.</p>

				  Biometrics are a powerful solution to identity authentication: but they also escalate the risks of data breaches into the realm of catastrophe: here’s how to solve the problem with decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>You can’t reset a person. That is, cosmetic surgery aside, you can’t reset the physically distinguishing and unique characteristics that make us who we are.</p>
<p>Which isn’t a problem, unless you create an identity system based on using these characteristics — aka biometrics — to authenticate access to high value information&nbsp; like bank accounts.</p>
<p>And, of course, that’s just what we’ve done. To address the inherent weaknesses of passwords, we’ve turned to deeper, probabilistically unique, identifiers like facial recognition, fingerprint scans, iris scans, and behavioral and vocal recognition.</p>
<p>In one important way, these are much better ways of authenticating access than passwords and pin codes simply because they are unique to the person seeking authentication. They provide confidence that a person is who they say they are in a way that passwords never could. They are also fast and approach the seamless interaction that people desire and systems require.</p>
<p>The way biometric data is stored should scare you</p>
<p>But in one critical respect,biometrics are much worse than passwords: they can’t be reset.</p>
<p>The way biometric data is used requires comparing a real-time scan of a particular biometric characteristic against stored data for that characteristic.</p>
<p>Therein lies the first of two problems: if the biometric data is stored in a centralized database, the risk of a data breach will never be zero. And if there is a data breach, it’s a privacy and security catastrophe. Fraudsters have access to your unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Now guess where biometric data are conventionally stored.</p>
<p>“Bring your own biometrics”</p>
<p>Verifiable credential technology provides a simple fix: it removes the need for centrally storing biometric data in order to facilitate authentication.</p>
<p>Instead, during onboarding, a person’s biometric data is captured by a relevant authority (e.g., a bank)&nbsp; in a biometric template. This biometric template is then issued as a verifiable credential, which the person holds in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>The credential is a unique cryptographic proof that their biometric data has been authenticated by the given authority. As the biometric data recorded in the template is digitally signed, any attempt to alter it will render the credential non-functional.</p>
<p>When the person performs a biometric scan, they also present their biometric template credential. Because of the way these presentations are made, only the person issued with the credential can present their credential. The biometric template in the credential is cryptographically verified as authentic and compared to the biometric scan.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>In this way, a person “brings their own biometrics” for authentication. The source of the credential is verified by the relying party —&nbsp;e.g., a bank can cryptographically verify that it had issued you and only you with this biometric credential, while digital signatures show that the biometric data has not been tampered with.</p>
<p>With no more than a couple of screen swipes, the problem of centralized biometric data disappears, and with it the nightmare of data privacy and protection and compliance.</p>
<p>In our next piece, we’ll look at the second problem with biometrics and authentication: how verifiable credentials can defend against the challenge of generative AI deepfakes.</p>

<p><br>In recent years, blockchain technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation with the potential to revolutionize various industries, particularly finance. One of the most promising applications of blockchain in the financial sector is asset tokenization. Asset tokenization refers to the process of representing ownership of real-world assets, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, or commodities, as digital tokens on a blockchain. This transformative approach not only enhances liquidity and accessibility but also introduces new opportunities for investment and innovation in global capital markets.</p>



<p>This post delves deep into the essence of asset tokenization, exploring its mechanisms, benefits, challenges, and future potential. By examining real-world examples and case studies, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how asset tokenization is reshaping the financial landscape and what it means for investors, institutions, and regulators.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Understanding Asset Tokenization 



 <br>What is Asset Tokenization? 



<p>Asset tokenization involves creating a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain. This process typically entails the issuance of digital tokens that represent ownership or a stake in the underlying asset. These tokens can be traded, transferred, and managed on blockchain platforms, enabling a more efficient and transparent way of handling assets.</p>



<p><br></p>



 How Does Asset Tokenization Work? 



<p>1. Identification of the Asset: The first step in asset tokenization is identifying the asset to be tokenized. This can include physical assets like real estate, precious metals, and artworks, as well as financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and derivatives.</p>



<p>2. Valuation and Structuring: Once the asset is identified, it is valued and structured for tokenization. This involves determining the total value of the asset and dividing it into smaller units or tokens. Each token represents a fraction of the total asset value.</p>



<p>3. Issuance of Tokens: The next step is issuing the tokens on a blockchain platform. These tokens are typically created using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.</p>



<p>4. Trading and Transfer: After issuance, the tokens can be traded and transferred on blockchain-based exchanges or platforms. This allows for seamless and instantaneous transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and minimizing transaction costs.</p>



<p>5. Ownership and Governance: The ownership of the tokens is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record of all transactions. Token holders may also have certain governance rights, such as voting on decisions related to the underlying asset.<br></p>







 <br>Benefits of Asset Tokenization 



 <br>Increased Liquidity 



<p>One of the primary benefits of asset tokenization is increased liquidity. Traditional assets, such as real estate or fine art, are often illiquid, meaning they cannot be easily bought or sold without significantly impacting their price. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy and sell smaller portions of an asset. This fractionalization makes it easier to match buyers and sellers, enhancing market liquidity.</p>



 <br>Fractional Ownership and Accessibility 



<p>Tokenization democratizes access to high-value assets by enabling fractional ownership. Investors can purchase tokens representing a fraction of an asset, lowering the barrier to entry and allowing more individuals to participate in the market. This increased accessibility can attract a broader range of investors, including those who may not have the financial resources to acquire entire assets.</p>



 <br>Transparency and Security 



<p>Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable ledger of all transactions, enhancing trust and security in the market. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, providing a clear and verifiable record of ownership and transfer. This transparency reduces the risk of fraud and ensures that all parties have access to consistent and up-to-date information.</p>



 <br>Efficiency and Cost Reduction 



<p>By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes, asset tokenization can significantly reduce transaction costs and improve efficiency. Traditional asset transactions often involve multiple intermediaries, such as brokers, custodians, and clearinghouses, each adding costs and delays to the process. Tokenization streamlines these processes by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions and automated settlement through smart contracts.</p>



 <br>Enhanced Regulatory Compliance 



<p>Blockchain’s transparent and immutable ledger facilitates enhanced regulatory compliance. Regulators can have real-time access to transaction data, enabling better oversight and quicker response to suspicious activities. Additionally, blockchain can simplify the compliance process by providing a single source of truth for all transactions, reducing the costs and complexities associated with regulatory reporting.</p>



 <br><br>Applications of Asset Tokenization 



 <br>Real Estate 



<p>Real estate is one of the most promising sectors for asset tokenization. Traditional real estate investments often involve significant capital outlay and lengthy transaction processes. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of real estate properties, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares of properties and enhancing liquidity in the market.</p>



<p>For example, a real estate developer can tokenize a commercial property, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership shares. Investors can purchase these tokens, gaining exposure to the property and earning a share of the rental income. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for seamless and instantaneous transactions.</p>



 <br>Art and Collectibles 



<p>The art and collectibles market is another sector that can benefit from asset tokenization. High-value artworks and collectibles are often illiquid, with few opportunities for investors to buy and sell shares. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of these assets, providing greater liquidity and accessibility.</p>



<p>For instance, a rare painting can be tokenized, with each token representing a fraction of the painting’s value. Investors can purchase tokens, gaining exposure to the artwork and participating in its potential appreciation. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for greater flexibility and liquidity in the market.</p>



 <br>Stocks and Bonds 



<p>Tokenization can also be applied to traditional financial assets, such as stocks and bonds. By representing these assets as digital tokens on a blockchain, investors can benefit from increased liquidity, transparency, and efficiency.</p>



<p>For example, a company can issue digital tokens representing shares of its stock. Investors can purchase these tokens, gaining exposure to the company’s equity and participating in its potential growth. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, enabling seamless and instantaneous transactions.</p>



<p>Similarly, bonds can be tokenized, with each token representing a fraction of the bond’s value. Investors can purchase tokens, earning interest payments and participating in the bond’s potential appreciation. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, providing greater liquidity and flexibility in the market.</p>



 <br>Commodities 



<p>Commodities, such as gold, silver, and oil, can also be tokenized, providing greater liquidity and accessibility for investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership of commodities, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares and participate in the market.</p>



<p>For instance, a gold producer can tokenize a portion of its gold reserves, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership shares. Investors can purchase these tokens, gaining exposure to the gold and participating in its potential appreciation. The tokens can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for seamless and instantaneous transactions.</p>



 <br>Future Outlook and Potential Developments 



 <br>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) 



<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging sector that leverages blockchain technology to create decentralized and open financial systems. DeFi platforms enable a wide range of financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and trading, without the need for traditional intermediaries.</p>



<p>Asset tokenization plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem by enabling the creation of digital assets that can be seamlessly integrated into DeFi platforms. Tokenized assets can be used as collateral for loans, traded on decentralized exchanges, and integrated into various DeFi protocols, enhancing liquidity and accessibility in the financial system.</p>



 <br>Security Tokens and STOs 



<p>Security tokens and security token offerings (STOs) represent a new paradigm in fundraising and investment. Security tokens are digital representations of traditional securities, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, issued and traded on a blockchain. STOs provide a regulated and compliant framework for issuing and trading security tokens, combining the benefits of blockchain technology with the regulatory compliance of traditional securities.</p>



<p>The proliferation of security tokens and STOs has the potential to transform capital markets by enhancing liquidity, reducing transaction costs, and democratizing access to investment opportunities. As regulatory frameworks evolve and market participants embrace innovation, security tokens are poised to play a significant role in the future of finance.</p>



 <br>Integration with Emerging Technologies 



<p>Blockchain technology can be integrated with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data, to create innovative solutions for asset management and trading. For example, AI can be used to analyze blockchain data and identify patterns and trends, providing valuable insights for investment strategies. IoT devices can generate real-time data that can be recorded on a blockchain, enhancing transparency and traceability in supply chain finance.</p>



 <br>Global Adoption and Collaboration 



<p>The future of asset tokenization depends on global adoption and collaboration among market participants, regulators, and technology providers. Building a standardized and interoperable framework for asset tokenization requires international cooperation and alignment of regulatory and technical standards.</p>



<p>Collaborative efforts can drive innovation, reduce fragmentation, and ensure the seamless integration of tokenized assets into the global financial system. As more countries and institutions recognize the potential of asset tokenization, the financial landscape is poised for significant transformation.</p>



 <br>Conclusion 



<p>Asset tokenization represents a revolutionary shift in how assets are managed, traded, and owned. By leveraging blockchain technology, asset tokenization enhances liquidity, accessibility, transparency, and efficiency in global capital markets. This transformative approach democratizes access to high-value assets, reduces transaction costs, and provides new opportunities for investment and innovation.</p>



<p>While challenges remain, such as regulatory compliance, technical infrastructure, and market adoption, the potential benefits of asset tokenization are significant. Real-world examples and case studies demonstrate the viability and advantages of tokenization across various asset classes, including real estate, art, stocks, bonds, and commodities.</p>



<p>As technology continues to evolve and market participants embrace innovation, asset tokenization is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of finance. The journey towards widespread adoption is ongoing, and the future holds exciting possibilities for the financial industry.</p>



<p>In the long term, asset tokenization has the potential to fundamentally alter the structure and operation of capital markets. By providing a more transparent, efficient, and secure framework, tokenization can enhance market integrity, reduce systemic risks, and create new opportunities for growth and development. As we move forward, the financial industry must navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by this transformative technology.</p>

<p>The Virtual Asset User Protection Act began its legislative journey in July 2023 and is set to take effect on the 19th of this month. As interest in this new law grows, we will delve into the background, detailed provisions, impact on Metadium, and future challenges of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act.</p><p>What is the Virtual Asset User Protection Act?</p><p>The primary aim of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act is to safeguard the assets of virtual asset users and systematically regulate unfair trading practices to enhance the transparency and stability of the virtual asset market. Over the past few years, virtual assets, or cryptocurrencies, have experienced rapid growth, attracting a surge of investors. However, this growth has been accompanied by an increase in hacking, fraud, and other illegal activities in virtual asset exchanges, leading to significant investor losses. The Virtual Asset User Protection Act was introduced to address these issues and protect&nbsp;users.</p><p>Detailed Provisions of the&nbsp;Act</p>  Protection of Customer&nbsp;Assets  <p>One of the most notable aspects of the Act is the requirement for domestic virtual asset exchanges, wallets, and custodians registered with the financial authorities to separate and safeguard customer deposits. These deposits, which investors entrust to exchanges for coin purchases, must be held separately in a bank. This ensures that even in the event of an exchange’s bankruptcy or business closure, the deposits can be safely returned to the investors via the bank. It is important to note that virtual assets held by exchanges are not protected in the same manner as deposits. In the case of exchange bankruptcy, investors’ virtual assets may still be subject to creditor claims and potential losses.</p><p>2. Enhanced Security and Prohibition of Unfair Trading Practices</p><p>The Act also targets unfair trading practices, such as market manipulation. Exchanges must establish systems for continuously monitoring abnormal transactions and report any suspicious activities to the financial authorities. Should the Financial Supervisory Service confirm illegal activities during investigations, the exchanges could face criminal charges and&nbsp;fines.</p><p>3. Information Disclosure and Reporting Obligations</p><p>Virtual asset businesses are required to disclose key management information periodically and report suspicious transactions to the authorities regularly. Exchanges must build systems for continuous monitoring and report any abnormal transactions to the financial authorities. Confirmed illegal activities will lead to criminal prosecution and&nbsp;fines.</p><p>Future Challenges</p><p>While the Virtual Asset User Protection Act represents a significant step towards a healthy market development, several challenges remain.</p>  Strengthening International Cooperation  <p>Given that virtual asset transactions frequently cross borders, international cooperation is essential. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has announced plans to incorporate global standards into regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) services, like Solana (SOL). Establishing and effectively enforcing regulations that align with global standards is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>2. Adapting to Technological Advancements</p><p>Virtual asset technology is rapidly evolving. Regulatory authorities must continuously update regulations to keep pace with technological advancements and flexibly respond to market&nbsp;changes.</p><p>3. Investor Education</p><p>Strengthening education programs to ensure investors properly understand virtual assets is vital. This will further enhance investor protection.</p><p>4. Continuous Monitoring</p><p>The dynamic nature of the virtual asset market necessitates ongoing monitoring. Regulatory authorities should regularly assess market conditions and take appropriate measures as&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Impact on Metadium: Positive or Negative?</p><p>Metadium is committed to diligently disclosing key information such as circulating supply, as mentioned in the Act, and is not involved in unfair trading practices or market manipulation. Therefore, it is likely to avoid immediate drastic impacts. However, implementing the Act is expected to reduce illegal or unfair activities, thereby enhancing the transparency and stability of the virtual asset market. This can positively contribute to the long-term value and growth of the Metadium Community.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The Virtual Asset User Protection Act, taking effect on July 19, will play a crucial role in enhancing the transparency and safety of the virtual asset market and protecting investors. Ultimately, the introduction of this legislation is expected to contribute to the healthy development of the virtual asset market. It is important to remain vigilant about ongoing trends and adapt to changes flexibly. As always, Metadium will strive to protect user assets and foster a healthy and stable market.

  <p>Howdy, folks! Today I'm excited to share the latest enhancements for Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA).&nbsp;CBA is a phishing-resistant, password less, and convenient way to authenticate users with X.509 certificates, such as PIV/CAC cards, without relying on on-premises federation infrastructure, such as Active Directory Federated Service (AD FS). CBA is particularly critical for federal government organizations that are already using PIV/CAC cards and are looking to comply with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/memo-22-09-meet-identity-requirements">Executive Order 14028</a>, which requires phishing-resistant authentication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're announcing the general availability of many improvements we&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/introducing-more-granular-certificate-based-authentication/ba-p/2365668">introduced earlier this year</a> – username bindings, affinity bindings, policy rules, and advanced CBA options in Conditional Access are all GA! I am also excited to announce the public preview of an exciting new capability - issuer hints. The issuer hints feature greatly improves user experience by helping users to easily identify the right certificate for authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Principal Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now walk you through these new features that will help you in your journey toward phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA).    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!    </p>
<p>Alex Weinert   </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through the new issuer hints feature, as well as the features that will go into general availability.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuer hints feature improves user experience by helping users to easily identify the right certificate for authentication. When enabled by tenant admin, Entra will send back <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6066#page-12">Trusted CA Indication</a> as part of the TLS handshake. The trusted Certificate Authority (CA) list will be set to subject of the Certificate Authorities (CAs) uploaded by the tenant in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-1-configure-the-certification-authorities">Entra trust store</a>. The client or native application client will use the hints sent back by server to filter the certificates shown in certificate picker and will show only the client authentication certificates issued by the CAs in the trust store. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Enhanced certificate Picker with issuer hints enabled</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also thrilled to announce the features below are going to be in general availability. You can read more about each of the features in detail in our public preview blog: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/enhancements-to-microsoft-entra-certificate-based-authentication/ba-p/1061417">Enhancements to Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication - Microsoft Community Hub</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings, which CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: IssuerAndSerialNumber, IssuerAndSubject, and Subject. More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-4-configure-username-binding-policy">Configure Username binding policy</a>.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding allows admins to set affinity binding at the tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today. More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#understanding-the-username-binding-policy">CBA Affinity Bindings</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multifactor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OID) or by combining the Issuer and OID). More at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-certificate-based-authentication#step-3-configure-authentication-binding-policy">Configure authentication binding policy</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced CBA options in Conditional Access allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy OIDs properties. More at <a href="https://aka.ms/authstrengthadvanceddocs">authentication strength advanced options</a>.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can learn more about Microsoft Entra CBA <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication">here</a> and Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/federal/CyberEO.aspx">Executive Order 14028</a>.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last year, we’ve seen many federal and regulated industry customers migrate off AD FS to Microsoft Entra ID seamlessly by leveraging staged migration and providing end users a familiar sign-in experience with CBA. In fact, in the last 12 months, we’ve seen an over 1400% increase in phishing-resistant authentication for United States government customers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep your feedback coming at <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra/bd-p/Azure-Active-Directory">Microsoft Entra Community</a>! We’re working diligently to bring more enhancements like the removal of limits on Certificate Revocation List (CRL), new certificate authority trust store, CBA support on the resource tenant for B2B external guest users, and iOS UX enhancements, to name just a few! </p>

<p>It has become more important than ever for stablecoin and token issuers to ensure they’re adopting appropriate risk detection and mitigation strategies within their ecosystems. With the stablecoin market expected to grow to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/09/stablecoin-market-to-grow-to-almost-3t-in-next-5-years-bernstein/">$2.8 trillion in the next five years</a> (up from $125 billion), along with new and proposed regulatory regimes emerging around the globe, issuers must be able to demonstrate to regulators that they understand who is utilizing their token or stablecoin and where financial crimes risks are stemming from.<br><br>This need is underscored by the increasing use of stablecoins by illicit actors. Stablecoins can prove attractive to illicit actors owing to a variety of factors&nbsp; such as the price stability they afford, transaction processing speeds, and their deep liquidity across multiple blockchains. Consequently, it is more important than ever for participants in the cryptoasset ecosystem to work to ensure that illicit actors aren’t exploiting stablecoin or token ecosystems.</p>

 IDnow InstantSign and eID eSign reduce the cost and complexity of contract signing 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, July 9, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, has launched two new <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">e-signature solutions</a> to the market. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/instantsign/">InstantSign</a> empowers financial businesses to innovate friction-heavy and lengthy signing processes, such as loan contracts, by way of a reusable identity, while eID eSign enables users to verify their identity and digitally sign contracts with the help of Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.</p>



 AML compliance redefined: QES without reverification 



<p>Existing solutions traditionally either require a new identity verification before a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> can be issued or the identification needs to be handled by the financial institution. IDnow’s latest signing solution InstantSign removes these obligations, allowing users who have already performed Anti-Money-Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification at onboarding to digitally sign contracts at a qualified level, with no additional integrations required and in accordance with European eIDAS regulations.</p>



<p>“Eliminating the requirement for reverification by reusing an existing identification significantly streamlines the process of issuing a QES in an AML-compliant e-signing journey. InstantSign has been proven to reduce drop-offs and accelerate contract completion. With physical signing processes sometimes taking days, our customers can now cut this to mere seconds with InstantSign, by foregoing the printing, signing and return process of a hard copy contract”, explains Vikas Seth, Chief Product Officer at IDnow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Additionally, if reverification is needed due to an expired identity document, InstantSign works seamlessly with IDnow’s entire range of identity verification solutions from automated and hybrid, to video, thus keeping identity data up-to-date, and providing a compliant solution for financial services organizations.”</p>



 eID eSign – Fast verification and secure signing thanks to NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>eID eSign allows end customers to quickly verify their identity and digitally sign contracts remotely. In less than a minute, users can verify themselves by utilizing compliant and secure NFC technology, for a QES that is the legal equivalent to a wet-ink signature on the Level of Assurance (LoA) High. IDnow’s eID eSign solution currently works with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card</a>, residence permit or EU citizen card, using a secure, compliant NFC chip readout of these documents. It expands IDnow’s existing signing solution portfolio and complements the available identity verification methods for various types of signatures with solutions like VideoIdent, AutoIdent and IDCheck.io.</p>



<p>“With eID eSign, our customers can future-proof their offering according to the German AML laws (GwG) and the European eIDAS regulations. The use of the NFC chip reduces the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access while cutting costs associated with printing, storage and manual handling of documents. Both solutions propel us and our customers into the next stage of compliance digitalization,” concludes Seth. &nbsp;</p>

The solution to password attacks—still the most common attack vector for compromising identities—is to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa">turn on multifactor authentication (MFA)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as more customers do the right thing with MFA, actors are going beyond password-only attacks. So, we’re going to publish a series of articles on how to defeat more advanced attacks, starting with token theft. In this article, we’ll start with some basics on how tokens work, describe a token theft attack, and then explain what you can do to prevent and mitigate token theft now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tokens 101&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we get too deep into the token theft conversation, let’s quickly review the mechanics of tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A token is an authentication artifact that grants you access to resources. You get a token by signing into an identity provider (IDP), such as Microsoft Entra ID, using a set of credentials. The IDP responds to a successful sign-in by issuing a token that describes who you are and what you have permission to do. When you want to access an application or service (we’ll just say app from here), you get permission to talk to that resource by presenting a token that’s correctly signed by an issuer it trusts. The software on the client device you’re using takes care of all token handling behind the scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Basic token flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first token you get, called a session token, shows that you successfully signed into the IDP, and how you signed in. When you sign into an app, it can exchange that session token for an access token, which gives you access to a specific resource for a certain amount of time without having to reauthenticate. To use an analogy, think of an amusement park. The IDP is the ticket office, which issues a park pass that provides credits for different rides. If you want to go on the roller coaster, you go to the ticket office, show your season park pass, and receive a ticket for that ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as you might be able to buy a day pass, season pass, or lifetime pass to the park, each token has a lifetime, usually between one and 24 hours. And just as a 12-month season pass may get you a one-day pass to a specific ride, session tokens can have different—and usually much longer—lifetimes than access tokens. Moreover, access token lifetimes can differ, so the roller coaster pass may last an hour while the Ferris wheel pass is good for an entire day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditionally, longer lifetimes are more convenient for users and more resilient against potential IDP outages (they save round trips to the IDP and associated latency) but riskier, while shorter lifetimes are safer (the IDP checks the integrity of the request more often). Technologies such as continuous access evaluation provide continuous assessment, so a shorter token lifetime isn’t a benefit when these are in place. When a token expires or continuous access evaluation reports heightened risk, the client goes back to the IDP and requests a refresh. This process is typically invisible to users, but if a risk condition has changed, and your organization policy requires it, then you may have to reauthenticate and get a new token. One last thing to note: while it’s a bummer to lose your roller coaster ticket, it’s really bad to lose your season park pass. An attacker can use your roller coaster ticket to get on a single ride for a short while, but with your season park pass, they can get on any ride for as long as they want. It’s similar with which, if stolen, give an actor a lasting ability to get access tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How token theft works 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attackers steal tokens so they can impersonate you and access your data for as long as that stolen token lives. To do this, they get access to where a token is stored (on the client, in proxy servers, or in some cases in application or network logs) to acquire it and replay it from somewhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Access token</p>


<p>Individual ride ticket</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an attacker steals your session token, it’s like picking your pocket after you’ve purchased your all-access season park pass at the fair’s ticket office. Because a token is digital, token theft is like stealing the pass from your pocket, making a photocopy, and then putting the original back in your pocket. The attacker can use their copy of your session token to get unlimited new access tokens to keep stealing your data, just as they can show a copy of a valid park pass to keep getting on rides without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attacker stealing your access token is comparable to someone stealing your ride ticket as you stand in line. They do the same copy-and-replace trick, using their copy of your token to access the resource, just as they could show a copy of a valid ticket to get on an individual ride without paying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because in both cases the attacker puts the original pass or ticket back in your pocket, you don’t even know an attacker is riding the rides in your name. Your token seems fine, even though an attacker is using an illegitimate copy of it, and it may take a while to determine that anything is amiss—if you ever do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso stores all their documents in a secure cloud storage service and requires all employees to verify their identity using MFA before accessing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, after starting their workday by signing into Contoso's cloud storage service, a user inadvertently installed malware on their device by clicking on a malicious 'phishing' link sent to them via email. The malicious code copied the user's session token and sent it to the attacker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then used the stolen and MFA-validated session token, now copied to their machine, to gain access to Contoso's environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The attacker then downloaded as many documents as they could access, including a bunch of confidential reports, and leaked them on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use of malware on the client to acquire the token is one common, easy method for attackers. Other tactics used to steal tokens include:</p>
 
 Copying tokens from the network as they pass through a proxy or router that the attacker controls. 
 Extracting tokens from unsecured server logs of the relying party. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While token theft still constitutes fewer than 5% of all identity compromises, incidents are growing. alone, we detected 147,000 token replay attacks, a 111% increase year-over-year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IDPs and clients should handle tokens as securely as possible by only transmitting them over encrypted channels and not storing them in the open. But if an attacker infiltrates the device or network channel as in the example above, they can steal tokens and use them until they expire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, a token would only work when used from the device to which it was issued. That is, if replayed from a different device, such as one an attacker controls, they would be rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A key part of Microsoft’s protections against token theft is the use of tokens that are cryptographically tied to the device they own. This is often called token binding, but may also be called sender constrained tokens, or token proof of possession. Token protection makes it harder to execute the main types of attacks designed to steal tokens, including network-based attacks and those using malware on the device by restricting use of the stolen token from devices they weren't issued to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra, token protection binds tokens to cryptographic keys specific to the device and ties them to the device registration. Once developers enable their applications to use protected tokens, you can enforce an Entra Conditional Access policy that requires client applications to use protected tokens to access a service. This policy rejects tokens which are not cryptographically tied to the device they were issued to. In the theme park analogy, this is like the ticket office taking your picture and printing it on your ride ticket and requiring ride operators to match the picture to your face before letting you ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a large project, spanning operating system platforms, native and web applications, all our cloud services, and the full range of different tokens in use for each case. It will be released in stages for specific scenarios. The first stage, in public preview now, protects the sign-in session tokens that native applications on Windows devices use when accessing Exchange, SharePoint and Teams services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection policy is available for Windows clients today. We’ll support Azure management scenarios and web applications that access Microsoft 365 resources and extend our cross-platform capabilities to Mac, iOS, Android, and other clients over the next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Practical steps for countering token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token protection will offer the strongest protection against token theft; however, it will take the industry time to update all applications to use bound tokens. The good news is that Microsoft offers compelling countermeasures against attacks involving token theft that you can use today to reduce their risk and impact. We recommend a systematic defense-in-depth approach:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft. 
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens. 
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reduce the risk of successful token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of defense is to reduce the chances of attackers stealing tokens in the first place, and below are some well-established techniques for building it. It’s the equivalent of keeping your ride tickets and park passes safe from pickpockets while you’re in the theme park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require managed and compliant devices. Use device management and define Conditional Access policies to require that users access resources from a compliant device. Compliance policies we recommend to reduce the risk of successful token theft from devices include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 To help prevent accidental infection with token-stealing malware, require users running on Windows to run as standard users rather than with device admin rights and require that all devices run up to date anti-malware and virus tools. 
 Use storage encryption to protect device content, including tokens, in case someone steals the device itself. 
 Enable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to help protect Entra ID tokens in LSA memory. LSA protection is on by default for new devices and can be enabled for other devices via Intune. 
 Use jailbreak or rooting detection for mobile devices. Jailbroken devices are more likely to expose tokens and cryptographic secrets to potential attacks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn on Credential Guard for your Windows users. If your users are running Windows 10 or later, you can prevent theft of Active Directory credentials by configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/?source=recommendations">Credential Guard</a>, which uses virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate local and cached credentials so that only privileged system software—and not malware—can access them. Starting in Windows 11, version 22H2, Credential Guard is on by default for devices that meet requirements. This also helps protect cloud applications and resources when hybrid-joined devices using Active Directory authentication initiate a session to access cloud applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for enabling credential guard in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/configure?tabs=intune#enable-credential-guard">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Prevent malicious use of stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While device management and strong credentials certainly reduce the risk of token theft, not everyone has them, and they’re still not completely foolproof. The next layer of defense is to prevent attackers from using stolen tokens for ongoing access by configuring policies to reject them wherever possible, and by detecting attempted use and responding automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Require token protection in Conditional Access, and where possible, choose apps and services that use token protection. Microsoft is updating our apps, identity provider, and operating systems to support token protection, so if you’re using our apps and platforms, be sure to use the latest versions. Then configure Conditional Access to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756">require token protection for sign-in sessions</a> so only applications and devices using bound sign in session tokens, which can’t be used if they’ve been stolen and moved to another device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating a Conditional Access policy that requires token binding in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-token-protection#create-a-conditional-access-policy">our documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a risk policy to disrupt token theft in your environment automatically. When a user initiates a session or attempts to access an application, ID Protection will examine user and session risk factors to see if any have changed. Configure Conditional Access policies to protect both medium and high-risk sessions by either challenging users with MFA or by <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/prompt-users-for-reauthentication-on-sensitive-apps-and-high/ba-p/4062703">requiring reauthentication</a>. This will make it difficult or impossible for an attacker to initiate a session using a stolen session token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wherever available, <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)</a> can automatically invalidate tokens when ID Protection raises the risk for a user or a service principal. This triggers the risk-based Conditional Access policies to mitigate in real-time, requiring re-authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for creating risk-based Conditional Access policies in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the risk of token reuse by restricting sessions for use within network boundaries. Most attackers use stolen tokens from untrusted IP addresses. You can establish network boundaries with policies that prevent users from accessing your resources if they’re coming from unknown locations or from known bad locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrict networks with Entra Conditional Access:&nbsp;Conditional Access includes controls that will block requests from outside a network compliance boundary that you define. This will prevent an attacker from refreshing a stolen Entra token, restricting its use to the lifetime of the token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for defining a network compliance boundary with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhance network controls with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution</a>: To prevent the attacker from using a token outside of a trusted network at all, Entra Internet Access and Entra Private access use agents installed on endpoints and a compliant network check (enforced in real-time via CAE) to verify whether a user is connecting from a trusted network. Find step-by-step instructions for enabling compliant network check with Conditional Access in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAE-capable applications and services such as Teams, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online will continuously enforce the IP-based named location Conditional Access policies and compliant network policies to ensure that tokens can be used only from trusted networks to access services. CAE offers a strict location enforcement mode to maximize protection. Find the step-by-step instructions for enabling this in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revoke tokens using Continuous Access Evaluation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring that the supported services can only be accessed from trusted locations, <a href="http://aka.ms/cae">CAE</a> can revoke tokens when admins (or users themselves) take action in response to detecting an account compromise or token theft. These include disabling accounts, changing passwords, and revoking refresh tokens. Learn more about Continuous Access Evaluation in <a href="https://aka.ms/CAE">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Be prepared to detect and investigate attacks that use stolen tokens 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender to monitor for token theft. When a threat actor replays a token, their sign-in event can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-types-and-detection">trigger detections</a>&nbsp;such as ‘anomalous token’ and ‘unfamiliar sign-in properties’ from both Entra ID Protection and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#premium-detections">Premium detections</a> recognize abnormal characteristics such as an unusual token lifetime, a token played from an unfamiliar location, or token attributes that are unusual or match known attacker patterns. Signals from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) can indicate a possible attempt to access the Primary Refresh Token.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find step-by-step instructions for investigating token theft in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/operations/token-theft-playbook#investigations">our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pull all your data into one Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), such as Microsoft Sentinel, to investigate potential token theft. If you receive an alert for an event that may indicate token theft, you can investigate it in the Microsoft Sentinel portal or in another SIEM. Microsoft Sentinel gives you important details about a specific incident, such as its severity, when it occurred, how many entities were involved, which events triggered it, and whether it reflects any MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics or techniques. You can then view the investigation map to understand the scope and root cause of the potential security threat.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest issue of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we explore recent regulatory developments in the European Union and Turkey, examining their potential impacts on the crypto industry.</p> MiCA’s Stablecoin Regulations Are Now in Effect in the&nbsp;EU <p>The implementation of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">the Markets in Crypto-assets Regulations (MiCA)</a> will occur gradually in the European Union. For example, the stablecoin-related regulations have been in effect since June 30. Additional regulations impacting crypto asset service providers (CASPs) <a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/eu_tfr">will follow in December this&nbsp;year</a>.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/chrotania/status/1807362060948242618">Image Source</a>)<p>One immediate effect of MiCA is the psychological shift it brings, dispelling doubts about the legitimacy of crypto businesses within the EU. After all, the regulations eliminate uncertainties regarding the future of crypto in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Focus on Stablecoins <p>On the downside, MiCA also introduces market disruptions. Take Stablecoins, for example. They now must comply with stringent new requirements, which may lead to delisting non-compliant stablecoins from EU-based exchanges. Already, Uphold has delisted six stablecoins, including Tether USDT, the most dominant stablecoin globally.</p><p>Such moves might push issuers to exit the EU market altogether or transition towards euro-backed stablecoins.</p> Crypto Regulations Just One Step Away from Implementation in&nbsp;Turkey <p>Turkey passed a major crypto bill in the Turkish Grand National Assembly on June 27, 2024. This new law increases oversight of digital assets with strict penalties for non-compliance.</p> Key Provisions and Oversight <p>The bill gives control of crypto oversight to Turkey’s financial watchdog, the Capital Markets Board, which will also license digital asset exchanges. Crypto service providers must ensure that customer fund transfers are accessible and traceable by law enforcement.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/CaghanTansel/status/1806659610268283349">Image Source</a>)<p>Platforms that break these rules will face fines from $7,500 to $182,600 and prison terms of up to five years. The Capital Markets Board can also approve audit firms for digital asset companies and temporarily shut down non-compliant platforms.</p> Next Steps <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is expected to approve the bill soon. Once approved, it will be published in the Official Gazette or returned to parliament for further&nbsp;review.</p> Implications for the Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>The EU’s MiCA regulations aim to bring clarity and stability, which could attract more investors. Turkey’s strict rules and penalties, on the other hand, are intended to build trust and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>As both regions update their rules, the global crypto market is watching closely. It’s important for everyone in the crypto industry to stay informed and adapt to these&nbsp;changes.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/carret-integrates-shyft-veriscope-to-comply-with-fatf-travel-rule">Carret Integrates Shyft Veriscope to Comply with FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-compliance-guide-for-gibraltar">FATF Travel Rule Compliance Guide for Gibraltar</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-liechtenstein">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Liechtenstein</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-crypto-travel-rule-adoption-6-month-status-update">FATF Crypto Travel Rule Adoption: 6-Month Status&nbsp;Update</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

Building a Personal Data Bridge to enable Personal&nbsp;AI<p>We are excited to announce that Verida is building a “Personal Data Bridge” to enable user data to be unlocked from centralized platforms and made available for a new generation of personal AI applications and web3 applications that require user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Our personal data today is locked in centralized databases controlled by big tech, banks, healthcare providers, and governments. Verida is building the necessary infrastructure and tools to help individuals extract their data from these platforms and then use it for exciting new use cases such as personal&nbsp;AI.</p> Unlocking User&nbsp;Data <p>Verida is building the critical infrastructure to enable users to reclaim their personal data from any centralized platform, securely store it on decentralized database infrastructure and provide the tools to consent to the use of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>This unlocks user data to be integrated into the next generation of hyper-personal applications such as AI agents and disruptive user-centric web3 applications.</p><p>Flow of data from centralized web3 platforms, to user control, through to personal AI applications</p><p>The Personal Data Bridge is the connective tissue between centralized web2 platforms and end users, enabling them to easily take ownership and control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Personal Data Bridge consists of a Data Connector API with corresponding framework for integrating with centralized APIs, along with a user interface in the Verida Vault for end users to easily connect, disconnect and configure the data they pull from centralized platforms.</p><p>Verida’s personal data bridge opens up numerous possibilities:</p>  DeFi: Private and reusable on-chain credentials for KYC and credit scores, enabling under-collateralized lending and insurance products.  Healthcare: AI-powered personalized care with secure messaging and follow-up processes.  Metaverse: Portable personal profiles and player data across games and&nbsp;guilds.  AI: Personalized AI products that have access to a digital twin for highly personalized interactions  <p>These applications highlight the potential of combining decentralized identity, user-owned data, and crypto assets to create a more user-centric internet.</p><p>Verida’s approach to off-chain data storage is designed for privacy, speed, and security. Data is stored in encrypted databases, inaccessible to unauthorized users, and transactions are recorded quickly without waiting for network confirmations. This method reduces the risk of data breaches and provides a seamless user experience.</p> Data Connections in the Verida&nbsp;Vault <p>The Verida Vault is currently in development and will be made available in Q3 2024. It provides an easy web interface for users to manage their personal data, connect to third party applications, and pull their data from centralized platforms.</p><p>Mockup of the user interface for the Verida Personal Data Bridge in the Verida Vault web application</p><p>Users can pull their personal data from platforms such as Meta, Google, X, Email, LinkedIn, Strava, and much more. This data is encrypted and stored in a user-controlled personal data Vault on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Users can accept data access requests from third party applications, allowing them to connect their personal data with emerging personal AI applications.</p> Data Connector API <p>The Verida Data Connector API is currently in development and will be made available in Q3 2024. It is a secure web service that enables a user to authenticate with a centralized platform to take ownership of their personal data stored with that service, to be stored, encrypted in the user’s personal data&nbsp;vault.</p><p>This API will operate within Verida’s recently announced self-sovereign confidential compute infrastructure, ensuring user data is not visible to any infrastructure operator and is protected at all times in the data lifecycle.</p><p>The data migration status of each connector is tracked, so data can regularly synchronize and be kept up-to-date as new information becomes available. As such, this creates a near real time stream of data flowing into a user’s personal data&nbsp;vault.</p><p>User data is mapped into common data schemas to create an ecosystem of interoperable data. For example, social media posts from X, Facebook and LinkedIn are merged into a common “social post” schema for easy integration.</p><p>All user data is signed, so it can be independently verified to have originated from a particular third party platform.</p><p>The Data Connector API is built on an open framework, enabling any developer to contribute new connectors for centralized platforms. In this way, we can rapidly scale the number of data sources available for end users and maximize the volume of personal data users can take ownership of.</p> Unlocking Innovation and Mass Adoption for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Centralized platforms have a monopoly over how your data is used, with any innovation or products using your data limited to what those platforms build.</p><p>The future of web3 depends on the growth of user adoption and application development.

<p>Offer a new <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/digital-identity-standards-development-services/">service</a> for digital identity standards development, and suddenly, everyone has questions! (This makes me so happy! I love questions!) So, let’s look at why I think offering a service to inform executives about what’s happening in the digital identity standards space is a good idea.</p>



<p>I’m making a few assumptions as to why this service is valuable:</p>



 
 Executives aren’t opposed to conforming to standards, but they need a more structured way to understand when and how to assign resources to make the standards work for their products. 



 The standards process needs more input to ensure that the standards in question serve the critical use cases worldwide. 



 Engineers and standards architects are brilliant, but they can either engage in or facilitate the process, and they (usually) can’t do both. 
 



<p>Basically, whether it’s due to resource constraints, a lack of specific expertise, or simply the rapid pace at which changes occur, many organizations are unsure of how to engage effectively without overcommitting valuable resources. I want to help with that.</p>



 Let’s Talk Inspiration 



<p>Throughout my nearly 15 years working closely with Internet standards development efforts, I’ve seen brilliant engineers and busy executives struggle to juggle (heh, rhymes!) their day-to-day responsibilities with the necessity of staying aware of and (when necessary) influencing Internet standards. As much as the people who live and breathe standards development would prefer it otherwise, not every organization is ready, willing, or able to engage in standards development fully. Yet, staying on the sidelines isn’t a viable option either if you want to ensure that emerging standards will work for, and not against, your business interests.</p>



<p>If I were the queen of the universe, resources would magically appear; enough people with the right skills would be engaged in developing standards. I am not, however, queen of the universe (give me time). So, is there any part of this problem that I can solve? What if I could summarize what’s going on for people who need information that will let them decide when they need to engage? At the same time, can I act as a neutral party to help facilitate the process so that it runs as smoothly as possible while still including outreach to encourage participation and consensus?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



 Why A Digital Identity Standards Development Service Helps 



<p>My area of interest is in the digital identity space. I am actively engaged in the APIs under development in the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Working Groups</a>. I’m also kicking off as co-chair of the IETF’s Secure Patterns for Internet Credentials (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/spice/about/">spice</a>) working group. Those are the areas I can immediately help an executive learn more about. If your organization has services that use federated authentication via a web browser or if they are interested in potential work on credentials to be used by both human and non-human identities, then these topics should be of interest.</p>



<p>And let’s be clear: I’m not here to push any specific solutions or architectures. Instead, I focus on providing the information your team needs to make decisions that align with your business goals.</p>



<p>There are undoubtedly other digital identity-related standards out there that may also be of interest. Adding more to my plate would involve a conversation.</p>



 Making the Case 



<p>If you need language to make the case internally for the services I’m building, this might help.</p>



<p>My Digital Identity Standards Development Service will help you:</p>



 
 Stay Informed by keeping track of critical developments without needing to sift through every detail of the standards discussion. 



 Save Resources by concentrating your efforts and resources on areas that impact your business the most without spreading your team too thin. 



 Make Strategic Decisions by applying insights and expert analysis. This will enable you to decide when and how to engage effectively, ensuring you’re always a step ahead. 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>If you’ve read this far and haven’t clicked on the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/digital-identity-standards-development-services/">direct link</a> to the page describing this new service in detail, now’s a good time for that! If you and your organization feel overwhelmed by the prospect of keeping up with Internet standards, or if you’ve struggled to figure out how to engage without overcommitting resources, this service is designed for you. It’s about strategic engagement and ensuring that you do so with the maximum impact and minimum fuss when you choose to engage.</p>

<p>The pharmaceutical industry plays a pivotal role in safeguarding public health by ensuring the timely and reliable distribution of life-saving medications worldwide. However, the <a href="https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_intelligence/Supply_chain_challenges_in_2023_1490638#:~:text=Not%20only%20this%2C%20but%202023,%2C%20components%2C%20services%20or%20software.">complexities of the global pharmaceutical supply chain are increasing</a>, and the industry is facing several critical challenges that demand immediate attention. This article delves into the top four critical challenges confronting pharmaceutical supply chains today.</p>
 Supply Chain Resilience 
<p>Pharmaceutical supply chains are grappling with an ever-increasing need for resilience. Events like the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed vulnerabilities in the supply chain, demonstrating the urgency of having robust contingency plans in place. Supply chain disruptions due to natural disasters, political instability, or health crises can lead to drug shortages, jeopardizing patient well-being.</p>
<p>Building resilience entails diversifying sources of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), and finished products. Companies must also invest in data analytics and demand forecasting tools to predict and prepare for potential disruptions. Collaborative efforts across the industry to share information and resources during crises can further bolster supply chain resilience.</p>
 Regulatory Compliance and Quality Control 
<p>The pharmaceutical industry operates under stringent regulatory frameworks designed to ensure product safety, efficacy, and quality. Compliance with these regulations is paramount, yet it poses a significant challenge for supply chains. The intricacies of regulatory requirements vary across regions, necessitating harmonization efforts to simplify compliance.</p>
<p>Quality control is another critical aspect. Ensuring that each batch of medication meets the highest standards demands rigorous testing and monitoring throughout the supply chain. Any deviations can result in product recalls, financial losses, and reputational damage. Innovations in technology, such as blockchain and real-time monitoring, are helping companies maintain better control over the quality and authenticity of their products.</p>
 Cold Chain Management 
<p>Many pharmaceutical products, particularly vaccines and biologics, require strict temperature control throughout the supply chain. The maintenance of a cold chain is essential to preserving the efficacy of these products. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when dealing with global distribution, as variations in climate and infrastructure can affect temperature-sensitive medications.</p>
<p>To address this issue, pharmaceutical companies must invest in advanced cold chain logistics, temperature-monitoring devices, and packaging technologies. Ensuring the integrity of the cold chain is not only a matter of compliance but also a critical factor in patient safety and the overall success of pharmaceutical supply chains.</p>
 Counterfeiting and Supply Chain Security 
<p>Counterfeit pharmaceuticals pose a grave threat to public health and the reputation of the pharmaceutical industry. Criminal networks continuously devise sophisticated methods to infiltrate the supply chain and distribute fake medications. This challenge is exacerbated by the global nature of pharmaceutical supply chains, which involve multiple intermediaries and complex distribution networks.</p>
<p>To combat counterfeiting and enhance supply chain security, the industry is turning to innovative technologies like serialization, track-and-trace systems, and blockchain. These solutions – such as <a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">ARTiFACTS Verify</a> – create transparency and traceability, making it easier to identify and remove counterfeit products from the supply chain. Collaboration among stakeholders, including governments, law enforcement, and pharmaceutical companies, is crucial in addressing this challenge effectively.</p>
 Technology solutions to pharma’s critical challenges 
<p>The pharmaceutical supply chain is at a crossroads, facing numerous critical challenges that demand immediate attention and innovative solutions. Supply chain resilience, regulatory compliance, cold chain management, and counterfeiting are among the top concerns that must be addressed to ensure the continued availability and safety of essential medications.</p>
<p>To navigate this complex landscape successfully, pharmaceutical companies need to invest in advanced technologies, strengthen collaboration across the industry, and adapt to evolving regulatory requirements. The ultimate goal is to safeguard public health by maintaining a secure, efficient, and reliable pharmaceutical supply chain that can withstand unforeseen disruptions and deliver life-saving medications to those who need them most. By tackling these challenges head-on, the pharmaceutical industry can continue to fulfill its vital mission in the years to come.</p>

			 What is the Electronic Seal and What Function Does It Serve? 		 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is the Electronic Seal? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The electronic seal is a digital technology that confirms the authenticity, integrity, and origin of the digital documents to which it is attached. It is regulated by the EU eIDAS Regulation (910/2014), which describes it as a set of data in electronic form, logically associated with other digital data to guarantee the origin and integrity of the document. Considered the digital equivalent of a physical stamp, the electronic seal provides certification of provenance and protection against unauthorized alterations.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Qualified Electronic Seal (QeSeal) 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>The qualified electronic seal represents the most secure and reliable form of seal available according to the eIDAS regulation. This type of seal is particularly suitable for organizations that need to ensure the integrity and authenticity of their digital documents at a high level of security. A qualified electronic seal is generated using a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD). These devices are designed to be highly secure and resistant to tampering attempts, ensuring that the seals created are robust and secure.<br>• Certification and Compliance:<br>Each qualified electronic seal is supported by a qualified certificate, issued by a recognized certification authority. The certificate contains the identifying information of the legal entity responsible for the seal, ensuring transparency and traceability. Compliance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation ensures that these seals are recognized and accepted in all EU member states.<br>• Practical Applications:<br>The qualified electronic seal is used in a variety of business contexts, ensuring the security of important documents such as contracts, statements, and administrative documentation. It is frequently used in regulated sectors such as banking, insurance, healthcare, and the public sector, where the need to protect sensitive information is particularly critical.<br>• Strategic Advantages:<br>Adopting the qualified electronic seal allows companies to improve operational efficiency, reduce the risk of document fraud, and enhance trust in electronic transactions. Its implementation can significantly reduce operational costs associated with managing paper documents, contributing to the digital transformation of the company.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How to Obtain It 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>To obtain an electronic seal, an organization must undergo a rigorous verification process by a certification authority recognized by AgID. InfoCert is one of the leading providers recognized in Europe for the qualified validation of electronic seals, enabling German companies to use such seals for various applications, including registration with the European EPREL database for product energy classification.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>We’ve been hearing about Zero Trust and that “identity is the new perimeter” for years. Maybe it’s time to say, “identity is a perimeter”, because even though network perimeters are porous, they still exist. There is a growing awareness of the centrality of identity and access management in the larger field of IT security. This is because so many cyber-attacks leverage digital identities. This has led to increased emphasis and spending on IAM, beyond just the full IAM suite solutions. For example, we see higher quality and more user-friendly modular solutions for multi-factor (and passwordless) authentication, fine-grained authorization, privileged access management, and identity governance and lifecycle management, often delivered as cloud-hosted services.</p>
<p>The need for identity security was evidenced at our recent European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference, where <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/173">our track on identity security</a> was well attended. We had speakers addressing Zero Trust implementations, Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR), fraud techniques, the use of generative AI for perpetrating account takeovers (ATOs), gamification of cybersecurity and identity defenses to improve security postures, API security, and the role of identity in cloud security.</p>
<p>ITDR garnered much attention from both attendees and vendors. Vendors have developed solutions that are targeted at reducing threats and risks from enterprise ATOs that lead to asset compromise, data loss, and ransomware attacks. Sophisticated attackers today sometimes do not even use malware to attack victims. They simply take over legitimate accounts, often those that are not properly secured against remote attacks. In other cases, they buy access to real corporate accounts on the dark web. ITDR solutions primarily integrate with identity repositories and other security tools to understand normal activities in order to be able to identify abnormal activities that may be signs of malicious intent.</p>
<p>Some ITDR solutions leverage user behavioral analytics from endpoints, and some have identity deception capabilities, whereby fake accounts, credentials, and other lures are used to draw in would-be attackers to learn about their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). The ITDR market is relatively new and there is a lot of variety in how the products are implemented. We at KuppingerCole expect that the ITDR field will grow, mature, and standardize on more inclusive feature sets. For our latest research on ITDR, see the recently published <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80828/identity-threat-detection-and-response-itdr-iam-meets-the-soc">Leadership Compass on the subject</a>.</p>
<p>Fraud prevention is a desired outcome for identity security, especially within consumer and customer IAM. Fraudsters are constantly innovating on their techniques and finding new targets. Organizations must strive to keep up with mechanisms and services to detect fraud and prevent losses. Fortunately, numerous Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms (FRIPs) are available to help organizations of all kinds prevent ATOs, new account fraud, synthetic fraud, and ecommerce abuse. FRIP solutions typically have multiple capabilities to detect and stop fraud attempts, including identity verification, compromised credential intelligence, device intelligence, user behavioral analysis, behavioral biometrics, and bot detection and management.

<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/reclaim/">RECLAI</a><a href="https://mysudo.com/reclaim/">M</a>, powered by <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, is a new personal data removal service that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to help you reclaim control of your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> from the companies that store and might sell it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>RECLAIM scans your email subject lines and senders to identify which companies have your personal details, such as phone, address, and credit card details, and then gives you instructions for either switching out your personal information for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a> information or asking the company to delete your data altogether. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a> are secure digital profiles with <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">payment cards</a> to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">use instead of your own</a>. You create your <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a> in the <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a>, part of the same app family as RECLAIM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just released in beta, RECLAIM is a great place to start reducing the online exposure of your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personally identifiable information</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital footprint</a>, and boosting your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/11/9-reasons-why-data-privacy-matters/">data privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 RECLAIM has 6 handy tools built in&nbsp; 



 
 Dashboard – Start here. See your email scan and a first look at who has your data.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Footprint – Get the complete list of companies that have your data based on your email, and where your information might have been exposed in a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Key insights – Dive into the nitty gritty of what information each company has on you and what they might be doing with it based on their privacy policy and terms of service, which RECLAIM extracts and summarizes using AI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Protection Manager – Take the wheel by opting to either protect your data with <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> or delete it altogether.&nbsp; 
 



 
 MySudo Protection – If you decide to protect your information with MySudo, follow the steps to switch out your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private/">personal details</a> for your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">Sudo</a> secure digital profile details.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Deletion – If you opt to ask the company to delete your information, you’d do that here.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>When you start with RECLAIM, head to your dashboard to see your footprint scan and then start reclaiming control. It’s quick and easy, and definitely worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>



 Sign in with Google to reclaim your Gmail account&nbsp; 



<p>The beta version of RECLAIM only scans Gmail accounts. If you don’t have Gmail, there’s an option to share with us which email service you’d like our next release to support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you log in with Google, RECLAIM will read the metadata of your Gmail messages. Email metadata includes date and time, sender and recipient email addresses, and email subject. RECLAIM does not have access to the attachments or body of your Gmail inbox messages&nbsp;</p>



 RECLAIM works best with MySudo&nbsp; 



<p>Once you’ve regained control of your personal information with RECLAIM, keep up the good work by using <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">Sudos</a> to proactively protect your online presence. Sudos are secure digital profiles with <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">payment cards</a> to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2024/03/control-who-sees-your-personal-info-online-and-in-real-life/">use instead of your own</a>. You can sign up for new accounts and services with your Sudo information, not your personal information. You’d simply give companies your Sudo nickname, phone number, email address and payment card details instead of your own. Then, if that Sudo information is hit in a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-should-i-do-if-ive-been-caught-in-a-data-breach/">data breach</a> or the company sells it to <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> for profit, your own information is safe because it’s masked. You might choose to delete the affected Sudo and create a new one based on your <a href="https://mysudo.com/2023/10/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">personal needs</a> (you have up to <a href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/">nine Sudos</a> in the app). Read: <a>5 Ways to Make Best Use of your 9 Sudo Profiles</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Last month <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDGABlog">we announced the general availability</a> of our next generation customer identity and access management solution, <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID.</a> External ID makes Customer Identity &amp; Access Management (CIAM) secure and simple by enabling you to: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all external identities: Managing several disparate solutions can overcomplicate your security strategy. By adopting External ID as your CIAM solution, you can secure all identity types within your Microsoft Entra admin center, safeguarding all external identities with industry-leading security, including our own conditional access engine, verifiable credentials, and built-in identity governance.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Create frictionless user experiences: The rise of fraud, GenAI, and identity attacks has increased end-user fear when it comes to security risks online. With External ID, you can build frictionless, branded, user centric interfaces into your web and mobile applications to increase brand awareness, build user trust and drive user engagement. Check out an example in the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDWoodgroveDemo">WoodGrove Groceries demo!</a>&nbsp; 
 
 
 Streamline secure collaboration: Collaborating with external users and ensuring they have the right access at the right time is complex. Simplify collaboration by inviting business guests with External ID and defining what internal resources they can access across SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications: Integrating robust and extensive user flows into apps can take developers months. Shorten development time to minutes by leveraging External ID’s rich set of APIs, SDKs, and integrations with developer tools, such as Visual Studio Code, to build secure and branded identity experiences into external-facing web and mobile apps.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Best in class value at scale: Managing several security stacks can be costly. External ID brings innovative CIAM features at a cost-effective value for any growing customer without compromising on scalable, end-to-end security. For example, this approach helps us bring best-in-class identity verification like Face Check with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/02/06/microsoft-entra-verified-id-introduces-face-check-in-preview/">Verified ID</a> to reduce help desk costs for combatting fraud. <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDPricing">Learn more about External ID pricing here.</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide best in class protection from bot attacks, sign in and signup fraud and ability to audit every step of external user’s journeys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Ask Me Anything (AMA) on July 16&nbsp;for a deep dive into External ID!&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since our GA announcement, we’ve received lots of interest from customers who want to get started with External ID.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using Azure AD B2C, how can I take advantage of the innovation in Microsoft Entra External ID?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By building new applications with Microsoft Entra External ID, admins and developers can lean on familiar Microsoft Entra ID experiences while avoiding the overhead of building specific skills in Azure AD B2C technology. Powered by open standards, External ID is built to be interoperable with any Identity solution to provide enterprise-grade security without sacrificing end user experiences. <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDFAQ">Learn more.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Azure AD B2C is powerful in the flexibility of experiences it enables, External ID is designed for ease of adoption and speed of innovation as it’s converged into the Entra ID technical stack and organically benefits from all Entra ID innovation, extending Microsoft Entra industry-leading security and governance to external users.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will there be any changes in Azure AD B2C support and how can I migrate my existing Azure AD B2C applications to Microsoft Entra External ID?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current Azure AD B2C customers can continue using the Azure AD B2C with no service disruptions, including creating new tenants. You can continue to operate your existing B2C applications with confidence and we'll continue supporting you until at least May 2030.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you’d like to participate in early previews, your account team can help enroll you. You may choose to migrate your existing applications when the next-generation platform meets your feature requirements, and migration is right for your business. <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDFAQ">Learn more in our FAQ.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using Azure AD B2B collaboration and B2B direct connect, have these experiences changed?&nbsp;</p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security update to Entra ID affecting clients which are running old, unpatched builds of Windows</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're making a security update to Entra ID such that use of older unpatched version of Windows which still use the less secure Key Derivation Function v1 (KDFv1) will no longer be supported.&nbsp; Once the update is rolled out, unsupported and unpatched Windows 10 and 11 clients will no longer be able to sign in to Entra ID. Globally, more than 99% of Windows clients signing in to Entra ID have the required security patches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action required:</p>
<p>If your Windows devices have Security Patches after July 2021 no action is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows devices do not have security updates after July 2021, update Windows to the latest build of your currently supported Windows version to maintain access to Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All currently supported versions of Windows have the required patch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you keep Windows up to date with Security Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Security Update to Windows <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33781">CVE-2021-337</a>81 was issued in July 2021 to address a vulnerability where Primary Refresh Tokens were not stored sufficiently securely in the client.&nbsp; Once patched, Windows clients used the stronger KDFv2 algorithm.&nbsp; All versions of Windows released since that time have the update and handle the token securely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small percentage of Windows devices have not yet been updated and are still using the older v1 key derivation function. To improve security of the system, unpatched devices using the KDFv1 algorithm will no longer be able to sign in to Entra ID using Primary Refresh Tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the user experience on unsupported Windows devices when this change is rolled out?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users of Windows devices which haven’t been updated with patches since July 2021 may experience sign in failures with their Entra ID user accounts on joined or hybrid joined Windows device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I diagnose this situation?</p>
<p>The error code, which will show in sign in logs, is 'AADSTS5000611: Symmetric Key Derivation Function version 'KDFV1' is invalid. Update the device for the latest updates.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting&nbsp;in June 2026,&nbsp;all new Entra ID registrations will be bound&nbsp;to the Secure Enclave.&nbsp;As a result, all customers will need to adopt the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fentra%2Fidentity-platform%2Fapple-sso-plugin&amp;data=05%7C02%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C595884c953e941b8523108dc818f290c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638527699124669553%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=NKM%2FVimgj8HFHioHG75FozDmJ4oDEnanjXV%2FvmKJ5lc%3D&amp;reserved=0">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in</a>&nbsp;and some of the apps may need to make code changes to adopt the new Secure Enclave based device identity.</p>

<p>Important Update: Azure AD Graph Retirement</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">June 2023</a>, the Azure AD Graph API service is in a retirement cycle and will be retired (shut down) in incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, newly created applications will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We are revising the da20te for this first stage from June 30 to August 31, so only applications created after August 31, 2024, will be impacted. The second stage of the Azure AD Graph service retirement cycle will begin after January 31, 2025. At this point, all applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs will receive an error when making requests to the AAD Graph service. Azure AD Graph will be completely retired (and stop working) after June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We are providing an optional configuration (through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">authenticationBehaviors</a> setting) that will allow an application to continue use of Azure AD Graph APIs through March 30, 2025.&nbsp; If you develop or distribute software that still uses Azure AD Graph APIs, you must act now to avoid interruption. You will either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (highly recommended) or configure the application for an extension, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To identify applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs, we have provided two <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra recommendations</a> with information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Update: AzureAD and MSOnline PowerShell retirement&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, the legacy Azure AD PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell Preview, and MS Online modules <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">are deprecated</a>. These modules will continue to function through March 30, 2025, when they are retired and stop functioning. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a> is the replacement for these modules and you should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: as indicated in our April update, MS Online with “Legacy Auth” will stop functioning in the weeks after June 30, 2024. Legacy Auth is typically associated with versions before 1.1.166.0, and involves use of MS Online PowerShell with the Microsoft Online Sign-In Assistant package installed. If you are using MS Online versions before 1.1.166.0 or MS Online with Legacy Auth, you should immediately migrate to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK or update the MS Online version to the latest version (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSOnline/1.1.183.81">1.1.183.81</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help you identify usage of Azure AD PowerShell in your tenant, you can use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra Recommendation</a> titled Migrate Service Principals from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph. This recommendation will show vendor applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant, including AzureAD PowerShell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra, with the recent Public Preview launch of the <a href="https://aka.ms/EntraPSPreview">Microsoft</a> Entra PowerShell module. This new module builds upon and is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It’s fully interoperable with all cmdlets in the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, enabling you to perform complex operations with simple, well documented commands. The module also offers a backward compatibility option to simplify migraiton from the deprecated AzureAD Module. Additionally, we are aware that some of our customers were unable to fully migrate to scripts that managed Per-user MFA from MSOnline to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Microsoft Graph APIs were <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/changelog?search=e22b3741-9f9a-4d25-af9d-e935018a8b68">recently made available</a> to read and configure Per-user MFA settings for users, and availability in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets is soon to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Preview – QR code sign-in, a new authentication method for Frontline Workers</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are introducing a new simple way for Frontline Workers to authenticate in Microsoft Entra ID with a QR code and PIN, eliminating the need to enter long UPNs and alphanumeric passwords multiple times during their shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the private preview release of this feature in August 2024, all users in your tenant will see a new link ‘Sign in with QR code’ on navigating to <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/">https://login.microsoftonline.com</a> &gt; ‘Sign-in options’ &gt; ‘Sign in to an organization’ page. This new link, ‘Sign in with QR code’, will be visible only on mobile devices (Android/iOS/iPadOS). If you are not participating in the private preview, users from your tenant will not be able to sign-in through this method while we are still in private preview. They will receive an error message if they try to sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The feature will have a ‘preview’ tag until it is generally available. Your organization needs to be enabled to test this feature. Broad testing will be available in public preview, which we will announce later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the feature is in private preview, no technical support will be provided. Please learn more about support during previews here <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/licensing-preview-info">Microsoft Entra ID preview program information - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to phone call settings: custom greetings and caller ID</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting September 2024, phone call settings (custom greetings and caller ID) under Entra's multifactor authentication blade will be moved under the voice authentication method in the authentication method policy. Instead of accessing these settings through the Entra ID or Azure portal, they will be accessible through MS Graph API.&nbsp;If your organization is using custom greetings and/or caller ID, please make sure to check the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#phone-call-settings">public documentation</a> once we release the new experience to learn how to manage these settings through MS Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS Graph API support for per-user MFA</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, we are releasing the capability to manage user status (Enforced, Enabled, Disabled) for per-user MFA through MS Graph API. This will replace the legacy MS Online PowerShell module that is being retired. Please be aware that the recommended approach to protect users with Microsoft Entra MFA is Conditional Access (for licensed organizations) and security defaults (for unlicensed organizations).&nbsp;The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates">public documentation</a> will be updated once we release the new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server&nbsp;- 3-month notice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p><br>Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments will no longer service MFA requests, which could cause authentications to fail for your organization. MFA Server will have limited SLA and MFA Activity Report in the Azure Portal will no longer be available. To ensure uninterrupted authentication services and to remain in a supported state, organizations should <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-migrate-mfa-server-to-azure-mfa-user-authentication">migrate their users’ authentication data</a> to the cloud-based Azure MFA service using the latest Migration Utility included in the most recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55849">Azure MFA Server update</a>.

<p>Decommissioning of Group Writeback V2 (Public Preview) in Entra Connect Sync - Reminder</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public preview of Group Writeback V2 (GWB) in Entra Connect Sync is no longer available and Connect Sync will no longer support provisioning cloud security groups to Active Directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another similar functionality is offered in Entra Cloud Sync, called “Group Provision to AD”, that maybe used instead of GWB V2 for provisioning cloud security groups to AD. Enhanced functionality in Cloud Sync, along with other new features, are being developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers who use this preview feature in Connect Sync should&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/cloud-sync/migrate-group-writeback">switch their configuration from Connect Sync to Cloud Sync</a>. Customers can choose to move all their hybrid sync to Cloud Sync (if it supports their needs) or Cloud Sync can be run side-by-side and move only cloud security group provisioning to AD onto Cloud Sync. Customers who provision Microsoft 365 groups to AD can continue using GWB V1 for this capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual enhancements to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, we are making updates to the per-user MFA admin configuration experience to align with the look and feel of Entra ID. This change does not include any changes to the core functionality and will only include visual improvements. Starting in August 2024, you will be redirected to the new experience both from the Entra admin center and Azure portal. There will be a banner presented for the first 30 days to switch back to the old experience, after which you can only use the new experience. The<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates"> public documentation</a> will be updated once we release the new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updates to “Target resources” in Microsoft Entra Conditional Access</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in September 2024, the Microsoft Entra Conditional Access 'Target resources' assignment will consolidate the "Cloud apps" and "Global Secure Access" options under a new name "Resources". &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers will be able to target "All internet resources with Global Secure Access", "All resources (formerly 'all cloud apps') or select specific resources (formerly "select apps"). Some of the Global Secure Access attributes in the Conditional Access API will be deprecated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will start in September 2024 and will occur automatically, admins won’t need to take any action. There are no changes in the behavior of existing Conditional Access policies. To learn more, <a href="https://aka.ms/CA-target-resources-update">click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upcoming Improvements to Entra ID device code flow</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing commitment to security, we are announcing upcoming enhancements to the Entra ID device code flow. These improvements aim to provide a more secure and efficient authentication experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've refined the messaging and included app details within the device code flow to ensure a more secure and precise user experience. Specifically, we've adjusted headers and calls to action to help your users recognize and respond to security threats more effectively. These changes are designed to help your users make more informed decisions and prevent phishing attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes will be gradually introduced starting in July 2024 and are expected to be fully implemented by August 30, 2024. No action required from you.</p>

  <p>One year ago, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will occur in incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, newly created applications will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs. We’re revising the date for this first stage from June 30 to August 31, and only applications created after August 31, 2024 will be impacted. After January 31, 2025, all applications – both new and existing – will receive an error when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they’re configured to allow extended Azure AD Graph access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We’re providing an optional configuration through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors">the authenticationBehaviors property,</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;will allow an application to use Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025. Azure AD Graph will be fully retired after June 30, 2025, and no API requests will function at this point, regardless of the application’s configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you develop or distribute software that still uses Azure AD Graph APIs, you must act now to avoid interruption. You’ll either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (highly recommended) or configure the application for an extension, as described below, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change. If you’re using applications supplied by a vendor that use Azure AD Graph APIs, work with the software vendor to update to a version that has migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> feature provides recommendations to ensure your tenant is in a secure and healthy state, while also helping you maximize the value of the features available in Entra ID. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve provided two Entra recommendations that show information about applications and service principals that are actively using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations can support your efforts to identify and migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra Recommendations for Azure AD Graph migration</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Configuring an application for an extension of Azure AD Graph access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow an application created to have an extension for access to Azure AD Graph APIs through June 30, 2025, you must make a configuration change on the application after it’s created. This configuration change is done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface. By setting the blockAzureADGraphAccess flag to false, the newly created application will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs until further in the retirement cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: In this first stage, only Applications created after August 31, 2024 will be impacted. Existing applications will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs even if the authenticationBehaviors property is not configured. Once this change is rolled out, you may also choose to set blockAzureADGraphAccess to true for testing or to prevent an existing application from using Azure AD Graph APIs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after August 31, 2024? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Any existing applications that use Azure AD Graph APIs and were created before this date will not be impacted at this stage of the retirement cycle. 
 Any applications created after August 31, 2024 will encounter errors when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute has been set to false in the authenticationBehaviors configuration for the application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after January 31, 2025? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 After January 31, 2025, all applications – new and existing - will encounter errors when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute has been set to false in the authenticationBehaviors property for the application. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after June 30, 2025? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Azure AD Graph APIs will no longer be available to any applications after this point, and any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs will receive an error, regardless of the authenticationBehaviors configuration for the application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current support for Azure AD Graph</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph APIs are in the retirement cycle and have no SLA or maintenance commitment beyond security-related fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Microsoft Graph 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph represents our best-in-breed API surface. It offers a single unified endpoint to access Entra and Microsoft 365 services such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Intune. All new functionalities will only be available through Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is also more secure and resilient than Azure AD Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph has all the capabilities that have been available in Azure AD Graph and new APIs like identity protection and authentication methods. Its client libraries offer built-in support for features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What about Azure AD and Microsoft Online PowerShell modules? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, AzureAD, AzureAD-Preview, and Microsoft Online (MSOL) PowerShell modules are deprecated and will only be supported for security fixes. These modules will be retired and stop working after March 30, 2025. You should migrate these to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Please reference this <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-update-deprecation-of-azure-ad-powershell-and-msonline/ba-p/4094536">update</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zug and Singapore — July 1, 2024 –The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, comprising <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a>, <a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, has today announced the launch of the multi-coin merger, forming the unified token. This merger of AGIX, OCEAN, and FET tokens marks a significant step towards creating a fully decentralized AI ecosystem. By aligning incentives, the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance drives the vision of a decentralized, efficient, and transparent AI landscape, polling resources and expertise from its members to accelerate advancements in the ethical and transparent development of AI solutions.</p><p>Today, SingularityNET’s $AGIX and Ocean Protocol’s $OCEAN tokens merge into $FET. FET trading remains uninterrupted as the project rebrands to Artificial Superintelligence Alliance across platforms including CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. The migration platform is now open on the <a href="https://www.singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi">SingularityDAO dapp</a>, and $AGIX and $OCEAN are starting to delist from exchanges. This phase aims to onboard exchanges and data aggregators for a smooth transition.</p><p>Phase II will focus on community onboarding and $ASI deployment, prioritizing self-custody holders and deploying ASI tokens across multiple chains. The transition includes new migration contracts for $AGIX and $OCEAN tokens not yet converted to $FET and for EVM-based FET. All FET Mainnet Tokens will automatically convert to ASI during Fetch.ai’s mainnet upgrade. The migration contracts will be open for years, allowing ample time for all conversions. Detailed guides and tutorials are being provided to support a smooth transition. The timing of this phase is still underway, ensuring all necessary preparations are completed.</p><p>“Today’s token merger underscores our commitment to advancing safe artificial intelligence,” said Humayun Sheikh, chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and CEO of Fetch.ai. “By merging our tokens, we aim to enhance operational efficiency and seamlessly integrate decentralized AI systems, ensuring broad access to cutting-edge AI technologies. This merger marks the beginning of an ambitious journey to foster unparalleled collaboration and openness, setting new standards for the industry.”</p><p>“We’re excited to have reached this milestone along the path to realizing our vision of an Artificial Superintelligence Alliance capable of winning the AGI and ASI race for the decentralized ecosystem,” stated Ben Goertzel, CEO of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and SingularityNet. “This tokenomic merger paves the way for a series of R&amp;D and product collaborations combining Alliance technologies toward beneficial superintelligence.”</p><p>“We’re grateful to the community, exchanges and other partners for accommodating this token merge. We’re really looking forward to focusing on our users and products that increase adoption.” said Bruce Pon, Council Board Director of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance and founder of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>This milestone reflects the alliance’s commitment to accelerating AI research and development by combining Fetch.ai’s autonomous agent technology, Ocean Protocol’s data exchange frameworks, and SingularityNET’s decentralized AI services. The three technology partners will develop products leveraging each project’s diverse solutions to ensure ethical AI development. This open collaboration invites others to join the alliance, fostering an inclusive environment that promotes cutting-edge advancements while emphasizing responsible and transparent AI practices.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1805316078060417307">LINK TO ASI MIGRATION GUIDELINES</a></p><p>About The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance<br>The Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) Alliance is a collective formed by Fetch.ai, SingularityNET (SNET), and Ocean Protocol.

  The CIAM market continues to grow and change. There have been major acquisitions in this space, and new vendors are launching products and services. Security is always a driver, but deploying organizations want useful data to improve marketing effectiveness and increase revenues. New privacy regulations put more requirements for information collection and handling on customer organizations. CIAM systems must also be able to integrate with other IT, security, and enterprise IAM solutions. To capture market share, CIAM vendors have to be innovative. Fraud prevention and integrations with marketing tools are differentiators that many companies are looking for in CIAM.

<p></p>
<p>Following the successful <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/tbdex-v1">launch of tbDEX 1.0</a> in Rio de Janeiro, TBD embarked on a roadshow across Africa, visiting Accra, Nairobi, and Cape Town.
Our mission was to engage with local developers and share tbDEX, an open source protocol for global payments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recognizing that many African countries face significant barriers to participating in the global economy, we aimed to support the vibrant and growing developer communities in these regions.
These communities are already tackling these challenges head-on, and we wanted to contribute by providing open source tools to build robust payment applications.</p>
<p>The roadshow featured full-day, hands-on workshops in Accra and Nairobi, where hundreds of developers gathered to learn how to utilize tbDEX.
The excitement was palpable as participants built wallet applications using the tbDEX SDK.
The enthusiasm and curiosity among the developers were evident, and the success of these workshops was widely shared across <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7199777112713486337/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7199777112713486337%29">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://x.com/yellowcard_app/status/1795385010117386749">Twitter</a>.</p>
 <blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/user/status/1794038435218387164"></a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/user/status/1794018057012072690"></a></blockquote> 
<p>Angie Jones, Head of Developer Relations, and Adewale Abati, Staff Developer Advocate, led the workshops, demonstrating the capabilities of developers eager to integrate advanced payment solutions.
Co-sponsored by Yellow Card and Circle, these sessions saw developers integrating wallet applications with tbDEX in just one day.</p>
  
<p>In addition to the workshops, TBD actively participated in notable conferences across Africa.
At the 3iAfrica conference in Accra, Mike Brock, CEO of TBD, delivered an insightful session titled "Trust Reimagined in the Digital Assets World," discussing the economic principles behind digital assets and their impact on trust and value exchange in business.
Angie Jones hosted a roundtable discussion on tbDEX as an open protocol for global money movement."</p>
  
<p>The team also made a stop at Joy 99.7 FM radio station in Ghana, where Mike and Angie discussed how digital identity can enhance payment systems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The journey continued to the ID4Africa conference in Cape Town, where TBD engaged with local stakeholders to gain deeper insights into the challenges surrounding digital identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, the roadshow was a significant step in connecting with developer communities across Africa.
We were inspired by the talent and determination we encountered and look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that will emerge from these collaborations.</p>
 
<p>Get Started with tbDEX</p>
<p>With tbDEX, anyone can dive into building innovative payment solutions without needing permission.
This open source tool empowers developers to start building immediately.
We welcome your <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/tbdex">feedback and contributions</a> to make tbDEX even more robust and versatile.
Join us in breaking down barriers and building the future of global payments today.</p>

<p>I live in Slack. The rest of the team at YeshID does, too. So do a lot of our customers. That’s why we created the Slack integration we wrote about in <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/ditch-reminder-chaos-yeshid-slackbot-manages-onboarding-offboarding/">this other post.</a></p>
<p>Here, I’m going to tell you how we’ve taken that integration to the next level.</p>
 The Problem 
<p>Imagine you’re in Slack, discussing some problem. Steve’s the guy who seems to have a handle on what to do. The best way for Steve to take the next step is with an app he doesn’t use all the time. He knows how to use it but doesn’t have access right now. So, let’s just get him access. Easy, right? But according to the customers we’ve been talking to, it’s not.</p>
<p>They’ve told us what they have had to do:</p>
 
 Get out of Slack and send an email (or write a JIRA ticket) to the admin for the app to request access. 
 The admin may not be the approver, so the admin has to email the approver. 
 When the approver approves, they reply with an email to the admin, who grants access. 
 The admin then has to notify the requester. 
 However, the requester might not be the person who will use the app, so they have to notify that person. 
 
<p>It’s a mess. Or as it’s usually described, it’s a cluster- umm cluster-something.</p>
<p>Oh, and compliance? You need an audit trail for compliance. A bunch of emails is not an audit trail. You’ve got to record the decision in an organized way–like in a spreadsheet. Ugh spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Of course, some customers have a Slack channel for requests instead of emails. As the organization grows with multiple IT members, they often have a generic channel for access requests (or perhaps you’re just using the general IT team chat). But now you have to hope your request isn’t missed or forgotten in the buffer.</p>
<p>And you still need an audit trail for compliance. And a way to make sure things get done</p>
 The Solution: YeshID’s Access Workflow 
<p>We listened to them, and YeshID solved that problem a while ago. Anyone can go to their YeshID console and request an app, and YeshID will manage everything downstream. Anyone who’s clicked on the “Get Started Now” button on the YeshID website, that is.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.yeshid.com/signup"></a></p>
<p>Hint: click <a href="https://app.yeshid.com/signup">here</a> or on the button to Get Started Now,</p>
<p>If you’ve signed up for YeshID, here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Go to <a href="https://app.yeshid.com">https://app.yeshid.com</a> 
 Click on “My Apps” 
 Click on “Request an application.” 
 Pick the application or request a different one if the one you want isn’t on the list 
 
<p>And you’re done.</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID generates a task and gets it to the right person–approver or admin–depending on how you’ve set things up. YeshIID tracks actions and notifies the requester when the request has been completed.</p>
<p>Having YeshID manage the process and provide the artifacts needed for compliance is better than an unmanaged collection (mess) of emails or Slack messages that you have to round up and put into a spreadsheet.</p>
 Even Better: Request Directly from Slack 
<p>But why even switch focus from Slack to YeshID?</p>
<p>With YeshID’s new Slack integration, you make the request right in Slack—no tool switching. And even better, you can request an application for someone else. Here’s how it works.</p>
 
 Just type <code>/request</code> 
 YeshID will pop up a request form in Slack 
 
<p></p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll see if you were part of T’s Tangerine Organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And the image below&nbsp; how it would look if you wanted to make a request for Figma on behalf of a guy named Steve Jobs. (Not that Steve Jobs. That one has ceased to be, expired and gone to meet his maker, is bereft of life, rests in peace… see <a href="http://montypython.50webs.com/scripts/Series_1/53.htm">Monty Python Dead Parrot Sketch</a>. This is another Steve Jobs.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The request goes straight to YeshID and gets forwarded to the right approver or administrator. YeshID monitors the entire process and constructs an audit trail. When approval has been granted, YeshID notifies both the person who has been given access and the person who requested it for them. No loose ends. All loops closed.</p>
<p>Ready to Revolutionize Your Access Management?</p>
<p>Don’t let outdated processes hold you back. Embrace YeshID and experience:</p>
 
 Increased productivity 
 Enhanced security 
 Simplified compliance 
 Happier employees and IT staff

<p>Enable-EntraAzureADAlias #enable aliasing&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get-AzureADUser -Top 1</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the difference between the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and Microsoft Entra PowerShell modules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra PowerShell is a part of our increased investment in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. It brings high-quality and scenario-optimized Entra resource management to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Still, it keeps all the benefits of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK for authorization, connection management, error handling, and (low-level) API coverage. As Microsoft Entra PowerShell builds on the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, it is completely interoperable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the Microsoft Entra PowerShell module compatible with Microsoft Graph PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes. You don't need to switch if you’ve already used the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module. Both modules work well together, and whether you use Entra module cmdlets or Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK cmdlets for Entra resources is a matter of preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to migrate from the deprecated AzureAD or MSOnline modules. Should I wait for Microsoft Entra PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. One of our goals with Microsoft Entra PowerShell is to help you migrate from Azure AD PowerShell more quickly by setting Enable-EntraAzureADAlias. Microsoft Entra PowerShell supports simplified migration for scripts that were using AzureAD PowerShell, with over 98% compatibility. However, the legacy AzureAD and MSOnline PowerShell modules are deprecated and will be retired (stop working) after March 30, 2025. We recommend that you act now to begin migrating your MSOnline and AzureAD PowerShell scripts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both modules use the latest Microsoft Graph APIs. For test environments and non-production systems, you can migrate to Microsoft Entra PowerShell. We recommend migrating to this module for production systems only after it reaches general availability. If you migrate scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK now, there is no need to update them again with Microsoft Entra PowerShell, as it enhances and will not replace Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I update Microsoft Graph PowerShell scripts to Microsoft Entra PowerShell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not necessary but a matter of preference. Microsoft Entra PowerShell is part of the Microsoft Graph PowerShell solution, and the two modules are interoperable. You can install both modules side-by-side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Microsoft Entra PowerShell add support for more resources in the future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it is a long-term investment. We will continue to expand support for more resources and scenarios over time. Expect new cmdlets for Privileged Identity Management (PIM), Entitlement Management, Tenant Configuration settings, Per-User multifactor authentication (MFA), and more. We'll also enhance existing cmdlets with additional parameters, detailed help, and intuitive names. Check out <a href="https://github.com/microsoftgraph/entra-powershell">GitHub repo</a> for ongoing updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will Microsoft Entra PowerShell use a pre-consented app like AzureAD or MSOnline modules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No. Microsoft Entra PowerShell permissions aren't preauthorized, and users must request the specific app permissions needed. This granularity ensures that the application has only the necessary permissions, providing granular control over resource management. For maximum flexibility and granularity in application permissions, we recommend <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/entra-powershell/create-custom-application">using your own application identity</a> with Entra PowerShell. By creating different applications for different uses of PowerShell in your tenant, you can have exacting control over application permissions granted for specific scenarios. To use your own application identity with Microsoft Entra PowerShell, you can use the Connect-Entra cmdlet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Connect-Entra -ClientId 'YOUR_APP_ID' -TenantId 'YOUR_TENANT_ID'&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you still relying on traditional passwords to authenticate users, even while cyber threats grow more sophisticated today? This article will examine passkey authentication work, a modern digital identity verification and security solution. You’ll learn everything about passkey authentication work, from its basic principles to its practical applications, along with the advantages and challenges it presents. By the end, you’ll gain valuable insights to determine if passkey authentication is suitable for enhancing your organization’s digital user verification and security.</p>
 
Traditional Methods vs. Passkey Authentication 
<p>While familiar and straightforward, the traditional password system presents numerous security challenges. These challenges include susceptibility to brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries numerous combinations to guess the password, and phishing attacks, where a user is tricked into revealing their password.<br>
Passkeys mitigate these risks effectively. They provide an additional or an alternative to passwords as a layer of security by issuing a new and unique code for every authentication attempt.<br>
Unlike static passwords, which are vulnerable to reuse in multiple services, passkeys are service-specific and time-bound. This dynamic nature makes it significantly more challenging for unauthorized users to access an account.<br>
If an attacker were to gain your static password, they could use it repeatedly until you notice and take action. With passkeys, however, each code is invalidated after use or after the expiration of a predetermined time, thus nullifying this type of attack vector.</p>
 
Layers of Security: Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly enhances account security by requiring two or more independent credentials: what the user knows (password), what the user has (security token or phone), and what the user is (biometric verification).<br>
The first layer is typically the password, which the user sets and knows. The second layer, a passkey, is often generated and stored on a users device or within a browser.<br>
Implementing MFA means that even if one layer is compromised, the likelihood of an unauthorized individual gaining access is significantly reduced.<br>
For instance, if your password were to be compromised, an attacker would still need to pass the subsequent layers of authentication, such as the passkey or biometric scan, to access your account.<br>
This multi-layered approach is increasingly considered best practice in cybersecurity to protect against a broad range of attacks and vulnerabilities.</p>
 The Authentication Sequence 
<p>When you try to log into a secure site, a unique passkey is made just for that attempt. It’s like when a game show host says, “Here’s the public key and the private key for your special question.Once the passkey is created and registered, it is stored on your device and can be used to access the associated website or app. To log in, simply select the saved passkey and authenticate using your device’s screen lock, such as a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition.<br>
The passkey is a permanent digital credential that replaces traditional usernames and passwords, providing a seamless and secure login experience without the need to enter anything manually each time.</p>
 
Types of Passkeys 
<p>Not all keys look the same, and neither do all passkeys. Some passkeys stored are a mix of letters and numbers. Others are just numbers but have a time limit, like a game you must beat before time runs out. Some people even use their fingerprints as a passkey.<br>
The type of passkey you use depends on what you’re trying to keep safe. If it’s just an email account, maybe a simple passkey sent through text is enough. But if it’s something like your bank account, you might want more layers, like a fingerprint plus a time-sensitive code.</p>
 
Encryption and Secure Transmission 
<p>Imagine you’re passing a secret note in class. You wouldn’t want anyone else to read it. That’s why you might write it in code or a language only you and your friend understand. This is similar to what encryption does for passkey, unlike passwords and cryptographic keys.<br>
When a passkey is sent to you, it’s scrambled into a code. This scrambled version is the only thing that gets sent over the internet. Even if someone catches it, like catching your secret note, they can’t read it because it’s still in code. Only your device knows how to unscramble it back into the same passkey you can use.</p>
 
Advantages of Passkey Authentication 
 
Security Benefits 
<p>One significant advantage of using passkeys is that they add an extra layer of security key safety to your online activities. Passkeys are often temporary, unlike traditional passwords that remain the same until you decide to change them.<br>
They expire after a short time or after you’ve used them, making them useless to anyone who tries to misuse them later. Another upside of traditional passwords is that passkeys are generated on the spot and sent to you directly; they are much harder for hackers to predict or intercept.<br>
This makes them a sturdy barrier against unauthorized access to Google accounts and user devices, effectively acting like a changing lock that keeps potential intruders guessing.</p>
 
User Convenience 
<p>While high security is crucial, it shouldn’t come at the cost of making life difficult for the user. Passkeys are often simpler to use than they sound. Typically, they are sent directly to a device that you already have on you, like your mobile device PIN or phone.<br>
There’s no need to memorize complex combinations of weak passwords or carry additional hardware. Moreover, because a new passkey is generated each time, the user is less pressured to create and remember a strong password. You don’t need to keep track of a complex string of characters; the passkey system handles the complexity.</p>
 
Scalability and Compatibility 
<p>Passkey systems are highly scalable and can easily expand as a business or organization grows. They can be implemented on various platforms and are usually compatible with existing software and hardware. This makes them a flexible option for both small businesses and large enterprises.<br>
Regarding compatibility, many passkey systems can be integrated into existing multi-factor authentication setups. Adding passkey authentication often doesn’t require an overhaul of the user’s current security system, making it a cost-effective upgrade.</p>
 Passkey Authentication in Corporate Security 
<p>In a business setting, protecting sensitive data is paramount. Passkey authentication is increasingly used to ensure only authorized employees can access crucial company information. Depending on the employee’s role, the passkey support system can be customized to provide different access levels.<br>
Moreover, since passkeys replacing passwords are often combined with other forms of authentication, they help create a robust security environment against remote attacks. This makes it difficult for potential intruders to gain unauthorized access to remote servers, safeguarding the company’s intellectual and financial assets.</p>
 
Use in Financial Transactions 
<p>Regarding banking and financial transactions, the stakes for security are incredibly high. Any vulnerability can lead to financial loss or identity theft. This is why many financial institutions turn to passkey technology for user authentication.<br>
Passkeys’ temporary nature and direct delivery to the user’s device make them a robust security measure for online financial activities. The use of passkeys as authentication factors can also streamline the user experience.<br>
For instance, during a financial transaction, a passkey can be quickly sent to the user’s device, reducing the steps needed to verify the user’s identity and making the process more efficient while maintaining high-security standards.</p>
 
Public and Government Sector Adoption 
<p>The need for secure passkey authentication and public key cryptography isn’t limited to corporations and financial institutions.<br>
Government agencies and public services also handle sensitive information and require high levels of security. Passkey authentication offers a feasible and efficient solution for these sectors.<br>
In many cases, government systems have to be accessible to the public for services like tax filing, voting, or accessing personal records.<br>
Passkey authentication provides a user-friendly yet secure method of using cryptographic private keys to facilitate these interactions, maintaining the integrity of data breaches in the system while ensuring ease of use for the general population.</p>
 
Security Vulnerabilities 
<p>While passkey authentication provides significant advantages, it is not entirely foolproof. For instance, if the device receiving the passkey is compromised, the user’s entire system’s integrity could be at risk. Malware or keyloggers on your smartphone or nearby device could potentially intercept passkeys, rendering the added layer of security ineffective.<br>
At the end of the encrypted call, there’s the possibility of ‘Man-in-the-Middle’ attacks, where an unauthorized entity intercepts the passkey during transmission. While encryption methods are generally strong enough to withstand such attempts, the risk of data breach, although low, still exists.</p>
 
Usability Concerns 
<p>The effectiveness of a security key system also depends on its ease of use. If users find a system cumbersome or confusing, they might avoid using it, compromising security.<br>
For instance, older adults or people not comfortable with technology might find the login process of receiving and inputting a passkey too complex, leading to resistance to adopting this security method.<br>
Also, the dependence on a single device, like a mobile phone, to receive a passkey can be problematic. If the phone is lost, broken, or out of battery, the user’s devices could get locked out of essential services until the issue is resolved.</p>
 
Cost and Complexity of Implementation 
<p>Switching to or adding security keys to a passkey or passwordless authentication-only system is not always straightforward. It requires investment in the technology and could necessitate updates or changes to existing operating systems, too.<br>
This can be a significant challenge for small businesses or organizations with limited resources. A new system will often require staff training who manage it and user education. This entails additional costs and effort, and the transition period could pose temporary but disruptive challenges.</p>
 
Implementation Best Practices 
 
Choosing the Right Passkey Tool 
<p>The first step in implementing passkey authentication is choosing the system that best fits the needs of the organization or service. Factors to consider include the level of security required, ease of use for the target audience, and compatibility with existing systems. Additionally, it’s advisable to opt for plans that offer strong encryption and reliable delivery methods for the user’s passkeys.</p>
 
Technical Requirements 
<p>Before deployment, organizations must ensure their infrastructure is compatible with the new passkey authentication system. This may require hardware and software upgrades or the integration of new modules into the current systems. A well-defined technical requirement will facilitate a smoother transition and mitigate potential challenges.</p>
 
Training and Awareness Programs 
<p>Security measures are most effective when users understand how and why they work. Training programs should be initiated to educate users and administrators about the new system.<br>
This can range from simple guides and FAQs to more intensive training sessions for staff responsible for system management. Ongoing awareness programs can help maintain high levels of compliance and effectiveness.</p>
 Technological Advancements on the Horizon 
<p>Passkey authentication will likely evolve with advancements in biometric authentication and sensor technology. Future systems might incorporate biometrics or behavioral traits as additional forms of biometric authentication of passkeys. There’s also a potential for integrating Artificial Intelligence to detect unauthorized activities more efficiently, making the system even more secure.</p>
 
Integrating with Other Authentication Methods 
<p>As public key cryptography and private key technology evolve, passkey authentication is expected to become more sophisticated and may integrate seamlessly with biometric data and other authentication methods. Combining passkeys with biometrics or hardware tokens can create an even more robust security landscape, offering identity providers high security and user convenience.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Are you struggling to design and implement decentralized digital trust ecosystems that actually work? </p>
<p>In this episode of The SSI Orbit Podcast, host Mathieu Glaude sits down with Ecosystem Architect Antti Kettunen to unpack the challenges of adoption and value creation in decentralized systems. Antti shares his insights on moving beyond technology-focused conversations and instead building the right incentive models and business value propositions. He explains why simply selling decentralized identity as a technology solution is not enough—ecosystems need to be designed holistically with all stakeholders in mind.</p>
<p>Some of the valuable topics discussed include:</p>
<p>✨ Contrasting value chains in centralized vs decentralized ecosystems<br>✨ The importance of coordinated governance in decentralized systems<br>✨ Strategies for Mapping out ecosystem value propositions<br>✨ Frameworks for analyzing incentives across different participants</p>
<p>Whether you’re in the process of building a decentralized identity solution or embarking on a digital transformation journey for an existing ecosystem, this episode is a goldmine of practical insights. It offers essential guidance on how to create sustainable value for all parties involved. Tune in to gain actionable knowledge that will empower you to design decentralized ecosystems that drive adoption.</p>
<p><br>Key Insights:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Decentralized ecosystems have disconnected value chains between issuance and presentation of credentials, making it challenging to create value for all parties 
 Ecosystem design needs to consider business value chains and governance, not just technology 
 Payments and transactions can be enablers for ecosystem adoption, but cannot be easily disrupted 
 Public/open data layers may be needed to enable private transactions in an ecosystem 
 Understanding and balancing incentives across all ecosystem participants is crucial for success 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Take a high-level view and start with those who get the most value/have the biggest problems in the ecosystem 
 Map out benefits for different participants and identify win-win opportunities 
 Design governance models and liability frameworks to enable trust between parties 
 Use tools like Ron Adner’s “The Wide Lens” to analyze ecosystem value propositions 
 Think as an “ecosystem architect” to understand business, technology and governance holistically 
 
 Chapters: 
 
 00:00 – Value chains for decentralized ecosystems 
 08:27 – Are Wallets the new platforms? 
 14:07 – Are Payments a key enabler for decentralized trust ecosystems 
 25:25 – Will our identifiers ultimately be controlled by Apple/Google and Government wallets? 
 31:27 – Frameworks to enable ecosystems for decentralized data exchanges 
 44:17 – The need for public data layer within ecosystems to build trust and enable trusted interactions

<p>You have a problem. You see the looming effects of climate change and want to ensure a livable future for your children, but the money you are investing to support your children when they grow up is in mutual funds that likely support fossil fuel companies, arms manufacturers, and others directly responsible for the destruction of our climate.&nbsp;</p><p>The money that you hope will give your children a future is also actively destroying that future.</p><p>There is a new push into ethical funds which are meant to avoid these pitfalls, but these funds are limited in their investment opportunities and the tools for you to audit their activities are in their infancy. This article seeks to expand perspectives on better investing.</p><p>What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?&nbsp;</p><blockquote>What we need are new ways of expressing the very real value of these resources so that we can bring them into the system, investing in their preservation and growth. What we need is for our economies to not be at odds with our ecosystems.</blockquote><p>Let me introduce the concept of Regenerative Economics (Regen). The idea is to account for all the costs and values that are missed by traditional economics. That means both social effects, and externalities like carbon emissions.</p><p>If a marsh is drained to allow for a new property development, there is a loss of habitat for important species, there is a release of stored carbon and also a loss of future carbon sequestering and oxygen producing capacity by all of the plants and algae, and then there is a loss of the recreation space which is enjoyed people who live in the area. And all of this before we account for the carbon burned by the construction of the shopping centers and roads and homes that replace the original habitat. These are material and social costs that are paid by local residents, future generations, and the ecosystem as a whole. There is also an economic benefit to the developers, investors, and community members who use the services and spaces of the new development. These benefits and costs both matter, but our current economy only has methods to account for the expenses and value of the development, forgetting the value of the marsh and costs of its loss. Sometimes environmental offsets are bought to compensate, but the specificities are largely unaccounted for. Instead, those socio-ecological losses are termed “externalities” and considered outside the system.&nbsp;</p><p>But, you and I both know that these losses are not external to our lives. The loss of a local wetland, or our favorite childhood hike, or the salmon runs that bring life to our local rivers all impact us and our families for generations. </p><p>What we need are new ways of expressing the very real value of these resources so that we can bring them into the system, investing in their preservation and growth. What we need is for our economies to not be at odds with our ecosystems.</p> Case Studies <p>Two leading projects in the Holochain Ecosystem are attempting to solve pieces of this conundrum. One, Kwaxala, is building financial tools for investing in the environments we want to preserve; and the other, IOEN (the Internet of Energy Network), is connecting global finance to the local renewables that need to be developed. Together, they represent the beginning of a movement for ethical investment and regenerative economics.</p><p>Let’s start with IOEN.&nbsp;</p> IOEN <p>Renewable energy is the future. If our civilization has a future, we will have to shift to more sustainable methods for meeting our energy needs. That much is clear. It’s also clear that fossil fuel companies are resistant to this change, and that large solar and wind farms can only be one part of the solution. Small scale local energy production will be a large portion of the global market. Minigrids and Microgrids are emerging as solutions that are more efficient and resilient as they don’t need the massive infrastructure of energy distribution on top of the infrastructure of production. Energy is generated, stored, traded, and used locally.</p><p>The pathway to fully clean, tradable energy is not immediate. On the way to full access to clean energy, organizations including large corporations are taking seriously the responsibility to offset their production of carbon emissions. A factory produces a lot of carbon, both from the energy it uses and the industrial processes themselves. They can get their electricity from renewable sources, but depending on where a particular factory is and when they are operating, they might not have access to renewables. Renewable energy generation is subject to location, geography, and access to resources like wind, enough sunshine, and the ability to store electricity.</p><blockquote>What if you could invest in the environment, in efforts for climate justice, in carbon markets, and systemic change? What if you could invest in a future that you and your children want to live in?</blockquote><p>But, just because they are incapable of directly using renewable energy doesn’t mean that they cannot support the use of renewables generally. Environmental Attribute Credits (EACs), including carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), help create incentives to invest, support, and use renewable energy.</p><p>Currently, large renewable energy farms can sell carbon credits or RECs (depending on the system used), helping corporations offset their carbon emissions. But these are economies of scale. The accounting needed to get government issuance of these carbon credits only works at large scales (a single electrical meter is a lot easier to measure and monitor than many distributed meters). IOEN is providing a way for small scale energy producers who serve their local communities to aggregate their energy production and access global renewable certificate markets.</p><p>In order to ensure auditability and to account for distributed energy production by a collection of small holders, data is needed to track energy production. IOEN’s current work with partners in Asia is helping companies and home owners provide two types of data. First, photos of their solar arrays, preferably at the time of installation. Secondly, ongoing readings from their meter, showing the energy that they feed back to their local grid. IOEN’s partners then add satellite data which is used to confirm the installation of solar panels at the sites claimed. All of this data becomes available to regulators who can cross reference each source, ensuring that the meter readings match the expected generation range for the panels.&nbsp;</p><p>Aggregating the data of many individual producers allows IOEN to meet the scale requirements to work with government regulators, procuring and then selling the certificates to corporations. As each individual energy producer’s contributions to this larger pool is tracked, they are able to then be compensated directly in relation to the amount of energy they produced.</p><p>Key to IOEN’s value in the market is the ability for clients to store the data (meter data, photographs etc.) in private networks hosted on Holochain which provides auditors with assurance that the certificates minted are validated and true. This creates transparency and integrity in the certificate. IOEN’s blockchain solutions that sit on top of that data then allow secondary markets to emerge, along with fractionalised investment opportunities in these renewable assets, creating liquidity. Because transactions are all tracked on the blockchain, and linked to secure data in Holochain, different organizations involved in the assets all can be paid seamlessly and transparently through fractionalised payments. Already small businesses, communities, and large corporations are seeing the value in this approach for a number of energy-related environmental assets.</p> Kwaxala <p>Kwaxala is an indigenous forest regeneration cooperative taking a different approach to nature protection that goes far beyond carbon credits.</p><p>Rather than focusing on energy production, they are concerned with the preservation and stewardship of what we already have. Remember that marsh? We agreed that it has a value. And the question is: how can we invest in that value? Kwaxala is making that a possibility. Most land used for logging, oil drilling and fracking, and other resource extraction is government owned and often in contradiction with recognised Indigenous land rights in the area. Companies own or buy the permits and right to extract resources from that land, without buying the land itself. Kwaxala is working to buy those same rights, but rather than using them for extraction, they are securing the right to protect and regenerate the ecosystems threatened by extraction. This legal guarantee of preservation, in an area previously at genuine threat of extraction, is then used to generate carbon offsets each year which can be sold to corporations meeting their net zero commitments.</p><blockquote>This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Kwaxala offsets not only represent sequestered carbon, but also a wider range of monetized ecoservices such as biodiversity protection and ecosystem preservation alongside positive social outcomes such as Indigenous equity and reconciliation. This enables them to command a premium market price per tonne. Additionally, by enabling capital investment directly into the organization holding the right to regenerate, they provide a new way for investment funds to flow into the asset value of the protected natural ecosystem, generating much needed upfront capital to establish these protected areas and counterbalance the extractive economic pressure to destroy the area.</p><p>But how do we ensure that the land is well taken care of? Here Kwaxala is using overlapping datasets to build a picture of the ecosystem and its health. Working with Indigenous land stewards, who are also the principal shareholders in Kwaxala itself, they are developing the metrics needed to monitor and support the wellbeing of the particular ecosystems. For some situations, that might be the water and air quality; for others, it might be the presence of indicator species; for many, it will be the conglomeration of multiple data points, collaborating to tell a story. This rich dataset then provides detailed provenance for both the particular offsets generated by the protected ecosystems and for the long term investments in the ecosystems themselves so that there is detailed visibility into the health and stewardship of the ecosystem.</p><p>To collect, manage, and maintain this data — and to share it with community members, government regulators, and investors — they are investigating the development of a distributed platform, built on Holochain. Building on Holochain in this case ensures that control of the data isn’t managed solely by the organization claiming to be protecting the ecosystem, but is rather distributed between all stakeholders. With data provenance baked in, it is also easy to track exactly what agent adds any particular piece of data. This combination of verification and distributed storage of overlapping datasets allows for a high degree of trust to be developed, and holds the organization itself accountable.</p><blockquote>...we start to see the potential for a new regenerative economics to be developed. Based not on extraction, but rather the regenerative value of all ecosystem activities.</blockquote> Going Long on the Climate <p>In his book The Ministry for the Future, Kim Stanley Robinson introduces the idea of going long on the climate — basically, investing in our futures. As popular opinion shifts to focus on the climate crisis, we can expect the economic value of climate mitigation strategies to rise. One of the biggest issues to date in the space is a lack of reliable investment opportunities. With the capacities for data provenance that Holochain provides, investors can have more transparent access to the assets they are investing in.</p><p>There isn’t a one size fits all approach here. In comparison to the global replication of industry, climate mitigation is about <a href="https://hackernoon.com/economies-of-specificity?ref=blog.holochain.org">economies of specificity</a>, because ecosystems are specific to their place and relationships.</p><p>Holochain is designed so individual applications can be customized to their particular context, while still being compatible with each other. This gives the flexibility needed for hyper-specific economies to interact with the global market in accountable ways. Add to this <a href="https://hrea.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">innovative accounting methods</a> being developed on the framework and we start to see the potential for a new regenerative economics to be developed. Based not on extraction, but rather the regenerative value of all ecosystem activities.&nbsp;</p> Early Entry into a New Economy <p>The projects outlined above are only first steps towards solving your original problem. You want a way to invest in a future for yourself and your children. A future not only rich in a financial sense, but also an experiential one. Quality of life hinges on the environment and the wellbeing of our society.&nbsp;</p><p>There won’t be any single bulletproof investing strategy, but it’s going to take a multiplicity of tactics to address climate change. Looking at these pilots, we feel that the best way to diversify and to be an early investor in the regenerative economy is to go out and build it. We are looking for more projects innovating in this space. It’s going to take new business structures, financial tools, and community initiatives to shift the landscape and to build a thriving economy. But let’s thrive together, building on real tangible things, building on relationships with the nature we cherish.</p>

 6th Anniversary Celebrations <p>Ontology Network, launched in June 2018, has evolved from a blockchain platform focused on digital identity and data solutions to a comprehensive Web3 infrastructure. Over the past six years, Ontology has achieved significant milestones, including the launch of its MainNet, integration of layer-2 technology, and the introduction of an Ethereum Virtual Machine, while expanding its ecosystem through strategic partnerships and community growth. Let’s take a journey through some of the key highlights of Ontology’s evolution.</p> MainNet and TestNet&nbsp;Launches <p>The Ontology MainNet has undergone several significant changes and upgrades since its inception:</p><p>· 2018: Ontology MainNet version 1.0 officially launched, marking the beginning of Ontology’s independent blockchain. This launch included the implementation of a unique dual-token system consisting of <a href="https://ont.io/tokens/">ONT and ONG</a>, as well as tools to support developers in building dApps and smart contracts.</p><p>· 2019: Ontology introduced sharding technology and launched its cross-chain TestNet, enhancing the network’s scalability and interoperability.</p><p>· 2020: Ontology MainNet 2.0 was released, integrating layer-2 technology to improve transaction speed and efficiency.</p><p>· 2021: The Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) test network was launched. This significant update allowed Ontology to support four types of smart contracts — Native, NeoVM, WasmVM, and EVM — making it one of the most versatile public-chain platforms in terms of development languages and virtual machines supported.</p><p>· 2022: The project’s commitment to expansion is further evidenced by its $10 million EVM fund, aimed at supporting global developers and fostering growth within the Ontology ecosystem.</p><p>· 2023: Ontology introduced liquid staking, represented by the stONT token. This significant update allows ONT token holders to maintain liquidity while participating in network consensus. The stONT token accumulates rewards by growing in value relative to ONG, providing users with more flexibility in managing their staked&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The consistent updates demonstrate Ontology’s commitment to regular and substantial improvements to its network infrastructure. These launches have progressively enhanced Ontology’s capabilities, from basic blockchain functionality to advanced features like sharding, cross-chain compatibility, and EVM integration.</p><p>In terms of <a href="https://node.ont.io/">staking</a>, Ontology implements a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. The network has gained popularity among node operators of various sizes and maintains an active staking community. Stakers can earn ONG as rewards for participating in network consensus and governance.</p> Slash Mechanism for Consensus Nodes <p>To further enhance the security and stability of the blockchain, Ontology is introducing a Slash mechanism for Consensus Nodes. This new feature ensures that the network operates in a safer and more stable manner by penalizing nodes that act maliciously or fail to perform their duties properly. This addition strengthens Ontology’s commitment to maintaining a robust and reliable blockchain infrastructure.</p> TestNet Faucet: Empowering Developers <p>As part of our continuous effort to support developers, <a href="http://bwarelabs.com">Bwarelabs</a> now provides faucets for ONT and ONG test tokens on Ontology and Ontology EVM. This initiative aims to lower the barriers for developers, making it easier to test and deploy their applications on the Ontology MainNet. By offering easy access to test tokens, we hope to foster innovation and growth within our developer community.</p> Developer Relations: Breaking&nbsp;Barriers <p>In collaboration with <a href="http://stackup.dev">StackUp</a>, Ontology is launched a campaign focused on removing barriers for the developer community. This initiative aims to provide comprehensive support and resources, ensuring that developers have everything they need to succeed in building on the Ontology MainNet. Together, we are committed to creating an inclusive and supportive environment that empowers developers to innovate and&nbsp;thrive.</p> Sneak Preview of Our Giveaway Campaigns <p>To celebrate our 6th anniversary, we’re excited to announce some amazing giveaway campaigns!</p><p>Stake2Earn — Giveaway to Ontology Stakers: Win a share of 3000 ONG!

			 Tokenized Securities Unaffected by MiCA, Utility Tokens and Stablecoins Face Stricter Rules 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to partially become applicable&nbsp;on 30th June 2024, it is crucial to understand its implications for various types of crypto-assets. While tokenized securities remain largely unaffected by MiCA, utility tokens and stablecoins will face significantly stricter regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>MiCA introduces comprehensive measures to regulate the crypto-asset market, providing much-needed clarity. However, it’s important to note that&nbsp;MiCA does not apply to crypto-assets qualifying as financial instruments, such as transferable securities. These assets continue to fall under the existing regulatory framework of MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II). This provides clear guidance to securities’ issuers.</p>
<p>In contrast,&nbsp;MiCA imposes significant new requirements on utility tokens and stablecoins, fundamentally changing how these assets can be issued and managed. Most cash equivalent tokens currently use the ERC-20 token standard, which lacks owner identification capabilities. Under MiCA, issuers might need to consider a transition to the&nbsp;ERC-3643 token standard to issue permissioned tokens, enabling the necessary compliance features such as owner identification and additional controls.</p>
<p>In addition, providers of services linked to crypto-assets may have to obtain a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) license. Obtaining such a license would involve considerable financial and time investments. To some extent,&nbsp;the complexity and costly legal processes could make issuing security tokens easier than issuing utility tokens and stablecoins under MiCA.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the stricter but clear regulations present opportunities for&nbsp;large institutions such as banks to tokenize cash, providing institutionally acceptable money onchain, which is missing today.&nbsp;They are likely to issue permissioned cash coins to enforce compliance, as we discussed in the previous newsletter “<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VVxqrs54ScBmW8y7vlW2Nh3VjW7HlLKX5gQClQN9k7Mbb3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3myW5tBQN98Z5hL_VhrCLX5BrzP3VzWR3s4w4yykW8lwFvr3TgQkhW4w8Xcq6_7dmhW1flrsg32LtRxW3_rYy35KL1yFW2Hs1y_35jRCRW90NyVs7-hzRXW7zzmpD7m6p8MW12BNJj5xyVGSW5rTFpr8R5-XzW7_ZcFq14xcwWN2FDpsKBTtg2N8pW667XsjsrW7DyR5k70HmJNW6hWYXF7PZvkdW48p9sb1_TL2RW5hWWWc2C12yvVxSbX18R5m-3W5ZPQfZ3FrL7LW6Ghxv28HlT0qW31FG2R4CT-gYW6l7yyM5ZSbySW3nMCZz46lhq5W1gkJLg1Khrnvf1pw0C804">Institutional RWA Tokenization Needs Permissioned Cash Coins</a>”.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we are well-positioned to leverage these opportunities. Our technology enables both payment coins and securities issuers to&nbsp;identify token holders, track ownership, and enforce automated compliance onchain, which is increasingly crucial as regulations tighten.</p>
<p>This is a historic moment for Europe to position itself as the hub of institutional tokenization, we are excited for what’s coming!</p>

However, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) were given an 18-month grace period, making full compliance mandatory only by September 22,&nbsp;2022.</p> Key Features of the FATF Travel Rule in Gibraltar <p>The FATF Travel Rule in Gibraltar requires VASPs to share detailed transaction-related personal information for all virtual asset transfers above EUR 1,000. This information includes the full names, wallet addresses, and other identifying information of both the originator and the beneficiary.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>VASPs in Gibraltar must comply with several key requirements.</p>  Registration and Licensing: VASPs must obtain a DLT Provider License from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC). The <a href="https://www.fsc.gi/">GFSC provides a structured process</a> for applying for authorization, which includes pre-application engagement and an initial application assessment.  Verification of Identities: VASPs must verify the identities of their counterparties, especially when dealing with high-risk jurisdictions. The aim behind this measure is to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations.  Enhanced Due Diligence: For transactions involving unhosted wallets, VASPs are required to collect additional information such as the originator’s name, physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth. Through enhanced due diligence, GFSC seeks to mitigate the risks associated with unhosted wallets and ensure thorough verification and monitoring.  <p>For Originators, it includes:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  One of the following: physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth  <p>For Beneficiaries:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>If the required Travel Rule data is missing, incomplete, or delayed, the beneficiary VASP must implement risk-based procedures to address these gaps, potentially suspending or rejecting the transfer until compliance is achieved.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>VASPs in Gibraltar, including cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers, must adhere to the FATF Travel Rule under the supervision of the GFSC. This regulation is crucial for preventing money laundering and terrorism financing.</p><p>VASPs must monitor crypto transfers. All transactions, especially those involving unhosted wallets, require monitoring and additional information gathering during high-risk transactions. They must also develop risk-based policies for managing transfers involving unhosted wallets and ensure thorough verification and monitoring.</p><p>Failure to adhere to the FATF Travel Rule requirements in Gibraltar can lead to significant penalties. For a summary conviction, the penalties may include imprisonment for up to one year, a fine up to level 5 on the standard scale, or both. In the case of conviction on indictment, the penalties can be more severe, with imprisonment for up to two years, a fine, or&nbsp;both.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>Gibraltar enforces a EUR 1,000 threshold for the Travel Rule, aligning with FATF recommendations. Comparatively, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-switzerland">Switzerland’s Crypto Travel Rule threshold</a> is 1,000 CHF, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">whereas in the United Kingdom</a>, it is 1,000 GBP, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">in Japan</a>, the threshold is&nbsp;$3,000.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Since implementing the FATF Travel Rule in March 2021, Gibraltar requires detailed verification for cryptocurrency transactions over EUR 1,000. This regulation aims to safeguard financial transactions and prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> FAQs  1. What is the minimum threshold for the Travel Rule in Gibraltar? <p>The Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrency transactions above EUR&nbsp;1,000.</p> 2. What information must VASPs collect and verify under the Travel Rule in Gibraltar? <p>VASPs must collect and verify full names, wallet addresses, and additional identifying information such as a physical address, national identity number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth for both originators and beneficiaries in Gibraltar.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has undergone considerable expansion thanks to the digitalization of its services, made more accessible through a simple application. A societal topic thanks to its public service quality, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">urban mobility</a> contributes not only to the inclusiveness of certain populations, but also to the <a href="https://cor.europa.eu/en/engage/studies/Documents/The%20New%20Urban%20Mobility%20Initiative%20Can%20it%20deliver%20inclusive%20local%20mobility%20needs%20and%20European%20decarbonisation%20goals%20at%20the%20same%20time.pdf">reduction of carbon-based transport</a>. Urban mobility plays a key role in our strategy to combat global warming, by encouraging the use of public transport through the connection of different transport offers, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> and car-sharing.</p>



<p>To encourage the use of public transport, various pricing initiatives have been put in place. For example, reduced-price season tickets have been introduced for certain categories of the population, such as students. These age-based fares are offered by many transport networks in Germany as well as in France, such as <a href="https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en">Île de France Mobilités</a> or <a href="https://www.sncf-voyageurs.com/en/travel-with-us/in-france/mainline-cards-and-fares/avantage-card/avantage-jeune/">SNCF</a>, with offers reserved for those under 26 or senior citizens.</p>



<p>While such measures encourage the adoption of these services, they also open the door to fraudulent practices, with harmful consequences. It therefore seems necessary to provide solutions in terms of age verification of users, to guarantee a fair and efficient service and avoid attempts at fraud and identity theft.</p>



 The importance of discounted fares in urban mobility. 



<p>Discounted tickets exist on many types of platforms and services. From telecom operators to streaming or cultural services, there is a plethora of places offering this type of service. In the field of transport, it is a social policy tool, where the existence of specific offers according to age and income categories promotes access to transport for different categories of the population.</p>



<blockquote><p>The introduction of reduced fares for young people is justified by a number of social and equity considerations: young people are often dependent on public transport (lack of driver’s license and/or vehicle).</p>Île de France Mobilités</blockquote>



<p>These special fares are also used by transport companies as a means of building customer loyalty. However, in a tense economic climate, it is sometimes tempting for users who are not entitled to special fares to abuse the loopholes in a subscription system in order to benefit from them. As a result, mobility providers are increasingly detecting fraud in this area. This may involve the use of false identity documents to take advantage of discounts, or the theft of another person’s identity.</p>



<p>The impact of such fraud is twofold: not only does it adversely affect the revenues of transport operators, it also limits the scope of these offers and the fairness between users. However, it is possible to curb this damaging occurence with online identity verification solutions, which are transparent and easy for the user.</p>



 Combating fraud through identity verification. 



<p>Traditionally, age verification on public transport has been carried out by means of identity documents presented when purchasing season tickets. The possibility of subscribing to these services online has made it easier to commit fraud and obtain discounted fares. It is now easy for anyone to forge an identity document, thanks to editing software that has become readily available.</p>



<p>At the same time, anti-fraud and identity verification technologies have also become more sophisticated, providing even more secure and appropriate responses.</p>



<p>For a transport operator, using these solutions means effectively guarding against identity fraud during the subscription process. They also ensure that users benefiting from an offer are indeed who they say they are.</p>



<p>IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is a solution that has been used for many years in banking and financial services, but is now proving its worth in the mobility and transport sector. By verifying a user’s identity document and photo, IDnow ensures that users are thoroughly screened and their age confirmed in just a few steps:</p>



  The user submits an identity document when subscribing to the offer;  A biometric capture (facial recognition or live detection) is then performed to obtain a correlation with the user making the subscription;  The document is then analyzed by our APIs to verify its authenticity, and cross-referenced with the biometric capture for comparison. This ensures that it is the same person;  The account is validated in a matter of seconds, based on the results.  



<p>Transparent to the user, the identity verification solution is easily integrated into a mobile or web application via our SDK.</p>



<p>Using this solution limits the risk of identity theft, as the user cannot use someone else’s document to subscribe to an offer. Any alteration is identified and forces the user to terminate the subscription process.</p>



 Safer access to offers for both operators and users. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">constantly evolving</a> mobility sector has undergone digital transformations that have revolutionized our habits. At the same time, fraudsters have adapted to these new operating modes, impacting the economic efficiency of various players. Age and identity verification provides transport operators with the guarantee that their users have access to the offers they are entitled to. </p>



<p>Identity verification solutions can be seamlessly integrated into the user journey, simplifying the user experience. In addition to contributing to the fight against fraud, identity verification solutions help improve operators’ economic efficiency. As a result, they are able to enhance their transport offering, as well as the quality of their services. In the end, all users benefit from these measures.</p>

 Sifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis <p>It is hard for organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges to determine what strategies may have the greatest impact. This should be easier with more organizations publishing what they learn and AI tools supporting efficient curation of insights. In reality, the vast amount of data generated is met with overwhelm, and impact-focused organizations struggle to determine what data can be meaningfully used to support their strategic ambitions and what is just&nbsp;noise.</p><p>Over the past ten years of working with foundations, government agencies, and private sector organizations, <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital</a> has found that impact evidence synthesis is one of the more powerful tools to support strategic decisions. Evidence synthesis is the process of compiling and analyzing multiple studies to provide comprehensive impact insights on a set of interventions or products.</p><p>In this article, we share our experience of the value that evidence synthesis has catalyzed, the need to improve prevailing impact evidence synthesis norms, and how we have refined our evidence synthesis processes and products to drive impactful decisions.</p> The power of leveraging collective insights <p>Organizations that address complex social, economic, and environmental challenges are not doing it alone. Scattered across the internet and within these organizations’ own knowledge management systems, there is an abundance of insights that could be harnessed to explore the pertinent questions of what works, under what conditions, and for whom. Impact evidence synthesis brings these insights together.</p><p>Individual research efforts provide puzzle pieces that evidence synthesis assembles to create the impact picture. It adds immense value&nbsp;by:</p>  Generating a holistic view: Combining varied perspectives provides a comprehensive view of an issue, allowing for inclusive assessments of what works and what is untested.  Optimizing resources: Identifying promising interventions and avoiding duplicating those with limited impact are valuable tactics in light of finite resources.  Enabling adaptive strategies: Creating an information infrastructure supports agile strategic responses to the changing social and economic landscape.  <p>By basing actions and investment decisions on a curated body of evidence, organizations can establish a clear and justified basis while also building an evidence ecosystem and infrastructure that encourages a collective approach to engaging in shared&nbsp;issues.</p> Challenges within the prevailing forms of impact evidence synthesis <p>There are two phases to unlocking the value of evidence synthesis. The first is intentionality on what is included in a given synthesis, and the second is ensuring the outputs are delivered in ways that support access and — fundamentally — the use of evidence. While there are diverse views on these phases, there are dominant practices. These dominant practices serve some sectors well; in others, they present challenges that can limit their value. Two of the main challenges are:</p>  A bias toward experimental methods: In some sectors, an exclusive focus on one methodology can be challenging for numerous reasons, including issues of power, diversity, and representation, and discounting early insights in emerging and rapidly changing sectors — like digital — where experimental evidence may not be available when investment decisions are being&nbsp;made.  Static representation: Evidence synthesis products often exist as static narratives that summarize the state of evidence. The last decade has seen an increase in evidence maps: graphic representations of the landscape of impact evidence plotted against a set of interventions and outcomes. Maps vary but are usually one-off and focus on visualizing the number of studies rather than the insights gained from them. Unless they are accompanied by narrative summaries, evidence maps leave impact insights on the table. Like all knowledge products, content and medium directly affect engagement and use by different audiences.  <p>At Caribou Digital, we have struggled with these prevailing norms and forms, which sparked our work to innovate and improve the practice of evidence synthesis.</p> How we’ve refined our approach to connect insights to decisions <p>Our approach seeks to provide timely insights with rigor, context, and diversity of perspectives. Five elements distinguish our evidence synthesis approach:</p>  Iterative Theory of Change: Designed with thematic experts, the Theory of Change outlines impact pathways for specific issues as the basis of the synthesis.  Diverse and credible impact methodologies: Experimental and theoretical approaches each offer important views on the evidence. We need both and include&nbsp;both.  Impact results: We include a view of the volume of data points that initiated positive, negative, or no impact, not just the number of studies on a given&nbsp;topic.  Design and delivery mechanisms of interventions: Interventions or products (e.g., upskilling, e-commerce platforms) are not homogeneous. They have unique design and delivery features that can and do affect their impact. We include these features in our analysis to really drill down into what&nbsp;works.  Contextual insights: Who is being studied and where influences impact. We extract contextual data, leveraging localized evidence to support targeted interventions that are more likely to&nbsp;succeed.  <p>Including and extracting this level of detail from individual studies supports a rapid and deeper interrogation of the impact data — many of these elements are visualized in our existing evidence maps on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services</a> and <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital and data-first approaches to driving small business&nbsp;growth</a>.</p> Transforming the way users interact with evidence synthesis <p>At Caribou Digital, we are proponents of interactive and ongoing evidence synthesis. Our experience delivering interactive evidence synthesis has revealed a strong demand for customized and detailed insights on demand. This entails extracting and synthesizing impact evidence from the database on specific questions, such as “<a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">What is the impact of market-place platforms on small business growth?</a>” This recurring need has led us to further innovate with evidence outputs to support greater access to insights using generative AI. Below are three ways we share our evidence synthesis outputs:</p>  An interactive impact database holds the raw coded data. Guided by a code book, we can filter, search, and access extracted summary insights and data points from the impact database. This has been a successful format for (manually) mining the database on-demand to craft impact narratives on interventions/products in specific countries on specific segments. All our evidence syntheses have an underlying impact database, resulting in a significant body of evidence on <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/publication/digital-finance-evidence-map/">digital financial services,</a> <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">digital approaches to driving small business growth</a>, digital tools to support women’s economic empowerment, and geospatial data for humanitarian action (forthcoming).  Interactive evidence maps provide a visual overview of the entire impact evidence landscape, plotting interventions to outcomes and the direction of impact. The maps are integral for communicating a snapshot of the impact landscape and quickly discerning where evidence is concentrated. Filter buttons enable users to get more specific on other variables of interest (i.e., methodology, design and delivery mechanisms, country, segment, etc.) Alongside these interactive syntheses, Caribou Digital has crafted dozens of targeted insights for client strategy and the public (e.g., <a href="https://www.financedigitalafrica.org/tag/evidence-gap-map/">DFS</a> and <a href="https://strivecommunity.org/insights/library">small business</a>).  <p>3. A chatbot-based conversational interface queries the impact evidence database using natural language queries. This utilizes language-learning models to interpret queries and return synthesized results from the evidence base, with cited references, allowing users to, for example, type a query “Outline e-commerce products that have positively impacted women’s income in India.” This interface opens up new possibilities to engage with impact evidence, particularly when convenience and speed are prioritized and when supporting greater access to insights for those traditionally marginalized from more complex knowledge products.</p> What’s next <p>This is an exciting time to be working in evidence synthesis. With innovative new tools and processes to work with, there are more possibilities than ever to advance the efficiency, accuracy, diversity, and inclusivity of evidence synthesis. In the coming months, we will share more about our iterations with Gen AI and our approaches to deepening inclusivity and equity within the evidence synthesis process and products. We are keen to connect with users and practitioners alike to refine and perfect these approaches.</p><p>Contact <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">niamh@cariboudigital.net</a> with any feedback or questions about our evidence synthesis approach.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/shifting-through-the-noise-in-the-age-of-information-overload-the-power-of-evidence-synthesis-6157e5bc472a">Shifting through the noise in the age of information overload — the power of evidence synthesis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Munich-based identity pioneer looks back on ten years of revolutionizing the KYC space and doubles down on reusable identities and trust services 



<p>Munich, June 27, 2024 – IDnow, a leading platform provider for identity verification in Europe, is looking back on ten successful years of revolutionizing the German and European Know-Your-Customer (KYC) market and is now doubling down on reusable identities and trust services. Founded in 2014 by Armin Bauer, Sebastian Bärhold, Felix Haas and Dennis von Ferenczy, the Munich-based company’s flagship product at the time was <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">the revolutionary VideoIdent</a>, which had just been allowed by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>).</p>



 A platform with automated and expert-led solutions that serves all needs 



<p>Since then, a variety of solutions have been added to the portfolio, following market needs and technological trends: the AI-supported, fully automated AutoIdent solution was introduced in 2018, followed by the electronic function of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German ID card (eID)</a> in 2019. Just last year, IDnow introduced ShopIdent, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">onsite solution for identification</a> in German petrol stations and stores. The transaction figures prove the success of these solutions: Over 13.2 million transactions have been processed via IDnow AutoIdent, while the scale-up looks back on another 13 million successfully identified users with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent</a> to date.</p>



<p>In 2019, Andreas Bodczek was appointed as CEO at IDnow: “We have made it our mission over the past five years to actively shape and lead our industry and show our customers why digital identities are essential to their business. In the last decade, we have grown into a platform provider that serves all market needs with the help of the latest technology. We have earned the trust of our customers because we focus on our core business every day without losing sight of the secular trends that are shaping the market.”</p>



 Munich-based scale-up has long been one of the largest European players 



<p>In 2021, increased expansion opportunities led IDnow to acquire the French market leader for identity verification technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German provider identity Trust Management AG, establishing IDnow as one of the largest European players in the identity industry.</p>



<p>In addition to its traditional financial and telecommunications applications, new growth areas for IDnow have opened up in the mobility and travel industry, online dating, gaming, human resources and social media. Although user needs and regulatory requirements differ greatly from traditional industries, the desire for increased trust in digital transactions has grown across territories, regardless of the use case.</p>



 Reusable identities and trust services determine the future 



<p>The digital identity industry is facing a paradigm shift due to regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 at the European level or announced changes to the Videoident regulation in Germany. With its more than 900 trusted customers, the company aims to leverage these relationships and take them to the next level by building up its own trust service and a digital identity pool of several million users in the next few years. In doing so, the scale-up intends to lead the way in the transformation of the digital identity market heralded by eIDAS 2.0: European trust services, reusable identities and a fully integrated, broad product portfolio form the basis of the company’s long-term product strategy.</p>



<p>“Today, we are facing a fundamental transformation of our industry – away from the one-time verification process and towards reusable identities – and we will once again lead this revolution,” Bodczek says. “Since its founding, IDnow, with its broad and continually evolving portfolio, has shown a great deal of foresight, resiliency, and adaptability to market developments. With a team of over 450 highly skilled colleagues across ten offices in Europe, we are already one of the largest players in the identity industry. The experience, expertise, and innovation drive that we have assembled in-house make us extremely optimistic about the next ten years of our company and the industry at large,” he concludes.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that the <a href="https://setup.cloud.microsoft/entra/migrate-ad-fs-to-microsoft-entra-id">migration tool</a> for Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS) customers to move their apps to Microsoft Entra ID is now generally available! Customers can begin updating their identity management with more extensive monitoring and security infrastructure by quickly identifying which applications are capable of being migrated and assessing all their AD FS applications for compatibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/introducing-ad-fs-application-migration-your-path-to-simplicity/ba-p/3980232">announced AD FS Application Migration</a> would be moving to public preview, and the response from our partners and customers has been overwhelmingly positive. For some, transitioning to cloud-based security is a daunting task, but the tool has proven to dramatically streamline the process of moving to Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simplified workflow, reduced need for manual intervention, and minimized downtime (for applications and end users) have reduced stress for hassle-free migrations. The tool not only checks the compatibility of your applications with Entra ID, but it can also suggest how to resolve any issues. It then monitors the migration progress and reflects the latest changes in your applications. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJYmEOK6UJo">Watch the demo</a> to see the tool in action.</p>
<p>Moving from AD FS to a more agile and responsive, cloud-native solution helps overcome some of the inherent limitations of the old way of managing identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to more robust security, organizations count greater visibility and control with a centralized, intuitive admin center and reduced server costs as transformative benefits of moving to a modern identity management. Moreover, Entra ID features can help organizations achieve better security and compliance with multifactor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies—both of which provide a critical foundation for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More Entra ID features include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless</a> and MFA for better user experience. 
 A rich set of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-integrated-apps">apps, APIs, SDKs, and connectors</a> for customization and extensibility. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-conditional-access">Granular adaptive access controls</a> to define and monitor conditional access. 
 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-user-self-service-portals">Self-service portals</a> that allow employees to securely manage their own identity.

<p>In the dynamic landscape of Web3, ensuring trust and authenticity is paramount. Proof of Humanity (PoH) emerges as a pivotal solution, combining social verification, video submission, and decentralized dispute resolution to create a Sybil-proof registry of real humans on the blockchain. This revolutionary system addresses key challenges by verifying that each registered entity is a unique individual, thus fostering a more secure and trustworthy digital environment.</p> Key Features of Proof of&nbsp;Humanity   Sybil-Proof Registry: Guarantees each registered user is a real, unique human, preventing fraudulent multiple accounts.  Social Vouching: Existing verified humans vouch for new registrants, adding a layer of community-based verification.  Challenge Mechanisms: Users can challenge suspicious submissions, which are resolved through a decentralized process.  Reverse Turing Tests: Distinguishes humans from bots using advanced behavioral analysis.  Decentralized Dispute Resolution: Utilizes systems like Kleros for unbiased resolution of disputes.   Importance in&nbsp;Web3 <p>With the rise of AI and bots, distinguishing between human and machine interactions in Web3 is increasingly difficult. PoH mitigates these challenges by preventing Sybil attacks, ensuring fair resource distribution, and enhancing transparency in digital interactions. This system empowers users to interact only with verified accounts, akin to content moderation on social media, fostering authentic relationships in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p> Challenges and Considerations <p>Despite its advantages, PoH faces several challenges:</p>  Privacy: Balancing verification with user privacy is crucial, as PoH systems may require sensitive personal&nbsp;data.  Scalability: Ensuring PoH can handle large-scale adoption efficiently.  Inclusivity: Overcoming barriers such as access to technology and digital literacy to ensure widespread participation.  Evolving AI: Continual adaptation to differentiate increasingly sophisticated AI from&nbsp;humans.   Applications and Use&nbsp;Cases <p>PoH’s applications span various sectors. In decentralized finance (DeFi), it enhances trust in transactions and lending protocols. For governance, it ensures fair voting in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) by preventing Sybil attacks. In social media, PoH verifies user identities, enabling portable reputations across platforms. Additionally, it supports fair distribution of resources in schemes like Universal Basic Income (UBI), ensuring each verified individual receives their due&nbsp;share.</p><p>Proof of Humanity stands at the forefront of human-centric blockchain innovations, safeguarding trust and authenticity in the evolving Web3 ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-trust-and-reputation-in-web3-with-proof-of-humanity-b20497c81360">Building Trust and Reputation in Web3 with Proof of Humanity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Verida Network Community Update — 26 June&nbsp;2024  Following a $5M raise and recent announcement to support personalized AI with confidential compute on the Verida Network, here’s what it means for the future of&nbsp;Verida. Verida Network Community Update: 26 June&nbsp;2024 Hello, gm everyone! <p>Chris Were here, the CEO and Co-founder at Verida&nbsp;👋</p><p>With our <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/301318/verida-raises-5-million-to-protect-user-data-amid-rise-in-generative-ai">$5M raise</a> and recent <a href="https://x.com/Verida_io/status/1803935148502872434">announcement</a> to support personalized AI with confidential compute on the Verida Network, I wanted to provide a community update to share with you all what it means for the future of&nbsp;Verida.</p> Confidential Computation to Fuel Personalized AI <p>Some of you may have seen our important announcement about Verida and how we’re going to <a href="https://news.verida.io/extending-the-verida-network-for-personalized-ai-with-confidential-compute-9b1bf93ff2fb">extend the Verida network to support confidential computation</a>. This is a significant step to unlock decentralized infrastructure for personalized AI. I want to explain what this means and how it fits into the broader story of AI and the critical infrastructure and technology we’ve been building.</p><p>You can <a href="https://youtu.be/OuFEbFs1jsc">watch my community update on YouTube</a>, where I share my ideas in a live scratchpad, or dive into this article for the&nbsp;details.</p> Honing in on Personalized AI <p>Until a few weeks ago, our focus at Verida was on decentralized infrastructure for private databases, particularly addressing data storage for personal data. We ensured that data was securely handled, encrypted by private keys, and met all necessary authentication, security, and regulatory requirements. Recently, we announced that we are extending the Verida network to support personalized AI with confidential compute.</p> Why Verida? Why are we well-placed to make this&nbsp;move? <p>Firstly, everyone has seen the rapid growth in AI and its evolving use cases. Verida has always focused on helping people own their data and benefit from it. The idea of having all your data and using it with AI is powerful, and I’ll elaborate on that&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>From Verida’s perspective, we’ve always been about protecting and adding value to your data. We’ve built infrastructure around database storage for user data, making it well-suited to extend to confidential computation leveraging that&nbsp;data.</p><p>For example, if you’re technical, you might build software to interact with a database. But with an API, you get computation attached to it, adding business logic and making it much more powerful and useful for developers and product builders.</p><p>This is what we’re doing — saying, “databases are great, but what if we could add business logic and confidential compute?” This extension will provide APIs for other builders, making it easy to build AI platforms using your personal&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“Data matters more than the AI or the compute” — Emad&nbsp;Mostaque</blockquote><p>To highlight the importance of this, Emad Mostaque from <a href="https://stability.ai/">Stability AI</a>, who recently founded Shelling AI, emphasized that “data matters more than the AI or the compute.” At the <a href="https://www.superai.com/">Super AI</a> conference in Singapore, he talked about the idea of <a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/ai-for-the-people-emad-mostaque-part-2">self-sovereign AI</a>.</p><p>Verida has discussed self-sovereign data, and now we’re advancing to self-sovereign AI, which needs self-sovereign identity and data as foundational pieces. Verida is well-placed to provide this infrastructure for a future of self-sovereign AI.</p> AI privacy issues are&nbsp;critical <p>For instance, Elon Musk highlighted concerns about <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1800265431078551973">Apple devices potentially sharing personal information with OpenAI</a>. Imagine if all prompts and information you sent to an AI were exposed — this is a real risk, not a hypothetical one.</p><p>Data breaches, like the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/ashley-madison-data-breach-netflix-documentary-b2545067.html">Ashley Madison hack in 2015</a>, show the potential consequences of sensitive information leaks. Verida’s work on database infrastructure supports end-to-end privacy for AI, and we can extend this to the compute&nbsp;side.</p><p>It’s important to note that we are not providing decentralized computation for training AI models. Instead, we focus on personalized AI, using personal data confidentially with&nbsp;AI.</p> So, what does personalized AI&nbsp;mean? <p>We have products with AI built into them, like facial recognition and autocomplete in Gmail. Another type of AI involves prompts, like ChatGPT, which provides contextual help by accessing your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Examples include answering questions about your purchase history or creating itineraries based on your emails and bookings. More complex prompts might involve estimating taxes by accessing your pay slips and other financial information. AI agents, which act on your behalf, represent another aspect of personalized AI. These agents, supercharged by direct access to your personal data, can perform tasks like searching for shoes or helping advance your career by suggesting networking opportunities, online courses, and relevant connections.</p><p>For personalized AI to work, it needs access to personal data and guaranteed end-to-end privacy.</p><p>This is where Verida excels. We’ve been building infrastructure for storage and a personal data bridge, allowing users to connect to web2 platforms and pull their data into Verida’s decentralized storage&nbsp;network.</p> Introducing the Verida&nbsp;Vault <p>The Verida Vault is the user interface that enables this, allowing you to connect, browse, and authorize access to your data. Here’s a preview of the Verida Vault, where you can connect to the personal data bridge and pull in data from various platforms. Once your data is in the Verida Vault, you can authorize access to different AI products and services that enhance their features with your&nbsp;data.</p>Sneak preview of the Verida&nbsp;Vault The journey from web2 to web3 data unlocks personal&nbsp;AI <p>Verida’s infrastructure includes the personal data bridge and Verida Vault, ensuring secure and private access to your data. By adding confidential compute, we enable AI products and services to interact with your data securely, enhancing its usefulness.</p>Enabling Personalized AI with Verida Vault and Personal Data&nbsp;Bridge Your data, your control, our commitment. <p>Verida is solving the problem of bringing your data from web2 to web3, enabling personalized AI use cases with guaranteed privacy. This infrastructure will play a critical role in the future of self-sovereign AI, leveraging confidential compute to provide secure, personalized AI experiences.</p><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/verida_io">Follow us</a> for more updates and join the conversation with me on <a href="https://x.com/tahpot/">X/Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswere\">LinkedIn</a> about the future of personalized AI.</p><p>Yours truly,</p><p>Chris Were — CEO &amp; Co-founder, Verida</p> About Verida <p>Verida is a pioneering <a href="https://www.verida.network/">decentralized data network</a> and <a href="https://www.verida.io/">self-custody wallet</a> that empowers users with control over their digital identity and data.

<p>This blog is third in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in a practical way on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>So far in this series we’ve talked about some absolute basics: <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-a-personal-data-store-a583f7ef9be3">how personal data stores work</a> and how they enable <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-and-data-sharing-1f59f5381c85">a new approach to data sharing</a>. But very often, to get something done, you don’t just need personal data. You also need data about the world out there — data about those aspects of the world which relate directly to your task at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Ideally, what you want to be able to do is to connect your personal data to this relevant info ‘about the world’ so that the two types of data get integrated together, providing everything you need either to make a better decision or to act well on this decision, efficiently and effectively.</p> Today — friction, effort, risk and cost all&nbsp;round <p>Today however, this connection and integration happens only rarely. Usually, the two types of data are kept completely apart, which involves you in all sorts of to-ing and fro-ing, looking for which bits of data are relevant and working out how to bring them together.</p><p>Here’s an everyday example. You need to send something in the post but you don’t know the postcode. So you have to stop what you are doing, search for the right website, enter it, and then once there, search again for the information you need. Then you need to copy the information, leave the web site, and go back to what you were doing. A time consuming, irritating interruption — a classic example of what we call FERC — which stands for Friction, Effort, Risk and&nbsp;Cost.</p><p>This is just a trivial example. It gets more complicated — and the FERC just grows and grows — with more detailed, sensitive information such as the medicines that a patient should be taking, where there are more things to think about such as when you should take what dose, what other medicines you can’t take with it, contra-indications and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>This isn’t personal information as such. It’s information about the drug — information that is very important to the person at this time in this context, because it relates and connects directly to what they need and are trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Most services are made up of these two different types of information: Information about the person themselves and information about some aspect of the world that relates to what the person needs and is trying to achieve. Both types of information are needed if a person is to receive a comprehensive, quality&nbsp;service.</p><p>For example, health and care service providers need to integrate detailed data about the particular individual being cared for (personal data) with data about what services they need, based on their specific health conditions and medications they are to take (data about ‘the world’). This extends to referrals to specific services the individual may want to use as part of getting the support they&nbsp;need.</p><p>Currently, such data is kept separate, making it difficult and time consuming for people (both people needing support and service providers providing the support) to bring it together in a way that speaks directly to that particular person’s situation at that particular time.</p><p>The UK’s NHS has developed painstakingly curated lists of the medications it enables doctors to use, and of health conditions they are likely to come across. These lists are freely available and accessible to everyone&nbsp;… if, that is, you know they exist (in separate websites) and have the time, will and energy to jump through all the hoops you need to access and use&nbsp;them.</p><p>To do this, you first have to find the URL for the website in question (a different search process just to get started); navigate your way through mountains of information that’s not relevant for you; then once you have found, it capture the information in some way (such as copy and paste); go back to what you were originally doing; and find some way to integrate it into what you were trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Very often, well-meaning service providers develop general information packs for people dealing with a particular health condition. Very often these information packs are truly informative and helpful&nbsp;… but to find what’s truly informative and helpful in relation to this particular individual with these particular circumstances the person then has to wade through them, looking for the few bits of information that are particularly relevant to them right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Many people feel overwhelmed and exhausted by such processes. Often they feel overloaded with information, get confused. Sometimes frightened.</p> A breakthrough in service provision <p>We have developed our Master Reference Data service (MRD) to get rid of all this hassle so that people can access exactly the right information that they need, at the right time, from within what they are doing, seamlessly. This means they don’t have to stop what they were trying to do to go searching for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, the individual needing the information (the person themselves or a front line team member in a service provider) can instantly look up exactly the right relevant information, sourced from a reliable, curated source as an integrated part of what they are doing — from within whatever application they are using. Individuals can link it into their own records stored in their Personal Data Store and service providers can use it to build personalised information packs and resources for the people they&nbsp;serve.</p><p>Take the example of a service provider arranging an appointment with a person who needs support regarding a particular condition or situation. The appointment is being arranged seamlessly online (no need for letters or emails). It mentions some medications which need to be reviewed and plus some other services they might want to use. As soon as the medication is mentioned, a link to exactly the right place in the curated list is created, so that both sides can instantly see exactly the right information. Same for services and specifics relating to the health condition involved.</p><p>Or, looking at it the other way round, an individual can develop an ‘About Me’ profile that summarises all the key personal information about themselves and their condition, medications, support services etc. They can integrate this information seamlessly into their own records, with all the links stored in their personal data&nbsp;store.</p><p>They can then share this full profile with a new service provider as and when needed, so that the new service provider gets presented with all the key information they need straight away, without delay. This also means that the individual doesn’t keep on having to tell the same story to different people over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>Result: a much better quality service and process with much lower FERC (Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost) for both the individual and the service provider.</p> Getting the details&nbsp;right <p>Of course, explaining it like this makes it sound simple (as it should be). But behind this simple experience lies a lot of technicalities. So, for example, a key part of the Master Reference Data Service is the detailed support services for developers covering such issues as <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/mrd-api/mrd-authentication.html">authentication</a> to access the service, how <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/mrd-api/cross-service-search.html">cross-service search works</a>, and <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/developer-helpers.html">help support services</a>.</p><p>At a higher level, Figure One below sums up how we provide these services.</p>Figure One: Overview of how our Master Reference Data Services&nbsp;work<p>It starts with the curated data sources themselves (the coloured circles at the bottom of the diagram). We access the data from these curated data sources and crunch them so that a) people using different software languages or formats can easily access the data (interoperability) and b) so that the data they contain can be sliced and diced so that only those bits of data that are particularly relevant to a person at a particular time can be easily presented (configuration).</p><p>This means that if you are looking for information about a particular thing that may be referred to in a range of different curated databases, you can search for this information from within our service across all these different databases, all at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>For example, a patient with a particular condition could access information about the condition itself, information about medicines related to treating that condition, and about local services or community groups supporting people with that condition.</p><p>The top of the diagram then shows subscribers subscribing to any and all curated data sources that are relevant to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Currently these data sources include ALISS (A Local Information System for Scotland) and NHS curated content covering a wide range of&nbsp;areas.</p><p>ALISS is a service designed to help citizens find help and support close to them when they need it most. ALISS is maintained and published by the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE) and is funded by the Scottish Government.</p><p>The NHS databases cover:</p>  Health Conditions information for the top 600 health conditions experienced by People. Symptoms, assessments, testing, treatment and implications.  Live Well, which covers advice about healthy living, including eating a balanced diet, healthy weight, exercise, quitting smoking and drinking less alcohol, sexual health and addiction support.  Mental Health support. This covers feelings, symptoms and behaviours, mental health conditions, advice for life situations and events, self-help, mental health services, mental health for children, teenagers and young adults, talking therapies, medicine and psychiatry, social care, mental health and your&nbsp;rights.  Medicines This covers content about common medicines. Includes how and when to take the medicine, possible side effects and answers to common questions.  Pregnancy&nbsp;, including modular advice and guidance about trying for a baby, pregnancy, labour and&nbsp;birth.  <p>Many of these curated lists of information also link with each other. MRD makes it easy to link and pull them together into a seamless payload that can be integrated into any application. This reduces the amount of duplication involved across organisations and their applications, improves the data quality and reduces the complexity of delivering interoperability and integration.</p><p>Subscribers accessing this curated content via our MRD API can be confident that the information they are accessing is accurate and up-to-date. This is because each one of them is refreshed once a week to include any changes that may have been made in the last seven&nbsp;days.</p><p>The list of data services covered by our MRD service is continually growing. For example, we are in the process of adding the World Health Organisation’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine — Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) which is another standardised, multilingual vocabulary of clinical terminology that is used by physicians and other healthcare providers for the electronic exchange of health information.</p><p>We are seeking to enable standardised lists of the sorts of adaptations people may need in their homes if they are disabled, frail or at risk of falling, postcode look-ups, and (further into the future) comprehensive lists of operational GPs and dentists.</p><p>We also include (or will soon include) data services designed to help service providers improve the quality of the personal data they hold and share. These include personal data quality relating&nbsp;to:</p>  Race and Ethnicity, and Age Range classifications.  Activity and Measurement reference tables covering the full spectrum of datasets supporting wearables (for example relating to activity types, temperature, sleep and exercise)  Postcode and geolocation cross references  <p>The potential list is endless. In this blog we have only talked about health and care, but the concept applies to every aspect of life. The underlying goals and core processes remain the same: it’s all about bringing exactly the right information to people at the right time, as and when they need&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Personal data lies at the heart of every service that deals with an identified individual: we need to be able to access and use it to manage our lives better. But very often, for the service to really fulfil its function it needs to relate information about some important things of ‘the world out there’ to the specific needs and context of the individual, as identified by their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Very often, the key to service quality and efficiency is the ability to access and integrate both types of data so that all the right data is made available at the right time, and so that everybody involved can be confident that the information they are using is reliable (i.e. comes from a professionally curated&nbsp;source).</p><p>We have spent years developing our Master Reference Data Services so that both individuals and service providers can use data in this way.

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced decentralized identity (DI) <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">mobile wallet SDK</a> on the market—and the newly released version 2.0 has even more features for customers to apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a market leader in innovative <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity (DI)</a> technology offerings, Anonyome Labs is proud to bring version 2.0 of the Sudo Platform DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK to market. Like its <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">predecessor</a>, this SDK unites industry-standard DI protocols with <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>’s modularity, reliability and security, and then adds new features that give customers more options for applying the technology to their product suite.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a> is an application that sits on an ‘edge device’, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">wallet</a> and peer-to-peer services. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Learn more</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article we run through the technical specs of Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0, but here are the 5 ways the version 2.0 mobile wallet SDK is more advanced than its predecessor:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest v2.0 suite of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">Hyperledger Aries RFCs</a> for receiving and securely storing credentials and verifiably presenting credentials. Learn about how the banking industry is using <a href="https://anonyome.com/2024/02/revolutionizing-credit-union-kyc-reusable-credentials/">verifiable or reusable credentials</a>, for example.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 still supports <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Hyperledger Anoncreds</a>, and now also supports more credential and presentation formats, particularly <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs)</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adds support for Aries-based chat functionality, so users can exchange end-to-end encrypted chat messages with their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">DIDComm</a> connections.&nbsp; 
 



 
 The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">DI offerings</a>, such as in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Sudo Platform Cloud Agent Service</a> and the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform Decentralized Identity Relay</a>.&nbsp; 
 



 
 In future we will add into the SDK support for OpenID4VC and more of the latest Hyperledger Aries RFCs. This will be part of our new roadmap as we move on from the initial roadmap we outlined <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s now go into more detail about these 5 features:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK 2.0 adopts the latest Aries credential and presentation exchange RFCs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to expand its support for the Hyperledger Aries RFCs. Having already supported most of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile/README.md">Aries Interop Protocol (AIP)</a> 1.0 suite of protocols, we have progressed to the latest AIP 2.0 suite. To do this, we’ve implemented these new Aries RFCs into our edge agent:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2">Issue Credential Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0453)</a> for negotiating and receiving verifiable credentials from Aries issuers&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2">Present Proof Protocol 2.0 (RFC 0454)</a> for presenting verifiable credentials to Aries verifiers.&nbsp; 
 



<p>This means version 2.0 is significantly better than version 1.0 because it can receive and present credentials in a range of different formats, such as W3C VCs, in addition to Anoncreds. We discuss these new supported formats below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As was the case with version 1 of the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK, we implement the core of these Aries RFCs by leveraging and contributing to the open-source Hyperledger project that Anonyome co-maintains: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">Aries-VCX</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for W3C credentials and presentations&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Using the latest Aries protocols for credential and presentation exchange, we built support for new credential and presentation formats, such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs and VPs</a>. This means our customers can pick and choose from a wider range of ‘DI flavours’ that best suit their business use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">previously analysed Anoncreds and W3C VCs</a>, both of which play a crucial purpose in the DI ecosystem. Some benefits the Edge Agent SDK’s support for W3C VCs offers include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Higher interoperability from standardization and widespread adoption as a result of being formalized by W3C&nbsp; 



 Highly flexible data structure in comparison to Anoncreds, including support for more complex credential structures such as nested attributes and lists, suitable for a broad range of applications&nbsp; 



 More maturity and backing by a global standard, with many implementations and growing adoption.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Where Anoncreds may beat W3C VCs is in its advanced privacy-preserving features. Anoncreds thrives in this area, with support for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">zero knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs) of credential attributes, and partial disclosure of credential attributes (only reveal the attributes that need to be revealed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To retain some of these privacy-preserving use cases in W3C VCs credentials, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK adds support for presenting selectively disclosed credentials using BBS+ cryptography (as defined in <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0646-bbs-credentials">Aries RFC 0646</a>). This means edge agent users can present a proof with a subset of their BBS credential’s attributes without revealing all the other attributes that may contain sensitive data. This is not otherwise possible with other W3C VC types, such as Ed25519-based VCs.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Version 2.0 adds support for end-to-end encrypted chatting&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>All Aries protocol messages transmitted between the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK and its peers (issuers, verifiers, etc.) are already end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), but with our added support for Aries “Basic Messages” (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>), our users can now send and receive text chat messages with their DIDComm connections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome has built a <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/decentralized-identity/edge-agent-sdk/messaging">comprehensive API around this feature</a>, with support for message storage and real-time subscriptions. This new suite of APIs allows our customers to build E2EE chat use cases into their applications, whether that is E2EE chat with an issuer or verifier (e.g. a bank or DMV), or with a fellow edge agent (mobile to mobile chat). The Edge Agent SDK supports these use cases.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The SDK exists in Anonyome’s suite of DI offerings&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Anonyome continues to advance its <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/decentralized-iam/">collection of DI offerings</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. The Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our edge agent against our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a> offering (in addition to a suite of open-source Aries agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 
 We have a rich roadmap ahead for the SDK&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 



<p>Maturing into its second stable release, the Sudo Platform Edge Agent SDK has achieved the roadmap tasks that we laid out in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">this article</a>. But given the evolving nature of the DI industry, Anonyome plans to continue adding new features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future for the SDK, we plan to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Implement V2 Aries protocols for connection establishment, particularly DIDExchange (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0023-did-exchange">RFC 0023</a>) and Out-of-Band protocol (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">RFC 0434</a>)&nbsp; 



 Implement parts of the <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID4VC</a> DI stack, allowing the Edge Agent SDK to receive and present credentials with a wider audience of standards, particularly the EUDI’s <a href="https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/arf.md">Architecture and Reference Framework</a>&nbsp; 



 Expand the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:indy, and did:peer, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents.&nbsp;

  <p>Today, we're excited to announce the general availability of user insights in Microsoft Entra External ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User insights, which was launched in public preview in October 2023, is a powerful tool that enables admins and developers to gain deeper insights into their customers’ behavior, preferences, and challenges. It provides key metrics such as monthly active users (MAU), daily active users (DAU), new users added, requests over time, authentications over time, multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage by type, and MFA success versus failure rates. You can also filter and segment the data by time range, operating system, country, and application id. With user insights, you can:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Analyze the trends and patterns of your customers’ application login and registration activity and discover new opportunities for growth and improvement. 
 Optimize user experience and identity management strategies for your customers and make data-driven decisions that align with your business goals and user needs. 
 Build customized dashboards in tools like Power BI using user insights from Microsoft Graph APIs, allowing more flexibility and control of your customer identity data.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access user insights, you need to have a <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> external tenant. Once you have your tenant ready, you can access the dashboards on the <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDUserInsights">Microsoft admin center</a> or access raw data via <a href="https://aka.ms/userInsightsGraphAPIs">Microsoft Graph APIs</a>. The features we’re announcing today provide significant value and are based on direct feedback from our preview customers. Sign up for your free trial <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_B2CAdmin/Trialtenantcreation.reactview/isFromDevHub/true">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Export data to Excel for offline analysis 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘export to Microsoft Excel’ feature is a convenient way to access raw data from the dashboards to suit different user preferences and use cases. You will now be able to export data in comma-separated values (CSV) format to facilitate the seamless importation and manipulation of data with Excel, or any other preferred CSV editor. This allows customers to use data offline for their own customized analysis and manipulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Export authentications data to Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can filter data by language and identity provider to get more insights into the preferences and behavior of your users. For example, you can see which languages are most popular among your users and how they vary across applications and regions. You can also see which identity providers are used the most for authentication and how they may affect the user experience and retention. These filters help you tailor and optimize your identity management solution for different user segments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Analyze authentications data by identity provider or language customization</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improving user experience and security with MFA failure insights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA failure chart shows the number of sign-in attempts that failed due to MFA issues and why they failed. You can see the breakdown by three categories:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Bad request: the sign-in request was malformed or invalid. 
 MFA denied: the user entered the wrong verification code or declined the MFA request. 
 MFA incomplete: the user did not complete the MFA request within the time limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This breakdown can help you understand the common causes of MFA failures so you can target your resources and improve the user experience and security of your applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Monthly MFA failures insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identify potential issues with user retention, engagement, and satisfaction 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inactive users are users who have not signed in over a certain period. You can see the number of daily and monthly inactive users in your applications, as well as the trend over time. This metric can help you monitor user engagement and identify areas where you can improve your user experience or offer incentives to re-engage your users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To be competitive in an era of accelerating consumer expectations, deploying a seamless application experience for personal lending, mortgage, tenant screening and other use cases is a must. Slower, resource-laden manual processes invite higher consumer drop-off rates, introduce inefficiencies and can be vulnerable to fraudsters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Mastercard Open Banking, provided by Finicity</a>, a Mastercard company, is equipping its customers with the capabilities to deliver smarter and more efficient digital lending experiences.&nbsp; With the expansion of its Verification of Income and Employment (VOIE) solution to include credentialed payroll, Mastercard Open Banking enables consumers to permission access to their payroll account data, mitigating the need to collect income documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A more efficient digital experience within the loan application process is precisely what open banking customers need – and credentialed payroll delivers a seamless, secure income and employment verification process, and reliable data at speed. The latest VOIE innovation populates consumer-permissioned data directly into the correct fields, creating a fast, secure digital experience that can boost profitability while making life easier for your applicants and employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 *Update, July 30, 2024: Credentialed payroll data gets a boost 



<p><a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/">Fannie Mae</a> has authorized the use of Finicity, a Mastercard Company’s credentialed payroll data, sourced from <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a>, for Day 1 Certainty® eligibility. The data will be enabled through the <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/desktop-underwriter-desktop-originator">Desktop Underwriter®</a> (DU®) validation service July 30, 2024, providing the additional benefit of rep and warranty relief on validated components to our mortgage clients.  &nbsp;</p>



 Strong partnerships that drive industry-leading innovations&nbsp; 



<p>Mastercard Open Banking teamed up with industry-leading payroll data aggregator <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a> to power this expanded VOIE solution. With 90%+ coverage of the U.S. workforce, financial institutions can now digitally verify an applicant’s income and employment in just moments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re excited to partner with Mastercard Open Banking to make digital verification of income and employment widely available through our trusted network of consumer-permissioned connections,” said Brian Geary, COO at Argyle. “Together, we are creating smarter lending experiences, free from time-consuming manual touchpoints while achieving faster and more accurate verification​s​,” he added. The combined capabilities of Mastercard Open Banking and Argyle are driving VOIE to be an efficient, flexible solution that comes in at a much more affordable price point than other income and employment verification options, poised to benefit financial institutions and consumers alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mastercard Open Banking’s new credentialed payroll enhancement was one of the simplest product launches we have done,” said Josh Cilman, EVP at <a href="https://intercoastalmortgage.com/">Intercoastal Mortgage</a>. “The new experience integrated smoothly into our existing processes with no impact to loan processing workflows and an efficient borrower experience. We are excited to digitize our loan application experience with a much more cost-effective way to verify income and employment.”&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/"></a>



 Multiple verification solutions to fit your business&nbsp; 



<p>Credentialed payroll is just the latest addition to Mastercard Open Banking’s growing list of digital income and employment verification solutions for smarter and faster decisioning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mastercard Open Banking’s Deposit Income verification solution analyzes direct deposit streams from the consumer’s permissioned bank account data to identify an applicant’s income.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Freddie Mac launched Loan Product Advisor® (LPASM) asset and income modeler (AIM) for income using direct deposits in March 2022 with Mastercard Open Banking as an initial service provider. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/">Fannie Mae</a> announced general availability of Deposit Income as part of their <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/fannie-mae-single-source-mortgage-verification/">Desktop Underwriter</a> (DU®) validation service. These solutions help streamline the mortgage origination process for lenders and homebuyers while expanding opportunities for home ownership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mastercard Open Banking solutions are used by financial institutions and decision makers in varied use cases, including mortgage lenders, tenant screeners, personal lenders, credit card issuers and more.&nbsp; Credentialed payroll and Deposit Income solutions provide financial institutions with the high conversion, affordable income, and employment solutions they seek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bank account and payroll account data can be used independently or in combination to enhance the customer experience depending on the institution’s needs and workflows.&nbsp;</p>



 Partner with Mastercard to create better consumer experiences&nbsp; 



<p>The Mastercard Open Banking platform delivers next-generation financial experiences that delight consumers. The platform serves as a one-stop shop for digital verifications, with the capabilities to verify assets, balances, income, employment, cash flow and much more, seamlessly and at scale. Credentialed payroll and Deposit Income solutions are available today through Mastercard Open Banking’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">lending solutions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

However, this growth raises concerns about user privacy, as the platforms hosting these AI models have access to user prompts. Additionally, current AI models rely heavily on massive datasets collected by companies like Google and Apple. This raises serious privacy issues, leaving users with limited control over how their data is used or shared with third-party AI applications — an issue highlighted this week by Elon Musk concerned over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-threatens-to-ban-apple-devices-from-his-companies-over-apples-chatgpt-integrations/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR2K_DlRORkitf6kBZVTorsh3W64663-PNK-ExzV9zx6H8LHiPv7XY4e5Cg_aem_AVW1-MwMaFA5GMtlf7_siBeB9-CUFrVkXMAJYMYnJE2yDYIyW8MjCCuXwPSTayn58GSe-zxA7fOhLOD5gl-9I8Aj&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cDovL20uZmFjZWJvb2suY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKEoZL7MjliCI3GlDaGDr-8aRRXmWkqMLs1Ar2WAga-5sYOiWBPkvQw2do73Z-1yb9xspwsbX84inSCz1IfyRggrbIHSos5V7iXm5EIWNUDe_trHriGtXI0tJDKhqv0pMH_prSr-s1RneR9UpmQzc14Nxa8rwrO_AmCSSY6dsenG&amp;guccounter=2">Apple’s ChatGPT integration</a>.</p><p>Verida is on a mission to ensure everyone is in control of their own identity and data, without the need to rely on third parties.

 We sit down with our internal subject matter expert in the telecommunications industry to learn what trends this sector is seeing, predictions on where it is headed as well as advice for the future. 



<p>Telecommunications is becoming an ever-growing market, not only because we live in a connected world but also because the number of devices and network connections just keeps increasing. One recent study predicts that <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/5g-iot-connections-to-surpass-100-mn/">5G IoT (Internet of Things) connections will reach 116 million globally by 2026</a>. This industry is therefore confronted with many challenges as the number of devices and connections continues to rise.</p>



<p>According to an identity verification survey conducted by Regula in 2023, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202312/telecoms-turn-to-identity-verification-as-fraud-concerns-soar">9 out of 10 organizations in the telecommunications industry consider identity verification (IDV) a crucial tool in combating the increasing threat of identity fraud</a>. Furthermore, in the coming years, <a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/information-technology/images/infographics/2024-cio-agenda/2024-cio-agenda-infographics/2024-cio-agenda-banking-and-investment-infographic">CIOs will increase investments by 83% in Integration Technologies/APIs/API Architecture according to Gartner</a>. But fraud isn’t the only challenge this industry faces. Telecommunications needs to stay up-to-date and meet the demands that modern technology brings to the table, or shall I say device, if it is to have any future. Since smart devices are as common and habitual as brushing one’s teeth, the direction in which this industry is headed is one in which needs to stay ahead of the curve or get left behind in the pile of outdated technology.</p>



<p>We spoke with Duke Golden, Director Sales at IDnow, with his almost 30 years within the industry and past experiences at 1NCE, Huawei and Vodafone to name just a few, to learn what topics in the telecommunications sector are trending, his predictions on where this industry is headed and his advice for telco operators.</p>



 As an industry that is perhaps overlooked due to the fact that it is very much part of our everyday lives and common for the generations that grew up within this technology boom, what major trends would you say the telecommunications industry is therefore seeing? 



<p>Telecommunications in our daily lives is almost invisible these days – but it is truly the foundation for our digital lives. It’s just something that you think should be there. I’ve been in the telecommunications industry for about 25 years now. But you’re right, that comment is very much what you get from a generation that grew up with the Internet. But there is a lot that goes into this. Everything we enjoy today from dating apps to ordering groceries, telecommunications is the driving force behind all of these innovations. Nothing happens without a network connection.</p>



<p>To describe it in a different way, network connectivity has very much become a commodity, especially over the last 10-15 years. Connectivity is like bread, milk, eggs, oil, gas—it’s just something we need for our everyday life. However, the struggle right now within the telecommunications industry, especially with regards to Tier-1 operators, is that they need to find a way to make that connectivity into something like a value add for their customers. It can’t just be about the connectivity. The question now is what do telecommunications operators do with that connectivity? They have a great opportunity to do something really special, being the owner of the network connectivity.</p>



<blockquote><p>So right now we’re at a point where telecommunications providers really need to provide new solutions, incorporating their connectivity to bring additional value add to customers.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>A big part of that value add for customers is the IoT—API driven economies. What they’re doing is basically providing the connectivity and then a platform for API integration for a million different types of services that are intrinsically connected to their connectivity.</p>



<p>But how do you monetize connectivity? You have to create an ecosystem where you can generate revenue based on new ideas using that connectivity. Telecommunications providers still want connectivity to be at the center of their proposition but the really interesting and attractive part for customers is the ability to monetize this in a variety of forms. And this is where the IoT starts to come in.</p>



 Yes, IoT (Internet of Things) seems to be one of those trends on the radar within telecom, why is this the case? 



<p>IoT is evolving to become one of the most disruptive and enabling technologies for end users in recent memory. It’s revolutionizing the way we approach network connectivity and digitalization in our daily lives. In the beginning it was just machine to machine which was basically the first iteration of the IoT.</p>



<p>IoT is basically a blank canvas for an artist to use connectivity to paint a picture which didn’t exist before, and that’s what’s happening with the IoT, especially with telco-driven IoT initiatives. Because it’s not just the telcos who are doing IoT. It is a hugely competitive and largely proprietary space where the only limitation to business cases is the creator’s imagination. This is where only the strongest telcos will prosper. Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has a very strong expert approach to IoT which can accommodate entire ecosystems to create business value for their customers.</p>



<p>Now, the pressure on the telecom world is really to bring the knowledge that they have, not just about networks but about industry verticals themselves, into play to develop something meaningful for individual customers.</p>



 What tools and resources will help these initiatives in the telco sector? 



<p>What we do at IDnow is possibly one of the most important enabling solutions within the IoT potentially. One of my goals is to connect IDnow into this API economy so customers of a telco service have the option to conduct an ID verification process. To date, IoT has been more concerned with locating individual devices. A lot of people think IoT is a device-driven type of world where you don’t need to know the person behind it. But that’s changing, especially with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">AI and deepfakes</a>. You can really manipulate a traditional device-based IoT network in a big way unless you verify who the person is working on the IoT platform. You really need to know who has access and who is accessing the platform. Maybe it doesn’t have to be a deep dive, but the key with IoT is trust.</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is the number one factor that will either enable a customer to deploy a telco-based IoT solution or will stop it in its tracks.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>If there are doubts about the authenticity of the platform, or the ability for that platform to control unauthorized usage, then a lot of times IoT initiatives never make it off the ground, especially in Germany. It’s all about 1% risk means 100% opposition in many cases. Germany has kind of a very strict sense when it comes to these things like 0 risk is the only acceptable risk.</p>



 Since trust is the number one factor within telco, the term Zero Trust with regards to network connections and security has been used a lot recently. Is this something widespread in the telecommunications industry? 



<p>Zero Trust is widely used. That is a term that you will hear everywhere from network engineers to security operations technicians. Zero trust—trust nothing. The reason that it has become popular is because security has become completely endangered, especially over the last five to 10 years. In the network engineering world, there are different points of ingress into the network. In the past before IoT, before cloud, before all these other innovative ways to connect to the Internet, the Internet protocol basically protected these environments. They were standardized environments where you could only enter them with a specific network protocol and it was much easier to protect them. Zero Trust wasn’t really needed at that point because you knew that if someone broke into the network, it was an inside job.</p>



<p>Now, anyone has the opportunity to interface with any layer of the network from a completely unverified position. So Zero Trust was born, and it became probably the strongest terminology used especially in the telco world. You need to verify every single user to a different degree. For example, if you’re talking about an online dating platform, you don’t need to verify everything about this person’s character. You just need to verify they are over 18. Zero Trust doesn’t mean you have to conduct a complete background check on every single individual person, but you need to know who you’re dealing with.</p>



 With the need to verify a person and bind them to the device they are using, will there be hesitation from users with concerns to data privacy? 



<p>Enterprises want to know more about their customers because the more they know the better they can serve their customers. Nothing is for free. A well-known CEO of a cybersecurity company once told me, if you are getting something for free, then you are the product. Thus, we’re not dealing in a cash-based economy anymore. True value lies in information these days.</p>



<p>And with regards to the telecommunications industry, there is a huge push right now to monetize in different ways the connectivity that they’re already providing to people. With the price of connectivity sinking daily, the push now for telcos is to recover that depreciation in the cost of actual connectivity in extra value-added services like IoT, like cloud services, 5G campus Networks and other digitalization initiatives. And the key to all these other value-added services is to verify who those services are going to, not only for the safety and security aspect, but having the knowledge to serve their customers better. That knowledge for telecommunications providers is essential to designing or altering services to fit specific types of the widest possible scope of business cases.</p>



<p>As with all new initiatives, especially from my experience in Europe, there will be hesitation. But it depends on the country and on the culture. Every society globally is very different when it comes to their aversion to risk. At the end of the day, it’s all about the economy and people’s ability to pay for things, either with money or information.</p>



<p>While there might be kickback in conservative countries like Germany, the vast majority of the world will have no problem with signing up for services and giving them a certain amount of information. But it needs to be tied to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a> because the only way to really increase security in a very complicated online services world is to start with a single point of truth. And the only way to truly verify who a person is, is by verifying their identity. But they can’t only be verified one time. It needs to be an ongoing activity verifying and reverifying, especially with regards to critical infrastructure. And this is where the telecommunications industry and IDV is headed.</p>



 How regulated would you say is the IoT industry? For example, in Germany, there is the Telecommunications Act (TKG) but are there any other regulations? 



<p>With regards to the IoT specifically, IoT is still very much wild, wild West. There is very little regulation.</p>



<p>I think there is a serious risk that the IoT can become too dangerous in some ways if we don’t regulate ourselves using best practice instead of waiting for regulatory agencies to act. The difference between traditional telecommunications networks and IoT networks is that telecom networks are completely standardized internally and with IoT all of these solutions are proprietary. There is no standardization within the IoT industry. So that means our ability to secure the IoT is much less than with standardized industry standards like on the traditional network side which have well thought out, highly developed security protocols built into them.</p>



<p>What better place to secure the IoT than at the point of ingress for all users, both internal and external? That means performing a comprehensive ID verification process for admins and users, depending on what type of IoT platform it is. We just need to change our view on what is an acceptable level of risk.</p>



 With the number of smart devices continuing to increase and experts predicting that by 2030 the world population will be around 8.3 billion and the number of devices will have reached an estimated 43.2 billion, what are the main challenges this industry faces when considering these numbers? 



<p>Traditionally, in the IDV sector it’s been about verifying users before they buy their prepaid mobile or before they activate it and then they’re good to go. </p>



<blockquote><p>Now, verification needs to become an integral part of the entire value chain for technology, not just at the point of purchase, but at the point of usage.</p>Duke Golden, Director Sales</blockquote>



<p>The ID verification process is something that needs to be always going on in the background. And this is where the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0 regulation</a> would come into play with a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a>. But we’re just not there yet. Regulations will always be behind technology.</p>



<p>At IDnow and as an ID verification solutions provider, it’s our responsibility to fill the gap between regulation and everyday business risks that aren’t being addressed by the regulatory environment. Building this bridge of trust for our customers is our core mission which we take very seriously.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule applies to all crypto transactions above 1 CHF in Liechtenstein.  To operate legally in Liechtenstein, VASPs must register with the FMA and verify transaction parties’ identities.  VASPs must use blockchain analytics to verify and monitor transactions, especially with unhosted wallets in Liechtenstein.  <p>Since January 1, 2020, Liechtenstein has enforced the Blockchain Act (TVTG), creating a comprehensive legal structure for cryptocurrencies and related services.</p><p>Subsequent amendments to the Due Diligence Act (SPG) and the Due Diligence Ordinance (SPV) have integrated <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In Liechtenstein, the Travel Rule obliges VASPs to exchange detailed transaction-related personal information for all virtual asset transfers above the minimum threshold of 1 Swiss Franc&nbsp;(CHF).</p><p>This includes the full names, wallet addresses, and other identifying information of the transaction’s originator and beneficiary.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>VASPs in Liechtenstein must register as outlined in the TVTG, with the Financial Market Authority (FMA) having three months to respond to registration applications.</p><p>All VASPs must also verify the identities of counterpart VASPs, particularly when dealing with high-risk jurisdictions, and implement enhanced due diligence measures. These requirements apply to both domestic and cross-border transfers.</p><p>For Originators:</p>  Full name  Wallet address  One of the following: physical address, ID document number, customer identification number, or date and place of&nbsp;birth  <p>For Beneficiaries:</p>  Name  Wallet address  <p>If the required Travel Rule data is missing, incomplete, or delayed, the beneficiary VASP must implement risk-based procedures to identify and rectify gaps, potentially suspending or rejecting the transfer until compliance is achieved.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Liechtenstein, VASPs like cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services must adhere to the Travel Rule, supervised by the Financial Market Authority (FMA). This regulation is crucial for preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. Here’s what they need to&nbsp;do:</p> Registration and Licensing <p>VASPs must register and get licenses as per the Trustworthy Technologies Act (TVTG), with the FMA reviewing and approving these applications. This ensures that all VASPs meet high regulatory standards and contribute to a secure financial system.</p> Monitoring Transfers <p>Exchanges must monitor all transactions, especially those involving unhosted wallets that let owners directly control their private keys. This includes collecting extra information on these wallets during high-risk transactions to prevent illegal activities.</p><p>For this, VASPs must conduct laser-focused diligence and use blockchain analytics tools to verify the ownership of the wallets involved in transactions. Additionally, transactions involving these wallets must be scrutinized using blockchain analysis tools to ensure they do not facilitate money laundering or terrorist financing.</p> Risk-Based Policies <p>Both sending and receiving VASPs need to develop policies tailored for managing transfers involving unhosted wallets. These policies must focus on thorough verification and monitoring to align with local and international regulations.</p> Global Context <p>Liechtenstein enforces a low threshold for the Travel Rule, requiring compliance for transactions as small as 1 CHF. This is in contrast to places like the United States, where the threshold is $3,000, and Singapore, where it’s S$1,500. The European Union, on the other hand, is exploring the idea of applying the FATF Travel Rule to all crypto transactions, regardless of&nbsp;amount.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Since implementing the FATF Travel Rule in 2020, Liechtenstein requires detailed verification for cryptocurrency transactions over 1 CHF. This is in sharp contrast to the higher thresholds in <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a> and the potential for no minimum in the European Union. Liechtenstein’s strict approach aims to safeguard financial transactions and prevent illegal activities like money laundering and terrorism financing within its&nbsp;borders.</p> FAQs  1. What is the minimum threshold for the Travel Rule in Liechtenstein? <p>In Liechtenstein, the FATF Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrency transactions above 1 Swiss Franc&nbsp;(CHF).</p> 2. What information must VASPs collect and verify under the Travel Rule in Liechtenstein? <p>VASPs must collect and verify full names, wallet addresses, and additional identifying information such as a physical address, ID document number, customer identification number, or date and place of birth for both originators and beneficiaries in Liechtenstein.</p> 3. How must VASPs handle transactions involving unhosted&nbsp;wallets? <p>VASPs must use blockchain analytics tools to verify the ownership of unhosted wallets and conduct enhanced due diligence to prevent illegal activities in Liechtenstein.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>As we enter the era of generative AI, the risk of identity theft for both individuals and organizations is escalating. A <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">recent case</a> in Hong Kong highlights this threat, where an office was deceived into transferring $25 million after a video call with a deepfake CFO and colleagues. As advances in AI erode trust, it becomes apparent that a robust digital identity solution for organizations is urgently&nbsp;needed.</p><p>In the past few years, the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a> framework has emerged as one of the most promising solutions to this global crisis. The vLEI framework offers one of the most secure and trustworthy digital organization identity management to date and potentially revolutionizes digital business transactions worldwide.</p><p>Since vLEI is also still in its infancy, there is a significant challenge for the community to overcome its adoption hurdle. In this article, we propose 4 pragmatic criteria for identifying fair, good, and great use cases for vLEI from the adoptability perspective. These criteria are by no means rigid rules set in stone but serve as a useful mental model for pioneers and early adopters exploring vLEI use&nbsp;cases.</p> The 4&nbsp;Criteria <p>We have identified 4 criteria for good and great vLEI use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Use cases that involve organization-to-organization transactions  Use cases that involve cross-border transactions  Use cases that are highly regulated  Use cases that have open ecosystems   1. Org-to-Org <p>The first criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they involve organization-to-organization (Org-to-Org) transactions. This includes business-to-business (B2B), business-to-government (B2G), and government-to-government (G2G) use cases. This is because org-to-org transactions often involve significant monetary value, which far outweighs the initial friction associated with adopting&nbsp;vLEI.</p> 2. Cross-Border <p>Cross-border transactions often face challenges in identifying and verifying clients, suppliers, or partners across different countries, leading to significant perceived risks. The vLEI framework is ideal for addressing these challenges as it is specifically designed for international use. It can potentially streamline the cross-border identification and verification processes, mitigating risks and improving efficiency.</p> 3. Highly Regulated <p>Highly regulated use cases are subject to strict requirements and standards, where non-compliance can result in severe penalties or legal consequences. As a result, these use cases often require extensive due diligence of business partners, including Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>The process of obtaining vLEI for organizations and their representatives involves robust identity verification that is more stringent than those often conducted in the financial sector. As a result, vLEI, which is built on the global LEI system, can help streamline the due diligence process, significantly reducing compliance costs.</p> 4. Open Ecosystems <p>The final criterion for viable vLEI use cases is that they operate within open ecosystems, allowing the addition of organizations whose identities are not known in advance. Onboarding a new organization to the ecosystem often incurs significant cost, time, and effort. vLEI allows these onboarding costs to be offloaded to a third party, specifically a qualified vLEI issuer (QVI), which ensures that the organization and its representatives have undergone strict identity verification.</p> Fair, Good, and Great Use&nbsp;Cases  Great Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Great use cases are those that satisfy all 4 criteria, making them ideal candidates that could benefit from integrating vLEI into their workflows.</p><p>A prime example of a great use case is trade finance. It typically involves organizations (criterion 1) which are often located in different countries (criterion 2). Trade finance is also highly regulated, with financiers subject to AML and CFT requirements (criterion 3). The trade finance ecosystem is open, allowing any company worldwide to initiate trades and apply for, e.g., a letter of credit (criterion 4).</p> Good Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Good use cases are those that satisfy 3 out of the 4 criteria. We consider these use cases worth pursuing.</p><p>An example of a good use case is the financial reporting of banking institutions in Europe to the European <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-discussion-paper-centralisation-eea-banks">Banking Authority (EBA)</a>. This exemplifies a B2G scenario (criterion 1), encompassing banks across multiple European countries (criterion 2) that operate within a highly regulated environment (criterion 3). What makes this use case simply good rather than great in our criteria is that European banks are already known entities within the closed ecosystem supervised by the&nbsp;EBA.</p> Fair Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Fair use cases are those that satisfy two or fewer criteria. While they may be a feasible use case for vLEI, we consider them a low-potential candidate. We argue that fair use cases will become viable once vLEI has achieved widespread adoption. For instance, organizations that already possess vLEI for stronger use cases might contemplate applying it to these fair use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>An example of a use case we consider “fair” for vLEI is an HR platform. Such a platform is used internally between employers and employees (not org-to-org) and is also not highly regulated. Typically, employees and employers have alternative means to verify each other, diminishing the necessity for vLEI in this&nbsp;context.</p> Conclusion <p>While vLEI holds significant potential to transform global business operations, it currently faces a challenge known as the “cold start problem,” where there are not enough holders and use cases to foster exponential growth in the ecosystem. Pioneers and early adopters are encouraged to prioritize exploring high-potential use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Do you agree with our criteria? Are there additional criteria we should consider adding to the list? We welcome your feedback and invite you to contact us at contact@enauthn.id.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/4-criteria-for-great-vlei-use-cases-c5fa0e04a6f5">4 Criteria for Great vLEI Use Cases</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Beyond code, Copilot understands shipping <p>I know, we all drowned in “OMG” posts last year as people shared their AI experiences. We’re beyond that now; we’re looking for use cases, value adding application and bundling.</p><p>Nonetheless, I can’t hide from the fact that I had one of those OMG experiences yesterday. I was designing a JSON Schema for a Mill Test Report (MTR)— a document used in the Steel industry to describe the type and quality of steel products. MTRs can contain a large number of tests, and I had modeled a few of them&nbsp;already.</p><p>As I got to Surface Condition tests, I typed “surface” — and look what Github Copilot suggested…</p>Stupid amount of code generated.<p>As my colleague stated, it generated “stupid amount of code” for me. Not rocket science, mainly repeating a pattern of the previous tests — but still a lot I didn’t have to&nbsp;type.</p><p>But then I moved to generating an example JSON instance. Now&nbsp;look…</p>Copiloting on both horizontal and vertical&nbsp;domains.<p>As the test standard for Microstructure Analysis, it suggests “ASTM E112–13”. That is indeed a standard for microstructure analysis! Copilot pulls industry vertical knowledge into my Visual Studio Code environment. The fact that it “copilots” on both horizontal (the technical coding domain) and vertical (industry domain) is just…&nbsp;Cool!</p><p>In all fairness, Copilot subsequently suggested “ASTM E112–13” again for Hydrostatic Tests, which (to my knowledge) does not define such test standards. I guess it got carried away a bit there. Human vigilance is still required. But that hardly takes away from the coolness of this AI experience.</p><p>You can find the resulting Mill Test Report schema and many more common, standardized shipping documents on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates">https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates</a>.</p><p>Transmute is committed to digitizing supply global chains, applying modern cryptography standards for more efficient, automated, and safer cross-border trade. <br>Sign up for free now on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/templates">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p><p>Nis Jespersen<br>Solution Architect<br>Transmute<br>https://platform.transmute.industries</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/yet-another-ai-139896e24b67">Yet another AI 🤯</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 In the age of the Internet of Things, autonomous and connected cars are revolutionizing the way we drive. As these vehicles become increasingly sophisticated, verifying user identity is becoming a crucial issue in ensuring safety and preventing fraud. Let’s explore the challenges and solutions associated with this mobility revolution. 



<p>By 2025, it is estimated that <a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/braincamps/planet/how-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-of-the-digital-sector/internet-of-things-50-billion-greenhouse-gas-producers/">50 billion objects will be connected worldwide</a>, covering everything from household appliances to urban infrastructure. Among these objects, cars occupy a prominent place, with functionalities multiplying at an impressive rate. According to <a href="https://www.geotab.com/blog/what-is-connected-car/">Geotab</a>, the smart device is what has changed the game the most in recent years. As technology advances, connected vehicles become more sophisticated, offering advanced functionality that goes far beyond simple driving. These advances are not just limited to improving mechanical and safety aspects, but also extend to features that enhance the overall experience for drivers and passengers.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://www.febiac.be/en/article/connectivity-in-cars-seen-from-all-aspects">Belgian Automobile Federation (FEBIAC)</a> explains: “There are two types of connected cars. The first category has a 4G/5G card that vehicles use to be constantly connected to the Internet, and more specifically to the manufacturer’s online services. The second category connects via your smartphone, whose screen will be replicated on that of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>Connected cars are increasingly integrating smartphones into their ecosystems, thanks in particular to the democratization of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple CarPlay</a> and <a href="https://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a>. As Apple points out, it’s now possible to integrate your iPhone with your car’s digital keys, to open and start your vehicle. Users are now able to link their phone to their vehicle, enabling them to benefit from functions such as remote opening and starting, or purchasing options directly from their phone.</p>



<p>However, such functionalities require a high level of user verification. With the <a href="https://www.confused.com/meet-our-experts/content/automotive-hacking-and-connected-cars">risk of hacking on the rise</a>, it is essential to protect against fraud and identity theft by adopting appropriate solutions.</p>



 Connectivity: the new spearhead of the automotive sector. 



<p>Connected cars have opened up a whole new world of opportunities for automakers and end-users alike. Connectivity has made a major contribution to enhancing the driving experience, through the deployment of new functionalities. These include:</p>



  Predictive maintenance, thanks to remote diagnostic modules, or maintenance notifications based on real-time analysis of vehicle data;  Personalized services, such as notification of available parking spaces nearby, or suggestions for restaurants and services based on location;  Entertainment and connectivity, including smartphones accessing streaming services, or compatible applications from stores;  Remote control and command, enabling the vehicle to be locked, unlocked or started remotely, or the vehicle temperature to be preset.  



<p>Some of these advantages require a connection with a smartphone to operate. More and more cars no longer need a key to start, for example. Cards are gradually replacing ignition keys. They can also be dematerialized on a smartphone, for even greater convenience. This is one of the reasons behind the success of car-sharing services such as <a href="https://getaround.com/">Getaround</a> or <a href="https://zity.eco/en/">Zity</a>, which rely on remote unlocking of vehicles, thanks to strong user identification.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/critical-information-systems-and-cybersecurity/news/new-security-methodology-connected-cars">Thales</a> points out, another crucial point in terms of security for connected vehicles lies in web applications. These enable “the exchange of information between the vehicle and/or driver and the manufacturer’s IT system. If the authentication process is not secure enough, an attacker can enter a user’s account and take control of the vehicle.”</p>



<p>For all these reasons, strong identification measures are essential to anticipate these new uses.</p>



 



 

 



 Securing new uses through identification. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">car-sharing</a> is one of the benchmark use cases, there are other situations in which it may be useful to identify the driver of a vehicle. Lending a vehicle to an employee, rental between private individuals or even self-service cars are all examples of uses that justify better identification of the driver.</p>



<p>These new uses require strong authentication of users using their smartphone, as well as identification of the smartphone by the vehicle. This begins as soon as the vehicle is delivered, where an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> check and biometric verification can be carried out, in order to associate a user with his or her account.</p>



<p>When a key is exchanged digitally with another user, it is necessary for the user to prove his or her identity. By going through the same identification and authentication process as the owner, both parties can optimize the security of vehicle access.</p>



<p>It is also possible to request an additional biometric element to reinforce authentication. For example, the use of biometric features such as facial recognition can add an extra layer of security, allowing the user to access their account in complete safety. Many modern smartphones are equipped with biometric sensors that can be used to authenticate the user before allowing them to unlock the vehicle. Even if an ill-intentioned person has the smartphone of the vehicle’s rightful owner, it will not be possible for him or her to gain access, or even worse, to start it.</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re helping to enhance the security of connected vehicles by offering <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">ID document verification</a> via our APIs, capable of handling over 3,000 ID documents from 195 countries. By leveraging the latest technologies in facial recognition and life detection, we are able to confirm the physical presence of the person during the verification process. By integrating these technologies and strategies, manufacturers and users of connected vehicles can ensure secure identification of users via their smartphones, minimizing the risk of fraud.</p>



 Anticipating future uses. 



<p>As vehicles become increasingly autonomous and integrated into our daily lives, reliable and secure identification systems are essential to protect drivers and their vehicles. Faced with these new uses, we need to think about security and identification, both on the user side and on the component side. Proactive measures will have a positive impact on users’ peace of mind and their confidence in connected cars.</p>
