<p>I think most of us are ready to put 2020 behind us, closing off final deals and crossing the finish line on projects we may never have expected to need to prioritise this year. We’ve all learnt a lot in a short space of time, not least the critical value of flexible digital infrastructure to support whatever the years ahead may bring for businesses.</p>
<p>Whilst we’re not entirely sure what’s in store for 2021 and beyond, we do know that three digital trends are likely to stay whatever happens next. The first is simply the increase in digital interactions as customers need to transact online, or now prefer its convenience. The second is the subsequent rise in cyberattacks as bad actors take advantage of the increased opportunity for manipulation. The third is the growth of remote working, which most agree is here to stay in some capacity, increasing the likelihood of privileged access over the public internet and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).</p>
<p>Here are three, important yet oft-forgotten, identity management principles to help guide us through the security, customer experience and operational efficiency challenges that these trends present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data collection – less is more 
<p>We’ve seen it with the media’s scrutiny of Covid tracing apps and social media’s role in the US election – more and more people are waking up to their right to privacy. Perhaps not all of us value our privacy as much as we should, but certainly awareness of data privacy is growing and transparency over data use is key.</p>
<p>Best-practice identity management can help you practice the principle of data minimisation – essentially only asking for data that is absolutely necessary, and not keeping it for longer than needed. So if I’m signing up for a music streaming service, it may need to know some aspects of my identity – like my email address and bank details – but, according to data minimisation, would not need to know my gender. The service may prefer to know my gender so its marketing team can analyse demographics, but it is not necessary to my use of the service. Many apps, like Instagram, will make these fields optional to avoid registration abandonment.</p>
<p>It’s important to offer a self-service account management capability, so that users can manage their own identity data and view what you know about them. It’s also important to be transparent around what you know and why you need to know it, in order to build trust with your customers. The good news is that many users are still happy to provide non-essential data if there is value for them in doing so. For example, if you let them know that this will enable you to personalise the service that you’re providing to them. This results in more loyal customers and more successful marketing/sales teams who can target their efforts based on up-to-date information – not information that’s been assumed or has expired in your CRM.</p>
<p>Speaking of your CRM, make sure it’s integrated with your app’s identity and access management. By integrating these systems, you avoid data siloes and wasting time and money on either updating each system individually or not leveraging the most up-to-date information for sales/other processes.</p>
<p>Finally, avoid asking your customers to provide identity credentials when it’s not necessary. By employing single sign-on (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-sso/">SSO</a>) and step-up authentication, you can achieve the correct balance of robust security and seamless customer experience. SSO means that customers only need one set of login credentials to sign into all authorised services. If one particular service requires stronger authentication than the others, for example billing, then you can step up authentication for just that service (i.e. require another authentication factor, as we’ll see in the next principle).</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA is a basic requirement 
<p>Multi-factor authentication (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/authentication-mfa/">MFA</a>) is no longer a security gold standard; it is just standard. As a reminder, MFA is the use of more than one authentication factor (like a username/password plus a fingerprint scan). Customers generally fall into two camps – the camp that cares about their online security so will demand MFA availability, and the other camp who don’t really care and won’t go looking for it (and are therefore more likely to present a breach risk to your organisation). You must offer MFA to your users and, if you don’t enforce it, encourage them to set it up. If you don’t have MFA in place by the end of 2020, 2021 is the year you must find the time and budget for it. Not doing so may mean much more budget and time spent on dealing with a data breach down the line.</p>
<p>Remember that not all authentication factors are created equally. Some, like a password or social media login, are unlikely to be strong enough when used on their own as they can be hacked more easily than other methods. Others, like a bank ID or authenticator app time-based one-time password (TOTP), are stronger as they’re harder to hack. Whichever combinations you decide to enable for access to your application should reflect the sensitivity of the data you’re storing, the geographical location of your users and your regulatory context. It’s also a good idea to provide options, as only providing one choice will alienate certain users (e.g. some users may not have social media accounts or may be unable to provide certain biometric data).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Least Privilege 
<p>It can be hard to keep on top of which accounts have access to which systems internally, let alone with your (usually more numerous) external customers and/or partners. The principle of least privilege denotes that user accounts should only ever have the minimum access authorisation necessary to their role in the service. I’ll cover two examples.</p>
<p>The first example is with remote employees. When staff are in the office, it may be easy to identify anyone who should not be accessing your company systems and stop them before they do any damage. After all, they’d have to be sat in front of a team that knew them for an imposter. But with the increase in remote working, it’s more likely that bad actors could take advantage of the anonymity and gain unauthorised access to an account. If this does happen, you’ll want the hacked user’s account to have access to as little data as possible to minimise what information is visible/vulnerable to the hacker.</p>
<p>The second example is a business to business use case. Say you run an online service for your business partners, where several employees within the partner business need access to your service. The easiest thing to do is give everyone at the partner business an account with the same level of privilege. However, this would mean that if any of those accounts are hacked, the hacker also gains full access rights. But the accounts don’t all need access to every area, so this method presents an unnecessary risk. Perhaps only an administrator needs to have access to billing, while an ordinary member only needs enough access to upload documents. Here, different access rights levels reduce the risk of more sensitive areas being hacked. In this example, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/delegated-authority/">Delegated Authority</a> streamlines how you handle these access levels by giving the partner business administrator control over their own employee invitations. This saves both businesses time and, therefore, money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final thoughts 
<p>With life online taking centre stage right now, digital identity is still firmly under the spotlight. How we protect and make life easier for our online users now will ultimately have a huge impact on business success, regardless of how long it takes to return to ‘normality’.</p>
<p>Of course, these principles above are only three out of a long list, but it would be wise to keep returning to these and asking yourself and your team if you continue to do enough on each.</p>

<p>Before you get started on the actual application, however, let’s take a look at Spring Data for a moment.</p>

 What is Spring Data? 

<p>Spring Data is a behemoth. Spring calls it an “umbrella” framework. It ties together a large number of different sub-projects that aim to provide a consistent programming interface for everything from SQL and Postgres, to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. It also natively supports technologies such as Hibernate, JDBC, LDAP, KeyValue stores, Geode, and GemFire. Community modules add support for many other projects, such as Couchbase, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, Neo4j, and Apache Solr. The idea is to bring all of these technologies together with a consistent and familiar (to Spring developers, anyway) interface that makes it easy to implement and maintain applications using these technologies.</p>

<p>In a Java web service, Spring Data can provide a number of important functions. It allows the developer to quickly and easily declare data objects or entities using simple annotated Java classes. Spring Data will automatically map the annotated Java class to an appropriate persistence structure. It also provides a repository interface that manages reading from and writing to the database using an intuitive, query-like method structure. Finally, in some cases, it will even expose the data model and repository to the web, creating a REST service.</p>

<p>All of this means that, as you will see, with a few simple files, you can define your data model using a Java class, seamlessly persist it to a database, and expose that data in a secure RESTful web service.</p>

<p>Spring Data works well with Spring Boot, providing a super-efficient way to create web applications without having to code a whole lot of configuration and boilerplate code. Using Spring Boot and Spring MVC, RESTful web services can be created in minutes with only a handful of files and a few dozen lines of code.</p>

<p>Spring Data also supports reactive programming (asynchronous, non-blocking). The Spring WebFlux sub-project provides the reactive web server features for Spring Boot, and when combined with the relatively new R2DBC project (for relational databases) or Reactive Repositories (for NoSQL) you can build an entirely reactive web service.</p>

<p>The vision behind Spring Data is that, ideally, the same data model code and business logic code could be used with a variety of databases, and that switching between them would only require changing some dependencies and the implemented repository interface. In reality, this is asking a lot of abstraction. Typically, one chooses SQL or MongoDB because of features specific to that database, features that are not shared by all other databases. Fortunately, Spring Data exposes the unique, individual features of each database. Spring Data strikes a nice balance between simplification and abstraction while preserving database-specific features and deep customization.</p>

<p>That’s a TON of options. Let’s narrow it down. The first decision one needs to make is what database suits the needs of the application. In this case, you’re going to use a relational database (SQL). More specifically, you’re going to use the default Hibernate in-memory database that Spring Boot and Spring Data include by default when configuring a project.</p>

<p>This database is great for testing, example applications, and mock-ups. It’s quick and easy because it doesn’t require setting up an external database. It doesn’t persist between sessions, which for testing and for example apps, may be exactly what you need. Also, when you decide it’s time to move to a database that’s not in-memory, all you have to do is update some dependencies and add a little configuration.</p>

 Spring Data JPA Overview 

<p>Since you’re going to be using a relational database, you’re also going to be using Spring Data JPA. JPA is the Java Persistence API. JPA is a specification that outlines how Java objects can be mapped to database tables. Historically, JPA has only supported SQL databases, however, this is changing with EclipseLink and JPA 2.2. Spring Data JPA is the implementation of this JPA specification. This technology is what will allow you to create a plain Java class with a few annotations and expect it to be seamlessly mapped to and from the database.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>You’ll need to install a few things before you get started.</p>

 
   Java 11: This tutorial uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. You can find instructions on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. You can install OpenJDK using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another great option for installing and managing Java versions. 
   HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you’ll use to test the WebFlux server. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>. 
   Okta CLI: You’ll use this to bootstrap your project. Follow the installation instructions on <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">the project’s GitHub page</a>. 
 

<p>You’ll need a free Okta developer account to complete this tutorial. However, the Okta CLI will walk you through the registration process or allow you to log in using your credentials.</p>

 Bootstrap a Spring Data JPA Project with the Okta CLI 

<p>Open a shell and, in a reasonable parent folder location, and run the Okta CLI.</p>

   <code>okta start spring-boot
</code>   

<p>If you haven’t used the Okta CLI before, you’ll be prompted to create an account. If you have an Okta account already, you can sign in using <code>okta login</code>.</p>

<p>You’ll see the following:</p>

   <code>Configuring a new OIDC Application, almost done:
Created OIDC application, client-id: 0oa168nw50nxJSSmg4x7

Change the directory:
    cd spring-boot

Okta configuration written to: src/main/resources/application.properties
Don't EVER commit src/main/resources/application.properties into source control

Run this application with:
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>At this point, you can run the app.</p>

   <code>cd spring-boot
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open a browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>CAUTION: If you get an <code>invalid target release: 11</code> error, it’s likely because you’re using Java 8. This tutorial requires Java 11. Time to upgrade! 😛</p>

<p>If you’re already logged into Okta, you’ll be directed to a page that displays “Hello: &lt;username&gt;”. If not, you’ll be directed to Okta to log in via OpenID Connect (OIDC). This is the default configuration. You’re going to change this to behavior from a client login flow to a JWT-based, resource server flow.</p>

<p>TIP: If you’re not familiar with OpenID Connect, resource servers, and all that jazz, you might want to check out <a>An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.</p>

<p>Create a new Java class that will update the security configuration. This file temporarily allows all requests, effectively disabling security. You’ll change this later in the tutorial to enable JWT authentication.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/SecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt;
                authorizeRequests.antMatchers("/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated())
            .csrf().disable();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>SimpleRestController</code> static inner class in the <code>Application.java</code> file so that it doesn’t cause an error if there is an anonymous user.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/Application.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @RestController
    static class SimpleRestController {
        @GetMapping("/")
        String sayHello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
            return "Hello " + (oidcUser != null ? oidcUser.getFullName() : "anonymous");
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Use <code>Control-C</code> to stop the running process if you haven’t already and run it again (up arrow on most good shells).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Use HTTPie to test the root endpoint.</p>

   <code>http :8080
</code>   

<p>You should see the following:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200
...

Hello anonymous
</code>   

<p>This shows that you successfully made a request to the root endpoint of the unprotected Spring Boot resource server.</p>

 Create a Dinosaur Domain Model 

<p>What this world needs right now is some gigantic, prehistoric monsters, so, in order to demonstrate how to use Spring Data JPA, you’re going to create a dinosaur domain model and a dinosaur repository.</p>

<p>The first step in creating prehistoric monsters is, of course, adding the requisite dependencies to your Maven <code>pom.xml</code> file. You’re adding four dependencies.</p>

 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</code> is the basic Spring Data JPA project meta-dependency 
   <code>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</code> adds the REST interface capabilities to the <code>CrudRepository</code> 
   <code>h2</code> tells Spring Data that you want to use an H2 database, which will default to the in-memory database 
   <code>lombok</code> is a helper that will allow us to easily generate some getters, setters, and a constructor in your data model class 
 

<p><code>pom.xml</code></p>
   <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;

    ...

    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-data-rest&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.18.14&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now create the dinosaur data model class itself. Notice the three annotations: <code>@Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor</code>. This is where Lombok is helping you to generate some boilerplate code. If you’re doing this tutorial in an IDE, you may need to enable annotation processing so Lombok can generate code for you. See Lombok’s instructions { <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij">IDEA</a> }  for more information.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/Dinosaur.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Setter;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
@Getter @Setter @NoArgsConstructor
public class Dinosaur {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private boolean fangs;

    private int numberOfArms;

    private double weightTons;

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format(
                "Customer[id=%d, name='%s', fangs='%b', numberOfArms='%d', weightTons='%f']",
                id, name, fangs, numberOfArms, weightTons);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This defines a dinosaur with five properties:</p>

 
   <code>id</code>: the unique identifier in the database 
   <code>name</code>: all things need names, even giant prehistoric monsters 
   <code>genusAndSpecies</code>: what is the scientific genus and species? 
   <code>fangs</code>: cut to the chase, does the dinosaur have fangs? 
   <code>numberOfArms</code>: how many grasping arms does it have? 
   <code>weightTons</code>: how overwhelmingly enormous is it? 
 

<p>Now, these dinosaurs aren’t wreaking much havoc in your head. You need a way to create, read, update, and delete these dinosaurs. And don’t forget the DELETE part, that’s the mistake the movie made! If they had used Spring, they would have gotten DELETE automatically for free and, while it might not have been much of a movie, they would have survived.</p>

 Create a Spring Data Repository 

<p>Create a <code>DinosaurRepository</code>. This is the interface that will leverage Spring Data JPA to read and write the Dinosaur instances to and from the in-memory database.</p>

<p>Further, because you’re extending Spring’s <code>CrudRepository</code> repository, you will get a fully functioning REST interface automatically. If you don’t want or need the REST interface, or you want to create your own, you could subclass <code>Repository</code>.</p>

<p>There are two other relevant repository types: <code>JpaRepository</code> and <code>PagingAndSortingRepository</code>. All of these are part of a class hierarchy, building on <code>Repository</code>.</p>

 
   <code>Repository</code> is the base class. It adds the basic database functions. 
   <code>CrudRepository</code> extends <code>Repository</code> and adds the REST interface. 
   <code>PagingAndSortingRepository</code> extends <code>CrudRepository</code> and adds paging and sorting abilities. 
   <code>JpaRepository</code> extends <code>PagingAndSortingRepository</code> and adds a few JPA-related features, such as deleting batches of records and persistence context flushing. 
 

<p>Now create the <code>DinosaurRepository</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/DinosaurRepository.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll notice there’s not much there. If you look at the <code>CrudRepository</code> superclass, you’ll see the methods that are being implemented and exposed by the repository.</p>

   <code>public interface CrudRepository&lt;T, ID&gt; extends Repository&lt;T, ID&gt; {
    &lt;S extends T&gt; S save(S var1);

    &lt;S extends T&gt; Iterable&lt;S&gt; saveAll(Iterable&lt;S&gt; var1);

    Optional&lt;T&gt; findById(ID var1);

    boolean existsById(ID var1);

    Iterable&lt;T&gt; findAll();

    Iterable&lt;T&gt; findAllById(Iterable&lt;ID&gt; var1);

    long count();

    void deleteById(ID var1);

    void delete(T var1);

    void deleteAll(Iterable&lt;? extends T&gt; var1);

    void deleteAll();
}
</code>   

<p>Now you can test the automatically generated REST resource. Use <code>Control-C</code> to stop the running process if you haven’t already and run it again.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Then, hit the <code>/dinosaurs</code> endpoint to see the response.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs
</code>   

<p>Since you don’t have any dinosaurs, the results aren’t very exciting. All you have is an empty array along with some HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) and HAL (Hypertext Application Language) links.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200
...

{
    "_embedded": {
        "dinosaurs": []
    },
    "_links": {
        "profile": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/profile/dinosaurs"
        },
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/dinosaurs"
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Spring Data REST uses HATEOAS and HAL to return formatted data. Very, very briefly: HAL is a descriptive resource language that uses published links to point to resources. It allows a resource server to describe itself to its clients. You can read more about it on <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/current/reference/html/#repository-resources.resource-discoverability">the Spring Data REST page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid exposing the REST resource entirely, you can annotate the <code>DinosaurRepository</code> in the following way. This disables the REST resource.</p>

   <code>@RepositoryRestResource(exported=false)
public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Further, if you wanted to hide only certain CRUD methods, you can use the <code>@RestResource(exported = false)</code> annotation on individual methods. Let’s say you want to disable the delete methods for the dinosaurs (cue maniacal laughing and hand wringing).</p>

<p>Go ahead and update your <code>DinosaurRepository</code> to match the following:</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/DinosaurRepository.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RestResource;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer;

public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
    @Override
    @RestResource(exported = false)
    void deleteById(Long id);

    @Override
    @RestResource(exported = false)
    void delete(Dinosaur entity);

    @Configuration
    static class RepositoryConfig implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {
        @Override
        public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config) {
            config.exposeIdsFor(Dinosaur.class);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The general idea is to override the particular subclass method to be hidden and mark them so they’re not exported. Notice that in this case, to hide the delete methods, you have to hide both of the subclass’s delete methods.</p>

<p>I also slipped another change into the file. I added the <code>RepositoryConfig</code> static class to configure Spring to return the entity IDs with the JSON. Spring doesn’t do that by default, and it’s handy to do that in this example to demonstrate the CRUD methods.</p>

<p>Before you try this all out, create some bootstrapped demo data to be loaded into the database. Create a <code>src/main/resources/data.sql</code> file that will be run upon application initialization only when the H2 in-memory database is being used.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/data.sql</code></p>
   <code>INSERT INTO dinosaur (name, fangs, number_of_arms, weight_tons) VALUES  
  ('Terror Bird', true, 2, 100),  
  ('Ankylosaurus', true, 4, 350.5),
  ('Spinosaurus', false, 4, 500);
</code>   

<p>Remember these are recombinant, mutated dinosaurs, not actual dinosaurs, so they have extra arms.</p>

 Test Your Spring Data JPA-Powered REST API 

<p>Now, try it out. Run the Spring Boot app (<code>Control-C</code> if necessary).</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Perform a GET request on the <code>/dinosaur</code> REST endpoint.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs
</code>   

<p>You’ll see the following (with some elements omitted for clarity):</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200
...

{
    "_embedded": {
        "dinosaurs": [
            {
                ...
                "fangs": true,
                "id": 1
                "name": "Terror Bird",
                "numberOfArms": 2,
                "weightTons": 100.0
            },
            {
                ...
                "fangs": true,
                "id": 2
                "name": "Ankylosaurus",
                "numberOfArms": 4,
                "weightTons": 350.5
            },
            {
                ...
                "fangs": false,
                "id": 3
                "name": "Spinosaurus",
                "numberOfArms": 4,
                "weightTons": 500.0
            }
        ]
    },
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>Try to delete one of the dinosaurs.</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/dinosaurs/1
</code>   

<p>The response should be a 405 error. HTTP 405 is “method not allowed.” Evil laughter. And, the dinosaurs take over the world.</p>

<p>To avert disaster, remove the two <code>@Override</code> methods from the <code>DinosaurRepository</code>.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/sample/DinosaurRepository.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.config.RepositoryRestConfiguration;
import org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.config.RepositoryRestConfigurer;

public interface DinosaurRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Dinosaur, Long&gt; {
    @Configuration
    static class RepositoryConfig implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {
        @Override
        public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config) {
            config.exposeIdsFor(Dinosaur.class);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Stop (Control-C) and re-start the Spring Boot app.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Delete it again using HTTPie.</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/dinosaurs/1

...
HTTP/1.1 204
...
</code>   

<p>HTTP 204 implies “no content.” The server has successfully performed the delete and has nothing else to say about it. If you perform a GET request (<code>http :8080/dinosaurs</code>), you’ll see one less dinosaur. Crisis averted!</p>

<p>The only thing left to do is to secure the whole thing so random foreign net-bots aren’t creating dinosaurs willy-nilly.</p>

 Implement an OAuth 2.0 Resource Server 

<p>Thanks to Okta’s Spring Boot Starter, most of the OAuth is already in place. All you need to do to activate it is update your <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class. The following code configures the application to authorize all requests using JWTs and OAuth 2.0.</p>

   <code>package com.example.sample;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt; authorizeRequests.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Remember that you or the Okta CLI put the necessary OAuth configuration for Okta in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file, which should look something like the following:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourClientId}
okta.oauth2.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Stop (Control-C) and re-start the Spring Boot app.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Run a GET on the dinosaur service.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs
</code>   

<p>It’s now locked down.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401
...
</code>   

 Generate an Access Token JWT 

<p>You used Okta as your OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider when you used the Okta CLI. The CLI created an OIDC application for you on the Okta developer site and filled in the config details in the <code>application.properties</code> file. Your application is now expecting a JSON Web Token (JWT) when you make requests.</p>

<p>To generate a JWT, you can use the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OIDC Debugger</a>.</p>

<p>However, before you do that, you need to add a login redirect URI to your OIDC application. Navigate to the developer dashboard at <a href="https://developer.okta.com">https://developer.okta.com</a>. If this is your first time logging in, you may need to click the Admin button.</p>

<p>Click on Applications in the top menu.</p>

<p>In the panel, select the okta-spring-boot-sample application (the one that the CLI generated for you).</p>

<p>Select the General tab. Click Edit.</p>

<p>Add a new entry under Login redirect URIs: <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Save.</p>

<p>Take note of the OIDC applications Client ID and Client Secret at the bottom. You’ll need both of those values in just a moment.</p>

<p>Open the OIDC Debugger at <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">https://oidcdebugger.com</a>.</p>

<p>Fill in the following values:</p>

 
   Authorization URI: <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> (update {yourOktaDomain} with your actual Okta domain, something like <code>dev-1234567.okta.com</code> 
   Redirect URI: <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> (default value) 
   Client ID: the client ID from your OIDC application above 
   Scope: <code>openid</code> (default value) 
   State: any value (in production this is used to protect against cross-site request forgery) 
   Response type: <code>code</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click SEND REQUEST at the bottom of the form.</p>

<p>You should see an authorization code.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You need to exchange this code for a token. You can use HTTPie. Don’t forget to fill in the values in brackets: the authorization code, your Okta domain, your OIDC app client ID, and your OIDC app client secret.</p>

   <code>http -f https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  grant_type=authorization_code \
  code={yourAuthCode} \
  client_id={clientId} \
  client_secret={clientSecret} \
  redirect_uri=https://oidcdebugger.com/debug
</code>   

<p>You should get a JSON response that includes an access token and an ID token.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store
Connection: keep-alive
...

{
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJycGZWTzd4R2hDWmlvUXdrWWha...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJraWQiOiJycGZWTzd4R2hDWmlvUXdrWWhaSkph...",
    "scope": "openid",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
</code>   

 Access Your API with an OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token 

<p>Copy the resulting <code>access_token</code> value to the clipboard, and in the terminal where you are running your HTTPie commands, save the token value to a shell variable, like this:</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJxMm5rZmtwUDRhMlJLV2REU2JfQ...
</code>   

<p>Now you can use the token in a request.</p>

   <code>http :8080/dinosaurs "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>You should see your list of dinosaurs. 🦖</p>

 Learn More About Spring Data and Spring Boot 

<p>In this tutorial, you took a look at Spring Data in general and saw how it is an umbrella project. It encompasses a huge range of technologies that are designed to make persisting and manipulating data easy across widely divergent technologies without sacrificing technical flexibility.</p>

<p>As an example of this, you used Spring Data JPA to create a simple relational database model and repository. You used Spring’s <code>CrudRepository</code> class and saw how it automatically created a resource server from your data model. Finally, you used Okta’s OAuth 2.0 and OIDC implementation to quickly and easily add JWT authentication to your resource server. All of this was bootstrapped by Okta’s CLI.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-data-jpa-example">oktadeveloper/okta-spring-data-jpa-example</a>.</p>

  <p>Homeoffice und remote Zusammenarbeit werden durch ein weites und attraktives Angebot von cloudbasierten Collaborations-Tools begünstigt. Die aktuelle Covid-19 pandemische Situation hat zu einem großflächigen Aussetzen der Präsenzzusammenarbeit geführt. Ein nicht unerheblicher Teil der digitalen Collaboration findet - unter Access Management Gesichtspunkten betrachtet - mäßig bis schlecht organisiert statt. Wie bekommt man solche Collaborations-Szenarien (wieder) unter Kontrolle? Wie verhält es sich mit ad-hoc Szenarien? Der Vortrag wirft einen kritischen&nbsp; Blick auf Cloud-Collaboration und stellt einige hilfreiche praxiserprobte Lösungsansätze und Patterns im IAM-Umfeld dar.</p>

<p>Key Topics:</p>
<p>* Remote Zusammenarbeit und digitale Collaboration</p>

  <p>Privilege Access Management (PAM) sollte ein Schlüsselelement in Ihrer Sicherheitsstrategie sein. Daher müssen Sie sicherstellen, dass sich die von Ihnen gewählte Lösung leicht in Ihre Geschäftsprozesse und -vorgänge integrieren lässt. Erstens muss die Lösung schnell in Ihrer Umgebung implementiert werden können und möglichst wenig Reibung im täglichen Geschäftsbetrieb verursachen. Darüber hinaus muss sie sich nahtlos in andere Geschäftsvorgänge wie IGA, DevOps, Robotische Prozessautomatisierung und Active Directory integrieren, um Just-in-Time-Privilegien zu bieten, die Zero Trust ermöglichen. Außerdem muss die Verhaltensanalyse genutzt werden, um Risiken in Echtzeit zu beheben. Bevor Sie weitere Schritte mit Ihrem aktuellen PAM-Projekt unternehmen, nehmen Sie an dieser Sitzung teil, um zu sehen, wie das PAM-Portfolio der nächsten Generation von One Identity den Schutz, die Sichtbarkeit und den Umfang bietet, den Sie benötigen, um die schnellste Wertschöpfung und die niedrigsten Gesamtbetriebskosten zu erzielen.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cas2020_2020_11_18_bakos"></a>

  <p>Viele Organisationen stehen vor der Herausforderung Richtlinien für das Arbeiten aus dem Home-Office zu implementieren, um unter anderem eine stetig steigende Anzahl an Remote- und Hybrid-Mitarbeitern zu unterstützen. Während ein hybrides Arbeitsmodell eine interessante und aufregende Entwicklung darstellt, waren viele Organisationen nicht auf diese rasche, anfängliche Verlagerung der Arbeitsstruktur in Hybrid- oder Remote-Modelle vorbereitet. Die Nutzung einer Privileged Access Management-Lösung kann federführend dabei unterstützen, Sicherheitsauswirkungen dieser wachsenden Remote- und Hybrid-Belegschaft zu minimieren. Der Vortrag zeigt auf, wie diese neuen Arbeitsmodelle sicher supported sowie weiter ausgebaut werden können und legt dar, welche Rolle ein ganzheitlicher Privileged Access Management-Ansatz hierbei spielt.</p>

 Zeit für die Renovierung: Wie man vom Bestands-IAM fokussiert zu einer zukunftsfähigen IAM-Infrastruktur kommt 
 
<p>Martin Kuppinger spricht über die Herausforderungen von IAM im Zeitalter der Digitalen Transformation und die sich ändernden Anforderungen, die heute weit über ein „Mitarbeiter-IAM“ hinausgehen. Er zeigt auf, wie man das IAM fit für die neuen Herausforderungen machen kann, vom Betriebsmodell zur Bedienung hybrider Zielsysteme bis hin zur Unterstützung aller Benutzergruppen wie Partner, Konsumenten und Mitarbeiter, aber auch von weiteren Identitäten wie denen von Dingen, Software-Robotern (Robotic Process Automation) oder Geräten. Gleichzeitig erläutert er auch, wie man hier einen schrittweisen, selbstgesteuerten Übergang schaffen kann, bei dem ein schneller Nutzern für das Business erreicht wird.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cas2020_2020_11_18_kuppinger"></a>

Designed for simplicity and usability, Trinsic Studio has all the tools you need to build an SSI solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this how-to post, we will be walking through how to issue credentials in Trinsic Studio. Follow the steps below, and you’ll be issuing credentials in minutes!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To do so, go to <a href="https://trinsic.studio/">https://trinsic.studio/</a> and follow the instructions on the screen.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create an Organization 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In order to issue a credential, you must first create the Organization that will be issuing the credential. For this example, let’s say that Faber College is issuing its most recent graduate class digital diplomas in the form of a verifiable credential. To make Faber College an Organization in Trinsic Studio:<br><br></p>  Click on the “+Organization” button on the dashboard screen.  Create an Organization called Faber College. Feel free to upload a logo if you would like. For the Preferred Network drop-down, make sure you are on Sovrin Staging for this walkthrough. Click “Continue to Review”.  After making sure all the information is correct, click “Confirm”.  <p><br>And just like that, Faber College has been created as an Organization on Trinsic Studio.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Create a Credential Template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>All verifiable credentials come from credential templates. These templates specify what information should be included in a credential. Faber College would most likely want the credential template of its digital diplomas to include a graduate’s first and last name, what they got their degree in, what year they graduated, and their GPA. Let’s begin!<br><br></p>  First, click on the Faber College organization card on the dashboard screen.  Second, go to the Credentials tab and click the “+ Template” button.  Third, fill out the “Create a Credential Template” form. Since we are creating a brand new credential template, choose the “create new schema” option. Name the credential “College Diploma”. Go ahead and leave the “Version” and “Tag” boxes as they are. You can read more about each if you hover over their icons. You can also make the credentials revocable if you would like, but we are not going to do that in this tutorial. Now, add the following five attributes: First Name, Last Name, Degree, Year, and GPA. Click “Create Template”.  <p><br>With this credential template created, Faber College can start issuing credentials to its graduates.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Issue a credential 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>This is the fun part! The first graduate Faber College will send a digital diploma to is Alice Smith. To do so:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Navigate to the “Credentials” tab as Faber College.  Locate the “College Diploma” credential template.  Click on the “ISSUE” button that corresponds with that template.  Fill in all the attributes with Alice’s information.  Now you must decide how you want to send the credential. It can be by connection (which we will cover soon in an upcoming blog post), by email, or by QR code/link. We will choose to send the credential via Generate QR Code/Link.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Faber College can then send Alice her unique QR code which she can easily scan with the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> or another SSI wallet of her choice. Once she scans the QR code, Alice will have her digital diploma conveniently on her phone to easily and conveniently share with future employers or whoever else she chooses.</p>

 Marielle S. Gross, M.D., OB-GYN and Postdoctoral Fellow at Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, on the oversharing and myths of de-identification of sensitive health&nbsp;data <p>In the eighth episode of Voices of The Data Economy, we spoke to Marielle S. Gross, M.D., an OB-GYN and postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. In a conversation with us, she demystified the data privacy issues with the famous story of Henrietta Lacks and HeLa cells; the concerns with oversharing of sensitive women’s health data; the myths about de-identification of health data, and more. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> The Story of Henrietta Lacks and Bioethical standards <p>The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks">Henrietta Lacks</a> could be termed as a famous bioethics and social ethics case study. It begins in the early 1950s, the United States with Henrietta Lacks, a poor working black woman who was the mother of four children. According to the John Hopkins website, in 1951, she visited The Johns Hopkins Hospital and upon examination, renowned gynecologist Dr. Howard Jones discovered a large, malignant tumor on her cervix. A sample of her cancer cells retrieved during a biopsy were sent to Dr. George Gey’s nearby tissue lab. For years, Dr. Gey, prominent cancer and virus researcher, had been collecting cells from all patients who came to The Johns Hopkins Hospital with cervical cancer, but each sample quickly died in Dr. Gey’s lab. What he would soon discover was that Mrs. Lacks’ cells were unlike any of the others he had ever seen — where other cells would die, Mrs. Lacks’ cells doubled every 20 to 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Today, these cells — nicknamed “HeLa” cells — are used to study the effects of toxins, drugs, hormones, and viruses on the growth of cancer cells without experimenting on humans. They have been used to test the effects of radiation and poisons, to study the human genome, to learn more about how viruses work and played a crucial role in the development of the polio&nbsp;vaccine.</p><p>However, Marielle mentions that a sample of her normal tissue and a sample of her cancer tissue were taken- infamously without her permission, knowledge, or consent. The story starts when her cells just grew like wildfire, in the culture medium, and they subsequently were known as HeLa cells. Those cells became absolutely essential to basically 20th-century medicine as they were the only cells that anybody could grow for a long time, the majority of the major developments in medicine were done utilizing those cells. Each field of medicine, you could think about that has had a major development since 1950, in most cases, where biomedicine is involved — HeLa cells were also involved.</p><p>However, the family of Henrietta Lacks still has not been compensated. It took until the 1970s before the family ended up finding out about the research even on their mother’s tissue happening. They didn’t know about their mother’s role, and developing all these key scientific advancements that have saved lives and made billions. <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/henriettalacks/upholding-the-highest-bioethical-standards.html">Further details about the bioethical standards can be found here</a> on the Johns Hopkins&nbsp;website.</p> What if Henrietta Lacks happened&nbsp;today… <p>Marielle’s argument here is that what happened to Henrietta Lacks in the 1950’s is happening to all of us- each person who’s receiving care. “I can only relate to the US healthcare system where health data is recorded digitally, through a variety of mechanisms, creating these very elaborate digital biospecimens. What makes DNA so unique — how long the code is and how little variations matter. The same thing is exactly true in terms of our healthcare records.&nbsp;“</p><p><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/judge-dismisses-data-sharing-lawsuit-against-university-chicago-google">Why did Google and the University of Chicago get in trouble when they collaborated on healthcare records?</a> Because of the triangulation of data, and how tiny little details of who, where, when, and the combination of that with other details of medical records, instantly, people are identified.</p><p>“There’s this whole fiction of de-identification as a way of protecting people from violations and the use of their data,” says Marielle. We all are familiar with the technologies that can be implemented where we don’t have to sacrifice privacy in order to learn from our data. We can totally protect the privacy of data while extracting analytic value from it. Whether it’s blockchain or <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-andrew-trask-privacy-preserving-ai-845c47ae4e27">privacy-preserving technologies</a>, at least in theory, would allow us to protect people’s privacy and not have to compromise on privacy, while not erasing their name from the database that connects them with their information.</p><p>“While regulations have this premise of de-identification as something that is protective of individuals, I would argue that it’s really protective of the researchers. By protecting the privacy of those individuals, what we’re doing is that we’re cutting off people from access to the benefits from their data and it is being used by third parties. Our data is being used by third parties constantly. We at best are secondary recipients of those benefits. Whereas we could in many cases, be primary recipients and rightfully so.&nbsp;“</p><p>Marielle adds that Henrietta Lacks underwent invasive procedures. And as an OB-GYN, this speaks to her because doing a pelvic exam is inherently uncomfortable and violating — even if it’s done for the right reasons to help&nbsp;you.</p><p>“Often intimate and invasive acts are done in the process of collecting information about you where the premise of that procedure is that it is being done to help you in your health care. And in reality, it is just for the purposes of collecting data. I think that we have to acknowledge that there’s something significant going on there when the procedure is no longer about nearly just helping that individuals’ healthcare interests are advanced but the systemic treatment of data as something which is constantly mined. There’s a dual purpose of that procedure. And because of that dual purpose, the part that’s not just about advancing one’s health interests, I think gives additional rights and responsibilities.”</p> Can the de-identification of data save&nbsp;us? <p>With regards to the de-identification of data, the concept here is of group&nbsp;harm.</p><p>“Part of the whole problem with the de-identification of data is that it’s cutting off that feedback loop that we want. It’s cutting off that automatic feedback to the very individual, who is part of that research. There’s no mechanism through which it is automatically feeding back to the physician of that patient, even though we studied the physician’s records about that patient. It’s not like a mystery who that person was, because even if they were de-identified for the purposes of the study, we know how easy it is to re-identify people. But we have laws that actually specifically prevent the recontact, what’s called recontacting or re-identification of the research subjects. We are preventing that from happening.”</p> Final thoughts <p>Marielle concludes, “I think the key here is to step back and not allow the constant creation and third party utilization of data about our bodies to go unquestioned. Not allow it to be so normalized as it has been in a way that has just totally snuck in under the radar convincing us that it is being collected for our benefit. This is so pervasive, both within a medical context and outside of medical context, like within your doctor’s office and in your regular home life. We’re not questioning it and we are accepting the trade-offs. I would like more people to want to discuss how their data ought to be treated and protected. What they’re owed by those who use their data for their own benefits.”</p><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>5:10 — 19:10 The background and privacy concerns with Henrietta Lacks&nbsp;Story</p><p>19:10 — 25:55 The role of regulations in healthcare data collection</p><p>26:00 — 33:00 Why de-identification of data is a&nbsp;myth</p><p>33:00 — 42:30 Oversharing of sensitive women-health data</p><p>47:06 — onwards How is data affecting marginalized groups?</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Introducing a new collaboration between Ocean Protocol and Secret Network that will provide trustless and convenient access control for Ocean datatokens as well as decentralized private compute via Secret&nbsp;Network. <p>By <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://scrt.network">Secret&nbsp;Network</a></p> Overview <p>Ocean and Secret have long shared a vision for unlocking the true power and value of data via decentralized and privacy-preserving technologies. Leveraging the experience of our teams and the strength of our products and ecosystems, we are excited to announce a new collaboration that will create substantial opportunities for data publishers, data consumers, and developers.</p><p>This blog post summarizes a potential path to integrate Secret Network with Ocean Protocol, currently in the research phase, so that data publishers on Ocean Market no longer have to choose between convenience versus full trustlessness.</p><p>We are also announcing Secret Network’s support for Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-data-economy-challenge-datatokens-edition-32bab6e7c339">Data Economy Challenge</a>, where Secret will be sponsoring an additional bonus prize and participating in judging! Read to the end of this post to learn more about this opportunity for developers.</p> Challenges <p>There are two challenges in the Ocean ecosystem that an integration with Secret Network can help&nbsp;address:</p><p>1) Publishers of data to Ocean Market can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at&nbsp;once.</p><p>Currently the url of an Ocean data service is stored on-chain. Ocean “Provider” middleware encrypts and decrypts that&nbsp;url.</p><p>(a) For a given data service, the publisher can run their own Provider, which is trustless but not convenient.</p><p>(b) Or, they can use the Provider run by the operator of Ocean Market, which is convenient but allows the operator to see the decrypted url. The operator is Ocean Protocol Foundation.</p><p>Ocean Market actually only exposes (b) right now, but the tech for (a) is a small amount of work away, with no research needed. The goal is to get both (a) and (b) at once and Secret Network can help achieve&nbsp;this.</p><p>2) Publishers of Compute-to-Data services can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at&nbsp;once.</p><p>Compute-to-data can run any script and return results to the data consumer. However, there’s a risk that the script supplied leaks sensitive data, like Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The script can be malicious or simply&nbsp;overfit.</p><blockquote>Malicious: the script has special code that sends the data to the script supplier. The supplier obfuscates this code via an easy-to-miss special import like “import sk_learn” (versus the correct version “import sklearn”). The special library wraps sklearn, but injects&nbsp;copying.</blockquote><blockquote>Overfit: the model learns too much detail so that sensitive data can be extracted from it. An extreme example is: in CART tree training, learning each branch only stops when the leaf node has a single datapoint. Or, a neural network could get overfit if it has a large number of parameters compared to its datapoints and it doesn’t do regularization in training.</blockquote><p>To address the risk of leaking sensitive data, the publisher must choose what scripts to trust. Thus it’s the same entity that risks private data getting exposed and chooses what algorithm to trust. It is their choice to make, based on their risk-reward preference. To catch malicious scripts, they simply do inspection. To catch overfitting that leads to data leakage, some algorithms are easy to trust, like averaging or learning a logistic regression model. But for more advanced modeling, it’s a bit more of a burden. If the publisher is an AI expert, they can “vet” it themselves but it takes time. Otherwise they will need to rely on a trusted third party AI expert, or community-curated scripts.</p><p>To summarize the problem. Publishers can either&nbsp;have:</p>  (a) convenience and rely on third parties to vet the scripts,&nbsp;or  (b) they can inspect for themselves which requires time and expertise.  <p>The goal is to get both (a) and (b) at once. Secret Contracts which enable privacy preserving computations can help to address these challenges.</p> User Story <p>Alice is a data consumer (buying data) and Bob is a data provider (selling&nbsp;data).</p><p>Steps 1–3 solve challenge (1) described above. Additional step (4) solves challenge (2)&nbsp;above.</p>  Bob publishes a dataset onto Ethereum via&nbsp;Ocean    (a) Bob stores his data (IPFS, S3 etc.) in an encrypted manner — platform / UX&nbsp;TBD  (b) Bob publishes a dataset on Ocean Market. This includes minting an Ocean ERC20 datatoken contract on Ethereum mainnet, with symbol LKYSQD-23 (Lucky Squid). Bob lists LKYSQD-23 for purchase on Ocean Market, with either fixed price or automatic (AMM-based) price.  (c) Bob deploys a “Secret Vault” contract for LKYSQD-23 onto Secret Network. The.decryption key from 1a) is stored in its state, and can only be accessed by LKYSQD-23 tokens of&nbsp;1b).  <p>2. Alice buys access to data by acquiring 1.0 LKY-SQD datatokens on Ethereum via Ocean Market or another marketplace /&nbsp;DEX.</p><p>3. Alice accesses&nbsp;dataset</p>  (a) Using the Secret Ethereum bridge, Alice locks her 1.0 LKYSQD-23 on Ethereum, provides a Secret Network (SN) address and signs a Metamask&nbsp;TX.  (b) Multisig committee will mint LKYSQD-23 wrapped on SN to Alice’s address to make secretLKYSQD-23 (“LKYSQD-23, wrapped by Secret”).  (c) On SN, Alice sends her secretLKYSQD-23 to the vault contact from 1c) and she’s granted access (decryption key) to the&nbsp;data.  <p>4. Alice is not allowed to access the data set (privacy), but will use data in her private algorithm</p>  (a) Using the Secret Ethereum bridge, Alice locks her 1.0 LKYSQD-23 on Ethereum, provides a SN address and signs a Metamask TX. The multisig committee mints 1.0 secretLKYSQD-23 on&nbsp;SN.  (b) Alice also deploys a Secret contract for computation, to&nbsp;SN  (c) Alice sends her algorithm as an encrypted input to the computation contract in&nbsp;4b)  (d) Alice sends her secretLKYSQD-23 and the secret contract address in 4b) to the vault contact in&nbsp;1c)  (e) Data stored in SecretVault 1c) is sent to the computation contract in&nbsp;4b)  (f) Alice receives the computation result   Secret Ocean Collaboration <p>This new collaboration between Ocean and Secret will be enabled by the following components and modules of Secret&nbsp;Network:</p> Secret Contracts <p>Secret contracts can accept algorithms and data as encrypted inputs to complete contract execution in a fully private manner.

If desired, these datatokens can be minted as <a href="https://github.com/enigmampc/secretSCRT">privacy tokens</a> as well. The bridge has a M-by-N multisig committee that observes ETH and Secret to detect lock / burn transactions and mint or unlock funds in respective chains.</p> Secret Vault&nbsp;contract <p>The <a href="https://github.com/enigmampc/secret-vault">Secret Vault library</a> can be used to create an access control contract that allows storing private keys in the state of the contact. Secret Vault contracts can be designed to expose the private keys to certain parties interacting with the contract, “unlocking” content or access. <a href="https://github.com/PadlockApp">Padlock</a> is a sample implementation of Secret Vaults for monetizing content on Web3, the result of a recent hackathon project.</p> Next Steps <p>The teams and communities supporting Secret Network and Ocean Protocol share a commitment to data decentralization and protection while leveraging the power of Web3-based technologies. As our collaboration continues, we are looking for more developers and data providers to work alongside us as well as utilize and improve our solutions.</p><p>If you’re working on complimentary technologies or products, or if you want to provide any feedback to our teams, send us a&nbsp;note:</p><p><a href="mailto:info@oceanprotocol.com">info@oceanprotocol.com</a> and <a href="http://info@secret.foundation">info@secret.foundation</a></p><p>In addition, Secret Network is excited to be collaborating with Ocean on the Ocean Protocol Data Economy Challenge: datatokens edition (DEC). Secret will be offering a bonus prize for best integration between Ocean Protocol and Secret Network, with the winning team receiving $2,000 in SCRT coins. Both Ocean and Secret communities would love to see hackers work towards addressing the challenges listed in this&nbsp;post:</p><p>Challenge 1) Publishers of data to Ocean Market can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at once. (recommended)</p><p>Challenge 2) Publishers of Compute-to-Data services can either have convenience or fully trustless operation, but not both at once. (extra&nbsp;credit)</p><p>In order to be eligible for a prize, project teams will need to open source their code and properly document their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Learn more about the Data Economy Challenge on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-data-economy-challenge-datatokens-edition-32bab6e7c339">our&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>Let’s continue to revolutionize the Data&nbsp;Economy!</p><p>“We’ve long admired the work of Secret and Enigma and we’re thrilled to have Secret as a partner for the Data Economy Challenge. This collaboration gives us the opportunity to add Secret’s world-leading privacy infrastructure to Ocean V3 to offer users more options for secure data sharing,” said Ocean Founder Bruce&nbsp;Pon.</p><p>“Since the original Enigma whitepaper in 2015, we envisioned the existence of secure data marketplaces that would allow users to share data securely and process it privately. Combining the privacy-preserving power of Secret Network with Ocean’s world-leading work on data marketplaces, we are finally seeing this vision become reality,” said Enigma CEO and co-founder Guy Zyskind. “Our team and the entire Secret ecosystem are excited to work in collaboration with the Ocean Protocol team and community.”</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol is an on-ramp for data services into crypto ecosystems, using datatokens. Each datatoken is a fungible ERC20 token to access a given data service. Ocean smart contracts, Ocean libraries, and Ocean-powered front-ends make it easy to publish data services (deploy and mint datatokens) and consume data services (spend datatokens). Therefore Ocean provides decentralized access&nbsp;control.</p><p>Ocean contracts run on Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum composability enables crypto wallets as data wallets, crypto exchanges as data marketplaces, data DAOs as data co-ops, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Ocean Market is like a DEX tuned for data. It’s an open-source community marketplace for data that uses Ocean datatokens. Users can publish data, buy/sell data, consume data, and stake on data (curate). Each datatoken can have automatic price discovery via its own automated market maker (AMM)&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access on privately held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises. With it, Ocean Market enables monetization of private data while preserving privacy.</p> About Secret&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://scrt.network">Secret Network</a> is the first ever privacy-enabled Layer 1 blockchain, featuring privacy-preserving smart contracts (“secret contracts”) that utilize hardware-based and software-based privacy technologies to protect data. Secret contracts are unique in that they allow for encrypted inputs, outputs and state. Data on Secret Network is private by default, public when desired. Secret Network is also open-source and permissionless — anyone can operate a node, deploy an app, or contribute to the network and its ecosystem.</p><p>Applications built on Secret Network (Secret Apps) can utilize encrypted data without ever exposing the data itself, even to the nodes in the network performing computations. This groundbreaking ability unlocks valuable new use cases across a variety of critical Web3 fields, including decentralized finance, data sharing, access control, machine learning, non-fungible tokens, and many&nbsp;more.</p><p>The Secret vision is to bring “programmable privacy” to every public blockchain, enabling arbitrarily complex data privacy controls for Web3 applications. This finally gives users and developers the ability to provide privacy or transparency to any data they want, when they want to provide it. Secret Network is providing the critical missing piece to global adoption of Web3 technologies.</p><p>Secret Network is supported by multiple independent development teams and entities as well as a global community of passionate privacy advocates, including Enigma, Secret Foundation, Secretnodes.org, Chain of Secrets, 40+ mainnet validators, and many other developers and community members who contribute to network governance and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>If the line "We are detective" only reminds you of "guilty pleasure" radio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReacTOXGgHE">songs</a> <a></a> from the 1980s, despite the fact that you are responsible for cybersecurity or compliance in your company, then you should read on. In any case, you probably should read on because this is a trend that is becoming increasingly important in times of growing uncertainty and loss of trust – in contracts, in companies in the supply chain, in "the Internet", and in nation-states.</p>
 Trust as the foundation for reliable assurance 
<p>Understanding, assuming, mitigating, and managing risks in our increasingly hybrid IT infrastructures is often based on the level of trust in the respective system/service/company providing required capabilities. So, we may trust companies and their good reputation. Sometimes we trust in contracts and SLAs (Service level agreements). If not, we trust in the threat of penalties for breach of contract. We may also trust third party testimonies (certifications and audits) that provide us with robust assurances that standards and control frameworks are being met. But if this is not sufficient, we appoint an auditor ourselves, and trust in a completed audit tailored to our needs.</p>
<p>The objective in the end is to achieve a level of assurance that is sufficient to adequately fulfill our risk management obligations. This is an actively managed process, performed by a range of players between IT, cloud service providers, auditors, senior management, legal departments, and many more. And it is based on the robustness of evidence and confidence in statements made.</p>
 What to do when trust is not an option? 
<p>But what we have lost this trust in assurances made in whatever form? What if our risk appetite is too low for us to be able to rely on them? And what if it is obvious that national legislation in a considerable number of countries or regions does not warrant a relationship of trust? What do we do when it cannot be ensured for organizations of all kinds that services provided, for example in the cloud, are free from the influence of third parties, especially the state? This encompasses surveillance up to and including espionage or the creation of personal profiles of customers and employees for political or for criminal reasons by a multitude of threat actors, including the service providers.</p>
<p>A classic risk management response to such a risk is "avoid". For many companies, however, this also entails abandoning parts of the business model. When talking to the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) this might be an option, but when talking to the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) "avoid” becomes rather more difficult.</p>
 Just the facts, man 
<p>What to do? Well, simply do not trust if it is not appropriate! An increasingly important trend here is “detective controls”, i.e., monitoring what is happening in the systems. Based on selected runtime information, undesired behavior (especially accesses) can be identified, and countermeasures can be taken. In hybrid environments, this may also require a comprehensive time-based and time-critical correlation of vast amounts of information from otherwise isolated systems, which is certainly not a trivial challenge.</p>
<p>However, the computing power and capacities required do exist today, and modern SOC (Security Operations Center) approaches <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80008">like SOAR</a> (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) are on their way to becoming a central enabler.</p>
<p>In the cloud, AWS Cloud Trail or Azure Monitor, for example, serve as sources for a massive volume of real-time performance and log data. This data must be selected, understood, and correlated in a meaningful way.</p>
 Real-time log and activity data is big data 
<p>In separating signal and noise, pattern recognition and machine learning can be used to counteract the loss of confidence by analyzing the actual activities. However, the extraction of the truly important information and a robust analysis increasingly requires experts who have been trained to deal with this.</p>
<p>Your cybersecurity team may need to be complemented by a team of data scientists/data analysts as a counterpart to the security experts. Because it's important to understand what's going on in your cloud environment. It's not just about collecting data; it's about gaining insight into what's really going on. Hybrid, real-time log and activity data is big data, so you need to apply proper processes and technology to it.</p>
<p>This raises a multitude of further questions: Which companies should take this step first? Large companies and/or those with high criticality? Companies with a multi-cloud strategy and/or smaller companies and start-ups without a mature cybersecurity team?</p>
<p>And yes, of course, with job descriptions of such demanding requirements, the problem of the skills gap in IT in general, and cybersecurity in particular, strikes again: How do you obtain this expertise for your own company? Is it really necessary to recruit actual staff for your own company or can this essential know-how be provided by a service provider? And how much domain knowledge do these data scientists need to do their job well?</p>
<p>There is still a lot to discuss. Therefore, we will address these and other questions in this interesting new topic area in a follow-up blog post. But, as a first conclusion: If we can no longer trust, this leads us back to "We are detective".</p>

<p>Automated notifications make our lives easier, safer and more efficient in a range of real-world scenarios. Low fuel warning beeps keep us from being stranded on the side of the road, security system alerts help us protect our homes, and invite notices on our Apple Watches ensure we stay on top of work meetings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Similar communications also occur in the applications world. Apps can notify other apps by sending real-time data whenever a given event happens, such as when PayPal alerts your accounting app that a customer has paid their invoice or when Twitter informs your marketing app that someone has mentioned your company in a tweet. These automated bulletins free you from the manual work of routinely checking whether a particular activity has occurred, thereby boosting your efficiency while making sure important information is fully captured.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The number of apps that send and receive automatic notifications is on the rise, in large part because of a simple yet powerful technology called webhooks. Webhooks are an increasingly popular tool that can save your company significant time and energy—and ultimately result in a better, more streamlined experience for your end users.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>  The Basics of Webhooks  <p>In simple terms, webhooks, sometimes called “HTTP callbacks,” are a way for apps to communicate with one another that removes any manual effort out of the equation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now you may be thinking that you already have a tool that does this: polling requests to an API&nbsp; (application programming interface). In the polling requests model, you set some amount of time as an interval and then send HTTP requests to the server/API at every interval to see if there’s any new data. For example, suppose you need to know when a new user has been authenticated by your identity provider (which happens to be Ping!) before you can allow them to perform certain actions in your app. You would set up a polling request that would check authentications periodically, and whenever new users appear, that information would then be passed back to you. Whether a post request or a get request, that’s a lot of HTTP requests.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are a few drawbacks to this method, however. In this “pull” model, where you’re pulling information out of the other app, the timing of the intervals can be difficult to optimize. Make them too fast and you’re wasting resources; make them too far apart and you’re slow to get updates. It’s like the kid in the backseat asking “Are we there yet?” over and over, where each question is a request to the server to say, “Hey, any update yet?” At some point the answer will be yes, but it’s an inefficient (and annoying) way to operate.</p>

<p>As the digital identity space matures, it’s vital to have tools and tactics available to foster insights, growth and innovation. In that regard, today OWI has announced the launch of its <a href="http://oneworldidentity.com/distil">Digital Identity Standards, Technology, and Innovation Lab (DISTIL)</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISTIL is a community of individuals focused on building better user experiences enabled by digital identity. The DISTIL community will convene through a series of initiatives built around collaboration, idea generation, insights, and funding. These groups, classes, and networking opportunities include our new Immersive Experience Lab, Startup Accelerator Program, Working Groups, and Roundtables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The vision of the new OWI is coming into focus, starting with the launch of DISTIL. This initiative represents years of planning and development,” said Travis Jarae, Chief Executive Officer of OWI, “with the support of our amazing partners, clients, and community, DISTIL will represent the epicenter for identity innovation. We’re excited for others to join as we lead this next chapter for our industry.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the launch of DISTIL, we’re excited to also announce that the first Startup Accelerator Program will meet, starting on April 5, 2021. This 12-week program will connect a hand-selected group of disruptive new startups with OWI Ventures, the early-stage venture capital firm focused on digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The companies selected for this inaugural class will receive funding through OWI Ventures. They also will gain entry to DISTIL’s Immersive Experience Lab, which provides them with access to a community of over 300 digital identity experts. With this, participating founders and entrepreneurs can connect with valued mentors in the space and access proprietary information. The goal for this connectivity? To accelerate the next wave of identity innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we all have such an opportunity ahead of us, this meeting of the minds, experience, and resources will help drive development. We can’t wait to see what comes from such unique collaboration across the sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While applications for the Startup Accelerator Program will open in the coming weeks, it’s important to note that this is only the beginning of the full breadth of what DISTIL will offer the growing community. In the weeks and months to come, we will provide more information on the Immersive Experience Lab, Working Groups, and Roundtables, which will ensure the smartest minds – including both new and seasoned veterans of the space – come together to offer insights and strategies, as the digital identity sector grows and matures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unique findings will surely result from these collaborations, ones that will only improve and empower this dynamic community.&nbsp;</p>

   Results from The New Normal: Living Life Online Volume 2&nbsp; 

<p>We’ve been examining the significant changes in online <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgerock-consumer-survey-new-normal">consumer behavior</a> to ascertain what companies should be doing to help people access the connected world knowing that remote life won’t be going away any time soon. Our<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112194411/industry-brief/forgerock-consumer-behavior-report-the-new-normal.pdf"> first report</a>, ForgeRock New Normal: Living Life Online, provided a look into how the COVID-19 pandemic has permanently changed the way consumers plan to use apps and services. We followed that up with insights about <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/e-voting-future-busting-myths-and-objections">voter preferences</a> and made an appeal for governments to strongly consider digital voting. And now for the sequel, which takes a closer look at what makes people tick when it comes to digital experiences.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.forgerock.com/thenewnormal">volume 2</a> of our New Normal report: Living Life Online, we discuss how the rapid adoption of digital platforms affects consumer preferences when it comes to online experiences, including how they register and login and what features are most important for retaining their loyalty. Consumers will not tolerate a tedious registration process or ongoing authentication slowing them down. In fact, they believe being locked out of an account is more infuriating than running out of toilet paper or forgetting their mask at home. We also saw that respondents are beginning to value the apps and services that protect their personal data, but they still want to be recognized and offered a personalized experience. In our new online-centered world, organizations must address these priorities that have typically been at odds with each other.</p>

 
 


<p>Here are some key findings from Vol. 2:</p>

  Almost half of consumers (46%) said they wouldn’t register for a new account if it was too difficult to sign up. 
	 Consumers have a short fuse when it comes to poor digital experiences, with 35% cancelling or deleting an app if they have trouble logging in, while 32% said they would switch to a competitive service or app. 
	 Getting locked out of accounts is more frustrating for nearly three-quarters (72%) of consumers than forgetting their mask at home (44%) or not finding toilet paper at the store (51%). 
	 Globally, consumers are turning away from traditional passwords and usernames, preferring <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> options like biometrics or multifactor authentication (MFA) to log in where available (57%). 
	 Consumers said preventing their data from being resold to third parties is a top priority when considering app features (70%). 
 <p>So what does this mean for organizations trying to engage with consumers in this new world? Consumers are demanding smooth, uncomplicated experiences. Organizations across industries have their work cut out for them if they want to keep up with rising consumer expectations for a simple, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/family-affair-personalizing-customer-experience">frictionless digital experience</a>. Identity is the key to making sure that every customer can register, access and transact easily.</p>

<p>A well planned consumer identity strategy can make tailoring the user’s onboarding experience to match the right risk and friction levels easy to accomplish. This gives less risky users a smooth, drama free registration process, while riskier users or bad actors will encounter extra steps to acquire access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A proper identity infrastructure also allows you to streamline the user authentication process, providing a context driven, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> experience. If the system understands context it can determine the best possible way to safely authenticate a user at that moment. This ensures that the user never encounters more friction than is necessary to secure the service they are accessing. With the right identity solution, you can support exceptional login experiences like <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">single sign on</a> <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">(SSO)</a> to your applications and services for your consumers.</p>

<p>Organizations that put <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumer identity</a> first will win. Check out our report <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/report/the-new-normal-volume-two">here</a> to learn how to put identity at the center of your digital strategy to ensure you’re making the best first impression for your consumers.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Give everyone one hour each day to work on any initiative they’d like — metric-free — to encourage innovation. Create an unproduced video of a user struggling with a system the team believes to be issue-free and role-play until it's resolved. These small yet impactful experiences can quickly reshape employee behaviors and become an integral part of driving larger-scale initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now more than ever, infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) leaders face increased pressure to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-leadership-tactics-to-accelerate-digital-business-transformation/">support digital acceleration</a>, which is not an easy feat during a time of crisis. There is a high likelihood that I&amp;O teams are feeling transformation fatigue, so the question becomes: How can I&amp;O leaders develop a prescriptive, manageable and actionable approach to digital transformation that drives tangible results in the short term?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer: Culture hacks. They can be easily woven into an organization’s cultural fabric and serve as an effective way to encourage transformation without exhausting employees.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-culture-hacks-for-digital-transformation/">10 Culture Hacks for Digital Transformation</a></p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 A well-crafted culture hack has these core attributes: 
 
 Actionable. The hack is easily actioned in a tangible way, and is not theoretical or ambiguous in nature. 
 Low effort. The work required to prepare the hack can be completed in fewer than 48 hours. 
 Immediate. The effects of the hack are practically immediate. 
 Visible. The hack has high signaling power to the group that you’re trying to change. 
 Emotional. The hack triggers a visceral reaction. 
 
<p>“Driving cultural change at a smaller, more visceral level is far more likely to produce timely, lasting behavior improvements,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/53483/Katherine-Lord"> Katherine Lord</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “I&amp;O leaders should embrace the art of culture hacking to enhance organizational agility, innovation and customer centricity.”</p>
<p>To support digital transformation efforts, create a vision of the ideal workplace culture that aligns with the broader IT organization and enterprise. Within I&amp;O, culture hacks can drive four main goals for I&amp;O.</p>
 Goal No. 1: Agility 
<p>Agility came to the forefront for some companies that were forced to become more digital when the pandemic hit. To keep up with, or even surpass, competitors, organizations must remain flexible and agile to adapt to a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-ask-3-questions-before-updating-strategy-post-pandemic/">post-pandemic </a>world and avoid future shocks.</p>
<p>Long-term agility can be achieved by fostering a culture where failure is embraced as a learning opportunity, rather than a wholly negative outcome. Instead of celebrating wins alone, for instance, leave room for celebrations around at least one failed experiment each quarter to ensure proper improvement for the next time. Improve agility further by holding 15-minute stand-up meetings with teams to replace traditional operational meetings.</p>
 Goal No. 2: Innovation 
<p>Innovation challenges traditional mindsets and stagnation, driving clear value-adds for I&amp;O teams. It’s also increasingly important as businesses become more digital and the “next big thing” is right around the corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider holding a hackathon focused on new infrastructure initiatives or reward people for calling out “that’s how we’ve always done it” thinking. As infrastructure evolves and becomes more distributed, culture hacks enable I&amp;O teams to move past traditional, “territorial” thinking — where I&amp;O teams are structured based on roles.</p>
<p>Instead they’ve embraced innovative ways of fulfilling digital business requirements, where I&amp;O teams solve digital challenges by capitalizing on collective skills and collaborating with one another.</p>
 Goal No. 3: Collaboration 
<p>I&amp;O leaders understand the benefits of cross-functional collaborative work but often face cultural resistance to new ways of working. It doesn’t help that traditional I&amp;O organizational siloed structures are often not conducive to cross-collaboration, something that has been compounded by the shift to remote work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tackle this, encourage I&amp;O teams to practice the concept of opt-in teams. Rather than dictating all project assignments for your staff, let them choose a few to work on themselves to ensure ongoing engagement and that their interests are met.</p>
<p>Members of the server operations team might be interested in the organization’s new automation tools, just as the network team may have some new ideas for using DevOps to attain tangible results.</p>
 Goal No. 4: Customer centricity&nbsp; 
<p>Categorize each I&amp;O project based on the business benefit it is expected to deliver. One of the core tenets of the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">2021 CIO Agenda</a> — winning differently — is all about how organizations must go where their customers are, which is increasingly digital.</p>
<p>From a culture hack perspective, this may take the form of placing an empty chair in the conference room (which is likely virtual right now) to ensure that the theoretical voice of the customer is represented, or even role-play a user struggling to navigate a system that I&amp;O believes has no major issues.</p>

<p>“Identifying your preferred end state will support the change journey and goals for your I&amp;O organization,” says Lord. “Keep in mind that there is often a gap between what management perceives to be the culture and what is happening in reality.”</p>

  <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a clear description of the data and allows clients to specify what data they need, Benefits of using GraphQL include: reduced overhead,improved performance, and reduced risk of  potential errors as the API evolves. If the API enhances its functionality, existing clients won’t be affected unless they want to opt in to the new features.</p>

<p>Clients can also obtain many resources with a single request. Typical REST APIs require the client to query multiple resources as more details are required. If, for example, a user needed information about a book, the client would reach out to a <code>book</code> endpoint. If the client then required more information about the author of that book, he/she would need to query the <code>author</code> endpoint. With GraphQL, this can be summarized in one request to the GraphQL server.</p>

<p>Express is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks today. Clean and simple, it offers high performance and rapid development. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement a GraphQL API into your Express server. You will use the npm packages provided by the GraphQL to create a new endpoint where queries can be sent. Then you will implement those queries in your Express server and return the requested data.</p>

<p>You will also need to ensure that your API is protected by proper authentication. For this task, you will use Okta’s easy and secure Single Sign-on provider to create an authorization server. This server will supply the client with a JWT that can be validated by the Express server to ensure the user has permission to access the API. To validate the token, you will use Okta’s <code>jwt-verifier</code>. This library from Okta makes authenticating the requests to your GraphQL server quick and painless.</p>

 Set up Your Okta Authentication Server 

<p>The first thing you need to do is sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> if you don’t already have one. After you’ve completed the sign up, you will need to login and click on Applications. Click Add Application and select Service Machine-To-Machine and then Next. Give your application a meaningful name(I called mine GraphQL), and click Done. On the next page, note your Client ID and Client secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on API in the header and click on Authorization Servers. Okta will add an authorization for you named default. This is the one you will be using for this tutorial. Click on Default and then select Scopes. Click on Add Scope and name it api.  You can use api for the display name as well and give it a meaningful description.  For now you don’t need to check the User Consent, Default Scope, or Metadata Publish options.  Click Create to finalize the scope.  Click on the Settings tab and note your Issuer URL. You will need this in your application as well.</p>

 Create your Web Application 

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE and create a new folder with the command <code>mkdir</code>. Open this folder and run the command <code>npm init -y</code>.</p>

 Install Your Dependencies 

<p>Now you can begin installing your dependencies.</p>

<p>First, install Express. This is the backbone of your application.</p>

   <code>npm i express@4.17.1
</code>   

<p>Next, you will want to install the packages that will help support your GraphQL infrastructure. You must get both the  core GraphQL package and the Express-Graphql adapter.</p>

   <code>npm i graphql@15.3.0
npm i express-graphql@0.11.0
</code>   

<p>Next, install Okta’s JWT-verifier, which will do the heavy lifting validating the JWTs coming from the client.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@1.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will want to install dotenv to have a place to store your secure variables.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

 Build Your Node.js and GraphQL Web Application 

<p>First, add a file called <code>.env</code> to the root of your project. Add the following code to it.</p>

 <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientID}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE='api://default'
APP_BASE_PORT=3000
</code> 

<p>Here you are using the client Id and the issuer that you obtained from your authorization server. You are also specifying which port the application will run on.</p>

<p>Add a file to your root called <code>jwtVerifier.js</code>. This file will act as a wrapper around the Okta JWT verifier library. Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>const OktaJwtVerifier = require('@okta/jwt-verifier')

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
    issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER,
    clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
})

module.exports = async (request, response, next) =&gt; {

    const { authorization } = request.headers;

    if (!authorization) {
        return response.status(401).send();
    }

    const [authType, token] = authorization.trim().split(' ');

    try {
        const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE)

        if (!claims) {
            return response.status(401).send();
        }
        if (!claims.scp.includes('api')) {
            return response.status(401).send();
        }

        return next();
    }
    catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return response.status(401).send();
    }    
}
</code>   

<p>The Okta JWT Verifier will produce an exception when the token is invalid, so you will need to catch the error and handle it in a way that is appropriate for your application. You also want to check to ensure the authorization header is present on the request and that a token has been issued. Finally, you want to ensure the claim contains a scope for <code>api</code> that you added earlier in your authorization server.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>server.js</code>. This file will be the meat of your application. Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>'use strict';

const express = require('express');

const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql');
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql')

const jwtVerifier = require('./jwtVerifier')

const start = function (options) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, p) =&gt; {
            console.log("Unhandled Rejection at: Promise", p, "reason:", reason);
        });

        if (!options.port) {
            reject(new Error("no port specificed"));
        }

        const app = express();

        app.use(function (error, request, response, next) {
            console.log(error);
            reject(new Error("something went wrong" + error));
            response.status(500).send("something went wrong");
        });

        const schema = buildSchema(`

                            type Employee {
                                id: Int
                                first_name: String
                                last_name: String

                            }
                            
                            type Employees {
                                employees: [Employee]
                            }

                                employee(id: Int!): Employee
                            }
                    `);

        const root = {
            employees: () =&gt; {
                return data;
            },
            employee: (i) =&gt; {
                return data.employees.filter((r) =&gt; r.id == i.id)[0]
            }
        };

        app.use("/graphQl", ensureAuthenticated, graphqlHTTP({
            schema: schema,
            rootValue: root,
            graphiql: true,
        }));

        const server = app.listen(options.port, function () {
            resolve(server);
        });
    });
};

function ensureAuthenticated (request, response, next) {
    return jwtVerifier(request, response, next);
}

const data = {
    "employees": [
        {

        {
            "id": 2,
            "first_name": "Giavani",
            "last_name": "Frediani",
            "email": "gfrediani1@senate.gov",
            "gender": "Male",
            "ip_address": "229.179.4.212"

        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "first_name": "Willard",
            "last_name": "Valek",
            "email": "wvalek3@vk.com",

            "ip_address": "67.76.188.26"
        }
    ]
}

module.exports = Object.assign({}, { start });
</code>   

<p>This file kicks off your Express server with the <code>start</code> function. To use GraphQL you must bring in the GraphQL module and tell your application to use it. You can specify whatever endpoint you like. Here you have set it to <code>/GraphQL</code>. At the bottom of the file is some sample data. The trick now is to connect the sample data to your <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint.</p>

<p>You do this by building a schema. The schema has definitions for your objects and object types. Here you have an <code>Employees</code> class, which is an array of <code>Employee</code> objects. <code>Employee</code> itself has several primitive fields attached to it. You also must define your query. Here is where you tell the client what functions are available to it via the server. In this case, you have an <code>employees</code> function that will return the full list of employees and an <code>employee</code> function that will return one employee based on a required <code>id</code> parameter. In the <code>root</code> object, you define handlers for these functions. For <code>employees</code>, you are just returning the sample data provided. For <code>employee</code>, you must collect the parameters and find the employee’s data based on the id property of the query.</p>

<p>You are also using the <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware in the <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint. This will call your <code>jwtVerifier</code> and check the token presented in the <code>Authorization</code> header. Clients that don’t provide a valid JWT will be rejected with a <code>401</code> (unauthorized) HTTP code.</p>

<p>Lastly, you need to provide an entry point for your application. Create a new file called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>'use strict'

require('dotenv').config();

const server = require('./server')

const port = process.env.APP_BASE_PORT;

server.start({
    port: port
}).then(app =&gt; {
    console.log('Application is now running on port ' + port);
})
</code>   

<p>This file does two notable things. First, it calls dotenv’s <code>config()</code> function. Per the documentation, this should be placed as early in the application as possible. Second, it kicks off the server using the server file you just created.</p>

 Test Your GraphQL API 

<p>You can now start your application using <code>node index.js</code> from the console. To test this, I like to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US">Advanced Rest Client</a>, but <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> is another popular option.</p>

<p>First, ensure your authorization is working correctly.  Create a new POST request targeting the <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint.  Set your <code>Content-Type</code> to <code>application/graphql</code>.  Add the following code to your body:</p>

   <code>{
    employees
    {
        employees
        {
            id,
            first_name
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Submit the request, and you should receive a <code>401</code> back from the server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To resolve this, you first need to query your authorization server from Okta that you created at the beginning of this tutorial. Set up a new <code>POST</code> request to <code>{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>. You will need to add a <code>Content-Type</code> header with the value <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. You will also need to pass the following parameters in the body: <code>grant_type</code> should be set to <code>client_credentials</code>; <code>scope</code> will be set to <code>api</code> and <code>client_id</code> should be set to <code>{yourClientId}</code> and <code>client_secret</code> to <code>{yourClientSecret}</code>. Once you have these fields complete, you can make a request to the Okta authorization server, which should return a valid JWT to you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With your JWT, head back to your request for the  <code>GraphQL</code> endpoint and add an authorization header. The value should be <code>Bearer {yourJWTToken}</code>. Post your request again, and you should have the results passed back to you.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn More About GraphQL and Node.js 

<p>You have successfully built your GraphQL API and integrated it into Express on your Node.JS server. You can enhance your API without impacting users already using this version on your GraphQL API by simply adding new fields or functionality to your schema. You have also learned how to secure the API using Okta’s JWT Verification and authorization server.</p>

<p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-134-doj-challenges-visa-plaid-ssi-is-hot-stuff-f7811bdda7cd">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Why Groups is “the future of the internet”  Big Tech antitrust momentum builds around the&nbsp;world  The Bitcoin party continues  Stuff happens  Photo: Priscilla Du&nbsp;Preez 1. Back in September, we noted the spiritual similarities between Discord’s latest pivot and GlobaliD’s vision for Groups. Now, Protocol is describing that framework as “the future of the internet.” <p>(For reference, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-125-everyone-v-apple-discords-groups-vision-">The GiD Report #125 — Discord’s Groups&nbsp;vision</a>)</p><p><a href="https://www.protocol.com/discord">Protocol on the Discord pivot</a> (via&nbsp;Jun):</p><blockquote>Fast-forward a few years, and Discord is at the center of the gaming universe. It has more than 100 million monthly active users, in millions of communities for every game and player imaginable. Its largest servers have millions of members. Discord’s slowly building a business around all that popularity, too, and is now undergoing a big pivot: It’s pushing to turn the platform into a communication tool not just for gamers, but for everyone from study groups to sneakerheads to gardening enthusiasts. Five years in, Discord’s just now realizing it may have stumbled into something like the future of the internet. Almost by accident.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>“On one hand, it’s a lot like Slack, blending public channels with easy side-chats and plenty of ways to rope in the right people. It’s also a bit like Reddit, full of ever-evolving conversations that you can either try to keep up with or just jump into when you log in. (In fact, a lot of popular subreddits now have dedicated Discords, for more real-time chat among Redditors.) It uses simple status indicators to show who’s online and what they’re up to. But by putting all those things together, in a way that felt more like hanging out than doing work, Discord found something remarkable.”</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>“As we look back at the last few months,” Citron and Vishnevskiy wrote in a blog post announcing the redesign, “it’s clear that as people spend more and more time online, they want online spaces where they can find real humanity and belonging.”</blockquote><p>We’ve always said here at GlobaliD that your digital identity is merely the permission to act. What’s more important is what you can do with that — interacting and transacting with people, communities, and businesses — all within an ecosystem built on real&nbsp;trust.</p><p>As Greg Kidd&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>In my mind, Discord is all about Groups. This well informs us that we are hunting around in the right space trying to find our own unique combo of identity, communication, and&nbsp;money.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ol3RSIykPc">How Facebook opened Pandora’s box — Tristan Harris | Andrew Yang | Yang&nbsp;Speaks</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-societal-problem-of-only-needing-1-000-true-fans-to-be-successful-online">The Societal Problem of Only Needing 1,000 True Fans to Be Successful Online</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/junhiraga">/jun</a>— <a href="https://www.protocol.com/discord">How Discord (somewhat accidentally) invented the future of the&nbsp;internet</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/instagram-head-adam-mosseri-on-reels-ads-e-commerce-2020-election.html">Instagram’s Adam Mosseri confirms ads are coming to Reels and defends Facebook’s 2020 election&nbsp;response</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">PayPal says all users in US can now buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.mmhmm.app/blog/we-raised-some-money">We raised some money |&nbsp;mmhmm</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-3eb66608-1976-4097-97a0-f4d532f2a1b5.html">Parler exec defends allowing conspiracy theories, misinformation</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/2020-election-update.html">An update on our work around the 2020 US Elections</a>   2.

Englander expects the Fed to increase the pace of bond buying, which Powell alluded to at the policy meeting earlier this month. The Fed could also “add targeted measures to encourage credit provision to struggling businesses, limited to loans on good collateral.”  <blockquote>But, but, but: Englander doesn’t see these “measures as substitutes for fiscal policy, but somewhat effective measures are preferable to no measures” for the&nbsp;Fed.</blockquote><p>Because fiscal policy is likely coming soon,&nbsp;too.</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-fatf-travel-rule-threshold-v20-summit">Why FinCEN Wants Details on All Cross-Border Transactions Over $250 — CoinDesk</a>\  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chairman-jay-clayton-stepping-down-at-end-of-year">SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Stepping Down at End of Year — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84255/andreesen-horowitz-backed-deel-launches-crypto-payroll-tool">Andreesen Horowitz-backed Deel launches crypto payroll&nbsp;tool</a>   4.

<p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive Digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue, and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together.</p>Photo credit: Emrys Schoemaker<p>The use of digital technologies in identification systems (Digital ID) is increasingly central to the digital transformations reshaping politics, economies and societies, accelerated by the demands of COVID-19. Caribou Digital recognises digital ID as a critical pillar in building inclusive digital economies, so we asked experts and thought leaders from across four continents, diverse national contexts and from government, international development and humanitarian as well as academic and civil society contexts leading work on digital identification to share what key trends they see in their&nbsp;work.</p> Here are five takeaways from the discussion   The state of the art in digital identification are trust frameworks that accommodate diverse technologies, systems and stakeholders:  <p>The experts gathered broadly agreed that there was an increasing turn to trust frameworks in work on digital identification rather than an emphasis on specific systems — a trend that Caribou Digital’s <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/emrys-schoemaker-and-tom-kirk-introduce-caribou-digitals-new-project-to-develop-an-identity-8ec31ba61c9b">National Identity Ecosystem Mapping </a>tool aims to support. Building trust frameworks rather than systems is helpful because in determining principles and rules you can accommodate innovations in system and technology without being limited to what’s currently available.</p><p>Trust frameworks have dependencies that many contexts lack, yet even there, trust frameworks are recognised goals. As some guests noted, trust frameworks rely on the existence of authoritative sources of identification. In states with developed institutions of identity issuance such as reliable birth registration or with developed standards and compliance bodies, such as legal and governance institutions, trust frameworks have a foundation and architecture that can support the development of reliable standards for identity management. Where these institutions are weak or absent, trust frameworks have limited scope. Even in contexts where these institutions may not be as developed there is a trend towards developing trust frameworks, but that they had to work within the realities of their contexts, which often meant supporting the development of centrally located authoritative sources. For example, in the Philippines there are plans for a trust framework, but there are important first steps to be taken to develop foundational identity issuance, such as the <a href="http://rsso12.psa.gov.ph/content/about-philippine-identification-system">national ID scheme&nbsp;PhilSys</a>.</p><p>One key insight from an expert involved in developing an advanced trust framework noted that ‘you have to drive institutions to drive change’ — that the integrity of systems and trustworthiness of programs is driven by institutions, even more so than legal and policy frameworks.</p><p>2. Risks remain even within the most rigorous trust framework:</p><p>Another key insight was that risks remain even within the most rigorous trust framework — for example levels of confidence and clarity on responsibility for proofing. Tiered Know Your Customer (KYC) is one strategy for managing the risk of getting identification wrong — for example, the tiered KYC articulated by bodies and frameworks such as FATF and eIDAS reflects the fact that people may have different ways of proving who they are, so for example people may have greater confidence in someone with a birth certificate or driving license than someone with only letter of employment, and parties have to assess the risk of relying on those identity documents when deciding whether or not to trust (believe) that someone is who they say they are. The level of confidence in the credential is mostly determined by the authority responsible for and processes involved in issuing the credential — state issued documents such as birth certificates or driving licences are generally trusted more than credentials issued by private sector actors such as Facebook or&nbsp;Google.</p><p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the different roles of public and private sector actors in identity proofing, for example, whether Facebook might be a form of ID that could be used to access formal services. One important point which emerged from the expert discussion was that whether this happens is not inevitable. Indeed there was a general agreement that policy decisions are key to determining the form and nature of approaches to identity management.</p><p>3. Achieving inclusion requires addressing both technical and political dimensions:</p><p>The issue of inclusion and exclusion is a perennial issue facing digital identification, particularly for state services intended to achieve whole populations. Our guests emphasised the challenges involved in relying on state issued foundational credentials such as birth certificates in contexts where the issuing institutions may be weak or for populations whose access to them may be limited, such as the displaced and refugees who may have left them&nbsp;behind.</p><p>At a technical level, interoperability is one of the most talked about issues in digital identification, with the potential of linking separate datasets, systems and services offering opportunities for efficiency, accuracy and the inclusion of greater numbers of people in service populations. Siloed systems also limit marginalised populations such as refugees from being able to access mainstream national services — though as we have found, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">achieving interoperability can best be accomplished through the kind of standards</a> that can be embodied in a trust framework. Experts working on COVID-19 also emphasised how linking different information systems increased social protection beneficiaries — though this <a href="https://socialprotection.org/discover/publications/space-linking-humanitarian-social-protection-information-systems-covid-19">comes with challenges</a> — particularly <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">increased risks to privacy and data protection</a>.</p><p>The politics of inclusion are also key, as system design — intentionally or otherwise — that fails to identify and address vulnerable and marginalised populations can lead to exclusion. As one guest said ‘if the government doesn’t want inclusivity out of a system, you won’t get inclusion’. A particular theme of this discussion was the importance of recognising that system architecture can be a key driver of both inclusion and exclusion, and that politics are translated through system design and operation. We recognise this, and our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/emrys-schoemaker-and-tom-kirk-introduce-caribou-digitals-new-project-to-develop-an-identity-8ec31ba61c9b">national identity ecosystem mapping tool</a> is intended to map the ecosystem and support a political economy analysis to identify potential risks and vulnerabilities.</p><p>4. Trust frameworks are complicated so getting governance right requires an ecosystems approach:</p><p>Governance is a critical issue for identification systems, and particularly so for trust frameworks, given they consist of process rules and standards and must accommodate diverse actors, sectors and systems. Some emphasised the importance of independent authorities to lead on digital identification, to fulfill leadership, regulatory and accountability functions.</p><p>Governance of trust frameworks requires an ecosystem approach, one that goes beyond the focus on a single system — as one expert noted ‘you have to take a jurisdictional approach and instead of focusing on ‘systems’ focus on the jurisdiction as a whole.’ Translating the framework so that it can be understood by all stakeholders within the jurisdiction was also described as important — for example ensuring clarity over roles and responsibilities within the framework, ‘in such a way that the mutual and competing interests are served’. It’s critical to get clarity over governance right early on — as one expert noted, ‘far too often this *fight* is pushed down the track, only for it to rear its head later’. In one context, adopting the right language has been helpful — ‘shifting the policy language to ‘issuers’, ‘holders’ and ‘verifiers’ irrespective of the program or document. We’ve also found it important to be clear about terms — for example differentiating <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">identity, identification and digital&nbsp;ID</a>.</p><p>5. Building the future of digital identification means reckoning with an analogue&nbsp;past:</p><p>The discussion covered a range of challenges facing the deployment of digital identification, but one that kept coming up was the challenge of transitioning from old to new&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Dealing with legacy systems was recognised as a critical issue — as in most cases new systems are deployed over old systems. guests flagged critical questions such as asking ‘what existing data sets do Governments hold that can support identity proofing?’ This can identify existing credentials that can serve as proxies for identification — such as driving licenses or passports. Again, comprehensive ecosystem mapping can help identify existing systems, credentials and opportunities — as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">this map of Kenya’s identity ecosystem shows</a>.</p><p>This is particularly the case with identification and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, where a number of guests emphasised the importance of moving beyond standalone ID systems and engaging with the challenge of strengthening civil systems. Recognising the challenge of reforming CRVS systems, and the data protection issues involved in vital statistics management, one suggestion was to delink civil registration from vital statistics, as well as to ensure that reforms put individuals at the&nbsp;centre.</p><p>The introduction of new systems and frameworks also highlights the challenge of reforms and the pace of change. One participant noted how changing approaches to finance meant that people still used cheques so people had to find ways to accommodate them into the digital age, for example enabling cheque scanning options on mobile banking applications so the two worlds are co-existing but it’s incredibly expensive to maintain. A key task in planning transitions to digital identity is to clarify time horizons — with one participant asking ‘what can we do now and where do we want to be in 15–20 years&nbsp;time?’</p><p>This brief is an edited account of the full discussion reflecting our takeaways from this rich conversation and does not reflect the views or consensus of participants.</p> Participants   Subhashish Bhadra, Principal, Omidyar Network,&nbsp;India  Tim Bouma, Senior Policy Analyst Identity Management, Canada Treasury Board Secretariat  Kelvin Hui, Digital Health &amp; Social Protection Advisor | Project Manager at&nbsp;GIZ  Jonathan Marskell, Digital ID, Legal Identity &amp; Use Cases — ID4D, World Bank&nbsp;Group  Niall McCann, Policy Advisor and Project Manager, Legal Identity at United&nbsp;Nations  Nick Oakeshott, Senior Identity Management Officer,&nbsp;UNHCR  Golala Ruhani, Digital Development Policy Specialist, Swedish&nbsp;SIDA  Hannah Rutter, Deputy Director, Digital Identity at UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and&nbsp;Sport  Isaac Rutenberg, Senior Lecturer and Director, Centre for IP and IT Law (CIPIT), Strathmore University, Kenya  Emrys Schoemaker, Research Director, Caribou&nbsp;Digital  Fabro Steibel, Executive Director, ITS Rio, Professor of Innovation  Michiel van der Veen, Director of Innovation &amp; Development, Netherlands National Service for Identity&nbsp;Data  Edgar Whitley, Associate Professor (Reader) at London School of Economics  Kaliya Young, Independent Advisor, Self-Sovereign / Decentralized Identity  Some participants chose to remain anonymous   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/diagnostic-trends-shaping-the-future-of-digital-identification-181724c40068">Diagnostic: Trends shaping the future of Digital Identification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has spurred new enthusiasm for national digital identity schemes to facilitate enhanced government services. This blog post reviews notable initiatives to date this year, and critical challenges facing the implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments have been thrust into the spotlight, as COVID-19 has brought crises to countries worldwide. This tested their ability to quickly disperse aid to individuals and small businesses, provide public services to citizens, and contain the virus’ spread. Against this background, digital identity has emerged as a critical factor for success. However, growing pains still remain, as countries struggle to react to a newly pressing need for a digital identity public service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotlight on the US</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for a digital identity infrastructure was made particularly evident in the U.S. A national identity system has never gained traction in the U.S., despite&nbsp;<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/15/president-obama-releases-national-strategy-trusted-identities-cyberspace">some efforts from the Obama administration</a>. However, government agencies recognize the need for identity verification tools as they face rampant fraud in the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-fraud.html">&nbsp;collection of unemployment benefits</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/where-did-the-money-go-the-government-s-24118/">&nbsp;PPP loans</a>. State agencies, such as<a href="https://gcn.com/articles/2020/10/12/california-idme-unemployment-insurance.aspx">&nbsp;those of California</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://des.az.gov/sites/default/files/media/newsrelease-10-12-2020-DES-Partners-with-ID-me-to-Further-Prevent-Unemployment-Fraud-through-Advanced-Identity-Verification-System.pdf">&nbsp;Arizona</a>, have consequently hired private sector companies to facilitate identity verification services to reduce the backlog and fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September, a bipartisan cohort introduced the Improving Digital Identity Act of 2020 to roll out a standards-based approach to digital identity for use in private and public sectors. The bill positions identity fraud as a central motivating factor for improving digital identity infrastructure, citing over $16 billion lost in 2019 from identity fraud. One of the leading bill writers<a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2020/09/bipartisan-house-bill-targets-improving-digital-identity-verification/168456/">, Jim Langevin, notes</a>, “The COVID-19 pandemic and our increased reliance on the internet to accomplish everyday tasks has made it abundantly clear that we should build out our digital identity infrastructure.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Stress Test</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments in<a href="https://www.digitalfuturemagazine.com/2020/05/27/colombia-enters-the-age-of-digital-citizens-services-based-on-the-european-eidas-regulation-decree-620-2020/">&nbsp;Colombia</a>&nbsp;to<a href="https://www.digitalfuturemagazine.com/2020/05/27/colombia-enters-the-age-of-digital-citizens-services-based-on-the-european-eidas-regulation-decree-620-2020/">&nbsp;Madagascar</a>&nbsp;have also taken this moment to advance legislation for government digitization and invest in building national digital identity infrastructure. Moreover, the<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/26/world-bank-announces-mission-billion-challenge-winners-spotlighting-digital-id-for-resilient-recovery">&nbsp;World Bank has publicly championed</a>&nbsp;digital identity systems to support digital economies that have taken off due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, while COVID-19 has undoubtedly accelerated the development and implementation of national digital identity schemes globally, governments continue to face many critical challenges. Some governments are confronting critical technical setbacks and issues in private-public sector coordination and the need to ensure that data privacy regimes will protect citizens’ rights and minimize<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/digital-ids-are-more-dangerous-than-you-think/">&nbsp;the threat of widespread surveillance and cybersecurity breaches</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other countries have seen their digital identity systems stress-tested. For instance, Gov.UK Verify, U.K.’s digital identity service for government services, saw their users more than double as people attempted to claim Universal Credit for financial support. Additionally, account creations<a href="https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/Scaling+up+GOV.UK+Verify+to+help+during+coronavirus+12052020091000?open">&nbsp;increased from 35,000</a>&nbsp;in a week pre-COVID-19 to a weekly average of over 80,000 account creations between mid-March to mid-May. Identity providers for Gov.UK Verify initially struggled to meet demand at scale, with queues peaking at 155,000 people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second Chances for Infrastructure&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>U.K. citizens’ need for digital infrastructure extended the lifetime of Gov.UK Verify, which had<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/201903/gov-uk-digital-id-service-has-fraction-of-intended-users-and-verifies-less-than-half-successfully">&nbsp;previously faced criticism for low uptake</a>. In April 2020, funding for the service was extended for another 18 months due to renewed interest. Moreover, the U.K. government has introduced a plan for an overhaul of the digital infrastructure, including Document Checking Service, a private-public collaboration for passport authentication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Australia has similarly faced implementation challenges for its government identity service, myGovID, which will serve as the primary identity credential for government services and the government’s identity verification service. Initially planned for launch by May 2020, the service was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/mygov-digital-id-integration-in-limbo-as-dta-misses-target-rollout-date-550403">delayed</a>&nbsp;due to system integration errors, unsatisfactory user experience, and a lack of vendors for their “liveness detection” feature. myGovID is now planned for launch by the end of the year, while an old solution<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/services-australia-repurposed-a-years-old-id-solution-to-meet-covid-demand-555519">, Connected ID</a>, has been revived to temporarily fill in the pandemic-caused demand surge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the U.S., U.K., and Australia, further new legislation has been highlighted as a key enabler for the continued development of digital identity. All three countries have specifically expressed interest in creating legislation governing private-public involvement. Privacy advocates will also push for clear data privacy regulation to prevent the potential insidious effects of centralized databases containing highly sensitive personal identity attributes, running from Big Brother-style surveillance to attractive honeypots for cyberhackers. The U.K. has<a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/business/verify-2-0-industry-experts-cautiously-welcome-uk-efforts-to-overhaul-digital-identity-services">&nbsp;faced criticism</a>&nbsp;in this regard, while Australia has<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/digital-identity-legislation-up-for-consultation-557911">&nbsp;incorporated data privacy legislation</a>&nbsp;for their Trusted Digital Identity Framework, which is currently up for consultation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments’ Growing Appetite for Identity&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this end, we expect that as government appetite for digital identity infrastructure continues to increase because of COVID-19, so too will the conversation around data privacy grow. Contact tracing serves as a clear case study, as data collected on citizens for COVID-19 can potentially blur with that leveraged for national identity databases. For example, India’s Aadhaar has been used to<a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/can-big-data-fight-pandemic">&nbsp;facilitate the distribution of welfare more than it has been used for contact tracing</a>. Still, privacy concerns have stemmed from the government’s data processing practices for the mobile tracking programs that it does run for contract tracing because these practices<a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/money/why-data-privacy-must-be-safeguarded-even-in-times-of-covid-19/1963579/">&nbsp;run counter to Aadhaar privacy guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>China serves as a more concrete example. An intensive COVID-19 health codes system for contact tracing has continued to further pre-existing surveillance concerns. Because of the health codes’ high coverage of China’s population – all residents are required to have a health codes app ­– there is speculation that the government will leverage the existing health codes data<a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-coronavirus-health-code-qr">&nbsp;to supplement their social credit system</a>. To this end, notable cities like<a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005703/citys-plan-for-permanent-health-codes-sparks-online-backlash">&nbsp;Hangzhou</a>&nbsp;and<a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/tech/article/3100270/shanghai-adds-personal-id-its-covid-19-health-codes-joining-new">&nbsp;Shanghai</a>&nbsp;expand the potential use cases of the health codes and track more personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, contact tracing has the potential to allow governments to collect personal identity data without adhering to the same level of scrutiny over privacy that might have existed during non-crisis times. The concern is that the temporary solutions that were implemented without proper data safeguards may become permanent, creating national digital identity systems that are more invasive for citizens than helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The OWI Take</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2020 has seen strong traction in both interest and the development of digital identity programs thanks (in large part) to COVID-19. Still, there is no newly discovered silver bullet for the development of digital identity systems. In fact, while stakeholder interest — a common hurdle before 2020 — may have increased, other challenges still persist, as public-private sector coordination, technical infrastructure implementation, and privacy concerns have plagued many governments worldwide this year. Considering these challenges, we see tremendous opportunity for private sector initiatives to support governments as they continue to implement digital identity systems in what will hopefully be an efficient, transparent, privacy-preserving, and user-centric manner.</p>

  <p>Facial recognition technology is used daily by many to access their mobile phones, but acceptance of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/is-your-product-development-ready-for-zero-touch-user-interfaces/">facial recognition</a> doesn’t always extend beyond personal use. Many jurisdictions have put this technology “on hold,” as it raises complex ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>“There is a strong negative sentiment against the use of face recognition technology. It is being seen as an invasion of privacy and a step toward mass surveillance,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/17247">Frank Buytendijk</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is more important, safety or privacy in the streets and in public buildings? The appropriate use of facial recognition technology depends on the prevailing culture, ethics, legislation and practices.</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Currently, there are no widely used or accepted regulations governing facial recognition, which means data and analytics leaders need to turn to digital ethics to use facial recognition technology responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
 Battle issues of bias and false positives by making facial recognition more reliable 
<p>Facial recognition is far from perfect. Training bias means that facial recognition technology isn’t always equally accurate for all types of faces. For example, some facial recognition technologies may not be able to identify the race or gender of individuals correctly. This inaccuracy leads to people being misidentified.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is very easy for facial recognition to misinterpret nuanced facial expressions. For example, an expression that conveys a polite greeting in one culture may indicate confirmation or agreement in another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider the reliability of facial recognition technology before deciding to make it operational. Take the time to develop sufficient countermeasures or verification procedures to battle the issues of bias and false positives.</p>

 Establish proportional use of facial recognition by evaluating less invasive technologies 
<p>Proportionality is a very important ethical concept. In a technological context, it means that an organization should use technology powerful enough to solve a particular problem, but not much more powerful. It’s important to understand why an activity is being undertaken and question the accompanying technological deployment and subsequent data creation and usage.</p>
<p>Consider whether the end goal can be achieved with a less invasive technology. “Finding the appropriate use and focusing on gathering only necessary data is key to striking the right balance,” says Buytendijk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, for a retail outlet, having security camera surveillance that can prevent instances of shoplifting seems useful, but definitely an invasion of privacy. In this scenario, a standard video-recording security camera is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>
 Restrict use of facial recognition data by establishing purpose boundaries 
<p>Data should preferably be processed for specific, deliberate, predefined purposes. Ethical issues often arise when data use crosses the originally stated purpose boundaries, also known as the “lineage of intent.”</p>
<p>For instance, facial recognition results used outside a parking lot to open the barriers and facilitate quick entry and exit of vehicles could also be used by car dealers as business leads. But that would be problematic because users did not agree to share the facial recognition data to facilitate business for car retailers.</p>
<p>For any data collected via facial recognition technology, it’s critical that data and analytics leaders explicitly determine and document its lineage of intent and restrict its use to only that predefined purpose.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">3 Actions for Ethical Data Collection During Pandemics</a></p>
 Respond to jurisdictional differences by expanding the rights of people identified in images 
<p>The ownership of facial recognition data is a point of contention in many jurisdictions, as it is often perceived as an invasion of privacy by governments. Data and analytics leaders need to ask these important questions: “Who owns the image of your face?” “Who owns the image of the expressions you make in public?” “Are emotions conveyed correctly in the public domain?” “Does the party that creates, measures and holds the data own that data?”</p>
<p>On the one hand, facial expressions that are made in a public place are potentially available for everyone present to see, so they’re not completely private. On the other hand, facial expressions are often made subconsciously, and they are transient. They are simply not meant to be systematically captured, stored and analyzed.</p>
<p>Data and analytics leaders need to work with their legal teams to understand the intellectual property rights relevant to facial recognition images and analysis. Treat facial recognition data not from the perspective of the organization’s rights, but rather from the perspective of the rights of the people portrayed.&nbsp;</p>

   Start Planning Now to Ensure Your Customers Aren't Robbed by Resellers 

<p>We’ve all heard about the damage malicious botnets, or bots, can cause. When a bot is used for evil, it can overwhelm an entire website and stop business. We’ve recently seen an upsurge of less obviously destructive bots that have a singular purpose: to buy up your stock of the latest must-have items before your customers do and sell them back to your own customers at a markup. These bots can impact your sales and the great customer experience you’ve worked so hard to create. And, with the holiday season just around the corner, retail bots wreaking havoc on the availability of popular items couldn’t come at a worse time.&nbsp;</p>

 How Retail Bots Work 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/retail">Retail</a> bots automatically monitor stock levels of leading retailers for popular items. As soon as these items are in stock, the bots immediately buy as many of them as they can while masquerading as consumers who are making purchases on your website. The bots add the item to their shopping carts, enter shipping information, and complete payment – all in a blink of an eye. Then they repeat the process over and over again until the targeted items sell out. If you do a little online legwork, you’ll find the items popping up on online auction sites a few hours later being scalped for double or triple your original retail price.&nbsp;</p>

 The Customer Experience Suffers – and so do Retailers 

<p>This is a frustrating experience for consumers left empty-handed when online retail shelves are wiped out. Customers don’t forget it. And on top of disappointing your customers, scalpers often end up returning their ill-gotten gains to your website when they aren’t sold, costing you even more time and money in lost sales.</p>

<p>This is not good for your customers, and it’s not good for you. As we approach the 2020 holiday shopping season – &nbsp;a peak retail period – &nbsp;we expect to see much more of this activity. But there are steps you can take to prevent bots from spoiling the season.</p>

 Who is the Real Customer? Identity is at the Core. 

<p>Essentially, we are dealing with an<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity"> identity</a> problem: How do we know we are dealing with a real customer and not a bot? To answer this question, we need to examine a range of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">environmental, contextual, and behavioral factors</a> and use these to make decisions in real time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> gives you the power to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/api-security-awareness-and-moderation-are-key">unmask the bots</a>. Using a wide range of data sources, our platform can <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">make decisions in real time and adapt the login or guest checkout journeys</a> to make them more challenging when we suspect a bot is present and hassle-free for legitimate customers.</p>

<p>Don’t let retail bots ruin the holidays for you or your valued customers. Read our white paper <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/block-the-bots-to-keep-your-customers-coming-back">Block the Bots to Keep Your Customers Coming Back</a>, which looks at how a retail bot works and how you can leverage the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> to defend against bots today and as they evolve in the future.</p>

 Das CIAM von Ubisecure ermöglicht jetzt mithilfe der Verimi-Dienste zum Registrieren, Anmelden und Nutzen digitaler Signaturen die schnelle Akzeptanz digitaler Identitäten für Verbraucher in Deutschland und ganz Europa. 
<p>BERLIN UND MÜNCHEN – 16 November 2020 – Verimi, der führende Identitätsanbieter in Deutschland, und Ubisecure, ein Experte für CIAM-Lösungen (Customer Identity and Access Management) mit Niederlassungen in ganz Europa, haben heute eine strategische Partnerschaft angekündigt.</p>
<p>(Read this press release in English <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/verimi-partnership/">here</a>)</p>
<p>Mit Verimi lassen sich die im Rahmen der Customer IAM- (CIAM) und IDaas-Lösungen (Identity as a Service) angebotenen Authentifizierungsmethoden einfach um digitale Identitäten erweitern. Ubisecure und Verimi kombinieren hierzu ihre Identitätsmanagementfähigkeiten in einer gemeinsamen Lösung, die Unternehmenskunden ein nahtloses Identitätsmanagement für ihre externen Nutzer (wie Kunden, Geschäftspartner, Bürger) bietet. Dreh- und Angelpunkt ist hierbei das datenschutzzentrierte Design nach dem “Privacy by Design-Prinzip”.</p>
<p>Die digitale Identitätslösung von Verimi bietet Verbrauchern eine validierbare, flexible und bequeme Möglichkeit, Ihre Kontakte mit Unternehmen und Behörden abzuwickeln. Bei Verimi hat der Nutzer die alleinige Datenhoheit und entscheidet, welche Daten an den jeweiligen Anwendungspartner weitergegeben werden. Alle Benutzerdaten werden verifiziert, so dass sich die Anwendungspartner sicher sein können, mit wem sie es zu tun haben, während die Benutzer von der einfachen Anmeldung bei verschiedenen Diensten profitieren.</p>
<p>Das CIAM von Ubisecure ermöglicht die schnelle Integration von Identitäts- und Zugriffsmanagementfunktionen wie Single Sign-On (SSO) und Multi-Faktor-Authentifizierung (MFA), sowie den Zugang zu einer Vielzahl von vertrauenswürdigen Identitätsanbietern (IdPs) und vielschichtige Möglichkeiten zum Delegieren von Autoritäten. Es ermöglicht Arbeitsabläufe, mit denen sich eine bessere Datensicherheit, optimierte Kundenerfahrung und genauere Einhaltung einschlägiger Vorschriften realisieren lassen. Die CIAM-Lösung kann je nach Kundenbedürfnissen und -präferenzen als IDaaS-, Cloud- oder lokal installierte Software bereitgestellt werden.</p>
<p>Dienstleister in Deutschland intensivieren ihre Digitalisierungsbemühungen, insbesondere vor dem Hintergrund der aktuellen globalen Situation mit ihren vielen Einschränkungen des persönlichen Kontakts. Diese gemeinsame Lösung bietet den Kundenorganisationen von Ubisecure und Verimi branchenübergreifend die Möglichkeit, ihre Lösungen mit einem nahtlosen Identitätsmanagement zu digitalisieren, von der Registrierung bis zur anschließenden Anmeldung, und dies durchgängig über den gesamten Lebenszyklus der Identität. Beispielsweise könnte eine Bank die Lösung so einsetzen, dass ihre Kunden sich mit ihrer Verimi-ID nahtlos in alle ihre digitalen Dienste einloggen und diese Identitäten dann mit den von Ubisecure bereitgestellten Workflows sicher und gesetzeskonform verwalten können. Verimi wird von Dienstleistern wie Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Postbank, Deutsche Telekom und vielen anderen akzeptiert.</p>
<p>Roland Adrian, Geschäftsführer von Verimi sagt dazu: “Wir sind hoch erfreut, dass wir mit Ubisecure einen führenden CIAM-Anbieter in Europa als Partner gewinnen konnten. Ubisecure hat Zugang zum relevanten Markt und kennt dank seiner langjährigen Erfahrung genau die Bedürfnisse von Verbrauchern und Unternehmen.”</p>
<p>Volker Zinser, Regionsleiter DACH bei Ubisecure, kommentiert dies wie folgt: “Es ist fantastisch, die Verimi-Plattform als Authentifizierungslösung für unsere Kunden in Deutschland und anderen Ländern anbieten zu können. Sie sind führend in ihrem Bereich und haben einen ausgezeichneten Ruf für gesetzeskonforme, sichere und nutzerzentrierte Lösungen – die gleichen Eigenschaften, auf die Ubisecure bei seinen Produkten stolz ist. Die Verwendung des OpenID Connect-Standards hat die Integration unserer Technologien ermöglicht und gezeigt, dass sich Investitionen in offene Standards und Interoperabilität wirklich auszahlen.”</p>

 Ubisecure CIAM now enables rapid acceptance of digital identities with Verimi Services for registration, login &amp; digital signatures for consumers in Germany and across Europe. 
<p>BERLIN AND MUNICH, GERMANY – 16 November 2020 – Today Verimi, the leading identity provider in Germany, and Ubisecure, a customer identity and access management (CIAM) solutions expert with offices across Europe, announced a strategic partnership.</p>
<p>(Read this press release in German <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/deutsch-blog/verimi-partnerschaft/">here</a>)</p>
<p>With Verimi, digital identities can be added easily to authentication methods offered through Ubisecure’s Customer IAM (CIAM) and IDaas (Identity as a Service) solutions. Ubisecure and Verimi combine their identity management capabilities to provide a joint solution that provides customer companies with seamless identity management for their external users (such as customers, partners, citizens), with “Privacy by Design” at the core.</p>
<p>Verimi’s digital identity solution offers consumers a valid, flexible and convenient way to engage with companies and institutions. With Verimi, the user has sole data sovereignty and decides which data is passed on to the respective application partner. All user data is verified, so application partners can be sure of who they’re dealing with, while users benefit from its ease of signing up/logging into multiple services.</p>
<p>Ubisecure CIAM enables fast integration of Identity &amp; Access Management capabilities such as single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), a wide range of trusted identity providers (IdPs), and complex delegation of authority. It facilitates workflows to increase security, improve customer experience and comply with regulations. The CIAM solution can be deployed as IDaaS, Cloud, or on-premise software, depending on client needs and preferences.</p>
<p>Service providers in Germany are ramping up digitalisation efforts, particularly in light of the current global situation limiting face-to-face contact. This joint solution provides a way for Ubisecure and Verimi’s client organisations across all verticals to digitalise their solutions with seamless identity management, from registration to subsequent logins and across the entire identity lifecycle. For example, a bank could deploy the solution to allow its customers to seamlessly log into all of its digital services with their Verimi-ID, and then securely and compliantly manage those identities ongoingly with Ubisecure-enabled workflows. Verimi is accepted by service providers including Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Postbank, Deutsche Telekom and many others.</p>
<p>Roland Adrian, Managing Director at Verimi, said, “we’re very excited to partner with Ubisecure as a leading provider of CIAM in Europe. Ubisecure has access to the relevant market and with many years of experience deeply understands the needs of consumers and companies.”</p>

Java also has a number of web frameworks but they are all based on the common servlet API which means that any framework can run on any web server which supports the servlet API.

  <p>Python has a number of different frameworks for building web applications. The choice of framework limits the choice of available web servers. Java also has a number of web frameworks but they are all based on the common servlet API which means that any framework can run on any web server which supports the servlet API.</p>

<p>You’ve probably seen WSGI mentioned before, but you might not be exactly sure what it meant or did. In this post, you will learn to write your own WSGI application and a basic WSGI server, too! Let’s get started!</p>

<p>(The dry technical details of WSGI are defined in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">PEP 333</a> and extended with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a> to improve string handling in Python 3.)</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Dr-Phill-Edwards/wsgi">GitHub</a> if you’d like to check it out</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a WSGI Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Python installed on your computer, you will need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install a recent version of Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Next, you need to install the <a href="https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado library</a> (which will be used to run the WSGI application):</p>

   <code>pip install tornado
</code>   

<p>Finally, create a project directory where all of our future code will live:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/wsgi
cd ~/wsgi
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple WSGI Application 

<p>We will start by creating the simplest WSGI application running in a Tornado server. Create a file called <code>simple.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.wsgi import WSGIContainer

def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, response_headers)
    return [b"Welcome to WSGI!\n"]

container = WSGIContainer(application)
server = HTTPServer(container)
server.listen(8080)
print("Listening")
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>Let’s explain what this code does. It is necessary to import any external packages so that Python can find the code. We could have simply used <code>import tornado.ioloop</code> but then later would have had to use <code>tornado.web.IOLoop</code> in the code. Using the <code>from</code> form of <code>import</code> means that we can just use <code>IOLoop</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>application</code> implements WSGI.  PEP 3333 refers to it as the application object. It has two parameters that are required by the WSGI server interface. These parameters are passed by the WGSI server implementation—in this case, the <code>WSGIContainer</code>.</p>

<p>The first parameter <code>environ</code> is a dictionary that contains environment variables that must be present. They must include environment variables defined by the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) specification. It may contain environment variables from the operating system. It must also contain WSGI-defined variables.  These environment variables are listed in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#environ-variables">PEP 3333</a> document.</p>

<p>The second parameter <code>start_response</code> is a function that must be called by the <code>application</code> function on each request. <code>start_response</code> takes two parameters, the response status code and a list of response headers. Each list element represents a header and is a tuple containing the header name and the header value. In the example above, the list contains one element that represents the <code>Content-Type</code> header: <code>[('Content-type', 'text/plain')]</code></p>

<p>The application object needs to define the HTTP response. It defines the status code which is a string containing a three-digit number and a message. It also needs to define any response headers in the form of a list of tuples. It then calls the <code>start_response</code> function passing it the status and headers. It then returns the response body. It must be of the Python type <code>bytes</code>, hence the <code>b</code> in front of the string.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to create a server—a Tornado <code>WSGIContainer</code> object which takes the WSGI function as a parameter. We then construct the <code>HTTPServer</code> object passing it to the WSGI container. We then need to tell the application which port to listen on, in this case, port 8080. The last line starts an <code>IOLoop</code> which will start listening on port 8080 and pass requests to the handler class instances.</p>

<p>The server can now be run using:</p>

   <code>python simple.py
</code>   

<p>The server can be tested by pointing a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> or using the <code>curl</code> command. The welcome message should be displayed.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>The server can be stopped by typing Control-C.  Python will complain about being interrupted but this can be ignored.</p>

 How to Create a Python Package Containing a WSGI Application 

<p>A Python package is simply a directory containing Python files. We are going to create a package called <code>server</code> which needs to be in a directory of the same name.</p>

   <code>mkdir server
</code>   

<p>The Python package plumbing requires a file called <code>__init__.py</code> which is executed whenever the package is imported. It can be an empty file.</p>

   <code>touch server/__init__.py
</code>   

<p>A WSGI application can also be implemented as a class. Create the file <code>server/Application.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>class Application:
    def __init__(self, environ, start_response):
        self.environ = environ
        self.start = start_response

    def __iter__(self):
        status = "200 OK"
        headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain")]
        self.start(status, headers)
        for chunk in [b"Welcome" b" " b"to" b" " b"WSGI!\n"]:
            yield chunk
</code>   

<p>Like the <code>application</code> function we wrote above, the constructor <code>__init__</code> must have the two parameters that are required by the WSGI server interface. In our example, these are saved as class attributes.</p>

<p>The class also needs to have an iterator method called <code>__iter__</code>, which at some point must call the “start_response” function that was passed to the constructor. The <code>__iter__</code> method must also  <code>yield</code> responses—as the “bytes” type and not the “str” type you might expect . Note that <code>__iter__</code> is a generator. This is why the keyword <code>yield</code> is used in place of <code>return</code>. Tersely put, <code>__iter__</code> is a generator that yields bytes. The generator is used because the response body could be a large object such as a video. This allows the server to start sending content immediately, instead of waiting until everything is loaded.</p>

<p>If a package contains a file called <code>__main__.py</code> it becomes the entry point for the module and allows the package to be run without specifying any Python files. Create a file called <code>server/__main__.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.wsgi import WSGIContainer
from .Application import Application

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
container = WSGIContainer(Application)
server = HTTPServer(container)
server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>This is similar to the earlier code, except that the class is passed to the WSGI container in place of the function.</p>

<p>It is bad practice to hard code the port number. Tornado provides an <code>options</code> package that allows command-line options to be defined and processed. A <code>port</code> option is defined which has a default value of 8080. It can be changed to port 80 on the command line using the <code>--port=80</code> option.</p>

<p>The server can be run specifying the port number to use.</p>

   <code>python -m server --port=8080
</code>   

<p>The program can be tested using <code>curl</code>, the <code>-i</code> option prints out the response headers.</p>

   <code>curl -i http://localhost:8080
</code>   

 Understanding the WSGI Environment 

<p>The WSGI environment dictionary contains the information required to process requests. We will copy <code>server/Application.py</code> to <code>server/Environment.py</code> while also renaming the “Application” class to “Environment”</p>

   <code>cat server/Application.py | sed 's/Application/Environment/' &gt; server/Environment.py
</code>   

<p>Next we will modify the iterator method in <code>server/Environment.py</code> to return the contents of the dictionary:</p>

   <code>def __iter__(self):
     status = "200 OK"
    headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain")]
    self.start(status, headers)
    for key, value in sorted(self.environ.items()):
        yield f"{key}: {value}\n".encode()
</code>   

<p>We also need to change <code>Application</code> to <code>Environment</code> in <code>server/__main__.py</code> so that it looks like this:</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.wsgi import WSGIContainer
from .Environment import Environment

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
container = WSGIContainer(Environment)
server = HTTPServer(container)
server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>Run the server and then use <code>curl</code> to send a GET request.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080/example?user=Joe
</code>   

<p>The contents of the dictionary are:</p>

   <code>HTTP_ACCEPT: */*
HTTP_HOST: localhost:8080
HTTP_USER_AGENT: curl/7.64.1
PATH_INFO: /example
QUERY_STRING: user=Joe
REMOTE_ADDR: ::1
REQUEST_METHOD: GET
SCRIPT_NAME:
SERVER_NAME: localhost
SERVER_PORT: 8080
SERVER_PROTOCOL: HTTP/1.1
wsgi.errors: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='&lt;stderr&gt;' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'&gt;
wsgi.input: &lt;_io.BytesIO object at 0x1077d36d0&gt;
wsgi.multiprocess: True
wsgi.multithread: False
wsgi.run_once: False
wsgi.url_scheme: http
wsgi.version: (1, 0)
</code>   

<p>The request method is in the environment variable <code>REQUEST_METHOD</code>. You can find the components of the URL <code>http://localhost:8080/example?user=Joe</code> in the environment variables <code>wsgi.url_scheme</code>, <code>HTTP_HOST</code>, <code>PATH_INFO</code>, and <code>QUERY_STRING</code>.</p>

<p>Now use <code>curl</code> to send a POST request.</p>

   <code>curl -i -X POST -d "email=michelle@example.com&amp;password=abcd1234" http://localhost:8080/login
</code>   

<p>The contents of the dictionary are:</p>

   <code>CONTENT_LENGTH: 44
CONTENT_TYPE: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
HTTP_ACCEPT: */*
HTTP_HOST: localhost:8080
HTTP_USER_AGENT: curl/7.64.1
PATH_INFO: /login
QUERY_STRING:
REMOTE_ADDR: ::1
REQUEST_METHOD: POST
SCRIPT_NAME:
SERVER_NAME: localhost
SERVER_PORT: 8080
SERVER_PROTOCOL: HTTP/1.1
wsgi.errors: &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='&lt;stderr&gt;' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'&gt;
wsgi.input: &lt;_io.BytesIO object at 0x1042f5450&gt;
wsgi.multiprocess: True
wsgi.multithread: False
wsgi.run_once: False
wsgi.url_scheme: http
wsgi.version: (1, 0)
</code>   

<p>The POST request sent parameters in the HTTP request body. This added the environment variables <code>CONTENT_LENGTH</code> and <code>CONTENT_TYPE</code>. The request body is contained in the environment variable <code>wsgi.input</code> which is a byte stream. This can be displayed by decoding the byte stream.</p>

   <code>    def __iter__(self):
        status = "200 OK"
        headers = [("Content-type", "text/plain")]
        self.start(status, headers)
        for key, value in sorted(self.environ.items()):
            yield f"{key}: {value}\n".encode()
        yield self.environ['wsgi.input'].getvalue()
        yield "\n".encode()
</code>   

<p>The output from the <code>curl</code> request now has the following line:</p>

   <code>email=michelle@example.com&amp;password=abcd1234
</code>   

 What are WSGI Server Considerations? 

<p>The Tornado WSGI container runs a single application. It also requires Python code to create the container and the server. A consequence of this is that the application needs to use the request method and the path to decide what content to serve.</p>

<p>There is another popular Python webserver called <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a>. It can run Python web applications, including WSGI applications, without any additional code. If the WSGI application is not a function called <code>application</code> then the function or class needs to be specified on the command line after a colon character. Again, it runs a single application.</p>

   <code>pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -b :8080 server.Application:Application
</code>   

<p>A more flexible solution is to use an Apache web server which has the <code>mod_wsgi</code> module installed. This allows URIs to be mapped to WSGI applications. A single server can run multiple applications each one handling a different URI.</p>

 How to Implement a WSGI Server 

<p>It may sometimes be necessary to implement the WSGI server side of the interface. A typical use case is writing a middleware layer that needs to perform transformation or forward requests to other servers.</p>

<p>In this example, we will implement a server that can redirect requests to different WSGI applications based on the HTTP request method and the URI.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>server/WSGIRunner.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>import sys
from tornado.web import RequestHandler
from .Application import Application
from .Environment import Environment

class WSGIRunner(RequestHandler):
    headers = []
    url_map = {
        '/': Application,
        '/env': Environment
    }

    def get(self, path):
        self._set_environment('GET', path)
        if path in WSGIRunner.url_map:
            self.run(WSGIRunner.url_map[path])
        else:
            self.send_error(404)

    def _set_environment(self, method, path):
        self.environ = {
            'wsgi.errors': sys.stderr,
            'wsgi.input': sys.stdin.buffer,
            'wsgi.multiprocess': True,
            'wsgi.multithread': False,
            'wsgi.run_once': False,
            'wsgi.url_scheme': 'http',
            'wsgi.version': (1, 0),
            'HTTP_ACCEPT': self.request.headers['Accept'],
            'HTTP_HOST': self.request.headers['Host'],
            'HTTP_HTTP_USER_AGENT': self.request.headers['User-Agent'],
            'REQUEST_METHOD': method,
            'PATH_INFO': path
        }
        query = ''
        for k, v in self.request.arguments.items():
            if len(query) &gt; 0:
                query += '&amp;'
            query += k + '=' + v[0].decode()
        self.environ['QUERY_STRING'] = query

    @staticmethod
    def start_response(status, response_headers):
        headers = response_headers

    def run(self, application):
        result = application(self.environ, WSGIRunner.start_response)
        for header in WSGIRunner.headers:
            self.set_header(header[0], header[1])
        for data in result:
            self.write(data)
</code>   

<p>The class <code>WSGIRunner</code> is a Tornado request handler which implements a <code>get</code> method that has a <code>path</code> parameter containing the request URI.</p>

<p>The <code>_set_environment()</code> method is called to create the environment map required by WSGI. The parameters are the request method—in this case, GET and the path.</p>

<p>The <code>get</code> method looks up the path in a static dictionary. If the entry exists, the dictionary returns the class containing the WSGI application to run. The <code>run</code> method is called to run the application. If the path is not in the map a 404 not found response is sent using the <code>RequestHandler</code> <code>send_error()</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>start_response()</code> method is the response callback required by the WSGI interface. It has to be a static method. The <code>@staticmethod</code> annotation allows the class to define a static method that does not require a <code>self</code> parameter. The method simply stores the response headers in the static list <code>headers</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>run</code> method calls the WSGI application, passing the environment dictionary and the response callback. It then sets the response headers and writes the data returned by the application as the response.</p>

<p>Tornado will decode any query string, so it needs to be reconstructed from the request arguments.</p>

<p>The file <code>___main__.py</code> now must be changed to run the <code>WSGIRunner</code> as a Tornado application.</p>

   <code>from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.web import Application
from .WSGIRunner import WSGIRunner

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
application = Application([("(/.*)", WSGIRunner)])
server = HTTPServer(application)
server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
IOLoop.current().start()
</code>   

<p>The Tornado <code>Application</code> gets passed an array of tuples, in this case just one. The tuple contains a URI and a class that handles it. In this case, the URI is a regular expression in parentheses that matches everything. The parentheses cause the URI to be captured and passed as a parameter to the <code>get</code> method.</p>

 Summing Up WSGI 

<p>WSGI is an interface specification for Python web applications. It is a low-level interface. Many Python developers build web applications using popular frameworks, such as Flask, Tornado, or Django.</p>

<p>If it is unlikely that the web application framework will be changed, the benefits of using the framework APIs outweigh the limitations of WSGI. If, however, the web application is designed to be deployed in different server environments, then WSGI is the only choice as it is a Python standard.</p>

<p>The biggest limitation of WSGI is that it needs to implement code conditionally based on the request method and the request URI. It also needs to extract and decode any request parameters from the environment dictionary.</p>

<p>These limitations can be overcome by using a standalone server implementation, which can invoke different WSGI applications, depending on the request method and URI. A utility class can decode request parameters and return a dictionary in a more consumable form.</p>

<p>To sum it up, while WSGI is a low-level protocol for building web applications in Python, it is often helpful to understand how these things work behind the scenes.  While you probably won’t be building any raw WSGI applications, I hope this information will be helpful to you in your web development journey.</p>

  <p>Twenty-seven percent of malware incidents reported in 2020 can be attributed to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-a-defensible-cybersecurity-program-in-3-steps/">ransomware</a>. Ransomware — cyber extortion that occurs when malicious software infiltrates computer systems and encrypts data, holding it hostage until the victim pays a ransom — can have a bigger impact on an organization than a data breach.</p>
<p>In the short term, ransomware can cost companies millions of dollars, and a potentially even greater loss over the long term, impacting reputation and reliability.&nbsp;From top healthcare providers and retailers in the U.S. to insurance providers in the Middle East, ransomware attackers are proving to be a continuing cybersecurity threat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations need to focus on is preparation and early mitigation if they want to cut losses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In some recent cases of ransomware attacks, the victim organizations have paid huge amounts to the attackers, which can be one of the reasons these attacks are getting more popular,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/89434">Paul Webber</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “Instead, what organizations need to focus on is preparation and early mitigation if they want to cut <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-security-and-risk-leaders-can-prepare-for-reduced-budgets/">losses</a> to ransomware."</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>CISOs and security leaders can reduce the likelihood of ransomware attacks, reduce exposure to vulnerabilities and secure the organization using a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/tackle-tomorrows-digital-business-security-risks/">mitigation</a> plan. This plan must cover the following six actions.</p>
 No. 1: Conduct initial ransomware assessments 
<p>Conduct risk assessments and penetration tests to determine the attack surface and current state of security resilience and preparedness in terms of tools, processes and skills to defend against attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Before you assume that payment is the only option, investigate using free ransomware decryption software,” says Webber.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Enforce ransomware governance&nbsp; 
<p>Establish processes and compliance procedures that involve key decision makers in the organization, even before preparing for the technical response to a ransomware attack. Ransomware can escalate from an issue to a crisis in no time, costing an organization revenue loss and creating a damaged reputation.</p>
<p>Key people such as the CEO, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-security-questions-board-will-definitely-ask/">board of directors</a> and other important stakeholders must be involved in the preparation. In the event of a ransomware attack, it is likely that journalists and other external stakeholders will reach out to the board of directors for response to the attack, not the security leaders or CISO.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Maintain consistent operational readiness 
<p>Conduct frequent exercises and drills to ensure that systems are always able to detect ransomware attacks. Build regular testing of incident response scenarios into the ransomware response plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test, test and retest at regular intervals to check for vulnerabilities, noncompliant systems and misconfigurations. Ensure that incident response processes are not themselves reliant on IT systems that may be affected by ransomware attacks or unavailable in case of a serious incident.</p>

 No. 4: Back up, test, repeat ransomware response 
<p>Back up not only the data but also every nonstandard application and its supporting IT infrastructure. Maintain frequent and reliable backup and recovery capabilities. If online backups are used, ensure that they cannot become encrypted by ransomware. Harden the components of enterprise backup and recovery infrastructure against attacks by routinely examining backup application, storage and network access and comparing this against expected or baseline activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prepare for critical application recovery in a systemwide ransomware attack by creating specific recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) parameters, safeguarding backup storage media and accessibility.</p>
 No. 5: Implement the principle of least privilege 
<p>Restrict permissions and deny unauthorized access to devices. Remove local administrator rights from end users and block application installation by standard users, replacing this with a centrally managed software distribution facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CISOs and security leaders must deploy multifactor authentication wherever possible, especially for privileged accounts. Increase authentication logging on all critical servers, network appliances and directory services, and ensure logs are not deleted. Notify security operations teams of any unexpected activity and ensure they proactively look for unusual logins/failed authentication attempts.</p>
 No. 6: Educate and train users on ransomware response actions 
<p>Research government and regional authorities that have provided guidelines on how organizations can fortify their network infrastructure against ransomware. CISOs and security leaders can use guidelines such as these to create a basic training program for all staff in the organization. However, ransomware preparedness training needs to be customized to the organization for better results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Use cyber crisis simulation tools for mock drills and training that provide closer to real-life situations for better preparedness of end users against ransomware,” says Webber.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges of ransomware and other forms of malware are the ever-changing tactics and agendas of hackers. Having a strategy in place for preparedness can help contain the losses and protect the organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to the 6th edition of our weekly summary of SSI + related topics.</p><p>We invite you forward and otherwise share this publication with others in your network who might enjoy our coverage and <a href="http://identosphere.substack.com/welcome">wish to subscribe</a>.</p><p>If you get value from our work - please consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/identosphere">making a monthly donation via Patreon</a> (I know it’s a different platform but Patreon is better at small recurring payments and Substack is better at newsletters). Your support is also a contribution to the ongoing work to map out the emerging identity space on Decentralized-ID.com.</p><p>If you’re interested to learn about the backend technologies supporting this newsletter, Infominer wrote a <a href="https://infominer.xyz/still-plugging-away/">blog post describing his work</a> on some of the more technical aspects of creating it. </p><p>In conjunction with this newsletter, infominer is also creating a weekly collection of tweets related to decentralized identity (<a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1327793303472005127">Week 2 November</a>). </p> Here we go with the news….  The founders of IIW have done a lot of blogging this week  Phil Windley has 4 posts:&nbsp;   <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/11/operationalizing_digital_relationships.shtml">Operationalizing Digital Relationships</a>. An SSI wallet provides a place for people to stand in the digital realm. Using the wallet, people can operationalize their digital relationships as peers with others online. The result is better, more authentic, digital relationships, more flexible online interactions, and the preservation of human freedom, privacy, and dignity.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/07/relationships_and_identity.shtml">Relationships and Identity</a>, We build digital identity systems to create and manage relationships—not identities. We need our digital relationships to have integrity and to be useful over a specified lifetime. Identity systems should provide relationship integrity and utility to participants for the appropriate length of time. Participants should be able to create relationships with whatever party will provide utility. SSI provides improved support for creating, managing, and using digital relationships.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> The architecture of an identity system has a profound impact on the nature of the relationships it supports. This post categorizes the high-level architecture of identity systems, discusses the properties of each category to understand architectural influences, and explores what their respective architectures mean to their legitimacy as a basis for online life.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>, Self-sovereign identity, supported by a heterarchical identity metasystem, creates a firm foundation for rich digital relationships that allow people to be digitally embodied so they can act online as autonomous agents.</p>   SSI is not Dystopian - it’s being built by a generative community. <p>Kaliya has an 8 series post rebutting the <a href="https://www.philipsheldrake.com/2020/11/the-dystopia-of-self-sovereign-identity-ssi/#more-31058">Dystopian SSI rant</a> by Philip Sheldrake who suggests we should spend who knows how long chit-chatting with him and social scientists in his “generative identity” group instead of building things. <a href="https://identitywoman.net/self-sovereigh-identity-critique-critique/">Post 1</a> republishes a letter posted on the VRM list in February. <a href="https://identitywoman.net/self-sovereign-identity-critique-critique-5/">Post 5</a> highlights a very interesting document people don’t really know about its a vision that Lawrence Lessig published in 1998 proposing an identity layer of the net (that SSI meets the criteria for) and <a href="https://identitywoman.net/self-sovereign-identity-critique-critique-7/">Post 7</a> that touches on the power of DIDComm and how identity indeed is a process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Doc Comments on the Election&nbsp; <p>Saying <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2020/11/08/epilogue/">we’re in the Epilogue Now</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>There are many stories within and behind the story, but this was the big one, and it had to end. Enough refs calling it made the ending official. President Trump will continue to fight, but the outcome won’t change.</p></blockquote> Wisdom from Tim Bouma <p>(Not an IIW founder but a Digital Identity OG none-the-less)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@trbouma/self-sovereign-identity-interview-with-tim-bouma-ca193f66f2bb">Tim Bouma is interviewed</a> by SSI Ambassador - Adrian Doerk</p><blockquote><p>Every technology is a two-edged sword, gunpowder, guns, you know anything? There’s an upside and there’s the downside. I think that’s something that we have to be very cognizant of. Just like in the mid 90s you had the crypto wars with the clipper chip You can only export certain key strengths and that caused a reaction. We have to be careful that we don’t get caught into those same traps of us against the government or government against them. I think we have to figure out how to work this out together.</p></blockquote> Upcoming Events <p><a href="https://www.isse.eu.com/">Information Security Solutions Europe</a> is happening this week put on by EMMA has some luminaries speaking at the Vision for European Security and Trust <a href="https://www.isse.eu.com/#webinars">including</a> Kim Cameron, Dave Birch, Heather Flanagan, Pamela Dingle, Katryan Dow.

IOTA is also participating with Odyssey Momentum, and open-sourced their <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/selv-mobile">Selv identity wallet</a>, as part of their hackathon package. They’ve also announced the launch of their <a href="https://github.com/iota-community/X-Team_IOTA_Identity">IOTA Identity Experience Team</a> to help pave the road for IOTA identity in the DLT and IOT space.</p> Core identity standards  Trinsic Basics: What Are SSI Standards? <p>Trinsic highlights the <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-standards/">core identity standards</a> and their commitment to them.</p><blockquote><p>There are two kinds of standards that Trinsic implements to enable interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in: data model standards and protocol standards.</p></blockquote> Trusted P2P Messaging with DIDs, DIDComm and VCs <p>uPort <a href="https://medium.com/uport/trusted-p2p-messaging-with-dids-didcomm-and-vcs-398f4c3f3cda">writes a great post</a> about their path towards trusted P2P messaging and announces the <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/daf">DIDAgent Framework (DAF)</a></p><blockquote><p>when we speak about a DID, then we need to be more precise and also speak about the particular DID method of that DID which defines the CRUD operations on a target system such as Ethereum.</p></blockquote> Spruce Systems introduces DIDKit <blockquote><p><a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/introducing-didkit-an-identity-toolkit-e0dfa292f53d">DIDKit is a cross-platform toolkit</a> for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). It allows you to resolve and manage DID documents, and also manage the entire lifecycle of Verifiable Credentials including their issuance, presentation, and verification.</p></blockquote> MyDex CCI on working with the Scottish Government.&nbsp; <p>A <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-way-forward-for-personal-data-6251d1503bdd">Way Forward for Personal Data</a> and launching a <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">Beta Phase of the work</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Smart Entitlements concept is very simple. Its goal is to create a common, easy approach for citizens to access public services that is consistent across multiple service providers. To achieve this, it provides citizens with the ability to store their personal information in an Attribute (or personal data) Store which they own and control.</p></blockquote> The wallets are coming…&nbsp;  Civic Phases out <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">Identity Application</a> <blockquote><p>We’re proud of the added functionality and product flow that we’ve built in Civic Wallet. With this improved user experience now in place, we will be removing Civic Secure Identity from app stores by the end of November and asking these users to download Civic Wallet.</p></blockquote> The GiD Report#134 — DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid, SSI is “hot stuff” <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-134-doj-challenges-visa-plaid-ssi-is-hot-stuff-f7811bdda7cd">GlobalID</a> quoting the <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">Harvard Blog</a>: “The easiest tool to imagine is a wallet or a wallet app (here’s one) with some kind of dashboard.”</p><blockquote><p>It’s understandable then why Civic is phasing out it’s identity app and merging it into its wallet.

Internet users are now both consumer and product: by using free online services, users feed companies with data, which those companies in turn process and monetize.</p></blockquote> HackerNoon covers SSI!!!&nbsp; <p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-decentralized-identifiers-will-shape-the-future-of-identity-iam3w9g">How Decentralized Identifiers Will Shape the Future of Identity</a></p><blockquote><p>Hackers value personal information the most. 96% of hacking groups’ primary motive is intelligence gathering.

  <p>Cyberattacks have rapidly evolved since the advent of online transacting almost 25 years ago, with attackers continually escalating and refining their evasion techniques. While&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;and individuals continue to&nbsp;mobilise&nbsp;in an attempt to&nbsp;mitigate the global disruptions taking place around them, cybercriminals have wasted no time in exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. Today, attackers and fraudsters call upon a sophisticated suite of tools, including human-powered click farms, social engineering, and malware – all designed to defeat traditional defenses such as&nbsp;WAFs &amp;&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will dive deeper into how&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;can keep pace with this precipitate shift and adjust their security postures accordingly, to more accurately reflect the realities of an ever-evolving threat landscape.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
<p>Discussion&nbsp;Points:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Attack Evolution&nbsp;- navigate the automated application attack-roadmap as it has progressed from the commodification of Credential Stuffing and ATO schemes to some of the most cutting-edge examples of Manual Fraud capability.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Countermeasure Efficacy&nbsp;- discover how&nbsp;F5’s Application Fraud&nbsp;portfolio addresses the whole spectrum&nbsp;of&nbsp;eCrime&nbsp;attacks&nbsp;deterring&nbsp;cybercriminals&nbsp;who&nbsp;continually&nbsp;retool&nbsp;to&nbsp;circumvent&nbsp;traditional countermeasures.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Inverting Friction&nbsp;- understand how&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;can protect their&nbsp;customers and brand without compromising user experience or collecting PII.&nbsp;

 Introducing DIDKit <p>In order to better work with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, we’re working on&nbsp;DIDKit.</p><p>DIDKit is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). It allows you to resolve and manage DID documents, and also manage the entire lifecycle of Verifiable Credentials including their issuance, presentation, and verification.</p><p>Notably, it reuses the same codebase across command-line tooling, RESTful HTTP servers, and platform-specific SDKs to facilitate code-level interoperability and a low total cost of ownership. When building ecosystems using decentralized identity to enable verifiable information, many actors must share the same underlying data formats and processing algorithms across different roles.</p><p>We wrote DIDKit in Rust due to its memory safety, expressive type system, and suitability across a variety of systems and environments. For example, the Rust ecosystem has already explored WASM compilation targets in support of single-page apps running in browsers, and we wanted to be able to support those and also browser extensions with DID and VC operations.</p><p>The same codebase can also run nimbly on embedded systems with moderately constrained resources (memory in the megabytes and CPU in the megahertz). Finally, Rust programs are able to directly interface with production-ready cryptographic libraries, as seen with Hyperledger Ursa’s use of openssl, libsodium, and libsecp256k1.</p><p>Currently, we have a working suite of command-line tools for credential issuance, presentation, and verification. We are creating an HTTP server conforming to <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, and we have native iOS and Android libraries that are used in our Credible&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will be more than happy to show our progress to date or show a&nbsp;demo.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>Once a vaccine for COVID-19 becomes available for use in the United States, officials will start the process of delivering doses to states, counties and cities and will oversee their administration to citizens. This is an historically complex challenge: making sure that there are enough vaccines distributed in a quick, effective and, if possible, equitable way. The process is expected to take at least a year to complete. Because not all Americans will be vaccinated right away (some may actually simply refuse the vaccination), employers will need to obtain proof of vaccination or sufficient presence of COVID-19 antibodies before welcoming their employees back into the office.</p>

<p>I’m excited to be able to reveal a great new commercial partnership we’ve been developing behind the scenes for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>We’re working with LexisNexis Risk Solutions to enable the implementation of self-sovereign digital identity (SSI) solutions. We’ve been collaborating since 2019, running discovery initiatives culminating in a joint go-to-market commercial arrangement.</p><p>SSI has been a cornerstone of the Nuggets vision since 2016. It represents a fundamental shift in the way personal data is owned, shared and controlled, giving consumers complete control of their personal information. With SSI, consumers can control when their data and identity documents are accessed, and by whom. You no longer have to send precious documents away, or have them stored in multiple physical or electronic locations.</p><p>Right now, if someone wants to open a bank account, or apply for a loan, mortgage or other financial product, they have to send personal documentation, either physically or electronically. The result: company servers full of sensitive customer information, which become a prime target for fraudsters.</p><p>Our new partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions — one of the world’s largest protectors of private and confidential data — will help to validate the benefits and strengths of the self-sovereign identity&nbsp;model.</p><p>SSI isn’t just good news for consumer privacy. It should also facilitate quicker processing and lower costs for risk and compliance for businesses like banks carrying out know-your-customer (KYC) and know-your-business (KYB)&nbsp;checks.</p><p>At Nuggets, we’ve always been driven by our belief that customers should be able to take back control of their data. As relentless data breaches show, the existing model of personal data storage is&nbsp;broken.</p><p>Through this new partnership, we’re helping to fundamentally change the way personal information is shared with, and used by, financial institutions. We’re helping individuals and businesses enhance their privacy and security protocols, for the benefit of&nbsp;all.</p><p>LexisNexis Risk Solutions provide solutions for a range of industries, including insurance, financial services, healthcare and government. With offices across the world, they’re also part of RELX, a provider of information and analytics for professional and business customers in various industries.</p><p>Here’s Steve Elliot, MD of LexisNexis Risk Solutions UK &amp; Ireland, on our new partnership:</p><p>“Effective solutions that can digitally identify and authenticate a person more quickly, more accurately and more securely, can have wide-ranging benefits for individuals, organisations and society as a whole, from reducing the time it takes consumers to acquire goods and services, to widening access and reducing fraud and money laundering. It’s really exciting to think that innovations like these could help reduce the increasing prevalence of large scale breaches of consumers’ personal data. We’re really excited to be working with Nuggets to explore how SSI can help achieve those benefits whilst maximising data privacy and security for consumers.”</p><p>If you share our belief in transforming the way personal information is stored and shared, and think your business could benefit from this approach, we’d love to hear from you. Get in touch via our website: <a href="https://nuggets.life/">nuggets.life</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/new-nuggets-partnership-with-lexisnexis-risk-solutions-769fa676de0">New Nuggets partnership with LexisNexis Risk Solutions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>“Artificial intelligence (AI)I will automate everything and put people out of work.” “AI is a science-fiction technology.” “Robots will take over the world.” </p>
<p>The hype around AI has produced many myths, in mainstream media, in board meetings and across organizations. Some worry about <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/human-beings-ai-and-robots-to-represent-the-new-workforce-in-2028/">an “almighty” AI that will take over the world</a>, and some think that AI is nothing more than a buzzword. The truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>“Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the majority of organizations have been maintaining or even increasing their investments in artificial intelligence,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/56819">Saniye Alaybeyi</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “However, only half of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-3-benefits-of-ai-projects/">these projects</a> ever make it to production.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>AI is not only augmenting mundane jobs. IT leaders need to create value for AI by establishing business benefits such as cost reductions and operations improvement by providing practical applications of the technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gartner has identified six common myths and misconceptions about AI.</p>
 Myth No. 1: AI Is an unnecessary luxury in times of the COVID-19 pandemic 
<p>AI is emerging as an important enabler of cost optimization and business continuity during the COVID-19 crisis. Contrary to the misconception that AI is an unnecessary luxury when enterprises are struggling with cash flows and uncertain economic conditions, AI is generating revenue. It is improving customer interactions, analyzing data more quickly, generating early warnings about upcoming disruptions and automating decision making.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-budget-planning-hacks-for-ai-projects/">3 Budget Planning Hacks for AI Projects</a></p>
 
 Myth No. 2: AI and machine learning (ML) are the same and interchangeable 
<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. ML requires a well-thought-out training and data acquisition strategy. AI, on the other hand, is an umbrella term for a broad set of computer engineering techniques, ranging from ML and rule-based systems to optimization techniques and natural language processing (NLP).&nbsp;</p>
 Myth No. 3: Intelligent machines learn on their own 
<p>A finished ML product gives the impression that it is able to learn on its own. However, experienced human data scientists frame the problem, prepare the data, determine appropriate datasets, remove potential bias in the training data and, most importantly, continually update the software to enable the integration of new knowledge and data into the next learning cycle.</p>
 Myth No. 4: AI can be 100% objective 
<p>Every AI technology is based on data, rules and other kinds of input from human experts. Because all humans are intrinsically biased in one way or another, so is the AI. Systems that are frequently retrained — for example, using new data from social media — are even more vulnerable to unwanted bias or intentional malevolent influences.</p>
<p>Even if your current AI strategy is “no AI,” this should be a conscious decision based on research and consideration.</p>
<p>“At the moment, there is no way to completely banish bias; however, we have to try our best to reduce it to a minimum,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/12496">Alexander Linden</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “In addition to technological solutions, such as diverse datasets, it is crucial to also ensure diversity in the teams working with the AI and have team members review each other’s work. This simple process can significantly reduce selection and confirmation bias.”</p>

 Myth No. 5: AI will only replace mundane jobs 
<p>AI enables businesses to make more accurate decisions via predictions, classifications and clustering. These abilities have enabled AI-based solutions to reach deep into work environments, not only replacing mundane tasks, but also augmenting those that are more complex.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the use of imaging <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-need-for-ai-governance-in-healthcare/">AI in healthcare</a>. A chest X-ray application based on AI can detect diseases faster than can radiologists. In the financial and insurance industry,&nbsp;roboadvisors are being used for wealth management and fraud detection. These capabilities don’t eliminate human involvement in those tasks but will eventually limit it to observing and dealing with unusual cases. Adjust job profiles and capacity planning and offer retraining options for existing staff.</p>
 Myth No. 6: My business does not need an AI strategy 
<p>Every organization should consider the potential impact of AI on its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-chief-data-officers-guide-to-an-ai-strategy/">strategy</a> and investigate how this technology can be applied to the organization’s business problems. In many ways, AI exploitation is the same as forgoing the next phase of automation, and could place enterprises at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Even if AI is not an immediate fix to a problem, businesses should revisit the decision to not implement AI periodically,” says Alaybeyi. “Organizations need to find appropriate use cases that leverage AI’s power to augment human work, decisions and interactions, as well as other functional innovation opportunities.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next four years, 69% of what a manager currently does will be automated. In such a disruptive environment, enterprises need a reality check on how best they can integrate AI into their strategy and be ready for forthcoming disruptions.</p>

   Next.js is a React framework that aims to provide the best development experience. It is feature rich, including hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, built-in CSS support, API routers, and much more. 

 TypeScript is an open-source language that is built on JavaScript that allows developers to use types. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use TypeScript with Next.js.

  <p>Next.js is a React framework that aims to provide the best development experience. It is feature rich, including hybrid static and server rendering, TypeScript support, built-in CSS support, API routers, and much more.</p>

<p>TypeScript is an open-source language that is built on JavaScript that allows developers to use types. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use TypeScript with Next.js.</p>

<p>Finally, you will secure your application with Okta Single Sign-On and the built-in functionality of Next.js, as well as the support of the next-auth package.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you will need to do is create an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta developer account</a> if you don’t have one already. The account is free, doesn’t require a credit card, and allows you to start with Okta immediately. Once you have signed up, log in to the Developer Console and click on Applications. Click Add Application and select Web. In your application settings screen set your URIs to <code>localhost:3000</code> instead of the default <code>localhost:8080</code>. Next, set your Login redirect URIs to <code>http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/okta</code>. This is the default callback URI that <code>next-auth</code> will use. Give your application a meaningful name, I named mine NextJs. Click Done and you will be brought to your application’s management screen. Click on General and note your Client ID and Client secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Your Next.js Application 

<p>Open your favorite IDE. For this tutorial, I used Visual Studio Code. Navigate to the folder where you wish to keep your application. Next, use the <code>create-next-app</code> task runner by using the command <code>npx create-next-app</code> and follow the instructions. After the runner is complete, open the folder it created for you.</p>

<p>Since you are using TypeScript in this tutorial you will need to set up TypeScript support. Create a new file in the root of your application called <code>tsconfig.json</code>. Next.js will automatically populate this file with its default values but you can edit them if you wish. Next, run <code>npm run dev</code> in your console and you will see instructions about installing your dependencies for TypeScript.</p>

<p>To do this, open the console and run the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm i typescript@4.0.3
npm i @types/node@14.11.8
npm i @types/react@16.9.52    
</code>   

<p>This will complete your TypeScript setup. But there are more dependencies you should add at this point. You can add <code>next-auth</code> at this point. Next-auth makes setting up any type of authentication in Next.js simple. Of course, for this application, you are only setting up Okta as an external provider. Install next-auth with the command below and you will see how to implement it later.</p>

   <code>npm i next-auth@3.1.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, for this tutorial, you will use Bootstrap for your CSS framework.</p>

   <code> npm i bootstrap@4.5.3
</code>   

 Convert Your Next.js Application to TypeScript 

<p>The task running for creating a Next.js application does not include an option for using TypeScript. Therefore you will need to manually convert your application from JavaScript to TypeScript. The process is simple and should only take a moment.</p>

<p>You have already completed the first two steps by setting up your <code>tsconfig.json</code> file and installing your dependencies. Now you will need to convert files with the <code>.js</code> extension to <code>.tsx</code>. You will need to do this for each file in your <code>pages</code> directory and any subdirectories. Any subsequent components you add will also need to have the <code>.tsx</code> file extension.</p>

 Set Up Your Authentication 

<p>Next, you’ll need to set up the authentication for external providers.</p>

<p>Before you can implement authentication, you will need to ensure that your <code>.env.local</code> file is set up correctly. Add this file to the root of your project if one doesn’t exist yet. Add the following values to it.</p>

 <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENTSECRET={yourClientSecret}
OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code> 

<p>Now, under your <code>pages\api</code> folder create a new folder called <code>auth</code> if one doesn’t exist yet. Add a file called <code>[...nextauth].ts</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

const options = {
  // Configure one or more authentication providers
  providers: [
    Providers.Okta({
      clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.OKTA_CLIENTSECRET,
      domain: process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN
    }),
    // ...add more providers here
  ]
}

export default (req, res) =&gt; NextAuth(req, res, options)
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>pages\_app.tsx</code> and replace the existing code with the following.</p>

   <code>import '../styles/globals.css'
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'

import { Provider } from 'next-auth/client'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    &lt;Provider session={pageProps.session}&gt;
      &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;
    &lt;/Provider&gt;
  )
}

export default MyApp
</code>   

<p>This code is the default Next.js code wrapped in a <code>Provider</code> class from next-auth. The provider class makes sharing the session between pages easier. You added the Bootstrap CSS in this file as well. This will enable you to use Bootstrap on your pages.</p>

 Write Your Next.js Components and Pages 

<p>Your application is set up and ready to develop. Start by adding a new folder called <code>Components</code> to the root of your directory. This will be a folder for your shared components. Add a new file called <code>Movies.tsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>export default function Movies() {

    return (
        &lt;div className="row"&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gDYZG%2BzDL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;He's the only chance anyone has got.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjRlNDUxZjAtOGQ4OC00OTNlLTgxNmQtYTBmMDgwZmNmNjkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard 2&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;They say lightning never strikes twice... They were wrong&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div className="col-lg-4"&gt;

                &lt;div className="card"&gt;
                    &lt;img className="card-img-top" src="https://belgianfilmfreak.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/d0.jpg" alt="Card image cap"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
                    &lt;div className="card-body"&gt;
                        &lt;h5 className="card-title"&gt;Die Hard: With a Vengence&lt;/h5&gt;
                        &lt;p className="card-text"&gt;Think Fast, Look Alive, Die Hard&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>This component will be displayed on the <code>Dashboard</code> page for logged-in users. It displays some of the most important movies in history to the user.</p>

<p>Next, you can add a file called <code>Unauthorized.tsx</code>.</p>

   <code>import { signIn } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Unauthorized() {

    return (
        &lt;div className="row"&gt;
            &lt;div className="col-lg-10 col-offset-1"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Hey There, looks like you reached an area you don't have access to.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt; Please sign in here.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt; &lt;button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signIn}&gt;Sign in&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>This is the first time on the client that you are using the <code>next-auth</code> package. You are importing the <code>signIn</code> feature from the <code>next-auth/client</code> component. This function will navigate the user to a list of providers that you implemented previously. The user will then be able to click on that provider and be taken to their login screen. The <code>Unauthorized</code> component simply presents the user with a message that they reached a protected part of the site without being authenticated and routes them to the appropriate provider.</p>

<p>The last file to add to this folder is the <code>Header.tsx</code> file. This is just a banner that sits on top of each page and has a login or logout button depending on the state of the user.</p>

   <code>import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Header() {

  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  var button;

  if (session) {
    button = &lt;button className="btn btn-secondary" onClick={signOut}&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;;
  }
  else {
    button = &lt;button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={signIn}&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;;
  }

  return (

    &lt;div className="row mb-4"&gt;
      &lt;div className="col-lg-12"&gt;
        &lt;nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;
          &lt;a className="navbar-brand" href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;button className="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
            &lt;span className="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/button&gt;

          &lt;div className="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent"&gt;
            &lt;ul className="navbar-nav mr-auto"&gt;
              &lt;li className="nav-item active"&gt;
                &lt;a className="nav-link" href="/"&gt;Home &lt;span className="sr-only"&gt;(current)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li className="nav-item"&gt;
                &lt;a className="nav-link" href="dashboard"&gt;Movies&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;div className="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0"&gt;
              {button}
            &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>The simplest way to see if a user is logged in is to check if the session exists by calling <code>useSession()</code> from <code>next-auth</code>. If it does, you present the user with the option to log out using the <code>signOut()</code> function. If it does not, you present the user with a login button that ties into the <code>signIn()</code> function you used on the <code>Unauthorized</code> component.</p>

<p>You can tie everything together by creating your pages. By default, Next.js should have added an <code>index.tsx</code> file. (Well, really, it added <code>index.js</code> but you should have changed the extension to <code>.tsx</code> already.) You can replace the code in that file with the code below.</p>

   <code>import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'

export default function Home() {

  return (
    &lt;div className="container"&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;

      &lt;div className="row"&gt;
        &lt;div className="col-lg-12"&gt;
          &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;


      &lt;main className={styles.main}&gt;
        &lt;h1 className={styles.title}&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are giving any user a landing page to display what your site is about and using the header to provide a login button if necessary.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to create a dashboard page. Start by creating a new file in the <code>pages</code> directory called <code>dashboard.tsx</code>. This page will need to check if the user has access to the page and display the <code>Unauthorized</code> component if not and the <code>Movies</code> component if they are. You can add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react'

import Head from 'next/head'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'

import Header from '../components/Header'
import Unauthorized from '../components/Unauthorized'
import Movies from '../components/Movies'

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/client'

export default function Dashboard() {

    const [session, loading] = useSession();

    var content = session ? &lt;Movies&gt;&lt;/Movies&gt; : &lt;Unauthorized&gt;&lt;/Unauthorized&gt;

    return (
        &lt;div className="container"&gt;
            &lt;Head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Movies By Nik - Find Your Next Movie&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
            &lt;/Head&gt;

            &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;

            {content}

        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
</code>   

<p>As you learned already, the easiest way to check if a user is authenticated is to check if the <code>session</code> exists.</p>

 Test and Conclusions 

<p>You should be ready to start your application now. From the command line run <code>npm run-script dev</code> and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should be presented with the home screen for the application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next click on the Movies link. You should receive a message telling you that you don’t have access to the dashboard. Click Sign in and select Okta then log in with your Okta credentials. You should be redirected to the dashboard page showing you some of the greatest movies in history.</p>

<p></p>

<p>From here you can continue to build on your react components and develop your API to support your frontend knowing that your application is safe and secure with Okta’s authentication.</p>

  <p>This talk aims to share the experience achieved during&nbsp;Q-Secure Net, a 2020's project co-financed by the European Institute of Technology (EIT) and Italtel, Cefriel, Politecnico di Milano, CNR, UPM and Telefonica. Q-Secure Net will provide a cost-effective and flexible network solution for&nbsp;unconditionally secure communication services&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)&nbsp;thought for fiber-optic networks.</p>
<p>The talk will also present an application of&nbsp;Blockchain Atomic Swaps&nbsp;for the exchange of securities and cryptocurrencies, developed in the project and based on QKD. Atomic Swaps have great potentials for financial scenarios regarding securities, crypto exchanges and cryptocurrencies but have specific security threats.</p>
<p>The QKD market is expected to grow over $980 million by 2024. In the long term, the QKD will be strategic for the design of new architectures in many sectors like telco, defence and transports and 5G sectors. QKD's infrastructural security and its ability to mitigate cyber-risks, also allow a whole new class of approaches and applications for Decentralised Finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QKD Features</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capabilities for Fintech applications</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atomic Swap and Crypto Exchanges</p>

  <p>Security is Culture – and culture starts with people (not technology!) The complex topic of SAP-security is a massive challenge for the almost 500.000 companies worldwide using SAP. The challenges are the same for everyone, and it is the combined corporate responsibility of the C-Level and all employees to protect the enterprise from threats. These core applications can be secured by focusing on the 3 main attack vectors: People, Processes, and Technology. Within this keynote, Jochen Fischer shares what needs to be done to define clear ownership and responsibilities for SAP-security. Enabling people to understand the risk in SAP is fundamental to design a sustainable strategy that is based on the individual risk profile of each individual company. It is time to stop the monkey business when it comes to mission-critical topics like security. As independent expert, Jochen Fischer provides state-of-the-art methodologies to deliver the right people the suitable skills required to protect SAP without burning money on tools that have no or limited effect on corporate cyber resilience.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fischer"></a>

  <p>Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity tasks are attracting greater attention from the private and the public&nbsp;sectors. Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity&nbsp;will grow from US$1 billion in 2016 to a US$34.8 billion net&nbsp;worth by 2025. The latest national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments explicitly mention AI capabili-&nbsp;ties. At the&nbsp;same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging&nbsp;on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks)&nbsp;to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double-&nbsp;edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applica-&nbsp;tions themselves, which may&nbsp;pose severe security threats. We argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that,&nbsp;to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for&nbsp;cybersecurity is necessary. To this&nbsp;end, we offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_taddeo"></a>

					 <p>Standards are an important part of the Trinsic platform. Our vision is that people everywhere will have a digital identity that’s as legitimate as their real-world identity. In the real world, standards are an important part of identity. Why do you think that driver’s licenses from different states contain the same information? Or transcripts from different universities look roughly the same? It’s because they’re based on standards that enable any counter party to trust it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Standards make the world go round 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Not to mention, open standards make good business. The ICP/IP protocol the internet runs on is an open standard that beat out the proprietary Microsoft protocols. HTTP is another standard—any browser can visit any website because of it. Bluetooth is another standard—any headphones can connect to any phone, which makes both the headphones and the phone more valuable as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Standards enable the Trinsic platform to interoperate with other self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials platforms. For example, if the State of California were to use Trinsic to issue digital driver’s licenses, any business or organization that needed to verify those licenses (such as a pharmacy when people pick up certain prescriptions) would not need to necessarily use the Trinsic platform to do so and vice versa. Any developer that uses the Trinsic platform—including <a href="https://trinsic.id/powerful-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, and the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>—will inherit <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">interoperability with solutions</a> that also implements open, community-driven SSI standards.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Avoids vendor lock-in 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Standards also enable us to avoid vendor lock-in. The State of California probably doesn’t want to force all its constituents to download a specific company’s digital wallet to store the driver’s license. Instead, it will want its citizens to have the freedom to choose from a variety of apps. (It may help to imagine if the whole internet was run by Microsoft, and you had to have a Microsoft device in order to access government services. That wouldn’t fly, because at that point Microsoft would be a monopoly.)<br><br></p><p>Not only would the State of California probably want its constituents to be able to choose from a variety of digital wallets, it would want its constituents to have the ability to leave their current wallet provider and switch to another at any time they wish without losing their credentials during the transition. The Trinsic Wallet is one of the first SSI digital wallets to provides its end users with the <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export of credentials</a> functionality.<br><br></p><p>There are two kinds of standards that Trinsic implements to enable interoperability and avoid vendor lock-in: data model standards and protocol standards.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Data model 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Computers are very precise, so it’s important they have a model for how data is structured. For (an oversimplified) example, if you had a database that stores data like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				{name: “Joe”, email: “Joehd@gmail.com”, dob: “10/22/91”}			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Then you will run in to problems if you try to insert the following into the database:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				{e-mail: ‘Joehd@gmail.com’, date_of_birth: ‘10/22/91’, f_name: ‘Joe’, zodiac: ‘aries’}			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>If you needed to share user databases with other people in an industry, you would need to form a standards body (like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">W3C</a> or <a href="https://www.computer.org/">IEEE</a>, etc.) to agree on what data will be collected, what order it appears in, how it’s spelled, punctuation, etc. The more specific the use case, the easier it is to standardize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two fundamentally important standards that Trinsic uses, both developed at the W3C:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs): DIDs are the identifiers used in SSI. They don’t store any data. Think of them as a username, a phone number, an IP address, or any other identifier—except they don’t need a central registry to authorize them. In SSI, every person has a new DID for each relationship they have. And the issuers of credentials have a public DID with a reputation so verifiers can trust it.  <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable credentials</a>: This is data that an issuer attests about you and signs with their DID. This same thing happens with the DMV in real life—they issue you a credential that others can verify is legit. Only now, there’s a digital version in addition to the plastic. Verifiable credentials answer the question “says who?”.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Protocol 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Once we’re using the same data model, we must figure out how to communicate. Theoretically, I could export my verifiable credentials out of my wallet onto a thumb drive and upload them into your wallet (if it supports the verifiable credentials data model), so you can check them out. But clearly, using common protocols is better than that.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 DID Communications 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>DIDComm is an important standard protocol that lets a DID have secure communications with another DID. DIDComm started in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> community and recently moved to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>. Every action the Trinsic platform enables, whether it be creating secure connections or verifying a credential, uses some number of DIDComm.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Aries RFCs 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At the core of the Trinsic platform is the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. The .NET implementation is a collection of implemented standards based on the Hyperledger Aries RFCs (Request for Comment) documents. This is a project that is meant to make apps and clients that can interact with a variety of distributed ledgers. All of the protocol specifications can be found in the&nbsp;aries-rfcs&nbsp;repo here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A protocol is a step-by-step process to accomplish a task. If it’s not followed exactly correctly by either side, the process will fail. I’ll give an example of a university issuing a student ID to someone.<br><br></p>  School sends a&nbsp;credential offer&nbsp;to&nbsp;student<br><br>  Student responds with a&nbsp;credential request&nbsp;to the school, to confirm<br><br>  School sends a&nbsp;issue credential&nbsp;message to the student, which includes the credential  <p><br>Trinsic doesn’t have to implement every Aries RFC. But if we implement a feature that can be done in a way that follows an RFC, we will follow the RFC to do so so that it’s interoperable with other implementations.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Our commitment 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As SSI continues to mature, the number of related standards will increase and existing standards will evolve. Through it all, our engineering team will ensure that the Trinsic platform is always based on the most recent standards and protocols, so you never have to worry about interoperability or standards compliance. <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Sign up for a free Trinsic Studio account today</a> to see the beauty of SSI standards in action!</p>

<p>IOTA Identity Alpha Release: A standard framework for Digital Identity.</p><p>Decentralized Identity (or Self Sovereign Identity) is a popular topic in the field of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with over 75 implementations of the DID standards being submitted to W3C. It is an enabling technology for DLT, as it allows the creation of trust through identification in an online setting. This is crucial for both the internet and DLT as identifying who you interact with online can prevent many cases of fraud, disinformation, and distrust. With IOTA Identity we make an important step towards the adoption of both IOTA and DID due to the unique ability to pay and identify in the same feeless protocol. If you are not yet familiar with the concepts described above, we highly recommend reading our <a href="https://files.iota.org/comms/IOTA_The_Case_for_a_Unified_Identity.pdf">whitepaper</a> or watch our latest<a href="https://youtu.be/4YnGFHhxua8"> EclipseCon talk</a> on the&nbsp;subject.</p><p>In this blog, you will find the alpha-release of IOTA Identity, open-sourcing our Selv app, and the announcement of the Identity X-Team. For those that participate at Odyssey Momentum, we also prepared a hackathon package near the bottom of this&nbsp;blog.</p><p>IOTA Identity Alpha&nbsp;Release</p><p>We are excited to announce the release of IOTA Identity Alpha. At this stage, the proposed standards for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) are implemented in full. The implementation of these specifications is a fundamental layer for building an SSI framework. You can find the code in <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/">our repository identity.rs</a>. This contains both the full Rust implementation and <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/main/libraries/wasm">Web Assembly (WASM) bindings</a>, which can be used both in the browser and Node.js environments in Javascript / Typescript. The current Alpha release is an early version and does not contain the level of documentation, code examples, and higher-level functionalities that we would ideally like, but that will be improved upon in the next few&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>For the remainder of the year, the team will focus on improving the IOTA Identity framework to prepare for the full 1.0 release. We will implement a higher-level library that wraps most of the complicated functions into easier, but less flexible functions. This should be sufficient for most of the applications that you might build on top of the IOTA Identity framework, otherwise, you can always access the lower level functions directly. In addition, we are working on implementing DID communications messages that allow different devices, programs, and platforms to interact in a standardized manner, allowing your custom apps to directly interface with Selv or other compatible applications. Lastly, we will improve upon the documentation and make it easier to use the framework.</p><p>Once again, I would like to thank huhn#8105, Thoralf#3558, and Tensor#2912 for their amazing work on identity.rs under the <a href="https://fund.iota.org">Ecosystem Development Fund</a> (EDF) grant with the support of our amazing colleagues at the IOTA Foundation such as Devin Turner and Daniel Thompson-Yvetot.</p><p>Selv</p><p>As part of the hackathon package, we are <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/selv-mobile">open-sourcing the Selv app</a>. Selv is the identity wallet developed by the IOTA Foundation. It is currently used for the <a href="https://selv.iota.org/demo/app">Selv: Health passport</a> demo and will be used for multiple demos. It allows people to store and share verifiable credentials with the demo websites or peer-to-peer with other Selv users via a QR-code. This is only the beginning for an identity wallet but should allow sufficient functionalities for an IOTA Identity based hackathon project. The repository includes a useful <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/selv-mobile#how-to-add-custom-credentials">tool </a>for generating new verifiable credentials and an associated QR Code which you can render on your pc and scan with the Selv app to transfer directly into the app. This workflow allows you to develop your own SSI demo with just a few commands.</p><p>Open sourcing the app was a long-promised step we still had to take, but it was delayed due to some required code restructures that were hard to prioritize during all our other work. Fortunately, we have recently received amazing community code contributions from Eike Haß, who is doing his master thesis about Selv. Adjacent to the IOTA Identity developments, we will be making more improvements on the tooling around Identity to foster the ecosystem.</p><p>Odyssey Hackathon Package</p><p>Tomorrow marks the kick-off of Odyssey Momentum, the 4th installment of the largest DLT/A.I. hackathon in the world. Last year, we saw nine teams who used IOTA in their solution, of which three teams won their respective challenges. As Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a popular topic at Odyssey to resolve the many different challenges, we have been hard at work at preparing a bunch of earlier than planned releases related to IOTA Identity in time for the hackathon.</p><p>We have prepared a minimum viable SSI stack for the participants of tomorrow’s Odyssey Momentum. The release of IOTA Identity Alpha contains the following components:</p><p>Rust</p>  Rust Implementation of the DID and VC&nbsp;standard  Publishing and Reading DIDs from the IOTA&nbsp;Tangle  <p>Javascript (WASM)</p>  WASM Bindings for the DID and VC&nbsp;standard  Publishing and Reading DIDs from the IOTA&nbsp;Tangle  Works on Node.js and the&nbsp;Web  Contains Typescript typing  <p>Selv app</p>  Open-source SSI&nbsp;wallet  Can store and verify credentials  QR code scanning to download, share and verify a credential  <p>If you have any questions during or after the hackathon about IOTA Identity, join us at <a href="http://discord.iota.org/">discord</a> and join the #identity-discussion channel. At Odyssey, you can also request assistance from our Jedis Dave de Fijter and Sebastian Heußer or tag them at the Odyssey Momentum&nbsp;Discord.</p><p>This is also an excellent opportunity for anyone else to familiarize yourself with IOTA Identity as we will soon be announcing further inquiries into the topic together with our community. We believe that IOTA Identity will not only impact how we use our identity from a technical perspective but also how we perceive our own identity and connect to the world around us. We look forward to exploring not only technological but also social and economic implications of SSI in the long-term together with our community. Stay tuned for more information on how to get involved!</p><p>X-Teams</p><p>In addition to the code releases, we are also happy to announce the launch of the IOTA Identity Experience Team. The X-Team members are active contributors to the ever-growing IOTA Ecosystem. Many of them already have personal projects that are planning to build on IOTA Identity such as <a href="https://society2.com/">Society2</a> and <a href="https://www.deposy.org/en/">Deposy</a>. X-Team members speak as a voice for the community. Working alongside IOTA Foundation members they will become intimately involved in preparing tools, libraries, and documentation for the IOTA Identity framework.</p><p>Everyone is invited to apply to the IOTA Identity X-Team and help pave the road for IOTA Identity to have the best experience in the DLT and IoT space.

<p>The weekend of 13-15 November 2020 saw the first ever <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/momentum/">Odyssey Momentum</a> event. This was an online mass collaboration aiming to reimagine what a typically physical event, such as a hackathon, looked like in the pandemic era. Occurring over 49 hours and featuring 105 teams, <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/#challenges">21 challenges</a> and more than 2,000 participants, Odyssey Momentum took place completely online.</p>



<p>It also saw the premiere of <a href="https://cherrytwist.org">Cherrytwist</a>, a self-hosted open source challenge management platform that gives ecosystems the power to manage their innovation challenges, community, grants and projects portfolio effectively. Cherrytwist is backed by a non-profit foundation of the same name and supported by Jolocom self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology.</p>



<p>The problem that the Cherrytwist platform seeks to solve is a timely one. Not just for this online-only outing of the well-regarded <a href="https://www.odyssey.org/about/">Odyssey</a> events but also for the wider world. That is, that any challenge, being a problem to be solved or overcome, requires diverse skills and talents to collaborate, making step by step progress towards the end goal. The team brought together to do this will need to share knowledge and expertise, communicate and feedback. They will need to interact, working from the same shared context and agreements in a trusted environment.</p>



<p>TL;DR – Managing complex challenges is, well, challenging. Currently, they tend to be managed in an ad-hoc way, with meetings held via Zoom or Microsoft Teams, collaborative copy created on Google Docs, spreadsheets shared via email and so on.</p>



<p>Taking a highly decentralized and fully open source approach, Cherrytwist offers a platform for managing challenges in a neutral way. Its vision is to enable a vibrant community that comes together, giving everyone the opportunity to fully contribute to the complex challenges we face today. Additionally, it seeks to unleash the potential for innovation that comes when all team members can build on, refine and improve each others’ contributions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cherrytwist.org/about/">Cherrytwist Foundation</a> is led by Rutger van Zuidam, who also runs the Odyssey hackathons, Neil Smyth, technical director at the YES!Delft Digital Hub, and Shell’s former chief digital officer, Rene Honig. It was their shared belief in the need to find a better way to organise society that drove the establishment of the foundation in June 2020.</p>



<p>Since then, progress has been rapid. This was primarily driven by the goal of hosting the Odyssey Momentum event on top of the Cherrytwist platform. With that achieved, participants in Momentum were given the freedom to continue to collaborate effectively after the event, by having persistent and shared representation of all the hackathon’s challenges.</p>



<p>Before work started on Cherrytwist, however, its guiding principles needed to be set. Foremost among these were that it needed to be Web 3.0 powered but Web 2.0 compatible. To put this in very simple terms, that means it would work for anyone now, using accounts, logins and so on, but that it would be ready for the re-decentralized Internet, running self-sovereign identities behind the scenes.</p>



<p>Cherrytwist aims to help the transition from the current centralised reality for digital identities, smoothing the path to the self-sovereign future. To do this, the platform was designed with SSI in mind, not only to leverage its capabilities for Web 3.0 but also because such a structural change is not something that can be retrofitted. It has to be foundation.</p>



<p>After evaluating SSI options, Cherrytwist chose to integrate our Jolocom SDK into its software to enable <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/">SSI-based identity</a>. As a result the Cherrytwist platform is designed so that all the key entities within or engaging with Cherrytwist will get their own SSI, be they individual users or groups, projects, challenges and so on. These identities will be used to execute all the key actions taken within Cherrytwist, such as committing to a project.</p>



<p>As everything within Cherrytwist is identified using SSI logic, and every interaction happening uses SSI, this creates a trail of past events, exchanges and transactions that can be accumulated by each identity. That then creates a higher level of control over the whole challenge-solving process.</p>



<p>Initially the platform will manage the identities in a guardian role, acting when authorised. For now, this role is only there out of necessity. Wider society is not yet using SSI. But the sooner the platform can hand over responsibility for the digital identities to the identity owners the better say Cherrytwist – and so do we.</p>



<p>Cherrytwist is very much set up to make sure that it’s the users themselves who are in control. When starting to address a challenge, users will define the challenge within an ecoverse – essentially a hosting environment for challenges. And the vision is that there will soon be many ecoverse instances, each hosting their own challenges. Any organisation is free to create its own Cherrytwist instance. It is open source, after all.</p>



<p>This means there is no central player who needs to be trusted or counted upon and that, because this is an <a href="https://github.com/cherrytwist">open source and community driven development</a>, it’s very safe and very accountable. Plus, you will always be able to see who’s been interacting with your challenge – who was involved and who was doing what when – creating transparency about who’s contributing what.</p>



<p>In short, Cherrytwist gives its users full data ownership. Once initiated, the platform becomes yours to create a fully decentralized challenge environment.</p>



<p>Throughout the journey so far, we’ve been helping the Cherrytwist Foundation as it has formulated its approach to SSI, facilitating the integration of the Jolocom stack and supporting through regular calls and technical guidance. Further, we have been able to leverage our network and connect Cherrytwist with other initiatives looking to ease the transition to a self-sovereign future.</p>



<p>For us, this whole experience has been a great opportunity to showcase our work at so highly regarded an event as the Odyssey hackathons, and in such an ambitious endeavour. It’s also a perfect way to show how easily the Jolocom stack can be integrated, setting the foundations for SSI-enabled interactions. And finally, it’s been a privilege to be such an integral part of so big a project, particularly one that will be unveiled to so influential an audience.</p>



<p>UPDATE: The hackathon has now been and gone. We’re extremely pleased to report that Cherrytwist was successfully launched and well received.

<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> is a stable identifier in form of an URI that introduces a level of indirection for key management and managing other useful information such as service endpoints. It means, you can rotate and add properties related to your DID and validators can find out about those changes. Trust is usually rooted in a Blockchain but some DID methods exist that don’t require any on-chain transactions. Consequently, when we speak about a DID, then we need to be more precise and also speak about the particular DID method of that DID which defines the CRUD operations on a target system such as Ethereum. Depending on the privacy, security, scalability and other guarantees, developers can choose from a variety of different DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>By resolving a DID a validator can typically discover the authoritative keys for different purposes or more generally, a set of verification methods for that DID. An Ethereum account could be a verification method as well. Service endpoints are extensible by design, so you could define your own ones if needed. However, the DID community has agreed on a set of well known service endpoints. Amongst them, the DIDComm service endpoint solves the how-to-reach-me problem and can be used to establish a secure communication channel with the other party. Despite there are only a few limitations of what properties can be associated with a DID, privacy regulations such as GDPR need to be considered very carefully.</p> If I had a Phone Book with DIDs&nbsp;… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages</a><p>So, what happens if you had a corporate registry (or phone book) where all companies had their own DIDs and please note, the phone book should not expand on individuals for privacy reasons. You would be able to start to interact with them or more specifically with their agents by just knowing their DIDs. An agent is a piece of software that runs on behalf of their controller and manages DIDs, their associated private keys, relationships with other agents and other credentials. The <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/daf">DID Agent Framework (DAF)</a> was developed by the identity team at ConsenSys AG (former uPort) and provides an agent framework for different architectures (frontend, backend, mobile, hybrid deployments using method delegation such as to support remote KMS/HSM). These agent-to-agent interactions will be secured using state-of-the-art cryptography regardless of the chosen transport channel. This approach is called <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/guide/">DIDComm Messaging</a> which originated in the Hyperledger foundation and is now being specified as V2 by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) as a pre-standard. DIDComm Messaging provides a secure communication channel between two agents. After a channel has been established, well defined message-based sub-protocols can be used to make more sense of the interaction, e.g., to increase the trustworthiness of the other&nbsp;party.</p> How to trust the Phone Book&nbsp;entries? Illustrates different steps in an agent-based system<p>The Hyperledger Aries project has defined a couple of DIDComm Messaging sub-protocols as Hyperledger Aries RFCs to build a decentralized reputation network based on the global <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) standard and specifications developed in DIF such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Credential Manifest</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">DIF Presentation Exchange</a>. Reputation is established by issuing, collecting, revoking, verifying the provenance of attestations and proving control over attestations which use the W3C VC data model. Be it the company’s home address, group membership, relationships with other company departments or with the umbrella company, subscriptions, contracts with other parties, invoices — literally, there is no limitation in what can be attested. Agents can be integrated with existing systems and work flows to enforce policies (e.g. based on attestations), obtain consent and acquire additional input data at certain steps in these sub-protocols.</p><p>If none of the existing sub-protocols in HL Aries fit, one could define a new sub-protocol. If the problem to solve is general enough, e.g. because it is used by a larger community such as by Baseline, it will be possible to register these sub-protocols in the didcomm.org registry for more visibility. It is certainly possible to use DIDs and VCs without DIDComm Messaging and add a domain-specific service endpoint to the DID that offers the&nbsp;service.</p><p>Other approaches exist that allow bi-directional binding DNS names to DIDs. For example, this can be accomplished by signalling support for the <a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">DIF DID Configuration</a> specification in the service endpoint section of the DID. The endpoint would point to a JSON file hosted under a well-known URL of that domain that contains cryptographic binding between the DID and the domain protected by existing TLS certificates (i.e. Internet PKI). This ensures that a specific DID belongs to a web origin, e.g. example.com, in a fully GDPR-compliant manner.</p><blockquote>did = agent.discoverDid(‘www.acme.com’)</blockquote><p>Nevertheless, this approach can be combined with the aforementioned HL Aries approach to build trust beyond DNS because we all know that the trust layer of the Internet is broken. However, leveraging the existing Internet PKI could be a good starting point to discover DIDs for certain domains until more natural trust anchors such as the <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/1._panel_-_daniel_du_seuil.pdf">European Commission (ESSIF)</a> or <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/gleif-uport-test-verified-data-exchange-in-financial-and-commercial-transactions/">GLEIF</a> start to build a trust framework rooted in DIDs and&nbsp;VCs.</p> Is this Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)? <p>You might have noticed that we have not mentioned the term Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so far. This is because DIDs, VCs and DIDComm Messaging don’t necessarily require an end-user wallet to have useful applications which are typically associated with SSI. However, people could use the same approach to provide end-user apps (mobile, PWA, browser extensions, web services) that operate as their own agents to manage their SSI&nbsp;wallets.</p> Relationship with&nbsp;ENS <p>DIDs and VCs are great for off-chain use cases but they are not great on-chain. This is where <a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a> still can make sense. ENS is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. On the other hand, if all you need is off-chain verification of an Ethereum account and that the account belongs to a company, then you don’t need ENS. Also note that ENS has a few design flaws which can be mitigated when an agent-based system architecture is&nbsp;used:</p>  DNSSEC oracle is not always up-to-date (specifically when the domain owner changed) which represents a security vulnerability.  Stored ENS records are hashes but they are not salted (for practical reasons), so it is questionable if this complies with&nbsp;GDPR.  Most ENS records are not verified, e.g., everyone could claim anything.  No L2 solution exists for updates (not yet) and therefore higher transaction costs can be expected.  No version history of ENS records is kept (without examining the ledger state history itself), e.g., it is not easy to find an older version of a public key which could be useful in order to (re-)verify historical data.  <p>If a system already uses ENS, then it could make sense to use ENS, DIDs, VCs and DIDComm Messaging together by adding a DID TXT record to an ENS entry. So, developers could use the ENS name as a lookup key to find other DIDs. Then, they could find out more about the reputation of that ENS name, or execute other off-chain protocols with their agent. A dedicated DID registrar contract for ENS might not be required because the linkage between the ENS name and the DID could be verified off-chain by other means (e.g.,&nbsp;VCs).</p> The DIDComm-agent Way&nbsp;… <p>The technologies described in this article can be used with SSI but are not strictly limited to end-user focused use cases. Further, DIDs are not necessarily competing with ENS and in certain cases can be a complementary solution.</p><p>Agents (through their DIDs) should be the starting point of every interaction between all types of entities across organizational borders. To make most sense out of an agent-based system architecture usually the following steps are required:</p>  Make DIDs discoverable.  Your agent discovers their&nbsp;DID.  Establish a DIDComm Messaging connection with their agent using their&nbsp;DID.  Execute higher-level sub-protocols through the DIDComm Messaging connection between your and their&nbsp;agent.  <p>By implementing this approach you will get a modular extendable way of implementing key (and other properties such as Ethereum accounts) rotation, service discovery, securely connecting systems with zero trust and enriching your business workflows with decentralized reputation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/trusted-p2p-messaging-with-dids-didcomm-and-vcs-398f4c3f3cda">Trusted P2P Messaging with DIDs, DIDComm and VCs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Organizations face challenges in scaling <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> projects because they lack the requisite skills, collaboration, tooling and know-how to create and manage a robust, production-grade AI pipeline.</p>
<p>Through 2023, Gartner estimates that 50% of IT leaders will struggle to move their AI projects past proof of concept (POC) to a production level of maturity.&nbsp;To reduce this high failure rate, organizations need to build the right roles for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-habits-of-organizations-with-successful-ai/">AI success</a>.</p>
<p>“In many organizations, data scientists are still wearing too many hats due to a dearth of talent across other roles,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/41189"> Arun Chandrasekaran</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner, during his session at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/symposium-spain">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 AI is a team sport 
<p>To successfully operationalize and scale AI initiatives, organizations need to build diverse AI roles and skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“AI is a team sport,” said Chandrasekaran. “On their AI team, CIOs and technology innovation leaders need to have data scientists, data engineers and complement the team with AI architects and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">machine learning (ML)</a> engineers. Together they can envision, build, deploy and operationalize an end-to-end ML/AI pipeline.”</p>
<p>That team should never operate in isolation and should collaborate with business domain experts, IT experts, and other relevant staff and stakeholders to deliver successful AI initiatives.</p>

 Roles of AI architects and ML engineers 
<p>Finding the right resources and how they work together as part of the AI team becomes pivotal for the success of AI projects. Two newer roles are complementing the AI team: AI architects and ML engineers.</p>
<p>The AI architect is laser-focused on the transformational architecture efforts that AI introduces. Their primary responsibility is to orchestrate the deployment and management of models in production and provide inputs on the applicability of ML and deep learning models within AI’s various disciplines, such as natural language processing or image recognition.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz00N2ZiMjJlNTFmNWExMWViYmRlMmRiODA5ZDk5OGE3YQ=="> </a></p>
<p>Because ML is the most utilized AI initiative, organizations are also increasingly hiring ML engineers as part of the AI team. They can move ML solutions in production and optimize the environment for performance and scalability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through 2023, the ML engineer role will be the fastest-growing role in the AI/ML space. Gartner estimates that today there is one ML engineer for every 10 data scientists, and it will likely change to between 5 and 10 by 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“ML engineers need to ensure that AI platforms deliver against technical and business SLA requirements,” said Chandrasekaran. “ML engineers are expected to be the connecting fabric with data scientists from an IT perspective and ensure their ML models run well in production.”</p>

<p>Over the past months Mydex CIC has been <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">working for the Scottish Government</a> on a strategy for implementing and scaling a system of ‘smart entitlements’ for the citizens of Scotland.</p><p>The Smart Entitlements concept is very simple. Its goal is to create a common, easy approach for citizens to access public services that is consistent across multiple service providers. To achieve this, it provides citizens with the ability to store their personal information in an Attribute (or personal data) Store which they own and control. Using this Attribute Store, citizens are able collect, receive and keep verified data about themselves and subsequently allow its reuse (if relevant) when they seek to access or use other public services.</p><p>Practically speaking, under the proposed system service providers would a) generate a secure electronic tokens that verify facts about a citizen (such as proofs of their address, age, disability or educational qualification), b) provide these tokens to citizens to be held safely in the citizen’s own attribute/personal data store, so that c) citizens can share these tokens with other service providers, under their control, as and when they are&nbsp;needed.</p><p>The benefits could be&nbsp;immense.</p>  Citizens would have to spend much less time and effort trying to find, present and prove information — filling in endless forms — and would also find the process less stressful and yes, sometimes less humiliating.  Organisations could use the process to reduce unnecessary data processing, verification of data entered into forms, all the duplicated effort, and errors that come from forms, enabling them to do more with&nbsp;less.  And the Government itself would benefit from the creation of a safe, efficient, privacy-protecting data sharing infrastructure that would support its inclusive growth and wellbeing agenda, while providing it with the digital capabilities to respond to new situations as they arise — such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  <p>In a separate project we proved that, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">technically speaking, it is indeed feasible</a> for service providers to generate verified attributes and for citizens to store them in an Attribute Store. (A ‘verified attribute’ is any piece of information about a person or performance that has been generated or checked by a responsible trustworthy body and made available to another party in such a manner as to be trustable as a specific attribute.) This approach is already being put into practice <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">in other projects</a> working with groups of organisations serving the same&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>But is such an approach operationally feasible? Could it work at scale? And how to achieve that&nbsp;scale?</p> A roadmap for&nbsp;success <p>The good news is that we have identified a way to achieve all the&nbsp;above.</p><p>It involves some technical things like creating metadata standards to make sure data is machine readable and to ensure clarity about levels of assurance about the data ( including descriptions of how the data was collected, created, protected and verified). But essentially, it boils down to identifying a good place to start (for example, focusing on attributes that are widely used by many services and are easy to mint and share) — and then getting on with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Crucially, it is do-able, now. There are no critical technical, operational or legal obstacles stopping Scottish Government from being able to implement this approach with immediate effect which is why they are able to move ahead with their Beta Phase during&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The details of this approach are laid out <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">in this report</a>. But its core features are&nbsp;simple.</p><p>First, Scottish Government agencies, departments and initiatives such as the National Entitlement Card, local authorities, housing associations and the Scottish Qualifications Authority have all the data that’s needed to deliver critical mass. Other bodies and agencies, such as Social Security Scotland, can always add additional data to the system as it grows and matures, as well as accessing verified attributes (with citizens’ permissions) for their own service provision purposes.</p><p>By enabling these agencies and departments to share data via citizens’ Attribute (personal data) Stores, the recommended approach minimises dependencies and maximises agency for the citizen. It can be done, now, by the Scottish Government without needing the permission or cooperation of other bodies. And it enables the Government to independently pursue its own agenda and policies.</p><p>Second, it can be done without major disruption and risk. The recommended strategy does not require any significant changes to existing back office systems that provide attributes or consume them. Instead, it connects these existing systems with a new piece of infrastructure (Attribute Stores) that join the data dots, adding a new layer of capability, flexibility and opportunity as they do&nbsp;so.</p><p>At the same time, it can proceed incrementally, taking one step at a time, so that the risks of big leaps into the unknown are avoided. Instead, it allows for a test-and-learn approach that builds momentum, impact and benefits over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Third, taking this incremental step-by-step approach brings immediate benefits for the uses of data that are initially prioritised while setting the right course for the future. The more service providers, verified data points and citizens that are involved, the more it builds the infrastructure and capabilities needed to bring further benefits. Once this infrastructure and processes have been put in place, an increasing number and range of attributes and attribute providers can be added incrementally, thereby expanding the number of use cases that can be supported and benefits that can be realised.</p><p>Fourth, in doing this, it generates powerful win-wins. All the key stakeholders involved — citizens, service providers and Government — benefit from doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>The Scottish Government is now <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/">launching a Beta Phase</a> to take this initiative to its next steps. The opportunities it presents are&nbsp;huge.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-way-forward-for-personal-data-6251d1503bdd">A Way Forward for Personal Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The world is caught between high expectations, futuristic fears, and non-legally binding recommendations on how to proceed with AI development and management. This means that although technologies are advancing and that many use cases are being proven effective to support enterprise data management, security, interactions with customers, and many more customized solutions per industry, most organizations are hesitant to board the AI train. For many, they do not feel they have enough guidance to launch a future-proof AI project. For the moment, all we have is a growing collection of AI governance frameworks from reputable groups such as the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai/principles/" title="OECD">OECD </a>and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640163/EPRS_BRI(2019)640163_EN.pdf" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a>. These provide valuable insight into what concepts should be front and center of any AI project and are the precursors to legislation. But better will be when governments and regulators clearly specify what is required for a robust, trustworthy, and human-centric model to be developed and used in a business context.</p>
 Edging Closer to a Regulation 
<p>On October 20th 2020, the European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20201016IPR89544/parliament-leads-the-way-on-first-set-of-eu-rules-for-artificial-intelligence" title="European Parliament Vote">voted on and accepted</a> recommendations on what should be addressed in a future legislation, the proposal of which is expected in early 2020. <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0186_EN.html#title3" title="Guiding Principles">The guiding principles</a> that were agreed upon are: a human-centric and human-made AI; safety, transparency, and accountability; respect for privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>A risk-assessment that defines different levels of risk caused by an AI system may be used to further regulate high-risk AI technologies. The higher the risk a system poses because of malfunction, malicious action, or because of its intended purpose, the higher the regulatory oversight and responsibility an implementing organization could carry. This is one option that could help facilitate the proposed requirement of human oversight at any time for high-risk AI technologies.</p>
<p>A separate proposal discusses a "<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0178_EN.html" title="Future-oriented Framework">future-oriented civil liability framework</a>" that would clarify and reconsider liability of self-learning algorithms in relation to developers, implementing organizations, and users. The Product Liability Directive (PLD) is one regulation that could serve as a starting point, and eventually be adapted to offer protection regarding digital and AI-based products. The framework that defines liability will have to be extended to include distinctions of frontend and backend operators, both of which would be held liable proportionately to the degree of control that each holds with the model's operation. Overall, liability should be proportionate with a model's risk, which requires clearly defined risk categories that models can be assessed by. Insurance coverage must also adapt, and the proposal suggests that the European Commission work closely with the insurance sector to find policies that offer sufficient protection.</p>
 Learn How to Prepare 
<p>These proposals are promising in that they show movement by the European Parliament, edging closer to a regulation. But these proposals did not have any surprises in them -- they are a natural extension of the European AI governance conversation. AI governance will continue to formalize, and if you want to know how to get started, join KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cybernetixworld2020" title="AI Workshop at cybernetix.world 2020">workshop on AI Governance on November 24th at cybernetix.world 2020</a>.</p>

 Dilemma of Smart Wallet and Different Approaches <p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p><p>Hi, friends. It’s been two months since the last update. Yield farming has attracted so much attention and also has a significant impact on the development of Smart Wallets. As I mentioned in the last column, the Smart Wallet operators will stop unrestricted subsidy, and they need to find new approaches for continuous growth. Several means were proposed, such as using targeted subsidy, building a billing system, and finding L2 integration solutions.</p> Response to congestion <p>The good news is many smart wallets are taking positive&nbsp;actions.</p> Gas policy&nbsp;updated   Dharma has ended unrestricted subsidy for all transactions except for specific ones.&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.dharma.io/update-to-dharma-gas-policy/">link</a>  Authereum has asked the new users to pay the deployment fee.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-2-650fc4faf549">link</a>  Argent only pays for security operations.  Dapper will no longer be subsidizing gas for non-Dapper Labs developed games. Some non-core CryptoKitties functions and <a href="https://medium.com/dapperlabs/gas-policy-update-for-dapper-ethereum-117a7474a423">will no longer subsidize</a> gas for the ‘approve’ function on CryptoKitties. <a href="https://support.dapperlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055953573-Gas-Policy-Update-Sept-24-20-">link</a>   Layer 2 solution integrated   Gnosis just released the Safe Multisig on the xdaichain. <a href="https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4552860-how-to-use-the-gnosis-safe-on-xdai-with-metamask">link</a>   New blockchain supported   MYKEY features TRON Network as the third smart contract layer.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-the-first-smart-wallet-on-tron-starts-a-public-beta-come-to-claim-airdrop-9eea5cd31fa9">link</a>   A new competitor with a low-cost creation&nbsp;feature   Loopring updates optimized the wallet smart contacts reducing the cost of creation. <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-monthly-update-2020-09-a6c4fae84146">link</a>   What did wallets&nbsp;do? <p>I’ve been keeping an eye on each smart wallets’ development, especially on their response to the high network fee problem. This section will talk about my observation about active smart wallets and thinking in the next section — sort by the number of registered users.</p> Dapper Labs <p>It seems that Dapper Labs is making a concentrated effort to build its public ledger, Flow. However, they still own the most users among all smart wallets, reaching 38,000, and has a stable growth(nearly 40 new users per day) not affected by the congestion. One reason is the contract is quite simple and only spend 135k gas, less than other wallets. Many new users come in most congestion days, such as Sep. 3rd, nearly 150 newcomers signed up to enjoy free transactions.</p><p>However, like other wallets, Dapper cut the subsidies. It only provides limited free transactions for Crypto Kitties, and users need to pay for the transaction pass for other types of transactions.</p> Argent <p>The number of Argent users increased from 20,000 to 30,000 rapidly in only two months starting from June, which seems they can get the first chair over Dapper soon. The unexpected congestion blocked the process. In the beginning, all transactions in the Argent app is free, but the <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/gas-fair-use-policy-update/">“painfully high gas price” cost them $400K only in July</a>. They used three ways to achieve balanced costs and revenues.</p>  Users need to pay for most transactions. The transfer and Dapps’ actions will charge users in ETH, DAI, USDC, BAT, ZRX, WBTC, REP. However, Dapps can offer free gas to Argent users, as Maker&nbsp;does.  Explore Layer 2 solutions. Argent announces that they’re researching Layer 2 opportunities and working with the best team in the space. This would benefit for the high cost of the gas&nbsp;fee.  Introduce commissioned aggregated trade. Argent <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/blog/the-best-way-to-trade/">launched a massive upgrade</a> that users can trade any token pair at the best market rate, earning <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/articles/997517812123.htm">a 0.15% commission fee</a> from each transaction.   MYKEY <p>MYKEY is deployed in multiple public chains based on <a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/keyid-eth-contracts/tree/master/contracts">KEY-ID protocol</a>. On Sep. 9th, it <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/mykey-the-first-smart-wallet-on-tron-starts-a-public-beta-come-to-claim-airdrop-9eea5cd31fa9">features TRON network</a> as the third infrastructure after EOS and Ethereum and reaching 6,000 new users in the first&nbsp;month.</p><p>TRON’s integration makes it cheaper to deposit and withdraw USDT. The cost will be covered by MYKEY relayer, so users enjoy the free transaction.</p> Gnosis <p>Gnosis has a <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-protocol-and-xdai-partnership-1de0e48fb14b">partnership </a>with xdai. As part of the partnership, Gnosis has invested in the xDai Ecosystem Fund to become significant holders of the STAKE Governance token. The xDai chain is an EVM based Ethereum sidechain following Proof-of-Authority consensus.</p><p>After that, Gnosis <a href="https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4552860-how-to-use-the-gnosis-safe-on-xdai-with-metamask">released </a>the Safe Multisig on the xdaichain to provide instant transactions with low network&nbsp;fees.</p> Dharma <p>Dharma is against the trend that in the most congestion period, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1288853793493250048">subsiding Uniswap trade transactions since July 30</a>. “Never miss a trade. Never pay for gas.” The <a href="https://twitter.com/Dharma_HQ/status/1288853801776984064">slogan</a> ends <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/update-to-dharma-gas-policy/">on Oct 23</a>, defining “Never” as 86&nbsp;days.</p><p>However, the free use of Uniswap brings unexpected trouble. Uniswap airdropped 400 UNI to all users who had been using its product. Unfortunately, Dharma users <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/retroactive-airdrop-excludes-proxy-contract-users-e-g-dharma-matcha-etc/1222">are not eligible to claim UNI token</a> because only addresses which directly called the Uniswap contracts were considered users. 2,833 Dharma users were affected. Dharma carried out a <a href="https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-excluded-proxy-contract-airdrop-phase-1/">Retroactive Airdrop proposal</a> to retroactively distributes 400 UNI to 12,619 distinct addresses who interacted with Uniswap via a proxy contract. Now it’s in the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2">voting&nbsp;stage</a>.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Dharma has updated <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/dharma-2020-q4-roadmap-update/">Q4 Roadmap.</a> The infrastructure is reconfigured, and after that, Dharma is purely a Smart Wallet rather than a DeFi&nbsp;product.</p>  1. Debit Card Deposits will be unavailable for 1–2 weeks while we build out the new feature set mentioned above  2. <a href="https://blog.dharma.io/introducing-the-dtoken/">dTokens</a>are being deprecated permanently as a means of earning yield in&nbsp;Dharma  3. Our Compound integration (aka Yield tab) and P2P payments system are being temporarily retired   Monolith <p>Monolith <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/closing-the-loop-on-defi-with-monolith-c4954339cda1">integrates </a>fiat-to-crypto exchange to close the loop on&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>It seems there’re no new users since June 1st in the <a href="https://explore.duneanalytics.com/public/dashboards/UaFym3IA7e1qZivL9TNqodqzUbf0tPrdOyXdbBRx">DuneAnalytics</a>. However, it’s a feature to avoid high gas fee. Monolith breaks new wallet creation in two steps: first, create accounts when Ethereum gas price is low; second, initialize when the user registers. The initialization spends much lower gas than deployment, enabling Monolith unaffected by high gas price. And I think it’s a good model case for other projects.</p><p>The most important thing for me is <a href="https://twitter.com/TokenBrice/status/1317123330877566976">TokenBrice</a>, the community manager of Monolith, is stepping down. Best wishes to&nbsp;him!</p> Authereum <p>After changing gas policy three times <a href="https://medium.com/authereum/ethereums-rapidly-changing-gas-market-and-sponsored-transactions-on-authereum-70f496f132a9">1</a><a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-6c320e28558a">2</a><a href="https://medium.com/authereum/gas-policy-update-2-650fc4faf549">3</a>, Authereum announced <a href="https://medium.com/authereum/authereum-is-out-of-beta-bb66be4f75ad">Authereum V1</a>. However, new users need to pay for registration, and the transfer is not free&nbsp;anymore.</p> Loopring <p>Welcome to the show! Loopring wallets are still delivered to beta-testers, so I cannot make a reasonable evaluation. See the <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-monthly-update-2020-09-a6c4fae84146">post</a> and look forward to the public&nbsp;version.</p> Around the&nbsp;wallets   Snapshot <a href="https://twitter.com/SnapshotLabs/status/1317366931502944257">added support</a> for EIP-1271 so users can vote from a smart contract wallet. However, I failed and got “Wrong Signature Error.” Now the issue is being&nbsp;fixed.  <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/6b15a3da608cb49e271d6f7a9fe8422629bb4c0c/EIPS/eip-3023.md">EIP-3023</a> was proposed to provide a registry for checking if a contract is a user wallet. This can avoid sending mistakes and statistical errors.  Layer 2 solutions based on zkRollup have rapid progress.  Matter Labs and Curve <a href="https://medium.com/matter-labs/curve-zksync-l2-ethereums-first-user-defined-zk-rollup-smart-contract-5a72c496b350">unveiled </a>a zkSync L2 smart contracts testnet with Curve Finance as the first resident&nbsp;dapp.  Hermez published its <a href="https://blog.hermez.io/the-hermez-white-paper-is-out/">whitepaper</a>.  StarkWare delivered <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/hello-cairo-3cb43b13b209">Cario</a>, the first production-grade platform for generating STARK proofs for general computation. Also, they spoke out their consideration of <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-road-to-l2-interoperability-718ff69ec822">L2 interoperability</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/starkware/the-optimistic-rollup-dilemma-c8fc470ca10c">Optimistic Rollup</a>.  Aztec announced <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-zkrollup-layer-2-privacy-1978e90ee3b6">Aztec 2.0</a>, a scaling solution with privacy allowing users to send token privately with ~300&nbsp;tx/s.   What’s the next&nbsp;step? <p>The gas price is quite low now but we’ll never go back. As I mentioned in the last post, we can’t enjoy free transactions on Ethereum anymore, unless…? Layer 2 solutions? ETH 2.0? Or?

 Overview of Smart Wallet Development <p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p> Abstract <p>Smart Wallet is a path to mainstream for the cryptocurrency. Using a smart contract as an account to interact with blockchain in place of using the private key, Smart Wallet makes it easier to use DeFi and various dapps on blockchain for average users. Smart wallets are rapidly emerging on Ethereum since 2017, namely <a href="https://wallet.gnosis.pm/">Gnosis Multisig</a>, <a href="https://gnosis-safe.io/">Gnosis Safe</a>, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://monolith.xyz/">Monolith</a>, <a href="https://mykey.org/">MYKEY</a>, <a href="https://www.dharma.io/">Dharma</a>, <a href="https://www.meetdapper.com/">Dapper</a>, and <a href="https://authereum.com/">Authereum</a>. Nearly 100,000 accounts are created by these smart wallet operators, holding more than billions of dollars. There’s an obvious trend that more Smart Wallets are designed for consumers, which drives the change in the pattern of blockchain account.</p> The Development of Smart Wallet on&nbsp;Ethereum  What is Smart&nbsp;Wallet? <p>Smart Wallet is the user interface and its underlying smart contract-based blockchain account. With well-designed account logic, Smart Wallet brings exciting features.</p> Stage 0: Crypto Entry before Smart&nbsp;Wallet <p>People use crypto wallets to interact with underlying blockchain. It’s a key management tool, a blockchain browser, and a dapp store where to view and use blockchain applications, such as transfer, staking, lending, etc. Currently, people use the custodial wallet or non-custodial wallet. The essential difference between them is who has the full control of the account, or precisely the private&nbsp;key.</p><p>The custodial wallet offers a traditional internet account rather than a blockchain account. User need to trust the custodian. In contrast, a non-custodial wallet gives back full control to the user, but meanwhile the user can’t enjoy the feature as same as internet products, such as account recovery, transfer limit, whitelist, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>That’s why we need Smart Wallet. With a proximity to the experience of Internet products, Smart Wallet is the potential path to realize such tasks using the smart contract.</p> Stage 1: MultiSig, Smart Wallet for Enterprise <p>Smart Wallet is not a new concept since Multisig Wallet is Smart Wallet indeed. Date back to 2015, Gavin Wood made the first implementation[1] of the MultiSig wallet. Since then, Gnosis, BitGo, Mist, DS Group, Parity made their implementation.</p><p>The goal of MultiSig wallets is to enhance security by a smart contract. The assets are owned by the smart contract, requiring multiple parties predefined to agree on transactions before execution. MultiSig wallets can avoid single failure risk of private key&nbsp;leaks.</p><p>Gnosis Multisig, the most widely adopted MultiSig Wallet, has nearly 4,000 users and has stable growth. Most of them are accounts for crypto funds, companies, exchanges, and foundations. Few individual users use MultiSig wallet unless he/she is a hardcore user or has much&nbsp;money.</p> Stage 2: Gasless, Smart Wallet for&nbsp;Customer <p>Smart Wallets for the customer are emerging rapidly in 2019. According to DuneAnalytics, the Smart Wallets for customers are launching one after another. Argent, Monolith, MYKEY, Dapper, Gnosis Safe, Dhamar, and Authereum all go live in 2019. The number of users gained in 2019 is nearly 44,000, while in the first five months of 2020, the number of new users achieves 47,000, showing the sound momentum of&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The trend of user growth of Smart Wallets can be seen in the figure&nbsp;below.</p> The difference between the two generations’ Smart&nbsp;Wallets <p>The biggest difference between the 2nd-generation &amp; the 1st-generation Smart Wallet is that all 2nd-generation Smart Wallets adopts meta-transaction to lower barriers for normal people, or we can say the Smart Wallets for customers is a gasless wallet, so the user doesn’t need to care about the transaction fee. There’s a relayer collecting user’s signed transaction and send it to the blockchain. The relayer service is usually provided by the Smart Wallet’s operator; however, it’s a trustless and permissionless service, which means the relayer can’t forge or tamper with the transaction, and everyone can deploy own relayer without authorization.</p><p>The other difference is reflected in account recovery, transfer limit, transaction batch,&nbsp;etc.</p> Brief Comparative Analysis of Mainstream Smart&nbsp;Wallets  Overview <p>What does the Smart Wallet look like? They’re quite different because they’re designed for different demands. Here’s the brief view of the selected Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Features <p>Every Smart Wallet listed here is a well-designed product with features. Each product needs to be described in detail to fully understand its functionality. However, some features are common: account recovery and gas abstraction.</p> Account Recovery <p>Most of the Smart Wallets(except for Monolith, but in the <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/your-monolith-account-is-due-for-an-upgrade-35b1814a01ed">latest blog</a>, they have a plan to upgrade the protocol to realize recovery function. ) support account recovery, which means you can reset your account through other means. This is quite different from traditional crypto wallets. And most of them provide official recovery service, assist the user in recovering the account after authenticating the user by email or bioinformatics.</p> [In addition from Brice’s comment, who’s working for Monolith]  Since day one Monolith provides account recovery, through the seed phrase only the user knows. We do not have a recovery service yet (like Argent's Guardians).  However, since the seed is known to the user, one can at any time take full control over their wallet without needing Monolith app/services using MetaMask and Etherscan:  <a href="https://medium.com/monolith/importing-using-your-monolith-wallet-with-metamask-and-etherscan-a22862283929">https://medium.com/monolith/importing-using-your-monolith-wallet-with-metamask-and-etherscan-a22862283929</a>  Gas Abstraction <p>All the Smart Wallets here use gas abstraction to enable the wallet gasless. And most of them provide limited free use. Outside of the free scene, they use a different way of charging users, such as service fee account, the ticket for transactions, or charge by cost per transaction.</p> Investors <p>Most of the Smart Wallets are being invested by investment institutions, while two of them raise funds through ICO. The total amount of financing reach $100M, but it should be noted the fundraising are is not entirely for the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Security <p>All the smart contracts of the Smart Wallet are audited, and most of them have a bug bounty program. However, the initiatives can increase security, but they cannot fully guarantee it. Here’s the information. What’s more, security is very complicated and needs expertise to understand. Next, I’ll write a feature article to analyze the security of Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p> Challenge for Smart&nbsp;Wallets  Security Issue <p>Compared to normal wallets, smart contract introduces new risks to Smart Wallets. To prevent from being hacked, the smart contract should be well audited as far as possible. Besides, the admin key risk still exists while the admin key is intended to upgrade the contract or terminate an emergency. Referring to defiwatch’s (<a href="https://defiwatch.net/">https://defiwatch.net/</a> )attempt, an analysis like smartwalletwatch is necessary to make users aware of the&nbsp;risks.</p> Pricing Model <p>Smart Wallets use meta-transaction to enable gasless transaction while the transaction fee is paid by the relayer. However, the relayer needs to charge the user for sustainable development. It’s important to design a sustainable pricing model to lower barriers of using blockchain, such as allowing deposit through&nbsp;fiat.</p> Compatibility <p>Smart Wallets face many compatibility issues, such as compatibility with new token standards, compatibility with web portals, compatibility with off-chain signatures. Fortunately, new protocols like WalletConnect &amp; EIP-1271 enhance compatibility, but there’re still many UX&nbsp;issues.</p> Next Step of Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trends <p>#1 Smart Wallet Weekly. I’ll publish the latest weekly progress of Smart Wallets, including the growth figures, new features, and new cooperation.</p><p>#2 Analysis of Smart Wallet. I’ll publish the in-depth analysis report of the selected Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>#3 Smart Wallet Connect.

<p>Writer: Xiang&nbsp;Yao</p><p>From Subscribe: Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend</p> Background <p>Last week, I published the first <a href="https://smartwallet.substack.com/p/smart-wallet-new-paradigm-for-blockchain">article</a>, which briefly introduces the overview development of Smart Wallets. A critical suspicion on Smart Wallet is that the assets are custodial, which indicates the wallet operator can dispose of the assets. In this article, I will analyze the Smart Wallet’s sovereignty and give some examples of how to control your wallet&nbsp;fully.</p> What is sovereignty? <p>Sovereignty means the user can fully control the account. For EOA, the one who owns the corresponding private key has sovereignty. If the third party holds the private key, the account is custodial. For contract accounts of Smart Wallet, sovereignty is much sophisticated because of the logic of diversity. However, it can be judged from three aspects: (1) What’s the highest authority of the account? (2)Does a designated third party(trustee) have a way to take over the account or freeze the assets? (3)Does the user has a way to send ANY transactions WITHOUT the permission of a third party? (4)Is the account contract upgradable, and is it rejectable?</p> What can a trustee do with the account and&nbsp;assets? <p>Most Smart Wallets enable account recovery and emergency operations via authentication off-chain, which means a designated third party(trustee) can change the owner of the account. The trustee can be the wallet provider, a hardware wallet, a seed phrase on paper that user assigns, such as the other wallet the user owns, families, and trusted friends. Different Smart Wallets grant the trustee(s) different authorities:</p>  Change the owner of the&nbsp;account.  Add a new owner of the&nbsp;account.  Assist in accelerating the security&nbsp;process.  Freeze or restrict the&nbsp;account.  <p>The introduction of a trustee has increased the robustness of the account but also increases the risk of trust. However, the trustee’s authority is restricted and may be canceled, so users still have the highest authority.</p><p>In the contract level, the trustee can be anyone. Still, most products only have a defaulting trustee operated by the wallet provider who authenticates users via email, phone number, and identity documents.</p> What’s the highest authority of the&nbsp;account? <p>The account owner has the highest authority of the account, who can change the state of account arbitrarily and forcibly. Though a trustee has some privileges to change the account owner or freeze it, the account owner can disrupt the flinching behavior and remove the trustee(s). The account owner is a private key or a group of keys with pre-defined logic and may be saved in several&nbsp;forms.</p>  The owner is a private key that is kept offline. — e.g.,&nbsp;MYKEY  The owner is a private key that is kept locally (e.g., in the smartphone) but CANNOT be exported. -e.g., Argent,&nbsp;Dharma  The owner is a private key that is kept locally and can be exported. -e.g.,&nbsp;Monolith  The owner is a private key that is kept on the cloud and can be exported. -e.g., Authereum  The owner is a (k,n) threshold of private keys while some can be exported. e.g., Gnosis,&nbsp;Dapper  <p>All crypto wallets are trying to protect the private key to avoid loss, and Smart Wallets have different methods to reduce the single point&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Of all these products, smart design in MYKEY is what I’m most interested in introducing. MYKEY separates the authority into the administrative authority and operational authority. The admin key has the highest authority but cannot perform normal transactions; thus, it can always be kept offline. With the delay mechanism and the assistance of Emergency Contacts, the compromise of an administrator’s key will still not cause fatal&nbsp;damage.</p> Can I send transactions without the wallet interface? <p>Smart Wallets use meta-transaction to broadcast the transaction. Anyone with a valid signature can send the transaction. Typically, most users use the wallet interface to send transactions that rely on the relayer service by the wallet provider. What if the provider stops relayer service? Smart Wallets give different solutions. For most Smart Wallets, the signing key is the owner key or one of the owner keys. For MYKEY users, the operation key is&nbsp;instead.</p>  The signing key can be exported so users can package transactions without the wallet. e.g., MYKEY, Monolith, Gnosis,&nbsp;Dapper  The signing key cannot be exported, but users can extract raw signatures from the wallet. e.g.,&nbsp;Argent.  The signing key nor the signatures can be exported, so users need to change the key through the trustee(s). e.g.,&nbsp;Dharma  <p>Unlike ordinary wallets, Smart Wallets only sign transactions; the transaction package and broadcast are done by the backend service. Sending transactions without relying on the wallet interface makes it possible to stay liveness when the wallet provider doesn’t work. However, it’s hard to package transactions with etherscan or CLI clients(geth, parity…) for ordinary people, so this only works for the hardcore players. Argent gives a good demonstration for avoiding service interruptions, but there’s still a threshold. Most users are not able to dispose of their&nbsp;assets.</p> What can I do if I don’t want to upgrade the contract? <p>Smart contracts in Ethereum are immutable by default. However, for some scenarios, to add additional features or fix potential vulnerabilities, most projects create upgradeable contracts. Therefore, it threatens the account security.</p><p>Most Smart Wallets have a modular design, and the upgrade means enabling a new module, or enabling a new module and disabling the old one. Enabling or disabling a module needs authentication, but most of the Smart Wallets will force users to upgrade. Otherwise, they cannot use the wallet anymore unless they use the exported owner key to control the&nbsp;account.</p> How to make a perfect&nbsp;upgrade?  What’s a perfect&nbsp;upgrade? <p>The perfect upgrade guarantees trustless, secure, and it’s better with fewer&nbsp;costs.</p> How to make it trustless? <p>Trustless means users are free to choose. In terms of implementation, the upgrade needs authentication, or there’s enough long time for users to migrate to another&nbsp;account.</p> Who can make an&nbsp;upgrade? <p>The contract allows a “privileged user” to approve a new contract. Currently, the “privileged user” is the wallet provider. It can be an EOA or MultiSig account. There are no apparent trends that Smart Wallets will change to DAO governance.</p> Are the users forced to&nbsp;upgrade? <p>By design, users have the right to choose to upgrade or not. There’re two main implementations.</p>  The upgrade is not global, and each user authenticates for an&nbsp;upgrade.  The upgrade is global but has a long enough waiting period, any user with doubt can migrate&nbsp;account.  <p>In reality, users cannot use the wallet without accepting an upgrade in case 1 and may miss the warning notification in case&nbsp;2.</p> Is the upgrade immediately? <p>The upgrade process requires a public notice period so that more users are likely to get informed. The waiting period can be on-chain or off-chain, while the former is more secure, and the latter is more flexible for emergency cases.</p><p>However, most Smart Wallets don’t have a standardized upgrade process. MYKEY has a <a href="https://security.mykey.org/contract-upgrade">webpage</a> to list the upgrade rule and upgrade&nbsp;history.</p> How to make it&nbsp;secure? <p>Secure is the most critical issue for the wallet. A lot of efforts should be made to guarantee the assets are safe. Security audits and bug bounty are common&nbsp;methods.</p> Security Audit <p>The outstanding security institutions are well auditing all Smart Wallets, it’s important to make every planned upgrade well audited before upgrading. Most Smart Wallets hasn’t disclosed every audit reports&nbsp;yet.</p> Bug Bounty <p>It’s essential to put the source code to the examination of more experts, that’s why we need a bug bounty. In June 2020, Open Zeppelin <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/argent-vulnerability-report/">disclosed a vulnerability</a> of Argent and helped them to fix the vulnerable smart contract. Open Zeppelin gets the reward of High severity, which is up to $25,000. As far as I know, <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/argent-bug-bounty/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://hackerone.com/monolith">Monolith</a>, <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/tagged/bug-bounty">Gnosis</a>, <a href="https://security.mykey.org/bug-bounty-program">MYKEY</a>, and <a href="https://support.authereum.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043760793-Does-Authereum-have-a-bug-bounty-program-">Authereum</a> have their bug bounty programs.</p> How to make it&nbsp;cheaper? <p>The cost of the upgrade is a less-discussed issue. In case the upgrade is global, then it’s not a problem. However, if the upgrade needs every user’s agreement, meaning that it needs 1 billion additional transactions for 1 billion users’ upgrade. Is it reasonable and practical? Is rollup technology helpful with&nbsp;that?</p> How to fully control a Smart Wallet&nbsp;account? <p>No operating manuals will be given to let you “escape from” your Smart Wallets. I just want to point out the direction and key points. Not all Smart Wallets are listed&nbsp;below.</p> Argent <p>It’s important to own a guardian by yourself, in case you lost your phone, and the official guardian doesn’t work. You can use <a href="https://security.argent.xyz/">https://security.argent.xyz/</a> to do so. Metamask, Ledger Nano, and Trezor are supported presently.</p> MYKEY <p>Always keep safe of your recovery phrase(the admin key), in case MYKEY doesn’t work properly, follow the <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/nirvana-plan-for-better-protect-users-assets-c80cac231ad">Nirvana Plan</a>, and use the <a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/mykey-tx-tool">tools</a> to control your accounts.</p> MONOLITH <p>Take care of your seed phrase, and read this&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/monolith/your-monolith-account-is-due-for-an-upgrade-35b1814a01ed?source=collection_home---2------2-----------------------">article</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Most Smart Wallets guarantee sovereignty while there’s still much room for improvement. In the normal state, users can take control of their identity and property. Extra attention needs to be paid to the upgrade process. Smart Wallets can provide a more transparent and standardized upgrade to ensure trustless and&nbsp;secure.</p> About Smart Wallet&nbsp;Trend <p>Smart Wallet Trend is a newsletter where you can find news, insights and fresh ideas about Smart&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>My name is Yao Xiang, currently a researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab.</p><p>Feel free to contact me via comment or <a href="mailto:freeyao@mykey.org">send 📧email</a> to me directly.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab/how-to-get-sovereignty-of-your-smart-wallet-f256674cb751">How to get sovereignty of your Smart Wallet?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mykey-lab">MYKEY Lab</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 When regulation, new tech, and public opinion&nbsp;converge <p>On May 25, enforcement begins under the European Union’s General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). This long-awaited regulation attempts to put the genie of digital personal data back in the proverbial bottle. Web companies were the first to realize the potential goldmine that is user data and began building businesses around it, attracting users and profits through a model of free services that generate data to sell or consumers to target. ~20 years into this model, public opinion and law-makers have realized the huge costs we’re suffering by letting people be turned into the product. Data breaches and abuses are perhaps the most visible, but huge inefficiencies and massive power in the hands of a few internet monopolies may be just as impactful.</p>From Larry Diar <a href="https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-17/">https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-17/</a><p>Many businesses are scrambling to meet the new compliance standards. It’s a sweeping regulation that impacts any business operating in the EU, collecting data from EU citizens, or doing any business in the EU, so the impact is global. Interested observers are waiting to see how some of the more vague language will be interpreted and how aggressively regulators will pursue potentially massive fines (up to 4% of a company’s global revenue). Meanwhile, a few are pondering a very different set of questions: how do regulations built for Web2 complement the new models we are building for&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>New cryptographic and decentralized technologies — most notably blockchains — have the potential to build data privacy into the core of digital systems. Developed while the GDPR and similar regimes were being drafted, the spirit of the technology and regulations are kindred: more control in users’ hands, more responsibility required of 2nd and 3rd parties. But it’s unclear in ways how the ‘letter of the law’ will apply to this new technology.</p><p>Thinking about how these simultaneous legal and technological changes, and shifts in social expectations, interact is key to planning for a more privacy-preserving future. While there are a few apparent incompatibilities — for example, the right to be forgotten on an immutable ledger — good design principles that help all parties make informed decisions can let these operate well together. Regulations and new technology that aim for ‘privacy by design,’ along with mounting public pressure for good data controls, can combine to usher in a new age of data privacy and user-control.</p> Private protections via public&nbsp;ledgers <p>Blockchains like Ethereum are public ledgers: they store pieces of data on a shared system that anyone can access, and nobody can delete. One of the things this enables is a new <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html">‘identity layer’ for the Internet</a>, giving users control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This would change the dynamics of digital interactions, likely altering the currently popular model of collecting and monetizing vast amounts of consumer data — the practice that led to regulations like GDPR. This new dynamic is now possible because decentralized technologies can let us build a decentralized consensus around who somebody is, rather than relying on centrally built and managed silos like Facebook or governments.</p><p>There’s an irony to using a public ledger to enable and protect private data. If personal data were put on Ethereum, that data would be permanently public for all to see and use. That is, of course, not what we’re doing at 3Box. As detailed in our <a href="https://medium.com/uport/privacy-preserving-identity-system-for-ethereum-dapps-a3352d1a93e8">approach to privacy-preserving identity</a>, this new system relies on a public ledger but minimizes what data is actually put&nbsp;there.</p><p>All that needs to be stored on-chain is decentralized identifier (DID), which is just a random string of characters. It’s currently not explicit whether these addresses will be classified as personal information under GDPR. Some precedent and the treatment of IP addresses suggests it may, at least in some cases. However, the DID itself tells nothing about the user: it is simply a random public address that a user claims control of through a private key in order to interact with others via a decentralized identity.</p><p>The personal data associated with a DID is controlled privately by the user. This data can be stored on private servers and encrypted so nobody but the user has access, can be pseudonymous so even when the user shares it doesn’t tie to their identity, and can be deleted anytime the user chooses. The only thing public is coded ‘pointers’ between the users DID and servers where the information is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Multiple keys are used so that even pseudonymous identities can’t be correlated. In 3Box’s system, a user can have many keys linked to a given identity and many identities, giving many ways to manage sharing or pseudonymity.</p><p>This combination does require <a href="https://medium.com/@lyricalpolymath/web3-design-principles-f21db2f240c1">thoughtful design </a>to help users, who act as their own data controller. Personal data does not need to be stored publicly — but it certainly can be. Many products, proposals, and open source projects would enable users write personal data to a blockchain if they chose to, and once this is done it cannot be undone. While we cannot control what’s possible in a world of open-source software, we can help developers and users <a href="https://medium.com/uport/different-approaches-to-ethereum-identity-standards-a09488347c87">make good decisions</a>. GDPR does not really anticipate situations in which the user is their own controller, and their own legal obligations to themselves.</p><p>Done right, users never have to disclose their personal data publicly and get all the benefits of an immutable, user-controlled transaction history. As one example of the flaws of today’s system: <a href="https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/ftc-credit-report-mistakes-1270.php">21% of credit reports have erroneous data in them. </a>Immutable transaction records would enable proof of origination to prevent this (and the billions of dollars spent each year on identity resolution, with companies trading user data back and forth), while not requiring that users ever disclose their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This system isn’t just more secure, it can be more private and far more powerful. Not just for users, but for businesses too: it will make it possible for companies to deliver the same or richer user experience without the risk &amp; cost of holding customer&nbsp;data.</p> Adoption through value, not just compliance &amp;&nbsp;tech <p>It’s great that the EU is taking serious steps to curb data abuses, and GDPR may have a significant impact on corporate responsibility. It’s doubtful it will lead to wholesale shift in how data is treated today, with it primarily in the control of organizations. And while public opinion seems to be shifting to demand more security and privacy, convenience and complacency still reign in many&nbsp;cases.</p><p>To shift Web3 to a user-centric model, with data truly in the hands of users, will require something more: value. The new model and technologies we are creating ultimately need to show their worth not through ethics and laws but through products and services that give people and organizations obvious value. And while we have work to do, our model will provide enormous reasons for identities of all types to&nbsp;adopt:</p>  Save users from identity theft and data breaches (Equifax alone cost an estimated $4bn) and protect organizations against cybercrime, estimated to be $<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/12/10/2017-roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts/#771dd60c1480">6tn </a>by&nbsp;2021  Give consumers a route to some of the $100bn+ that Facebook &amp; Google collect in ad revenue, and businesses a more effective way to discover and serve their highest value customers  Make large data sets &amp; rich customer histories available to startups, reducing barriers to competition  Give users infinitely granular <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_eurobarometer_240615_en.pdf">control </a>over their devices, accounts, relationships, and digital&nbsp;services  Reduce the 83% of adults who worry about identity theft, and the 40% who lose a password every&nbsp;week  <p>The GDPR in Europe may lead to some huge steps in curbing data breaches and giving users more control. It remains to be seen how regulators will treat public ledgers, a relatively new and unconsidered technology, but we’re confident they are complementary. The identity models being built on blockchain tech can not only enable the privacy and security the law aims for, but can drive widespread adoption of data rights and protections well beyond what the regulation calls&nbsp;for.</p> Join the conversation in the <a href="http://chat.3box.io">3Box discord community</a>.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/entering-the-age-of-data-privacy-7c3451ed3a57">Entering the age of data privacy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At 3Box we live and breathe identity, and while GDPR and data abuses like Facebook’s may be concerning, they have also brought some welcome attention to the issues of digital privacy and data control. As we push ahead to a self-sovereign future, I wanted to share how I think of the 3 parts of identity in our increasingly digital, interwoven society.</p> 1. Reducible identifier <p>Identity as a concept is difficult — even scholars in the field can’t agree on a definition. They do agree, though, that identity for each of us is not singular and static but rather plural and dynamic. Who we are changes over time and contexts. However, we as people and societies and institutions need something concrete to pick me out from the crowd of others, even others who may share my same name. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">Seeing Like a State </a>James Scott calls this ‘legibility.’ When we get past local communities and the Dunbar number, we need to make society understandable. We reduce things to lists and bits of information, and one of the must fundamental bits of information is who we&nbsp;are.</p><p>We need a legible, concrete, reducible identity. This leads to passports, social security numbers, and other root identifiers from the physical world. Much of the work in the identity industry is around verifying and authenticating who somebody is in this regard, whether through knowledge questions, facial or bio metric scan, or proof that they know a password or hold a private&nbsp;key.</p> 2. Contextual identification <p>While reducible identification is critical to anyone trying to keep track of a group, it doesn’t actually tell us much about the person who has been identified. Context about that reducible identity gives orientation to who the person (or otherwise) actually is. Traditionally this may include where somebody lives (driver’s license), who their parents are, what tribe (including nationalities, teams, gangs, political affiliations, religion, etc) they are a part of, or who their employer is — anything you might fill out on a test or census form. More recently, this would include a person’s social graph (Facebook friends, LI contacts) and location&nbsp;data.</p><p>This may be static or dynamic information, but it’s not ephemeral — it roots them in time and space. As we move to a more digital-first world, and hopefully soon <a href="https://medium.com/uport/entering-the-age-of-data-privacy-7c3451ed3a57">a self-sovereign world</a>, we talk often of capturing this contextual information as ‘attestations’ or ‘<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/">verifiable claims</a>’ to our root (reducible) identity, giving us a way to bring all the context about us together in a powerful, private, verifiable (trusted) way.</p> 3. Dynamic&nbsp;identity <p>A reducible identifier and contextual identification provide a way to differentiate each other, to verify who somebody is and know some categorical details about them. But they do not tell you who somebody is. The richness of our identity is captured in the multitude of behaviors, preferences, relationships, interactions, histories and even thoughts. Only here can true identity — the plural, dynamic identity — be seen. One persons preferences and behaviors may contradict each other over time, and often do, so this cannot be captured in a reducible and ‘verifiable’ context. It is only captured when our goal is to understand who somebody is deeply, rather than pick them out from a crowd of&nbsp;others.</p><p>In today’s world, data reflecting who we are is being generated and captured constantly. With much of our lives online and in our phones, and sensors cheap enough to put on everything, nearly all our interactions with the external world can be turned into digital data. In fact, our internal ‘data’ — health, mood, biological patterns is now logged as well. This is infamously captured and monetized by Facebook and others, but it is also incredibly powerful. If <a href="http://uport.me">put in control of users and creators of data</a>, we can build a world that lets us use this rich data to truly understand the people around us far better than ever before, and as far more than bits of reducible and contextual information.</p><p>In fact, with rich, full identity data, we could understand our dynamic selves far better than previous identity construct have allowed us. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310">Homo Deus</a> Yuval Harari envisions a breakdown of the singular ‘self’ into a multitude of biological signals and patterns and interactions, changing the very notion of identity — perhaps an indication of why this concept proves so hard to nail&nbsp;down.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/the-3-parts-of-identity-in-a-dynamic-world-f94724c2bae9">The 3 parts of identity in a dynamic world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Experts define Operational Technology (OT) as&nbsp;«hardware and software that detects or causes a change, through the direct monitoring and/or control of industrial equipment, assets, processes and events.»</p>
<p>OT differs from IT, in terms of functionalities, the culture of operators and threats. In recent months, we witness an increasing convergence of IT and OT systems.&nbsp;This area is a novel and rapidly expanding one for both cybercrime and industry.&nbsp;Recent IBM’s 2020 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index summarizes that attacks targeting operational technology (OT) infrastructure increased by over 2000 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year.&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends: it is the digital accelerant of the decade and accelerated companies’ digital transformations by approximately a global average of 6 years.</p>
<p>For example, one of the impacts of COVID-19 –at least until a vaccine is discovered– is the reduction of on-site staff. In the case of OT systems, this put a strain on the already limited resources and required an increase in external connectivity. The result is the numerous industrial plants exposed to, for example, ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a bird-fly point of view, IT and OT are still missing a holistic approach that includes cybersecurity, physical security and cyber-physical security, an integrated cyber-risk estimation and governance models able to span across IT and OT domains. Overall the primary need concentrates around as reconciliation of IT Security (typically built on Confidentiality-Integrity-Availability paradigm) with OT Cybersecurity (which fundamental properties are instead Safety-Reliability-Productivity).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status of IT and OT security</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long term impacts of the pandemic on the digital transformation agenda of industry</p>

  <p>Cyber resilience, a term often heard but never fully understood, has made headlines for many years. Nonetheless, we are still confronted with ransomware attacks that lead to the standstill of organizations, as evidenced in the 2017 Maersk attack or the declared state of emergency by the mayor of the city of New Orleans in December 2019 after the city was hit by a cyberattack.</p>
<p>Many organizations perceive cyber resilience as yet another regulatory topic to be addressed by the IT department or the IT security teams, ignoring the regulatory requirements deriving from stakeholders such as the European Central Bank, or the need to interlink cyber preparedness with business continuity efforts and the much-needed support not only by the business departments but also the C-suite.<br>All this stems from an incomplete understanding of cyber resilience and what added value it can offer to an organization. The presentation aims to close this knowledge gap by highlighting key regulatory requirements, and how these can be addressed in coordination with key decision-makers. It will also provide insights into future regulatory developments with a specific view on the EU legislation. The presentation will also talk about testing approaches for cyber resilience, such as the TIBER-EU (Threat Intelligence-Based Ethical Red Teaming for the European Union) framework.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>1) After completing this session, the participant will be able to refer to relevant CR regulations and put them into context and everyday use and to understand expectations from the FS regulators.<br>2) After completing this session, the participant will have knowledge about how CR is applied in other FS organizations, and what tools and methods exist to assess CR readiness.<br>3) After completing this session, the participant will be able to discuss key CR topics with senior management to promote the importance of CR, and to make a business case for it.<br>4) After completing this session, the participant will be able to refer to available resources on the internet to deepen his/her knowledge of CR.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_10_minkmar"></a>

  <p>You likely have an identity governance and administration (IGA) solution in place to address data privacy and regulatory requirements. “Identity governance” refers to identity needs like&nbsp; access request approvals and certifying user access levels, and “administration” refers to the back-end user account provisioning processes in place to meet those needs. In this blog, we’ll look at the requirements that have driven the adoption of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration</a>, how the changing identity landscape is posing challenges for legacy IGA solutions, and how modern IGA approaches fill those gaps.</p>

 Why You Need an Identity Governance and Administration Solution 

<p>You have to manage user access requirements, ensure compliance with an ever-increasing number of regulations, protect your organizational data and intellectual property, and maintain a seamless customer experience across multiple devices. IGA solutions have evolved over the years to address this broad set of needs.</p>

<p>A robust identity governance and administration solution should enable the certification of appropriate user access levels and allow you to govern that access with policy-based controls. Additionally, it should enable your security and compliance teams to handle access requests, access approvals, and role administration. An effective IGA solution should also help your organization achieve regulatory compliance.</p>

 IGA Landscape Challenges&nbsp; 

<p>You’ve likely had your existing identity governance and administration solution in place for a long time, and you’ve seen the identity landscape change drastically around it. Accelerating changes in enterprise technologies, cyberthreats, and the user landscape are putting growing pressure on traditional IGA solutions and, in turn, on your security and compliance teams.</p>

<p>The identity landscape today encompasses a growing number and type of users, accounts, devices, applications, and systems. Applications and systems are no longer just on-premises. They live in a dizzying hybrid of on-premises, cloud, and SaaS environments – and your users, encompassing your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumers</a>, and partners, access them from many different devices and networks. On top of these complexities, you’re protecting your data and users against an increasing number of internal and external threats while the number of compliance regulations mounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re left with a critical question: Can your IGA solution keep up?&nbsp;</p>

  Identity Silos Leave you with Poor Visibility<br>Enterprise IT environments become more complex every year, increasing the number of applications and systems you provide user access to. Most legacy identity governance solutions don’t connect and manage all applications, especially with systems living in a hybrid of on-premises and cloud environments. Combined with your user identity information scattered across multiple identity silos, this can lead to poor enterprise user access visibility, a lack of context, and an inability to recommend appropriate access privileges, like entitlements and role assignments. It’s difficult to secure identities, user access and maintain compliance when you don’t have – and can’t achieve – complete visibility. 
	 Compliance Becomes Challenging<br>Your IGA solution should enable you to understand who has access to what, but with fragmented visibility, your security and compliance teams don’t have the information needed to be compliant with the increasing number of regulations. Longstanding regulations like the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763">Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)</a> have been joined by new legislation like <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) and the <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>, are increasing the pressure on your security and compliance teams. Breaching these regulations comes at a high cost. Noncompliance with SOX can cost organizations up to $25 million in fines as well as criminal or civil prosecution. It’s estimated that <a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-biggest-gdpr-fines-so-far-2020/">$192 million</a> in GDPR violations have been levied against companies since the legislation went into effect.&nbsp; 
	 Resources are Exhausted <br>Identity governance solutions are expected to work across multiple siloed environments with tens of millions of access privileges spread across legacy and modern applications on both on-premise and cloud environments. Automation is critical to preventing your teams from over provisioning or granting inappropriate access privileges. Unfortunately, many legacy systems can’t be automated, resulting in an overflow of access requests for your team. Requests that require manual, human reviews and fulfillment. 
 <p>The shortcomings of existing&nbsp; IGA solutions can lead to identity governance fatigue and leave your organization more vulnerable. When considering a new, modern IGA solution, here are a few best practices to look for:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  AI-Driven IGA Solution - A modern identity lifecycle management solution that simplifies and automates the access request, access approval, certification and role modeling processes. By leveraging an AI-driven analytics engine, the solution identifies and applies appropriate user access, automates high-confidence access approvals, recommends low risk accounts for certification, re-certifies high-risk accounts, and automates the removal of unnecessary roles.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that automates access and governance controls to more easily manage the demands of today’s dynamic workforce throughout the entire users’ lifecycle.</p>

  Data Agnostic - A solution that does not include data bias, a data model that reflects the entire user access landscape. A solution that provides the ability to contextually examine all identity-related data, identify and recommend the right level of user access rights via high, medium, and low confident scores while providing the ability to apply appropriate birthright and or leaver user access rights to accounts, applications, systems, roles, and entitlements across the enterprise.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that reduces overall request volumes by predicting appropriate user access at the right time, to the right resources.&nbsp;</p>

  Extensible Data Model - A solution with a highly scalable identity model for managing all users, devices, and things. A solution that enables data aggregation from diverse identity authoritative sources combined with an identity relationship model. A data visualization model that automatically identifies contextual relationships across users, devices, and things.&nbsp; 
 <p>A solution that automates identity orchestration and automation across <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a>, identity governance, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a> via AI-based remediation recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Identity Governance and Administration 

<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">ForgeRock Identity Governance and Administration</a> solution is an integral part of the&nbsp; <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>.

 Identity is the new perimeter — but how can companies properly protect&nbsp;it?  Strongholds must be built around each individual’s identity, but what’s the best way to do this in an era of hyper-connectivity? Biometric solutions are our best&nbsp;answer. <p>The ways in which employees access corporate systems have changed dramatically. The shift to remote working, alongside the sheer volume of devices being used to access private networks, must be the wake-up call to reevaluate and modernize security strategies.</p><p>The security perimeter has shifted from the office to user end-points, and now finally to the end-user itself and their identity. The question being asked is not whether or not identity is the new perimeter, it’s how can it best be protected?</p><p>How can companies ensure that on-premise and cloud services are safe, while employees and third parties are suddenly requesting access to private systems from all over the&nbsp;world?</p><p>The answer to securing the new perimeter lies in rethinking how we authenticate and validate identities in the era of digitization.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the online domain identities are too commonly guarded with weak credentials like email addresses and passwords. These methods are inherently insecure, leaving companies and their users susceptible to privacy and security&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Not only are login credentials at extremely high risk of being compromised in breaches, (Computer Weekly reports that there are over <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252485713/Over-15-billion-credentials-for-sale-on-dark-web">15 billion credentials for sale on the dark web</a>), users also still disregard password best practices, insisting on sharing passwords, PINs, and other login data, despite the known&nbsp;risks.</p><blockquote>“<a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/infographic-95-percent-share-6-passwords-with-friends.html">95% of people share passwords with up to 6 people</a>” — LastPass</blockquote><p>In an increasingly connected world, weak credentials expose organizations and individuals to large-scale threats. To make matters more complicated, criminals are exponentially adept at using compromised email addresses and passwords to breach end-points and networks.</p><p>Since one set of compromised credentials can enable a bad actor to breach an entire network, it’s imperative that we rethink authentication and identity management.</p> Identity is the new cybersecurity frontier — but who can companies trust? <p>The answer is no one. By implementing a zero-trust approach to authentication and identity management, companies can ensure that only the right users have access to the right systems, at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>Zero-trust models differ from traditional security models in that they assume that nobody can be trusted (whether they’ve previously gained access to a network or not). This means users will need to continuously authenticate to prove their identity.</p><p>Read our blog on zero-trust security to gain a deeper understanding of zero-trust security&nbsp;models…</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/what-is-zero-trust-security-cad4a9e16899">What is zero-trust security?</a></p><p>By leveraging a zero-trust approach, companies can dramatically reduce the chance of a threat actor breaching private systems. But to ensure strong security without jeopardizing convenience, companies must move away from traditional authentication methods which are cumbersome and unreliable.</p> Biometric solutions are key to securing identities in the remote&nbsp;era <p>Biometric authentication and identity management solutions solve some of the key remote security challenges.</p> Improved user experience <p>Biometrics allow for fast, easy, and secure remote login experiences that are minimally disruptive to workflow. The seamlessness of biometrics can empower companies to strengthen security by enabling them to implement tighter access controls.</p> Invisible protection <p>As well as enhancing authentication flows for employees, customers, and partners, multimodal biometric solutions help mitigate unauthorized access by presenting multiple inherence-factor challenges to&nbsp;users.</p><p>By combining physical and behavioral biometrics, companies can deliver a sophisticated authentication solution that is resilient to spoofing threats and account takeovers — making it extremely difficult for hackers to assume the identity of an employee or&nbsp;user.</p><p>Behavioral biometrics differ from physical biometrics (facial, iris and, fingerprint scans), as they are invisible to the human eye and dependent on the individual’s unique interactions with their digital&nbsp;devices.</p><p>The combination of both behavioral with physical biometrics poses a challenge for cybercriminals — who usually rely on leveraging stolen and leaked passwords.</p><p>However, since a user’s biometrics are irreplaceable, it’s imperative that companies handling biometric data ensure that it’s never at risk. If vendors fail to do this, a user’s identity could be permanently compromised.</p> The stakes are higher with biometrics <p>Last year, BioStar 2, a web-based security platform that is used by thousands of companies, suffered a breach in which 28 million records were compromised. The company’s databases were allegedly unprotected, making it easy for biometric information to be&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>The Guardian reported that the type of data exposed in the BioStar 2 breach was, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/major-breach-found-in-biometrics-system-used-by-banks-uk-police-and-defence-firms">“fingerprint data, facial recognition data, face photos of users, unencrypted usernames and passwords, logs of facility access, security levels and clearance, and the personal details of&nbsp;staff”</a>.</p><p>How then, can companies leverage the benefits of biometric authentication without jeopardizing user privacy and security?</p><p>In the words of security and compliance manager, Neville Armstrong, “In a digital world, security has to be built into the infrastructure, business applications and solutions from the moment that they are conceived, not just considered post-development.”</p> Privacy at the core of&nbsp;identity <p>When it comes to securing biometric data, there are five key rules that must be met to ensure a user’s identity is not as risk of being compromised:</p>  Biometric information should always be encrypted (never stored in its raw&nbsp;format)  Encrypted biometric data should never be stored in a centralised location&nbsp;, where it is at higher risk of being compromised.  Biometric data should not be linked to personally identifiable information — like a user’s name, email address or date of&nbsp;birth.  No one should have access to a user’s complete set of encrypted biometric templates  The same standards should apply independent of a user’s device or operating system.   The Keyless solution: Passwordless Biometrics <p>Keyless combines multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing technology to provide seamless and secure passwordless solutions for the workforce and consumers.</p><p>Our solutions are uniquely designed to ensure that biometric data is never at risk of being compromised, lost, or stolen, empowering our clients to harness the security and convenience of biometric authentication.

   Zero trust and IAM from the cloud as the foundation of hybrid IT must be simple 
<p>Most companies today rely on a hybrid IT infrastructure: Existing on-premise solutions are extended with flexible best-of-breed SaaS solutions. This improves flexibility and agility, but also increases the scope for cyber attacks due to the growing number of digital identities. For example, the Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report 2020 showed that attack patterns that target end-users - such as phishing and the use of stolen credentials - lead the attack rankings again. With obvious numerical sequences and the multiple use of passwords, consumers - employees as well as customers - also make it easy for attackers. These new broadened IT infrastructures, which are becoming more and more complex due to numerous identities and new devices - keyword "Bring Your Own Device" (BYOD) - require a new security concept: Zero-Trust.</p>
 What is Zero Trust? 
<p>The idea behind Zero-Trust is simple: Never trust, always verify. In concrete terms, this means that every access to the corporate network - whether by a user, a device or an application - must be constantly verified depending on various factors. Companies should therefore be able to answer the following question at any time and ideally in real-time: Who is allowed to log on to which service via which device at which time and how, and what (un)critical content can be accessed?</p>
 Answer the "trust question" automatically 
<p>To answer this question, risk-based access decisions involving both the user and the device in use are automatically made using machine learning. For example, users can be secured using Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (AMFA), which typically involves entering a password followed by a choice of various other factors. For devices, the system checks whether the device is a managed, registered device and also includes location factors. Among other things, the combination of user and device checks results in a risk score that decides on access.</p>
<p>In order to make these complex decisions automatically in real-time, a central control point (access proxy) is required as a core component of the zero-trust architecture. The more data this control point has at its disposal and the more systems and information from third-party solutions are integrated, the better risk scores it can determine, make decisions based on policies and provide secure access to systems and data quickly.</p>
<p>For example, Okta has an extensive integration network with more than 6,500 pre-built integrations, including Proofpoint, which among others provides anti-phishing software to analyze email traffic. By integrating with Proofpoint Okta can incorporate information to determine the risk score, including denying access to victims of phishing attacks and Very Attacked Persons (VAPs) or allowing access only based on very strong multi-factor authentication.</p>
 Easy is Right – for admins and users 
<p>IT security solutions are often circumvented or levered out whenever possible if they are not simple and intuitive. For example, if a customer fails to change his or her password and is no longer able to access a shopping account, customers often choose another provider with a simpler user experience to make purchases. But also a well-intentioned high password complexity can have a negative impact on both experience and security. When a 15-character alphanumeric, case-sensitive password with special characters is required and which must be changed each quarter, passwords are often written down in one or more places. The attempt to improve security then turns into the opposite. This is why the guiding principle for identity and access management (IAM) is easy but secure is right.</p>
 An identity platform for B2E, B2C and B2B from the cloud 
<p>In the past, often different platforms were used for workforce and customer IAM. However, this means at least twice the complexity, twice the effort to integrate and build policies, and a loss of control due to too many identity providers (IdPs), which further increases the attack surface.</p>
<p>A single directory as a central access system that integrates all systems and applications provides IT managers with the foundation for centralized access management and the ability to implement SSO and multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the board. Furthermore, workflows can be defined according to the most diverse B2E/B2B/B2C use cases with little or no additional programming effort, i.e. low code and no code. This means, for example, that it is possible to define what should happen in certain login scenarios: sending a welcome message, registering and verifying as a user or making an entry in the central CRM database or trigger a process to verify the identity e.g. by validating their national ID cards.</p>
<p>A central cloud-based service (IDaaS) simplifies and accelerates implementation and integration time, enables IT teams to assign access securely and quickly, shortens time-to-market and value, and offers high and flexible scalability and short response times to constantly changing requirements.</p>
 The following applies to the user experience: The simpler, the better 
<p>The success and acceptance of security solutions depend on user experience (UX). With cloud-based IAM, MFA and single sign-on, IT security is perhaps for the first time in a position where an increase in security goes hand in hand with an increase in convenience. Users no longer need to have countless passwords on screen and update them regularly; simple user interfaces and the use of biometrics and apps for verification contribute to an uncomplicated and secure log-in experience.</p>
<p>In addition, by linking access authorization to risk scores and context factors such as location or criticality of resources, Okta enables the authentication chain to be adapted for the best possible user experience: If, for example, a validated user is located within a secure corporate network and uses a registered, trusted device, he or she can gain access to non-critical resources under clearly defined rules without having to authenticate at all - simply and securely.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>In a world where everything has to move faster and faster, security and user experience are becoming the most important criteria for whether consumers trust a solution or use a service, and thus determine the long-term success of organizations in the digital space. Zero-trust concepts paired with identity and access management help companies to realize IT security and UX as a powerful combination.</p>

<p>The efficiency case for the roll out of digital identities has been well established, with evidence emerging from countries across geographies over recent years i ii iii. However, the need for digital identities today extends beyond, becoming a near-necessity to keep public services functioning uninterrupted with prolonged periods of social distancing forced by COVID. Digital identities can enable E-Government services which are accessible remotely and 24×7. This was on display in the United Kingdom’s with the GOV.UK Verify digital identity platform. The first month of lockdown in March 2020 triggered a 10% rise in the number new digital identities being created  to remotely file Universal Credit claims at the start of the lockdown in March 2020  [1] . This helped deliver crucial financial support to ensure that thousands of citizens could access vital services in the midst of the crisis.</p>



<p> The GOV.UK Verify program has not been without its issues. Adoption rates have fallen well short of the 25 million users by 2020 target.  Having taken a private sector led approach, the low adoption and usage rates have forced 3 out of 5 identity providers (IdPs) to stop supporting the solution due to concerns regarding its profitability  [2] . Rolling out a successful digital identity program is a commitment for the long haul and it may seem that the short-term financial pressures faced by private actors may make them unsuited to perform the role of IdPs in cases where uptake falls short of expectations. While the private sector IdP model has seen huge success in the Nordic region, with near universal digital identity coverage, this approach has been met with mixed results in other geographies  [3]. Industry projections now suggest that the pandemic might just have tipped the balance in favour of a government issued digital identity model iv. </p>



<p>Irrespective of the model adopted by a country, one thing is for certain; digital identities are expected to see significant growth in the coming years, laying the foundation for the next wave of E-Government innovation. But the proliferation of digital identities is not an end in itself, empowering citizens is. It is thus highly pertinent to deliberate extensively on what constitutes good digital identity.  As a digital identity solutions provider, we look to global projects and emerging technology trends to inform our own product decisions. Along the way, we have adopted the following design principles to place the interests of our users (the citizens) at the forefront. </p>



<p>Privacy
by Design</p>



<p>Given the sensitive nature of digital identity and the extent of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) involved, public trust in a solution is paramount. At the core of this is ensuring that the solution is designed with citizen privacy as a priority. Procivis has been guided by the values of the Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain movements that leverage cryptographic techniques to ensure user control and sovereignty over their PII v. In line with this, every new feature must tick the following boxes; consent &amp; choice, purpose legitimacy &amp; specification, collection limitation and data minimization. </p>



<p>Offering
high-value use cases </p>



<p>While government issued digital identities have been around for nearly two decades, one of the primary factors setting apart successful programs from others, is access to services that citizens value. Beyond offering the primary functionality of authenticating yourself in the digital realm, cases from around the world have shown that adoption is strongly correlated with the availability of services with high-transaction frequencies. One such service is the provision of legally binding digital signatures. In Estonia, digital signatures have all but replaced wet signatures, with over 200 million digital signatures being submitted every year by a population of 1.3 million people [4]. Other use cases that have encouraged adoption include services that permit citizens to receive and manage official documents, certificates and licenses digitally. Brazil and Argentina have seen significant adoption of digital identity wallets since permitting citizens to store their driver’s licenses and vehicle documents on their smartphones. These are amongst the cases which have informed the development of our first three core features – eAuthentication, eSignatures and eDocuments. </p>



<p>Seamless
user-experience</p>



<p>It
is not just enough to provide access to vital services; it is also important
that the user-experience for a citizen is intuitive and seamless. For instance,
a number of countries introduced smart cards, which permit citizens to
authenticate and sign documents electronically. However, several of these
processes relied on also possessing a card reader, which proved prohibitively
complex and impeded adoption. Smartphone based digital identities address this
issue by relying on commodity hardware and familiar user journeys. Furthermore,
a number of government digital services suffer from being digitized in
fragments. For example, in Switzerland a number of official documents can be
ordered on a government portal, but the payment processes are separate,
requiring that citizens make a wire transfer after receiving an invoice. In the
Canton of Schaffhausen, we combine ePayments with eAuthentication and
eDocuments on a mobile app, permitting citizens to go through the process of
ordering, paying for via credit card and receiving their official documents all
in one seamless flow. </p>



<p>Interoperability
to build an ecosystem of services</p>



<p>As highlighted above, the true value of a digital identity lies in the access to services that it can enable. It is thus vital that solutions rely on open standards that make it easy for third parties (public and private sector) to integrate digital identities into their processes. The financial sector is one industry that finds immense value in leveraging a trusted digital identity. In Denmark for instance, out of the 70 million monthly transactions, 40 million were used for banking transactions.&nbsp;However, a government-issued identity forms the trusted foundation of a digital society and can find applications in quarters far broader than initially envisioned. </p>

<p>Decentralized identity has matured as foundations, working groups, and consortiums emerged to align standards across companies. However it has diverged significantly from the early days when it was closely aligned with the Ethereum developer community. We see potential to accelerate global impact on underserved populations by bringing these communities together. If there is something you want to build at the intersection of decentralized identity &amp; crypto, we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Email: isaac@bloom.co | team@bloom.co</p><p>Telegram: @IsaacPatka</p> <p>This is the blog post version of the talk I gave on October 30 at the EthOnline impact event</p><p>"Decentralize it with smart contracts" could have been the theme of the crypto space in 2017 and 2018. Lending, trading, derivatives, credit bureaus, and identity were all being coded in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum testnets. Some efforts have worked, some have fizzled, and some have branched off in different directions.</p><p>Decentralized Identity is a prime example of an effort from the early days of Ethereum that has matured significantly, but independently of the rest of the crypto space.</p><p>The true value of Decentralized Identity is the ability to identify everyone, even where data is lacking. Hundreds of millions of people globally are excluded from traditional identification systems. Institutions see these individuals as high risk, and expensive to onboard. Unique, localized dynamics for credit and fraud further add to the problems of financial exclusion.</p> They don't need on-chain identities <p>While these individuals are perfect candidates to be onboarded directly into an adaptive and decentralized approach to identity, they don't need on-chain identities - yet. The key detail here is that smart contracts don't solve any problems that these individuals face.</p><p>Problem 1: How do we uniquely identify individuals, when they might not be registered with any government systems, or are in a market where government identifiers are frequently stolen &amp; impersonated?</p><p>Solution: We can uniquely identify people with a public-key infrastructure.</p><p>Problem 2: How do we source data to strengthen individual identities where data is lacking?</p><p>Solution: We can leverage traditional and alternative data sources, as well as environmental data, such as P2P relationships and everyday interactions. We can associate this data with public keys associated with individuals.</p><p>Problem 3: How do we ensure Decentralized Identity complies with emerging legal frameworks for privacy &amp; personal information?</p><p>Solution: We don't store any identifiable information on chain, even at the direct request of a user. Instead, we store it off chain, in a way that only the user controls the access and sharing of their information.</p><p>None of the challenges above are solved by putting individual identities on-chain. We realized this mid-way through 2019, at which point we were submitting a mainnet Ethereum transaction for every new user sign-up. We stopped anchoring individual identities, but we never stopped registering new users.</p> But - they are enabled by blockchain technology! <p>Most Decentralized Identity approaches are using Ethereum or Bitcoin keys under the hood. An identity wallet is often a wrapper around a simple Ethereum wallet, the same wallets that are used in on-chain monetary transactions, like <a href="https://github.com/trustwallet">Trust Wallet</a>.</p> Decentralized Identity standards are maturing <p>Concepts that started as smart contract account registries, and attestations have evolved into standards.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AccountRegistryLogic.sol">BloomID</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (Decentralized Identifier)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AttestationLogic.sol">Bloom Attestations</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-vault">Bloom Vault</a> → <a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/encrypted-data-vaults/">Encrypted Data Vault</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Store</a> community  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/hellobloom.github.io/blob/master/attestation-data/Bloom-Merkle-Tree-22facf0b-bedb-4b45-bb7d-edcd57213eb0.md">Bloom Selective Disclosure Merkle Tree</a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">Mattr BBS signatures</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core">Bloom Attestation Smart Contracts</a> → <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020">W3C RevocationList2020 spec</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a> → <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange">Presentation Exchange Specification</a> &amp; <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API (CHAPI)</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/verify-kit#example">Bloom Share Kit Payload</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>  <p>More than 60 DID methods have been invented, none by Bloom.

   Here’s a thought exercise for you: How will we develop software in the near
future? Below, I’ll lay out what I think that looks like. Some of the things in
this post exist in some form already.  And some things don’t exist… yet. 

 To begin, I’m going to start with a short story about someone using this
futuristic development environment:

  <p>Here’s a thought exercise for you: How will we develop software in the near
future? Below, I’ll lay out what I think that looks like. Some of the things in
this post exist in some form already.  And some things don’t exist… yet.</p>

<p>To begin, I’m going to start with a short story about someone using this
futuristic development environment:</p>

 A Story 

<p>Imagine Viola. She is a software developer at Sunnyvale Systems, a logistics
company. Viola is on the phone with a customer, who called in to report a bug in
their route planning software. The customer is Polish, and unable to type the
Polish letter “Ś” into text fields in the Sunnyvale Systems user interface. It
takes a little while to figure out what the bug is, but Viola is able to get to
the bottom of the issue by connecting her development environment directly to
the customer’s  browser session.</p>

<p>Viola tries a few things with the customer on the line. “Try now,” she says, and
the customer tries again. No dice. A few more changes, and Viola asks the
customer to try  again, repeating this until she finds the solution—the
Sunnyvale Systems UI ignores the “Ctrl+S” keyboard combination to prevent the
“Save webpage” dialog  from opening for people who are used to Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>However, Polish keyboards send “Ctrl+Alt+S” when a user types “Right Alt+S” to
enter the “Ś” letter, and the logic to ignore “Ctrl+S” interferes with this.
<a href="https://medium.engineering/the-curious-case-of-disappearing-polish-s-fa398313d4df">The fix is to only ignore “Ctrl+S” if “Alt” isn’t pressed as well</a>.</p>

<p>Once Viola figures out what the issue is, it’s time to move her changes to the
production system. To do this, Viola points her development environment at the
production system, makes the change, but gets a warning that her updated change
has no tests for it. So she quickly adds a test to make sure that the Ctrl+Alt+S
key combination is not ignored. About 500 milliseconds after that test passes,
her change is live. She asks the customer to reload his app one more time and
try typing “Ś” —it works, and the customer hangs up, 
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html">a little shocked that his issue was fixed so quickly</a>.</p>

 Why Isn’t the “Future” Here Already? 

<p>Computers have barely achieved even a fraction of their potential. Most of what
is holding back the potential of computers is not the technology itself, it’s
the mental models that humans use to interact with computers.</p>

<p>Even with all of the advances that we’ve made since
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star#The_Xerox_Alto">1981</a>, the way that we
use computers hasn’t really changed much since then. We’ve made astounding
advances in processor, storage, and display technology since then. In fact,
computation is essentially free today. But in spite of all those changes, the
way that we think about, with, and for computers hasn’t changed. The computers
that we use today are essentially fancy typewriters.</p>

<p>That may sound like hyperbole, but let’s consider some examples of ways that
developers interact with their computers today:</p>




<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">



</a>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">



</a>




<p>On the left, we have Visual Studio Code, a popular program used to write code.
On the right, we see a command line interface, used to run, build, and test
code.</p>

<p>Each program uses fixed-width fonts. And furthermore, the picture on the right
is literally from a program that simulates a teletype, a “typewriter” that could
talk with other similar typewriters over the telephone. It’s another example of
the saying “We shape our tools, and our tools shape us.” Programmers in 2020 use
the same computer interface that the authors of UNIX used to write UNIX 50 years
earlier:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix"></a></p>

<p>There have been many attempts to break free of the typewriter interface for
computers, some of the better examples of this include HyperCard, Squeak, and
the Genera OS.</p>




<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2017/08/11/hypercard-on-the-archive-celebrating-30-years-of-hypercard/">



</a>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeak">



</a>


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera_(operating_system)">




</a>





<p>However, for various reasons none of these interfaces took off. For
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">better or worse</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Beginning..._Was_the_Command_Line">text based interfaces are here to stay</a>.</p>

<p>What does any of this have to do with “the development environment of the
future,” you may ask? Well, I strongly believe that as long as we’re using a
screen, keyboard, and mouse to interact with the computer, we simply can’t
ignore the effects of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependence</a>.</p>

<p>We will have to make compromises while still striving for the more ideal
environments that things like HyperCard, Squeak, and Genera all point to. Simply
put, a pragmatic approach is required.</p>

<p>Another thing to consider here is that the internet has changed the way that we
work with and think about our computers. In particular, the internet changed
software development from a “top down” approach to a “ground up” one. Microsoft,
which was founded before (and famously ignored) the internet, perfected the “top
down” style of software development and distribution. What they failed to see,
and tried to stop, was the “ground up” approach that Linux and the Free Software
movement epitomized. A popular analogy from the early 2000s was 
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar">the cathedral and the bazaar</a>,”
though I’ve found  it more useful to think of Free Software as a Cambrian
explosion of software, where software is selected based on ease of use and ease
of understanding,  instead of ease of acquisition. In short, the current state
of the computational medium means that old interfaces and pragmatism win.</p>

<p>The concept of “a computer as a fancy typewriter” is here to stay for now. Let’s
make the best of it.</p>

 Towards a More Ideal Development Environment 

<p>You can split the approaches used to program a computer into roughly two camps:
batch processing and interactive Computing. Batch processing is what banks used
to do in the days before computers: Stop everything while you focus on
processing all of the day’s financial transactions. (This is where 
“<a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/are-bankers-hours-still-relevant">banker’s
hours</a>”
come from.)</p>

<p>Batch processing is sort of like making soup by following a recipe exactly, down
to the nanoliter. In terms of software development, the batch processing
approach is where the programmer takes great pains to write software that works
right the first time it’s written. In contrast, the interactive computing
approach is sort of like making up a soup as you go along, constantly tasting
what’s in the pot as you mix in ingredients. In software development, the
interactive computing approach is one where the computer is constantly helping
the programmer as code is being written. When computers were as big as rooms and
cost as much as houses, it made sense to use the batch processing approach to
write software—the computing time was worth more than the programmer time. Now
that computers are basically free, it’s the programmer’s time that is worth
more. Now it makes sense to have the computer help write the software too.</p>

<p>This brings us to the first aspect of the development environment of the future:
A fully interactive environment, one where the programmer works with the
computer, not for the computer.</p>

<p>We see hints of this today: Microsoft Word will highlight suspected mispellings
or grammar error, programmers can have their development environments warn them
if there are syntactical errors in their code. But we still have a long way to
go. One thing missing in particular is automated testing. Today, a production
test suite is considered “fast” if it completes in a minute or so. However, a
minute is roughly 59.9 seconds too long. Automated tests should be so fast that
they can run as the programmer types.</p>

<p>On a related note, much of modern-day programming takes too long. Instead of
measuring software operations using hours, or minutes, we should be using
milliseconds. Changes to tests, database schemas, production systems, source
control… all of these things should happen in milliseconds.</p>

<p>Also obviously missing from the list of things that computers can do to help
programmers, is treating all code as a graph, rather than a linear text file.
“Lines of text” is yet another vestigial appendage from the teletype era. The
way that a programmer interfaces with a computer today is something like this:
Humans write code as linear text, which is parsed into a graph, compiled into a
linear set of instructions, which is parsed by the CPU into a graph, to be
executed. Many programming languages and programming environments are making it
easier to see, reason about, and work with code as a graph (or abstract syntax
tree), and we already know about a lot of great things you can do when you have
access to code as a graph, like Jester for Java, code slicing, LLVM, etc. The
issue is simply that thinking of code as a graph is another mental model to
adopt, and the benefits are hard to attain if your programming language doesn’t
expose the abstract syntax tree in an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand way.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples of already explored computer science research that
we have yet to adopt, and are particularly interesting when taking a look into
the near future. If we have a development system where tests and other changes
happen in milliseconds and code is a graph, then we can imagine how a system
with those characteristics might look—a system with no “environments,” no
development, testing, or production. No servers. No databases. Just code that
runs everywhere.</p>

<p>If this sounds ridiculous, consider that much of what I describe is already
available today!</p>

 Existing Visions of the Future of Software Development 

<p>Parts of what I describe above exist already. 
<a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> and <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a> are online,
interactive software development environments where changes to code happens
instantly. Companies like 
<a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless">Fastly</a>, 
<a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, and
<a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> have compelling “serverless” platforms, as do AWS,
GCP, and Azure. You could build part of what I described if you, for example,
hooked up Glitch to some fast unit tests and, when the code passed the tests,
had it automatically published to CloudFlare workers.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re willing to learn a custom (OCaml inspired) programming
language, you can see what the future of programming looks like by using
<a href="https://darklang.com/">Dark</a> which (among other things) allows you to edit code
as a graph, makes updates to production in milliseconds, and doesn’t require you
to think about servers or databases.</p>

 Where to Go from Here? 

<p>If I could encourage you to take only one thing from this post, it would be
this:</p>

<p>When you are building systems for programmers, build systems where the
programmer works with the computer, where the computer augments the programmer’s
intelligence, rather than tries to replace it.</p>

  <p>Digital leaders tend to think of digital transformation and acceleration in terms of technologies, business outcomes, process changes and their impact on people. But they often overlook the massive disruption that kind of transformation generates for leadership — and the enormous impact they can have on the success or failure of their organization’s digital transformation.</p>
<p>Those who are most successful exhibit seven standout characteristics. Kasey Panetta, Senior Content Marketing Manager at Gartner, sits down with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/12240/Mary-Mesaglio">Mary Mesaglio</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, to discuss the seven traits of these highly successful digital leaders and why it’s so important that they be curious about new things, understand the difference between creativity and innovation, and never consider digital to be the outcome.</p>
 Listen to interview 
<p>For the full interview, listen to the podcast below or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37663"]</p>
 No. 1: Digital leaders are neophiliacs 
<p>Neophilia is a term for people who are naturally attracted to newness. Neophiliacs are always ready to explore new situations, tend to be more open to making and embracing new opportunities, and are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">curious about new ideas</a>.</p>
<p>There are downsides to being a neophiliac, but it's necessary for digital leadership because the rate of obsolescence and the rate of change in the information technology field are not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">Why Now Is the Time to Accelerate Digital</a></p>
 No. 2: Digital leaders invent, but also copy 
<p>This trait requires leaders to pick areas to innovate while also borrowing from other areas. Digital leaders are very selective about where they invent, which is generally in areas where they want to be better than everybody else. But they're also excellent about copying because they are not trying to invent everywhere.</p>
<p>Digital leaders are clear on where they need to be exponentially better and where they can copy, since that's not the reason people buy from the organization. It’s <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/avoid-these-9-corporate-digital-business-transformation-mistakes/">not effective to dabble</a> in a lot of innovation efforts. Instead, leaders should be very clear in the areas it’s okay to copy.</p>
 No. 3: Digital leaders eschew industry boundaries 
<p>It can be a trap to consider the organization’s point of view, innovation possibilities, business model or digital transformation based on industry point of view. Many high-performing digital leaders, like Facebook, Amazon and Google, aren’t concerned with what industry they're in. Rather, they're concerned with what gap they can fill for customers. Their customer is at the center of what they do, not traditional industry boundaries.</p>
<p>Industry delineations like “financial services” can be unhelpful in determining new opportunities because they focus on what’s there, rather than what’s not there. The best innovation opportunities are often in the space between existing stuff. An industry lens does not help with filling that space with interesting new offerings. But a customer-needs view might.</p>
 No. 4: Digital leaders appreciate that innovation is more than just creativity 
<p>There is this notion that innovation and creativity are interchangeable, so if you have people with great ideas, boom, you get innovation. In reality, creativity is just one of five behaviors that you need to bring innovation to market. Creativity will generate the ideas, but you also need a challenging behavior to question, “Why would we do this? Is this really useful? Would someone buy this from us?”</p>
<p>Alongside challenging behavior, you’ll need collaboration to pull together disparate parts of the business and various disciplines. The fourth behavior is construction, which is the actual building part. Finally, you need people who will commercialize this innovation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does digital help you get to your destination? Because digital is not a destination</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To truly innovate and bring something to market, you’ll need all five of these behaviors, not just creativity. It’s important to audit your team and make sure you have skill sets in each area. It’s easy to overrepresent certain behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, during COVID-19 you might end up with more challenging behavior because people are simply fatigued, or your team might be great at coming up with a concept, and terrible at actually selling it on the market. Identify the gaps and pull in teams to fill them.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/digital-workplace-trends-you-cant-ignore/">Digital Workplace Trends You Can’t Ignore</a></p>
 No. 5: Digital leaders build teams with high AQ 
<p>Intelligence quotient (IQ) and emotional quotient (EQ) are fairly well known, but fewer leaders measure the adversity quotient (AQ). AQ measures human resilience and the capacity to come back from being dealt a blow. High AQ lends itself to better employee retention that is critical for digital leadership, because the nature of digital transformation often disrupts the way people work by breaking rules and overturning old assumptions.</p>
<p>To increase their resilience in high-pressure situations, high-performance athletes are often coached to visualize the positive and the negative “What would it feel like to bite the gold?” But also, what are some of the things that could happen to throw me off my game? What if the lineup is broken up, or I get a splinter in my foot the day before? It’s envisioning all potential obstacles and “practicing how I might come back from those” that can help with resilience.</p>
<p>Build AQ by introducing a little bit of unexpectedness or coaching and exploring different challenges and changes. Give people tools to deal with obstacles so that they're not thrown off their game entirely when things don't happen exactly according to plan. This trait is more important than ever because resilience is what we need to sustain us through the long, chronic phase of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
 No. 6: Digital leaders never consider digital to be the outcome 
<p>Digital is just a tool, it is just a means to an end. Nobody digitalizes just to be digital, just as nobody transforms just to transform. Be sure to clearly define and articulate the reason for digitalizing. If you digitalize without that kind of extra-clear hard-edged goal, you can end up in bad places.</p>
<p>For example, lots of people don't like online grocery shopping because they like browsing the shelves or they find it annoying to have to click on every single item or they want to be surprised by something they hadn't thought of and impulse buy.</p>
<p>To protect against “doing digital” just for the sake of being digital, consider what you’re trying to optimize or what are the desired outcomes. Maybe you want to make more money or increase margins or improve transparency or make things more secure. Does digital help you get to your destination? Because digital is not a destination.</p>
 No. 7: Digital leaders geek out on technology and so do their people 
<p>This is an often-underrated trait. Digital leaders actually do need to know a lot about technology to be able to evaluate where the opportunities lie. This is especially important when understanding what AI or other technologies can offer you or the possible impacts on the organization. However, it's not just leaders who should embrace their inner geek, but also their people.</p>
<p>Consider asking employees what they do with their free time. Perhaps they are doing something cool with Raspberry Pi or maybe someone else regularly writes a technology blog on their own time, and they've never mentioned it in a corporate or a professional environment. This might surface interesting responses, especially for younger employees who may have more free time, that might be useful for digital initiatives.</p>

 The GiD Report#134 — DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid, SSI is “hot&nbsp;stuff” <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-133-for-big-tech-it-doesnt-matter-who-wins-the-election-unless-you-re-facebook-c5e8d2dda9cc">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got this&nbsp;week:</p>  DOJ challenges Visa/Plaid acquisition  Wired’s overview of Biden administration on&nbsp;tech  Privacy’s continued prominence from Prop 24 to Tim Berners-Lee  Digital identity’s billion-dollar valuation  Harvard: self-sovereign identity is “hot&nbsp;stuff”  Paul’s Convenient Decentralization Theory  Stuff happens   1. There’s been a large focus on Big Tech antitrust but the DOJ’s lawsuit challenging Visa’s planned acquisition of Plaid shows that antitrust sentiment applies universally. Photo: cottonbro (pexels)<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visa-s-planned-acquisition-of-plaid-11604591434?mod=hp_lead_pos4">the WSJ</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The department brought the case in a Northern California federal court, alleging the deal would eliminate the nascent but significant competitive threat that Plaid poses to Visa in the online debit market. The acquisition would allow Visa to unlawfully maintain a monopoly in online debit, leading to higher prices, less innovation and higher entry barriers for online debit services, the department alleged.</blockquote><blockquote>“If allowed to proceed, the acquisition would deprive American merchants and consumers of this innovative alternative to Visa,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the department’s antitrust chief.</blockquote><blockquote>“American consumers and business owners increasingly buy and sell goods and services online, and Visa — a monopolist in online debit service — has extracted billions of dollars from those transactions,” Mr. Delrahim&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>A Visa spokesman said the lawsuit is “legally flawed and contradicted by the facts…The combination of Visa and Plaid will deliver substantial benefits for consumers seeking access to a broader range of financial-related services, and Visa intends to defend the transaction vigorously.”</blockquote><p>Greg’s thoughts:</p><blockquote>The Justice Department is finally beginning to understand how the game is&nbsp;played.</blockquote><p>And here’s Dan&nbsp;Primack:</p><blockquote>Thought bubble: DOJ claims that Visa is already a “monopolist,” as evidenced by Mastercard’s alleged inability to capture more than 25% of the online debt services market. But it also argues that Plaid is poised to threaten Visa, thus raising some doubt as to how strong Visa’s stranglehold really is in the first&nbsp;place.</blockquote><blockquote>On the other hand: DOJ obtained communications from a top Visa executive who said that Plaid “threatens Visa” in terms of debut, analogizing it to an underwater volcano that has explosive potential despite being barely&nbsp;visible.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-files-antitrust-lawsuit-challenging-visa-s-planned-acquisition-of-plaid-11604591434?mod=hp_lead_pos4">Justice Department Files Antitrust Lawsuit Challenging Visa’s Planned Acquisition of&nbsp;Plaid</a>  Tim Wu: <a href="https://superwuster.medium.com/reviewing-ben-thompsons-stratechery-45b545dd959">Reviewing Ben Thompson’s Stratechery</a>   2. As we noted the other week, regardless of who wins the U.S presidential election, issues concerning antitrust, privacy, Section 230 reform, moderation/misinformation will remain top of mind for policymakers. <p>Wired has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-broke-internet-can-joe-biden-fix-it/">a good overview of what that will look like under a Biden administration</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>).</p><p>Here’s the scoring&nbsp;system:</p><blockquote>Because it’s been a long week, I’ve scored them from one Joe-Biden-eating-ice-cream (not happening) to five JBEICs (bank on&nbsp;it).</blockquote><p>On antitrust (5&nbsp;JBEICs):</p><blockquote>So whether we’ll see bold, aggressive, consequential antitrust enforcement and rulemaking against Big Tech during the Biden administration, or just modest, incremental, possibly-doomed-in-the-courts stuff, is still up in the air. What’s for sure is that we’ll see something. Antitrust gets five out of five&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Privacy law only gets 2 JBEICs given a divided government:</p><blockquote>On the other hand, it’s Congress, it’s a very complicated topic with a ton of money on the line, and it’s Mitch McConnell with a Democratic president, so we shouldn’t get our hopes up too high. But a federal privacy law next year is still a possibility. I give it two out of five&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Expect adjustments to Section 230 but not fundamental reform (3&nbsp;JBEICs):</p><blockquote>However, there’s another category of legislation concerning Section 230 that is much more viable. I think of these as Section 230 “hook” bills, because they try to hook Section 230 onto other legislative goals. The best example of this is the EARN IT Act, introduced by Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Republican Lindsey Graham. The law would force companies to “earn” their Section 230 protections by submitting to an elaborate regime meant to make sure they aren’t facilitating the spread of child sexual abuse materials. Other bills similarly would condition Section 230 immunity on some other set of criteria that may have little to do with the underlying point of law. So while fundamental reform is probably off the table, we could see edits to Section 230 at the margins. It gets three&nbsp;JBEICs.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-broke-internet-can-joe-biden-fix-it/">Trump Broke the Internet.

Even if Wired downplays the chances of national privacy legislation, privacy will continue to be a big focus for local governments, businesses, and most importantly, users. <p>Indeed, California successfully passed Proposition 24, which aimed to close some loopholes from California’s original 2018 privacy legislation.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-clear-message-voters-election-more-privacy/">Wired</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><blockquote>Companies have many ways of profiting from collecting and accessing our data. Few involve money directly exchanging hands in a sale. The law approved Tuesday targets the companies once able to evade regulation by claiming they “share” but don’t “sell” data. CPRA combines the concepts of sharing, selling, and monetizing data. It requires companies to disclose what they’re collecting from users and with whom they’re selling or sharing the data, and it requires them to allow users to opt out of having their data collected, whether or not it’s “sold” in the literal&nbsp;sense.</blockquote><blockquote>CPRA creates a new category of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI), including race, sexuality, religion, and health data. Businesses must disclose to users if they plan to collect, share, or sell SPI. Once informed, users can prevent companies from sharing SPI. It also allocates $10 million to a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the language of the 2018 law left the door open for companies to require users to opt out of tracking from each site they visit rather than end tracking with one swoop. CPRA allows users to employ a global opt-out, such as a Do Not Track tool, but also to allow tracking selectively.</blockquote><p>Privacy as a value proposition also continues to build momentum on the business side of things. Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee just signed on some huge clients for his latest privacy project including the BBC, the NHS, and NatWest&nbsp;Bank.</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/09/tim-berners-lee-attracts-nhs-bbc-natwest-to-inrupts-solid-platform.html">CNBC</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>):</p><blockquote>Inrupt, founded by Berners-Lee and CEO John Bruce in 2018, is aiming to develop technology that gives people control of their data, allowing them to choose where their data is stored and who has access to&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>The start-up announced Monday that it had launched an enterprise version of its Solid platform. Built with scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Solid allows users to create Personal Online Data Stores, or Pods, that they can then share with third party-apps if they&nbsp;wish.</blockquote><blockquote>Bruce <a href="https://inrupt.com/enterprise-server-release">wrote in a blog</a> that the NHS, for example, was using the platform to allow patients to store their personal medical data on Pods, as well as data from health apps on their phone or other&nbsp;devices.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s going to drive groundbreaking new opportunities that not only restore trust in data but also enhance our lives,” claimed Berners-Lee, who is Inrupt’s chief technology officer.</blockquote><p>We’ve talked about TBL’s project in the past and what really stands out is how spiritually aligned it is with the work we’re doing here at GlobaliD.

And digital identity will continue to gain prominence in the new Web. Now the market is starting to price in just how valuable that proposition is. <p>For instance, Stripe-backed Fast just notched a billion-dollar valuation. Here’s Fast CEO Domm Holland on digital identity:</p><blockquote>E-commerce was projected to be $5 or $6 trillion this year, and that was pre-COVID. And we all know that COVID has done nothing but amplify e-commerce. It grew by 30% quarter-over-quarter recently. So if we just won checkout, that’s already an incredibly large business. But really, there’s so much more value we can unlock with consumers and we definitely want to be providing more. I think that conviction spurs us on. But we’re never ever going to drive that value for consumers if we don’t execute on checkout first. For the time being, sure, we’re competing with fintechs. And it will always be a core part of our business. But if we become the identity network, you can’t quantify what that would be&nbsp;worth.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/fast-a-startup-backed-by-stripe-discusses-billion-dollar-valuation">Fast, a Startup Backed by Stripe, Discusses Billion-Dollar Valuation</a>  <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fast-checkout">Fast has a plan to reinvent online shopping.

Of course, the movement around self-sovereign identity takes that one step further. And according to Harvard, it’s “hot stuff”right now. <p>Here’s <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">the Harvard&nbsp;blog</a>:</p><blockquote>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is hot stuff. Look it up and see how many results you get. As of today, I get 627,000 on Google. By that measure alone, SSI is the biggest thing in the VRM development world. Nothing I know has more promise to give individuals leverage for dealing with the organizations of the world, especially in business.</blockquote><p>Also Harvard:</p><blockquote>The easiest tool to imagine is a wallet, or a wallet app (here’s one) with some kind of dashboard.</blockquote><p>It’s understandable then why Civic is <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">phasing out it’s identity app and merging it into its wallet</a>. (Which further validates GlobaliD’s current&nbsp;path.)</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-secure-identity-is-now-civic-wallet/">Civic Secure Identity Users: Say Hello to Civic&nbsp;Wallet</a>  Harvard blog — <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2020/11/02/ssi-2/">What SSI&nbsp;needs</a>   6. Speaking of decentralized identity, Paul wrote a neat piece on what he calls The Convenient Decentralization Theory. <p>Here’s <a href="https://pstav.medium.com/the-convenient-decentralization-theory-aece8ef2f31c">Paul</a>:</p><blockquote>In todays world, money, data, and identity largely live in a federated world, meaning that certain powers hold the vast majority of this information in silos. But just as the movement from “harvested ice” and “plant ice” in the early 1900s to refrigerators in the 1930s brought on unimaginable benefits and autonomy to people and businesses, so too I’d say the convenient decentralization theory&nbsp;applies.</blockquote><blockquote>The bitcoin movement, which has been taking off long before COVID, is moreso in the spotlight due to monetary policy concerns exacerbated by the epidemic. It’s brought to light just how easy it one day could be to create protocols for decentralized solutions and allow people to be more autonomous with their money and&nbsp;value.</blockquote><blockquote>The same ethos and technologies that apply to the bitcoin movement can apply to the data we generate online and the way we hold our digital identities. In short, web 3.0 and the ethos it brings will usher in a world where online trust will be re-imagined through decentralized online identities, the way our data is stored and monetized will be decentralized and yield direct payments to individuals, and the way we exchange and create value will be significantly easier than it is today (especially for the underbanked). Can you imagine the goodness that will come out of these movements? We’ve just but scratched the&nbsp;surface.</blockquote><p>Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a>— <a href="https://pstav.medium.com/the-convenient-decentralization-theory-aece8ef2f31c">The Convenient Decentralization Theory</a></p> 7.

<p>Back in March 2019 Ubisecure’s Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) service, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a>, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/profileaddress-legal-entity-identifier/">announced a partnership</a> with Austria-based data marketing specialist, ProfileAddress. Under its ‘<a href="https://www.register-lei.com/">Register-LEI</a>‘ brand, ProfileAddress joined RapidLEI’s Registration Agent (RA) programme as an RA for Austria, Germany and the UK. From 2020, Register-LEI’s services have been offered in additional markets, and it has become a global RA.</p>
<p>I caught up with CEO Michael Fux to discuss the current state of the LEI world and his vision for the future of Register-LEI.</p>
 Francesca: Let’s start at the beginning. Why did ProfileAddress decide to get started offering LEIs to its customers? 
<p></p>
<p>Michael: In 2017, a friend of mine who was working with a private bank in Liechtenstein mentioned problems with the registration of an LEI for his private wealth clients. We then set out to solve these problems. At first we applied to the GLEIF [Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation] as an LOU [Local Operating Unit], but quickly realised the advantages of working with RapidLEI as our LOU instead and focused on our quality of service and customer support as a RapidLEI Registration Agent.</p>
 F: And of course I have to ask, why did you choose – and continue to choose – RapidLEI as your LOU? 
<p>M: The choice was and is easy to make. Register-LEI stands for high-quality service based on state-of-the-art technical implementations. RapidLEI offers exactly that. Further, we aim to offer our customers excellent support and can ourselves rely on the support of the RapidLEI team. Finally, we both continually look for improvement to all services to ensure the highest standards of customer care.</p>
 F: What impact do you think the current global situation has had on LEIs? 
<p>M: In some countries, including Austria, you can benefit from tax advantages by investing in securities. However, this is subject to a positive annual result, which may be a problem in times of crisis. In those countries the rate of newly issued LEIs may drop. On the other hand, fresh money is being pumped into the economy to support it, which can lead to devaluation and inflation. This effect can be compensated for by buying stocks, and for that we need the LEI system and safe trading.</p>
 F: Do you foresee any trends for LEIs looking into 2021 and beyond? 
<p>M: The number of registered LEIs will generally grow. The rate of increase will depend on the situation in the individual market. However, the focus should also be on ensuring lapsed LEIs are renewed, so that organisations do not find themselves unable to trade at critical times [due to an invalid LEI and relevant regulations].</p>
 F: What’s next for Register-LEI? 
<p>M: Right now we are teaming up with KSV1870 (“Kreditschutzverband est. 1870”, one of Austria’s leading economic platforms with innovative, digital solutions) with the aim to become market leaders in Austria next year. At the same time, we are increasing our efforts in international English-speaking jurisdictions, financial centers and tax havens. Finally, Register-LEI offers LEI registration as well as managed services, outsourced or insourced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>LEIs are available at <a href="https://www.register-lei.com/">www.register-lei.com</a>. Further regional sites can be found on Register-LEI’s profile page at RapidLEI: <a href="https://rapidlei.com/partners/5299004d4y4yvhdncf96/">rapidlei.com/partners/5299004d4y4yvhdncf96/</a></p>

  <p>When COVID-19 changed how the world did business, organizations shifted into survival mode and pushed for a focus on digital products. As businesses <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-digital-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming-in-the-next-5-years/">shifted tactics</a>, customers made it clear that not only did they like the shift to digital, they’d prefer to stay there for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seventy-six percent of CIOs reported increased demand for new<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/"> digital products</a> and services as a result of COVID-19 and 83% expect that to increase further in 2021, according to the Gartner CIO Agenda 2021. Along the same line, 65% of CIOs saw an increase in the use of self-service by customers/citizens, and 79% expect that usage to grow in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is especially true among top-performing organizations, with nine out of 10 pursuing <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/digital-workplace-trends-you-cant-ignore/">digital channels</a> and nearly 75% introducing new digital products faster. And it seems to be working. Organizations that increased their use of digital channels to reach customers or citizens are 3.5 times more likely to be top performers than trailing ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These changes allow organizations to maintain and develop deeper relationships with established customers at a time when new customers are tough to find. More digital products and services or self-service avenues encourage established customers to spend more, despite a lack of in-person touchpoints. These digital avenues will also enable organizations to extend sales and service hours without requiring more staff.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>COVID-19 might dominate the headlines, but it’s just one of eight key macro factors that will reshape business in this decade. The global pandemic will have long-lasting and far-reaching impact on the business world, but other shifts in macrobusiness environment areas — such as systematic mistrust, weakening international relationships and climate change — have not gone away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">Executives </a>will have to grapple with a host of other challenges during the 2020s, but from that maelstrom will rise new business opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time when economies were already on the edge,” said<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594/Mark-Raskino"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, during his presentation at virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/symposium-spain">Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo® 2020</a>. “A decade-long boom, generated substantially from inexpensive finance and lower-cost energy, led to structural stresses such as highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 No. 1: Global pandemic&nbsp; 
<p>The impact of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">COVID-19 </a>will depend heavily on how long the pandemic lasts. A shorter time frame means that people will revert more quickly to pre-pandemic ways of operating. For example, after 9/11, people reverted to normal flying behavior three years later. If the pandemic persists, it’s more likely to have long-lasting societal effects. For example, the Great Depression impacted food habits for decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about how the pandemic will affect societal behaviors like personal hygiene and personal space norms, social gatherings and family interactions, the savings ratio and consumer buying habits.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 2: Market crash and recession&nbsp; 
<p>Although COVID-19 served as the visible catalyst for the 2020 market crashes and subsequent recovery, the reality is that the markets were already fragile and precarious. In fact, Gartner found that in 2018 and 2019, half of CEOs were anticipating and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-this-3-phase-framework-to-navigate-the-covid-19-downturn/">preparing for an economic downturn</a>, which makes this recession unique to those in 2002–2003 and 2009. However, no one anticipated the deep damage caused by COVID-19, with a crash followed by persistent volatility.</p>
<p>Look to exploit remote work and e-commerce for better infrastructure and target requisitions to accelerate the digital business journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Systemic mistrust&nbsp; 
<p>Even before COVID-19, global consumer and citizen trust was at an all-time low. Now, closed borders, fights for vaccines, and arguments over masks and rules, combined with a mistrust of “other”— even previously close trading partners — threaten to widen the gap. However, it’s possible that over the long term, a common enemy in the virus will inspire empathy, common purpose and cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, executives should consider whether consumers will continue to be loyal to long-standing brands or shift to those that have supplies of limited goods. CEOs had to make difficult decisions in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Evaluate whether those actions irrevocably shifted attitudes toward the brand. A more personal connection — such as an open, authentic and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">empathetic email to customers</a> — might help overcome distrust.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Weak productivity&nbsp; 
<p>Slow productivity growth and a lack of focus on efficiency and productivity has been at odds with the economic growth of the past decade. COVID-19 further reduced productivity by complicating business operations. The cost of operating in a socially distanced world is increasing costs, requiring significant reengineering to return to pre-COVID productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set bold goals for productivity that necessitate reinvention.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 5: Environment concerns&nbsp; 
<p>At the very start of 2020, climate change was moving to the forefront of framing long-term business strategy and plans. Although temporarily overshadowed by COVID-19, half of CEOs still see climate change as a factor impacting their industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by temporary environmental wins caused by lockdowns and reduced travel, although you can look to these outcomes for inspiration on how to adjust work permanently. Keep in mind that major infrastructure projects designed to mitigate climate change could be delayed in some geographies by a redirection of funding to stimulus packages, requiring alternative carbon reducing strategies to be invented.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: Talent shortage&nbsp; 
<p>Despite an increase in unemployment rates globally, key talent shortages will continue to plague executives. While COVID-19 has increased unemployment and underemployment, it has not created <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">new pools of in-demand talent</a>. Even small shortfalls of critical talent will corrode or destroy market positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reconsider what types of skill sets will be needed in the post-COVID-19 world, and begin or increase reskilling programs during downtimes. Introduce agile learning as a core management philosophy and consider ways to widen the talent availability pool by rethinking remote work or gig economy options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-the-workforce-you-need-post-covid-19/">Build the Workforce You Need Post-COVID-19</a></p>
 No. 7: Technology advancement 
<p>Technology advancement will, of course, have a large effect in the coming decade. AI, blockchain, quantum computing and the mass arrival of machine customers will change how organizations and societies operate. There will be more frequent market disruptions and the emergence of what comes after digital: Autonomous business. This will change the landscape of the decade.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>ForgeRockers are a passionate and powerful crew! We showed what we can do to make a difference in our communities during our recent Global Action Week where we took time out of our regular schedules to give back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Employees across the globe put on their masks and ventured out into their communities to clean up parks and schools, feed the hungry, mentor, volunteer at animal sanctuaries, advocate for STEM programs in schools, or support the elderly. The pandemic meant a course correction for some of our ideas, but together we logged more than 200 volunteer hours service worldwide over the course of five days.&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRockers Give Back&nbsp; 

<p>“While this year has been a tough one for everyone, we recognized that it was more important to our employees than ever to give back to the communities, organizations and initiatives that meant the most to them. I am extremely proud of the CSR team’s ability to react to the changing environment and still host a dynamic and rewarding Global Action Week that has empowered so many ForgeRock employees to take action and make a difference.” - Ben Hutchings, CSR Lead &amp; People Program Manager</p>

<p>"I hiked about 42km in the Lake District over three days carrying everything we needed for the trip in our backpacks. During the hike I used the app Charity Miles to raise over $500 for a global organization called Girl Up. I chose Girl Up, as they are a movement to advance girls' skills, rights, and opportunities to be leaders. As someone who identifies as female within both the STEM industry, and hiking community - both areas where female representation is the minority - this is an important cause I feel particularly close with.” - Becky Maund, Senior Support Engineer</p>

<p>“I spent the day volunteering at Odd Man Inn Animal Refuge in Washougal, WA. They are a nonprofit farm sanctuary, adoption shelter, and wildlife rehab center. Odd Man Inn has a special place in my heart for taking in abused animals that have no other place to go. I had the pleasure of making sure all of the animals were happy, healthy, comfortable, and felt safe and right at home by cleaning their living quarters, passing out meals, and providing pets with the love and pampering they deserve.” - Krismy Botkin, Software Engineer</p>

<p>“I took a two man canoe down to the Bristol Harbour and taped some bin bags to the front seat of my canoe, and with the power of oars and a small net I paddled across the harbour cleaning rubbish from the water. Being in the center of the city, it can often fall prey to people mistaking the river for a garbage bin. This is a shame because there is actually a lot of wildlife on and under the water. By the end, I was tired but extremely satisfied with the amount of refuse I had collected. It's something I'd definitely do again.” - George Knight, HR Technology &amp; Data Manager</p>

<p>“A few coworkers and I spent the morning cleaning up Dolores Park in San Francisco. Many San Francisco residents don’t have yards or gardens, so public parks become our refuge when we want to (safely) get some fresh air. A lot of work goes into maintaining these spaces, and I felt that it was important to give back to the place that has helped my mental and physical health during this time.” - Greta Sohn, Content Marketing Manager</p>

 ForgeRock Learns 

<p>In addition to actively giving back to their communities, ForgeRockers also participated in a speaker series. Throughout the week, we hosted four virtual discussions. We learned about busting the mental health stigma from Tara Robinson from <a href="https://changesbristol.org.uk/">Changes Bristol</a>. We also spoke with <a href="https://www.tiffanydawson.co/">Tiffany Dawson</a> about how to promote gender equality in STEM. Felisia Castaneda from <a href="https://www.recology.com/recology-san-francisco/">Recology San Francisco</a> taught us how we can all make small changes that impact the environment. And we closed out the week with a powerful discussion about racism and DE&amp;I with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinwithane/">Kevin Withane</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 550 Hours Dedicated&nbsp; 

<p>By the end of the week, we had spent more than 200 hours volunteering and more than 300 combined hours learning. Global Action Week is a terrific extension of our purpose as a company to help people access the connected world - safely and simply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m so proud of our collective efforts and can’t wait to see what we accomplish next year!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I collaborated on this post with <a href="https://twitter.com/marcushellberg">Marcus Hellberg</a>, Head of Community at Vaadin. Marcus and I met years ago on the conference circuit, and we’re both from Finland. My great grandparents were Finnish and built the sauna and cabin I grew up in in Montana’s remote woods. Marcus and I share a passion for using Java and web technologies to build fast, efficient applications.</p>
 
 
<p>You might notice we keep saying "Vaadin Fusion" instead of "Vaadin." I’ve always thought Vaadin was a web framework based on Google’s GWT (Google Web Toolkit). I asked Marcus about this, and he explained to me there are now two products—Vaadin Flow and Vaadin Fusion.</p>
 
 
<p>The classic Vaadin server-side Java API is now called Vaadin Flow. Vaadin Fusion is a new TypeScript frontend framework designed for Java backends. Both offer full-stack type safety and use the same set of UI components. Vaadin is no longer based on GWT. Instead, its components use web component standards.</p>

 What Is Vaadin Fusion? 
 
 
<p><a href="https://vaadin.com/">Vaadin Fusion</a> is an open-source, front-end framework designed specifically for Java backends. Fusion gives you type-safe access to your backend from your client app by auto-generating TypeScript interfaces for your server Java objects. It wraps REST calls in async TypeScript methods, so you can access your backend as easily as calling any TypeScript function.</p>
 
 
<p>End-to-end type checking means you catch any breaking changes at build time, not in production. Oh, and there’s auto-complete everywhere, so you can focus on coding, not reading API docs.</p>
 
 
<p>Views are written in TypeScript with LitElement, a lightweight, reactive component library.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Spring Boot-based Vaadin Fusion Application 
 
 
<p>Begin by creating a new Vaadin Fusion app with the <a href="https://start.vaadin.com/">Vaadin starter wizard</a>. It allows you to configure views, tech stack, and theme before downloading an app starter.</p>
 
 
<p>Rename the About view to "People" and change its URL to "people":</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Go into the application settings and change the name to <code>Vaadin Okta</code>. Then, select TypeScript + HTML for the UI stack to get a Fusion project.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>Click Download, and you’ll get a zip file containing a Maven project.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the project in your IDE.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The two important folders in the project are:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>/frontend</code> - This folder contains all the frontend code</p>
 
 
<p><code>/src/main/java</code> - This folder includes all the backend code, which is a Spring Boot app</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Start the application with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The launcher should open up the app in your default browser. If not, navigate to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Secure Your Spring Boot Backend Services 
 
 
<p>Vaadin Fusion uses type-safe endpoints for server access. You create an endpoint by annotating a class with <code>@Endpoint</code>. This will export all the methods in the class and make them callable from TypeScript. Vaadin will also generate TypeScript interfaces for any data types the methods use.</p>
 
 
<p>Vaadin endpoints require authentication by default. You can explicitly make an endpoint class or a single method accessible to unauthenticated users by adding an <code>@AnonymousAllowed</code> annotation.</p>
 
 
<p>In this app, you want to restrict access to only authenticated users. You’ll use OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Okta to make this possible.</p>
 
 
 Add the Okta Spring Boot Starter 
 
<p>Add the Okta Spring Boot starter and Lombok dependencies to the <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> section of your <code>pom.xml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.4.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;

&lt;!-- Only for convenience, not required for using Vaadin or Okta --&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make sure your IDE imports the dependencies, or re-run <code>mvn</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 Register an OpenID Connect Application 
 
<p>Create a free Okta developer account on <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com</a> if you don’t already have one.</p>
 
 
<p>Once logged in, go to Applications &gt; Add Application and select Single-Page App.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Configure the app settings and click Done to create the app:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
<p>Name: Vaadin Fusion</p>
 
 
<p>Base URIs: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code></p>
 
 
<p>Login redirect URIs: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080/callback">http://localhost:8080/callback</a></code></p>
 
 
<p>Logout redirect URIs: <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code></p>
 
 
<p>Grant type allowed: Authorization Code</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Store the issuer in <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> by adding the following property:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Configure Spring Security 
 
<p>Vaadin integrates with Spring Security to handle authorization. Instead of restricting access to specific routes as you would with Spring REST controllers, you need permit all traffic to <code>/**</code> so Vaadin can handle security.</p>
 
 
<p>Vaadin is configured to:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Serve <code>index.html</code> for the root path and any unmatched server route</p>
 
 
<p>Serve static assets</p>
 
 
<p>Handle authorization and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection in server endpoints</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>By default, all server endpoints require an authenticated user. You can allow anonymous access to an endpoint or a method by adding an <code>@AnonymousAllowed</code> annotation. You can further restrict access by adding <code>@RolesAllowed</code> to an endpoint or a method.</p>
 
 






The security configuration below assumes you are only serving a Vaadin Fusion application. Suppose you are also serving Spring REST controllers or other non-Vaadin resources. In that case, you need to configure their access control separately, for instance, adding <code>antMatchers("/api/**").authenticated()</code> if you serve REST APIs under <code>/api</code>.



 
 
<p>Create a new class <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> in the same package as <code>Application.java</code> with the following contents:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.application;

import com.okta.spring.boot.oauth.Okta;

import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.WebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
        // @formatter:off
        web.ignoring()
          .antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, "/**")
          .antMatchers("/**/*.{js,html,css,webmanifest}");
        // @formatter:on
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        // @formatter:off
        // Vaadin handles CSRF for its endpoints

        http.csrf().ignoringAntMatchers("/connect/**")
            .and()
            .authorizeRequests()
            // allow access to everything, Vaadin will handle security
            .antMatchers("/**").permitAll()
            .and()
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        // @formatter:on

        Okta.configureResourceServer401ResponseBody(http);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Vaadin Endpoint for Accessing Data 
 
<p>Now that you have the server set up for authenticating requests add a service you can call from the client app.</p>
 
 
<p>First, create a <code>Person.java</code> class to use as the data model in the <code>com.example.application.views.people</code> package.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.application.views.people;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you aren’t using Lombok, omit the annotations and add a constructor that takes in <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>, and create getters and setters for both.</p>
 
 






If you’re doing this tutorial in an IDE, you may need to enable annotation processing so Lombok can generate code for you. See Lombok’s instructions { <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij">IntelliJ IDEA</a> } for more information.



 
 
<p>Open <code>PeopleEndpoint.java</code> and replace the contents with the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.application.views.people;

import com.vaadin.flow.server.connect.Endpoint;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@Endpoint
public class PeopleEndpoint {

    // We'll use a simple list to hold data
    private List&lt;Person&gt; people = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    public PeopleEndpoint() {
        // Add one person so we can see that everything works
        people.add(new Person("Jane", "Doe"));
    }

    public List&lt;Person&gt; getPeople() {
        return people;
    }

    public Person adEclipsedPerson(Person person) {
        people.add(person);
        return person;
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Vaadin will make the <code>getPeople()</code> and <code>addPerson()</code> methods available as asynchronous TypeScript methods. It will also generate a TypeScript interface for <code>Person</code>, so you can access the same type-information of both on the server and in the client.</p>
 
 
 
 Call the Spring Boot Endpoint from Vaadin Fusion 
 
<p>Create a view that uses the server API. Open <code>frontend/views/people/people-view.ts</code> and replace its code with the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import {
  LitElement,
  html,
  css,
  customElement,
  internalProperty,
} from 'lit-element';
import Person from '../../generated/com/example/application/views/people/Person';

import '@vaadin/vaadin-text-field';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-button';
import { Binder, field } from '@vaadin/form';
import PersonModel from '../../generated/com/example/application/views/people/PersonModel';
import { addPerson, getPeople } from '../../generated/PeopleEndpoint';

@customElement('people-view')
export class PeopleView extends LitElement {
  @internalProperty()
  private people: Person[] = [];
  @internalProperty()
  private message = '';

  // Manages form state, binds inputs to the model
  private binder = new Binder(this, PersonModel);

  render() {
    const { model } = this.binder;

    return html`
     &lt;h1&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;

     &lt;div class="message"&gt;${this.message}&lt;/div&gt;

     &lt;ul&gt;
       ${this.people.map(
      (person) =&gt; html`&lt;li&gt;${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}&lt;/li&gt;`
    )}
     &lt;/ul&gt;

     &lt;h2&gt;Add new person&lt;/h2&gt;
     &lt;div class="form"&gt;
       &lt;vaadin-text-field
         label="First Name"
         ...=${field(model.firstName)}
       &gt;&lt;/vaadin-text-field&gt;
       &lt;vaadin-text-field
         label="Last Name"
         ...=${field(model.lastName)}
       &gt;&lt;/vaadin-text-field&gt;
       &lt;vaadin-button @click=${this.add}&gt;Add&lt;/vaadin-button&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
   `;
  }

  async connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    try {
      this.people = await getPeople();
    } catch (e) {
      this.message = `Failed to get people: ${e.message}.`;
    }
  }

  async add() {
    try {
      const saved = await this.binder.submitTo(addPerson);
      if (saved) {
        this.people = [...this.people, saved];
        this.binder.clear();
      }
    } catch (e) {
      this.message = `Failed to save: ${e.message}.`;
    }
  }

  static styles = css`
   :host {
     display: block;
     padding: var(--lumo-space-m) var(--lumo-space-l);
   }
 `;
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Here’s what this code does:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Defines two internal properties: <code>people</code> and <code>message</code> to hold the component’s state. Any time a property changes, the template will get re-rendered efficiently.</p>
 
 
<p>Initialized a <code>Binder</code> for handling the new-person form. It keeps track of the model value, handles validations, and submits the value to the endpoint.</p>
 
 
<p>The template:</p>
 
 
 
<p>Lists all people in an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>)</p>
 
 
<p>Displays a form for adding new people. The form uses two Vaadin components: <code>vaadin-text-field</code> and <code>vaadin-button</code>. The fields are bound to the Binder with the help of a spread operator (<code>…​=${field(…​)}</code>). You can read more about forms in the <a href="https://vaadin.com/docs/v17/flow/client-side-forms/tutorial-binder.html">Vaadin documentation</a></p>
 
 
<p>The Add button calls the <code>add()</code> method, which submits the form to the backend and adds the saved <code>Person</code> to the people array.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>If any of the server calls fail, <code>message</code> gets populated to inform the user.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Start Your Vaadin + Spring Boot App 
 
<p>Start the application with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should now be able to launch the application and see the views. However, if you try to access the People page, you’ll get an error because you aren’t authenticated.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You need to add a login view and authenticate the user before calling any of the secure endpoints.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Add a Vaadin Login Page and Restrict Access to Views 
 
 
<p>You are going to use a custom login screen and Okta Auth JS to authenticate users. You will do this in three steps:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a service for handling everything auth related</p>
 
 
<p>Create a login view</p>
 
 
<p>Restrict view access to logged-in users and redirect unauthenticated users to the login view</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create an Auth Service for Authentication 
 
<p>Begin by installing the Okta Auth JS library with npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@4.0.3</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create a new file, <code>auth.ts</code>, in the <code>frontend</code> folder. This is where all the authentication magic happens.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import { AccessToken, OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const authClient = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktadomain}/oauth2/default', // use your own
  clientId: '{frontend app client id}', // use your own
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback',
  pkce: true
});

const isAuthenticated = async () =&gt; {
  // Checks if there is a current accessToken in the TokenManger.
  return !!(await authClient.tokenManager.get('accessToken'));
};

const signIn = async (username: string, password: string) =&gt; {
  const authResult = await authClient.signIn({
    username,
    password,
    scopes: ['openid', 'email', 'profile'],
  });

  if (authResult.status === 'SUCCESS') {
    authClient.token.getWithRedirect({
      sessionToken: authResult.sessionToken,
      responseType: 'id_token',
    });
  }
};

const signOut = () =&gt; authClient.signOut();

const handleAuthentication = async () =&gt; {
  if (authClient.token.isLoginRedirect()) {
    try {
      const tokenResponse = await authClient.token.parseFromUrl();
      const {accessToken, idToken} = tokenResponse.tokens;
      if (!accessToken || !idToken) return false;

      authClient.tokenManager.add('accessToken', accessToken);
      authClient.tokenManager.add('idToken', idToken);
      return true;
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`authClient.token.parseFromUrl() errored: ${err}`);
      return false;
    }
  }
  return false;
};

const getAccessToken = async () =&gt; {
  const token = (await authClient.tokenManager.get(
    'accessToken'
  )) as AccessToken;

  return token;
};

export {
  isAuthenticated,
  signIn,
  signOut,
  handleAuthentication,
  getAccessToken,
};</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Here’s what <code>auth.ts</code> does:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>It creates an internal instance of <code>AuthClient</code> configured with your info</p>
 
 
<p>It exports the following methods:</p>
 
 
 
<p><code>isAuthenticated</code> returns a boolean indicating whether or not the user is authenticated</p>
 
 
<p><code>signIn</code> takes a username and password and asks the client to authenticate. The client will redirect to the redirect URI</p>
 
 
<p><code>handleAuthentication</code> reads the response from the redirect and saves the returned tokens</p>
 
 
<p><code>getAccessToken</code> returns the access token for use with server calls</p>
 
 
<p><code>signOut</code> signs out the user</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Login View 
 
<p>Next, create a login view so users can enter their credentials and get authenticated.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new folder <code>frontend/views/login</code>. In that folder, create a new file <code>login-view.ts</code> with the following content:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>import { customElement, html, internalProperty, LitElement } from 'lit-element';
import { signIn } from '../../auth';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-login/vaadin-login-form';

@customElement('login-view') (1)
export class LoginView extends LitElement {
  @internalProperty()
  private error = !!new URLSearchParams().get('error');

  render() {
    return html`
     &lt;style&gt;
       login-view {
         display: flex;
         flex-direction: column;
         height: 100%;
         align-items: center;
         justify-content: center;
       }
     &lt;/style&gt;
     &lt;vaadin-login-form (2)
       @login=${this.login} (3)
       ?error=${this.error}
       no-forgot-password
     &gt;&lt;/vaadin-login-form&gt;
   `;
  }

  async login(e: CustomEvent) { (4)
    try {
      await signIn(e.detail.username, e.detail.password);
    } catch (e) {
      this.error = true;
    }
  }

  // Render in light DOM for password managers
  protected createRenderRoot() {
    return this;
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The view uses LitElement to define a new component, <code>&lt;login-view&gt;</code>.


2
Use the <code>&lt;vaadin-login-form&gt;</code> element for capturing login information.


3
The <code>login-event</code> is bound to the login method with <code>@login=${this.login}</code>.


4
The <code>login()</code> method calls the <code>signIn()</code> function in the <code>auth</code> service, which in turn will redirect the user to the callback URL.


 
 
 
 
 
 Restrict View Access to Authenticated Users 
 
<p>The final piece of the puzzle is to add an authentication guard that only allows logged-in users to access the views. Any unauthenticated users should be redirected to the login page first. You also need to define logic for capturing the callback from Okta and logging out users.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>frontend/index.ts</code> and replace its contents with the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import { Commands, Context, Route, Router } from '@vaadin/router';

import './views/main/main-view';
import './views/login/login-view';
import './views/helloworld/hello-world-view';
import { handleAuthentication, isAuthenticated, signOut } from './auth';

const authGuard = async (context: Context, commands: Commands) =&gt; {
  if (!(await isAuthenticated())) {
    // Save requested path
    sessionStorage.setItem('login-redirect-path', context.pathname);
    return commands.redirect('/login');
  }
  return undefined;
};

const routes: Route[] = [
  { path: '/login', component: 'login-view' },
  {
    path: '/callback',
    action: async (_: Context, commands: Commands) =&gt; {
      if (await handleAuthentication()) {
        return commands.redirect(
          sessionStorage.getItem('login-redirect-path') || '/'
        );
      } else {
        return commands.redirect('/login?error');
      }
    },
  },
  {
    path: '/logout',
    action: async (_: Context, commands: Commands) =&gt; {
      signOut();
      location.reload();
      return commands.prevent();
    },
  },
  {
    path: '',
    component: 'main-view',
    action: authGuard, // Require a logged in user to access
    children: [
      { path: '', component: 'hello-world-view' },
      { path: 'hello', component: 'hello-world-view' },
      {
        path: 'people',
        component: 'people-view',
        action: async () =&gt; {
          await import('./views/people/people-view');
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];

export const router = new Router(document.querySelector('#outlet'));
router.setRoutes(routes);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Here’s what this code does:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>authGuard</code> is a Vaadin Router action that uses the auth service to check if a user is authenticated. If not, it will save the requested path and redirect to the login view</p>
 
 
<p>In the router configuration, you added three routes:</p>
 
 
 
<p><code>login</code> maps to the login view component you created in the previous step</p>
 
 
<p><code>callback</code> handles the return value from Okta. If the authentication was successful, it will navigate to the path the user requested before being redirected to the login page</p>
 
 
<p><code>logout</code> signs out the user from the Okta Auth JS client and then destroys the Spring Security context by calling <code>/logout</code> on the server</p>
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Adds the <code>authGuard</code> to <code>main-view</code> with <code>action: authGuard</code></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Consume the Secure Endpoint from the Client 
 
 
<p>One last thing we need to take care of before we can access the backend is to include the access token JWT with server requests. We can do this with a middleware.</p>
 
 
 Create a Middleware to Add the Access Token JWT to Server Requests 
 
<p>Create a new file, <code>connect-client.ts</code> in the <code>frontend</code> folder with the following content:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import {
  ConnectClient,
  MiddlewareContext,
  MiddlewareNext,
} from '@vaadin/flow-frontend/Connect';
import { getAccessToken } from './auth';

const client = new ConnectClient({
  prefix: 'connect',
  middlewares: [
    async function addAuthHeaderMiddleware(
      context: MiddlewareContext,
      next: MiddlewareNext
    ) {
      const token = await getAccessToken();
      if (token) {
        context.request.headers.set(
          'Authorization',
          `Bearer ${token.accessToken}`
        );
      }
      return next(context);
    },
  ],
});

export default client;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The middleware uses the <code>auth</code> service to get the access token and adds it to the outgoing request headers.</p>
 
 
 
 Call the Secure Endpoint Methods 
 
<p>You are now ready to use the application. Run the application with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Once the application is up, go to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code>, log in with the user you created.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Once you are logged in, you should be able to view and add people through the secure server endpoint.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Add a Logout Link 
 
<p>Finally, add a logout link so users can sign out when they’re done.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>main-view.ts</code> and add a link at the end of the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section of the template, just after the Avatar image:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;header slot="navbar" theme="dark"&gt;
  &lt;vaadin-drawer-toggle&gt;&lt;/vaadin-drawer-toggle&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;${this.getSelectedTabName(this.menuTabs)}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/user.svg" alt="Avatar" /&gt;
  &lt;a href="logout" class="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add a margin to the link so that it doesn’t touch the edge of the screen in the styles section of <code>main-view.ts</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
header h1 {
  font-size: var(--lumo-font-size-l);
  margin: 0;
}

header .logout {
  margin-right: 12px;
}
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After making these changes, you should see a Log out link in the top right corner.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Now you should be able to log in, add people, and log out. Huzzah! 😃</p>

They <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">wrote about the ongoing work</a> enabling public sector organizations to give citizens verifiable attributes they keep in their own data stores and can prove to other parties without the issuing organization in the middle.</p> MyData Rocks&nbsp; <p>Some how the MyData Community got a leaked version of EU Data Governance Act. They wrote <a href="https://mydata.org/2020/11/06/towards-interconnected-and-human-centric-data-intermediaries/">a very detailed response</a><a href="https://mydata.org/2020/11/06/towards-interconnected-and-human-centric-data-intermediaries/"> </a>to the law, as it is written now, pushing for needed changes to make it really work for a personal data ecosystem where people are empowered with their data.&nbsp;</p> Self Sovereign Identity Critique, Critique.&nbsp; <p>You are in for a treat this week Kaliya <a href="https://identitywoman.net/self-sovereigh-identity-critique-critique/">takes on one of SSI’s loudest critics</a> who makes broad sweeping generalizations without actually getting down to what the technology actually does and accuses our community of “moving fast” and “breaking things” when I would argue we are moving slow and fixing things while creating new creative generative possibilities. As a bonus he decided to say <a href="https://twitter.com/Sheldrake/status/1324732000633262081">on twitter</a> Kaliya’s expertise was narrow, so she decided to <a href="https://identitywoman.net/interdisciplinary-expertise-for-self-sovereign-identity/">share some of her background</a> to clear up any confusion.&nbsp;</p> Decentralized-ID.com Updates! <p><a href="https://twitter.com/infominer33">Infominer</a> has been working on curating has some great pages covering companies in the industry. Here are the ones he made this week.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/mattr/">MATTR</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/jolocom/">Jolocom</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/meeco/">Meeco</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/blockchain/3box/">3Box</a>&nbsp; • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/transmute/">Transmute</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/spherity/">Spherity</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/evernym/">Evernym</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/companies/factom/">Factom</a> • <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/government/usa/dhs/">DHS-SVIP</a></p><p>Think of this as a potential wikipedia of curated lists surrounding decentralized identity.

He’s using the Twitter Api to query relevant keywords, and then sorting through the results to filter through finding only relevant content, and the result is a new weekly curated collection that began last week.</p>  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1322785746915307520">October Week 5 #SSI #DID</a></p>  <p><a href="https://twitter.com/DecentralizeID/timelines/1325219075463712769">Week 1 November #SSI #DID</a></p>   DIDs Fabric and Decentralized Networking <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/11/05/deon-a-hyperledger-based-decentralized-off-grid-network">DEON</a> is a new Hyperledger project focused in off-line communication networks, independent of internet infrastructure. This could be used to enable networks of devices to communicate peer-to-peer (without the need to ‘phone home’ over the internet), inter-enterprise consortia networks, and enabling user-centric data sharing in a more secure and private fashion.</p> Decentralized identity: The key to the digital era? <p>This post was published as a Sponsored Post <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/28/decentralized-identity-the-key-to-the-digital-era/">in Venture Beat</a>.</p><p>They quote <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/New+Tech+Decentralized+Digital+Identity+DDID+Q1+2020/-/E-RES147115">Forrester</a> “Today’s digital identity frameworks are centralized, suffer from a lack of trust, aren’t portable, and don’t give consumers control.”</p><p>They touch on a new acronym saying : enterprise-level thinking around next-generation authentication is focused on initiatives such as <a href="https://spiffe.io/">SPIFFE</a>, the Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone</p> Trinsic Introduces Interactive Connections in their Wallet &amp; Platform <p><a href="https://trinsic.id/interactive-connections/">See the post here</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Current digital wallet implementations fall short of the vision of self-sovereign identity (SSI) because they only allow wallet holders to respond to, not initiate, interactions with institutions. This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information [using DIDComm V1].</p></blockquote> Indicio is a finalist for the DHS Digital Wallets User Interface Challenge.&nbsp; <blockquote><p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-is-a-finalist-for-dhs-digital-wallets-user-interface-challenge/">goal of the DHS Challenge</a> is to design a user interface (UI) so that the process of using a wallet to access and perform these functions is clear, intuitive, consistent, and efficient.</p></blockquote><p>This contest was announced in September and had a very tight turnaround.

<p>At Spruce, we’re building a product suite to manage all aspects of the data supply chain. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Rust VC/DID&nbsp;Library <p>We are currently working on a project called DIDKit: a cross-platform toolkit for using DIDs and VCs with our Rust libraries at the&nbsp;core.</p>  We have been able to utilize the core credential flows of Issue, Present, and Verify using DIDKit, currently supporting RSA and Ed25519 signature systems with more to&nbsp;come.  We currently support <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did-key</a>, but are starting work on support for did-tezos, did-btcr, did-web, and did-peer.  We are helping to write tests for the DID Test Suite at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">W3C DID Working&nbsp;Group</a>.   Tezos DID&nbsp;Method <p>The Tezos DID Method makes a pragmatic trade-off between usability, security, and privacy, allowing any Tezos-based address to have a useful&nbsp;DID.</p>  Our current draft of the Tezos DID Method can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">here</a>.  We have been reviewing this with members of the Tezos ecosystem and members of the decentralized identity ecosystem to ensure usability, security, and&nbsp;privacy.  We have started the implementation of the&nbsp;method.  We intend to submit this as a Credentials Community Group work item with our partner TQ over the next few&nbsp;weeks.   Credible   We are completing the integration of our Rust libraries into our native mobile applications through the Flutter cross-platform framework.  We have begun scoping the cloud wallet and single-page app target aspects of Credible.   Keylink   We have begun work on Keylink, which links existing enterprise accounts to keypairs.  We have a working MVP demonstration which uses Keycloak as the identity provider and Keylink as the relying party for signing with Ed25519&nbsp;keys.  Keys are stored in an encrypted SQLite database for the MVP, but we intend to integrate with cloud KMS systems such as Amazon KMS in the&nbsp;future.  We intend to release Keylink open source as it&nbsp;matures.  <p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will respond within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>Before the pandemic, most organizations moved their digital strategies forward at a steady pace. Leaders either wanted proof of success and didn’t feel great urgency to invest more in digital or the organizational culture seemed resistant.</p>
<p>But when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, many employees started <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ask-these-questions-before-deploying-remote-access-technology/">to work remotely</a> and organizations ramped up digital engagement with customers. Surveyed corporate directors increased the development of digital products and services to maintain and accelerate their customer engagement, and help them reach their revenue growth targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz05NTlhZjA0MDE0NDgxMWViYWJhYTBhNTZkNmU3ZDRjZg=="></a></p>
<p>The way forward for them was to increase, rather than decrease, the speed of<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/prioritize-digital-business-initiatives-to-accelerate-into-the-future/"> their digital business initiatives </a>and to elevate funding for IT to support this acceleration.</p>
<p>The survey found that 87% of corporate directors deemed technology as having a transformational role in addressing strategic business priorities. Sixty-seven percent of corporate directors expected budgetary increases in technology, and the majority of them anticipated a 6.9% increase in their current IT budgets as a result of the acceleration.</p>
 Why is digital strategy acceleration important now? 
<p>Digital business acceleration is important now for three reasons:</p>
 
 COVID-19. The pandemic demonstrated the value of digital initiatives in e-commerce, deliveries, supply chain virtualization, process automation and other activities, especially where physical activities were no longer possible. 
 Costs and operations. The recession has driven the need to overhaul costs and streamline operations. 
 Results. The rapid responses to the pandemic make accelerating digital business seem feasible and also critical for the survival of a company. 
 
 Boards of directors position the CIO as a partner in digital strategy&nbsp; 
<p>To respond to this crisis and its aftermath, the role of the CIO as an advisor to the board on digital business issues will also increasingly change. More than half of boards of directors said that CIOs will serve as partners with senior business leaders, while over a third look to the CIO to lead digital business issues alone.</p>

 Knock, knock. Who’s there? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To most Americans, the question is a pathway to laughter. To many Sub-Saharan Africans, on the other hand, the matter of who’s who can be painfully complicated, inconvenient, or potentially transformative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">494 million</a>&nbsp;people do not have a form of identification, which is as much as 45% of the population. In other words, almost half of the Sub-Saharan Africans cannot prove who they say they are, thus walled off from access to public services and social welfare such as education or healthcare, denied the right to vote, and left ineligible to participate in any formal financial transactions or economic activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cash. Cash Who? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The implications of identification on livelihoods are more pronounced in the region because, among the many challenges mentioned above, Sub-Saharan Africa has historically hosted the biggest population underserved by the financial sector. </p>
<blockquote><p>Despite steady growth over the past years,&nbsp;<a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/reports.aspx?source=1228">less than one-third</a> of adults (age 15+) in the region own at least one financial account, compared with the world average of 67.1% and 93.8% in North America. Without an ID, individuals and businesses have no options but to rely on cash transactions.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financially speaking, for individuals, having a digital identity means&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/toward-new-impact-narrative-financial-inclusion">building resilience</a>&nbsp;— coping strategies in the face of life uncertainties and changes. It could be done through activities like instant online saving, instead of having to choose between finding a reliable savings club, spending hours traveling to a bank, and keeping cash under the pillow. It also significantly eases the process of participation in pension schemes and receiving qualified subsidies. The value of digital identity to individuals is more than resilience building; it’s also about seizing opportunities. By leveraging financing tools such as loans or investments, individuals have higher chances to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the business front, having an identity as the business owner helps with financing for business needs, such as a planned expansion or weathering an unplanned pandemic, through formal financial arrangements with&nbsp;<a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.617.4016&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">more competitive interest rates</a>. It also builds business credit history, which is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sba.gov/blog/10-stats-explain-why-business-credit-important-small-business">especially meaningful</a>&nbsp;to small to medium enterprises. Moreover, having a credible online presence verified by the government agencies or a third-party IDV service provider can be a critical part of customer acquisition in today’s global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, financial inclusion banks on identification, and to Sub-Saharan Africa, digital identity will turbo-charge inclusive financial growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No Time Like the Present 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researchers have&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.babson.edu/lcdstein/research/stein-yannelis-freedmanbank.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that financial inclusion interventions have a larger effect on people who open bank accounts earlier than those who do so later. It takes time for the enabling effect of digital identity on financial inclusion to occur, and so does the digitalization of identity. The writer argues that now is the best time to assess the needs for designing and rolling out digital identity systems that serve both the currently documented and undocumented in the region. The region can leverage the existing and continuously developing mobile networks and data and privacy regulation frameworks and follow in the footsteps of a few pioneer countries in the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM connection rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to grow from 77% in 2019 to 86% by the end of 2025, at a CAGR of 4.3%, and the mobile internet user rate from 26% to 39%, at a CAGR of 9.7%, according to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GSMA_MobileEconomy2020_SSA_Eng.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;published by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/">GSM Association</a>. The rising mobile penetration level lays a solid foundation for the potential continent-wide rollout of mobile identity, whose worldwide addressable market was valued at $34 billion through 2022, per OWI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/product/mobile-identity-the-34-billion-opportunity/">research in 2018</a>. The high mobile penetration rate also means plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SCT_Report_R_WebSingles.pdf">opportunities</a>&nbsp;leveraging tools such as mobile money for transactions among individuals and businesses and government-sponsored cash transfer programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>A reliable digital identity system also needs to be backed by a strong data and privacy regulation framework. By 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://unctad.org/news/data-and-privacy-unprotected-one-third-countries-despite-progress">half</a>&nbsp;of the African countries have had data and privacy legislation in place, and 61% have set up e-transaction laws, with the number&nbsp;<a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2019/12/24/kenya-now-has-a-data-protection-law-what-does-this-mean-for-netizens/">on a gradual rise</a>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, several countries in the region have already taken the first stab at the digital identity system. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europeanceo.com/world-view/electronic-identification-cards-herald-a-digital-future-for-ghana/">Ghana</a>&nbsp;began its national registration and issuance of electronic ID cards to citizens in 2018;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/kenya-creates-africas-first-national-digital-id-scheme/">Kenya</a>&nbsp;is creating a population-wide identity scheme in Africa, a US$60 million program; and earlier this year,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/loans-credits/2020/02/18/nigeria-digital-identification-for-development-project">Nigeria</a>&nbsp;launched the Digital Identification for Development Project with a US$115 million credit from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA). The identity digitization initiatives in these countries are not only meaningful for financial inclusion. They serve as trailblazers for their neighboring countries, especially given the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/digital-identity-for-all-push-in-africa-now-has-clarity-and-political-will-id4africa-executive-director">increasing demand</a>&nbsp;for digital identity and digital assets driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0239797">disproportionate economic impact</a>&nbsp;among households.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the rising mobile penetration, the promising regulatory landscape, and the countries carrying the torch, there are hurdles to clear. For instance, there’s still room for modification in regulation. It is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cigionline.org/sites/default/files/documents/no244_0.pdf">found</a>&nbsp;that many of the data and privacy laws are not as comprehensive as international regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Some of the rights enforced by GDPR such as the right to data portability, which&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/data-protection-and-privacy-laws">mitigates the risk</a>&nbsp;of locking consumers into a single service provider, is not covered in these laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, while policymakers and other stakeholders, like international organizations, should be careful when evaluating costs and feasibilities, the benefits of acting sooner rather than later are self-evident. With the data collected from digital identity systems, from simple data like population and gender ratio, to more complicated data points like health and socio-economic statistics, Sub-Saharan African policymakers will be<a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-data-affects-africas-ability-to-make-the-right-policy-decisions-64064">&nbsp;better positioned</a>&nbsp;to conduct evidence-based research and make data-informed policies. In addition, better infrastructure supported by government initiatives will help attract private-sector players both at home and abroad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital identity can be a transformative force in advancing regional criticalities such as financial inclusion in the public and private sectors. The sooner we take action, the faster we may bring changes to communities in need.</p>

  <p>The question of how much control to retain versus how much to give up is something that occupies the minds of parents, management consultants, and often coaches. A high level of control helps achieve specific objectives, but, at the same time, it may lead to a complex bureaucracy that slows down self-initiative, entrepreneurship, and general productivity. A high level of empowerment, on the other hand, fosters creativity and ownership, but it may lead to unmanageable or risky outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the world of identity and security, organizations across all sectors also face this conundrum. Managing identity involves both controlled (stateful) and autonomous (stateless) security tokens.&nbsp;</p>

  Stateful tokens are opaque and can be de-referenced by a central authority only after request (token introspection). The authority manages the state of the token, including revocation. The token depends on the availability and performance of the authority. 
	 Stateless tokens are self-contained and can be "unpacked" by any party with the appropriate key material. Stateless tokens can be processed with or without the availability of an authoritative service.&nbsp; 
 <p>Knowing which to use is often straightforward, but sometimes what you really want to deploy is something in between.</p>

 A Closer Look at Token Swapping Use Cases 

<p>Exposing open services and APIs to external clients is a perfect use case for stateful tokens. Because external clients can be located anywhere and security tokens can travel over many networks, more control is needed. With stateful tokens, you can have opaque tokens that don’t carry sensitive content, always introspect tokens against a central authority, and revoke tokens as needed to provide a high level of control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> architectures that require security checks at every stage, including each microservice-to-microservice call, using stateless tokens makes more sense. That’s because they don’t depend on a central authority, which could impact the ability to scale and to continue operations if the authority is unreachable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Token swapping describes the ability to exchange one security token for another in a different, enriched, or restricted form. A gateway can function as the "token swapper." It intercepts requests, validates tokens, and generates new tokens either by itself or in conjunction with other services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let’s look at the example of a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services">financial</a> company exposing APIs to partner organizations. Such a scenario requires a higher level of control and the ability to revoke granted access, so, for these external clients, the financial institution issues stateful tokens. Token swapping allows the company to use those stateful tokens on the front end but then switch to stateless tokens for scalability and other benefits within their microservices environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you swap a stateful token for a stateless token in the right way and at the right time, you can achieve that delicate balance between control and autonomy to better suit your purposes.</p>

  <p>In the aforementioned scenario, ForgeRock Identity Gateway, deployed as a north-south gateway, validates stateful OAuth2 tokens by introspection with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">Access Management</a>, ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Identity Cloud</a>, or any other OAuth2 authorization server. After validating the stateful token, Identity Gateway then generates a stateless JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the identity information the downstream services need to proceed autonomously.</p>

<p>Self-contained JWTs are a compelling token type for scenarios that require a high level of scaling, do not have a strong dependency on external services (such as the authority), and can tolerate the absence of token revocation capability. For many microservices scenarios, this is a very effective use case for token swapping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Local JWT validation can also be conducted by service meshes, such as Istio, or by ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">Identity Gateway</a>, deployed as an east-west gateway, or Microgateway with the JwtValidationFilter. Note, however, that service meshes support self-contained JWTs but do not integrate well with stateful OAuth2 and remote token introspection. Furthermore, JWTs consumed by service meshes like Istio need to have the appropriate content, which can be built using token swapping. The "token swapper" can aggregate the appropriate JWTs.</p>

<p>Token swapping is not limited to stateful OAuth2 to JWT token swapping. You can create transformations using other token types – such as OpenID Connect, SAML or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">SSO</a> tokens – and services like the security token service (STS). You can also enrich tokens with user roles, entitlements, or attributes obtained from the authority.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To learn more about balancing control and autonomy with token swapping, read about the following useful components: <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtBuilderFilter.html">JwtBuilderFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/JwtValidationFilter.html">JwtValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/IdTokenValidationFilter.html">IdTokenValidationFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/OAuth2ResourceServerFilter.html">OAuth2ResourceServerFilter</a>, <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/7/reference/TokenTransformationFilter.html">TokenTransformationFilter</a>.</p>

<p>With token swapping, you can expand your options for obtaining the right balance in the control versus autonomy dilemma—at least in the identity and security realm. Parents, philosophers, and management will have to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Last month’s <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW) was held entirely online for the second time in its history. This bi-annual unconference, typically hosted in Mountain View, CA at the Computer History Museum, connects a wide variety of people from across the globe focused on solving the hard problems around digital identity. As an unconference, the attendees set the agenda each day. The format is focused on open collaboration which creates a real and rare opportunity to organically discuss not only the latest technology developments, but also the surrounding social, political and legal implications.</p><p>This year, over 400 attendees from across the globe participated in IIW31. It was a great showcase of both the work and progress being achieved across a variety of open standards and open source communities.</p><p>Although there is too much to cover in one write up, we wanted to highlight MATTR’s pick of the three major&nbsp;themes:</p>  KERI comes into the spotlight  Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity   KERI comes into the spotlight <p>One of the technologies that received a great deal of attention this year was Sam Smith’s <a href="https://keri.one/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure</a> (KERI). Sam first introduced this topic over a year ago, and it’s evident that a lot has happened since then to bring these ideas and concepts to&nbsp;life.</p><p>KERI attempts to address the self-certifying aspect of identifier-based systems such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Central to this technology is the concept of Key Event Logs (KELs) which are maintained by each user in a distributed identity system. Key Event Logs contain digitally signed messages of all key management related transactions done by the user, and can be used not only to prove control over your identifier, but also shared with other external ‘witnesses’ who can independently validate and prove that you control your identifier. In practice, this means that KERI identifiers and keys are not “ledger-locked” — they are fully portable and can be validated using any ledger, distributed database, or other verifiable data registry.</p><p>In a session called “<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/2E/_KERI_for_Muggles">KERI for Muggles</a>”, Drummond Reed and Sam Smith identified 7 main characteristics that make KERI useful for identity:</p>  Self-certifying identifiers  Self-certifying Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Witnesses for Key Event&nbsp;Logs  Pre-rotation as simple, safe, scalable protection against key compromise  System-independent validation  Delegated self-certifying identifiers enable enterprise-class key management  Compatibility with the GDPR “right to be forgotten”  <p>There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=12A/_KERIfying_DID_Methods_%26_KERI_for_Interop">number</a> of <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13E/_DIDn%27t:_did:un_and_overlap_between_DIDs_%26_KERI">additional</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14A/_Verifiable_Trust_Bases:_How_to_make_the_web_of_trust_new_again_with_KERI">sessions</a> that dived into advanced KERI topics, including how KERI can create interoperability between different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID methods</a> and solving the operational concerns related to bringing these ideas to life. There are <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keripy">ongoing</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keriox">open-source projects</a> at the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) which are driving this work forward. We look forward to the positive change this will bring to our ecosystem, particularly in reducing our technology’s strict dependence on specific infrastructure like distributed ledgers.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with Federated Identity&nbsp;Systems <p>Following on from <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_30_Session_Notes">IIW30</a>, there was a continued theme around the bridging of W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs) with existing identity protocols on the web today such as <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (OIDC), which are mainly used in federated identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Evolution of existing protocols such as OIDC allows existing infrastructure providers to make adjustments to their implementations in order to start using new technology, rather than having to tear it all down and rebuild. The goal here is to build as much as we can upon previous work while addressing a number of significant shortcomings around federated identity as it exists today. We’ve covered <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/if-you-build-an-island-youll-need-a-boat-537f48525edc">this topic</a> before, so needless to say, we’re committed to solving this problem and we were extremely supportive of the continued discussion around these issues at this&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>A key component of this approach is the ability to allow existing identity solutions to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials. One way to achieve this is to extend the OpenID Connect protocol to enable more portable digital identity. Instead of using OIDC as a bearer token between an Issuer and Relying party, we can create a client-bound assertion that’s held in a user’s digital wallet. To that end, we <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1F/_OpenID_Connect_Credential_Provider">introduced</a> an approach that we’re calling <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">OpenID Connect Credential Provider</a>, which turns traditional Identity Providers (IdPs) into credential providers. It modifies current authentication/issuance flows used by OpenID Connect to allow IdPs to issue assertions that are re-provable and reusable for authentication. This helps to decouple the issuance of identity-relation information and the presentation of that information by a user, introducing the “wallet” layer between issuers and relying parties. There was great participation in this discussion from some of today’s existing Identity Providers, and one of the outcomes from this IIW is that the specification will be contributed to the <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a> (OIDF) as a work item, where it will be further developed by the community there.</p><p>There was also a great deal of interest around the evolution of <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop/">Self-Issued OpenID</a> (SIOP). The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">SIOP chapter</a> of the OpenID Connect specification was written in a way that clearly tried to leave room for some of the user-centric design concepts that are quite popular today, but given that it was first introduced in 2014, it lacked the context of today’s technologies such as DIDs and VCs. ُThere’s a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/issues/1180/siop-laundry-list">laundry list</a> of topics to cover here, so kick starting this effort has been a matter of breaking down each component and coming up with potential solutions. We identified 3 main problems that SIOP aims to&nbsp;address:</p>  Enabling portable identities between providers  Solving the <a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">NASCAR&nbsp;problem</a>  Dealing with different deployment types of OpenID providers  <p>There are a number of insights we can gain by addressing each of these issues separately, and bringing them together to form more robust solutions. It was exciting to see that there are <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=14B/_SIOP_-_progress_on_the_laundry_list_(wrt_DID)">many people</a> interested in revisiting SIOP and trying to address the underlying issues with federated identity. The work will continue to develop at the OpenID Foundation AB working group, so the conversation doesn’t stop at&nbsp;IIW.</p><p>In related news, there was some <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=13J/_The_Web_Platform,_Privacy_and_Federation_(thoughts_on_WebID)">collaborative</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=20C/_Browsers,_Privacy_and_Federation_(Cookies,_WebID,_CHAPI,_etc)">dialogue</a> with Google’s <a href="https://wicg.github.io/WebID/README.html">WebID</a> technology, which aims to explore how browsers can help solve the user privacy problem of cross-site cookie tracking on the web. Given that the IIW community is deeply focused on issues of security and user privacy, it made a lot of sense for those working on WebID to connect with people working on OpenID Connect, as well as the W3C community working on the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API</a> (CHAPI). The team developing Chromium discussed the possibility of adding a minimal set of browser APIs to work with CHAPI. Having something like CHAPI supported directly by the browser would allow for a more friendly user experience, allowing a credential holder to choose the provider of their identity (instead of being dictated by the relying party) and enabling better credential storage synchronization. The discussion here is really just a starting point, and we’re looking forward to seeing how WebID incorporates this approach and continues to work with the IIW community as the work develops.</p> SSI maturing into multi-dimensional &amp; relationship-oriented identity <p>It’s been nearly 15 years since Kim Cameron wrote the <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>, and over 4 years since Christopher Allen first laid out the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 Principles of SSI</a>. In the time since then, thinking has evolved a great deal around how to bring the power of SSI to users. This work has not only included building out the foundational technologies, but also addressing the practical tradeoffs between convenience, usability, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As these technologies get deployed in the real world, what’s emerging is the fact that what we call ‘SSI’ (Self-Sovereign Identity) is more a set of guiding principles in how we would like digital identity systems of the future to behave like or be based around, rather than a concrete checklist where you can say this technology is SSI. As it is, there are always new ideas about how to bring these principles to life in real world applications. This continued to be a hot topic at this IIW, including:</p>  Scaling peer communications  Scaling blockchains  Scaling privacy   Scaling peer communications <p>Besides all of the ongoing work on KERI, there were a number of updates surrounding technology enabling peer-to-peer communication. There were a <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=1J/_DIDComm_Messaging_V2_-_Where_we_are_and_what_to_expect">few</a> <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=21D/_DIDComm_Mediator_Agents_(v1_%26_v2)_-_Intro_and_where_open_source_projects_are">sessions</a> dedicated to giving the community an update on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> protocol, showing that the specification is maturing to a point where it will be stable enough to broadly implement. In addition, Daniel Hardman of <a href="https://www.evernym.com">Evernym</a> presented a thought provoking <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/index.php?title=23G/_Discovery:_Solving_the_Kobayashi_Maru_of_SSI">session</a> on the intersection of privacy and discoverability on the web, which he calls “The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a> Problem of&nbsp;SSI”.</p> Scaling blockchains <p>The team at <a href="https://consensys.net">Consensys</a> presented an interesting <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/3E/_Better_DID_Mehtods_with_Zero_Knowledge_Proofs_(ZKPs)%3F_-_Privacy_Preserving,_Globally_Verfiable_DIDs">proposal</a> for a new DID method based on <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK Rollups</a>. In recent years, there has been a big push in the community to reconsider the use of ledgers and minimize what information is made public, especially when it comes to identifying individual people. While there has been a lot of interest in DID methods that don’t use any blockchain or ledger infrastructure, Consensys and many others continue to explore the use of ledgers due to their unique properties, such as the ability to offer global resolvability. Although it’s early stages for this work and there is no codebase yet, there was a lot of interest from those in the community looking to use blockchain-based DID methods. Their approach would give DIDs global resolvability with the potential to keep the DID “off ledger” and privacy preserving, making it ideal for persons using DIDs. As mentioned earlier, the work on KERI is also helping to illustrate how we can continue using decentralized ledger technologies in a way that preserves user sovereignty and data portability.</p> Scaling privacy <p>As a followup to last IIW, we provided an introduction to multi-message signatures and an overview of recent developments made around using <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ Signatures</a> for selective disclosure in JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials. We <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April of this year. Since then, steady progress on open-source implementations and technical specs have resulted in a number of additional enhancements to the privacy preserving characteristics of zero knowledge proof based credentials, including the ability to have blinded subject credentials and domain bound proofs. In addition to progress on the technical specification, there have been significant developments on open-source implementations from a number of independent organizations. This progress has made the case for privacy-preserving credentials and selective disclosure stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p> Summary <p>SSI and decentralized digital identity are maturing at a steady pace, but we still have a lot of work ahead to solve the difficult problems around trust, privacy, and scalability that come with deploying systems in the real world. We’re excited to see progress on the critical issues move forward as the work happens across so many different communities and areas of interest.</p><p>As always, we’re incredibly grateful for the work that <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Kaliya Young</a>, <a href="https://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley</a>, and the team at IIW are doing to bring together different perspectives and to host important discussions which are open, respectful, and always illuminating. As for MATTR, you can usually find us on <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal">GitHub</a> and working within organizations like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OIDF</a>, and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> to push forward the vision for a more open and accessible internet. We will see you all at&nbsp;IIW32!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/highlights-of-iiw31-c36883cb70db">Highlights of #IIW31</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Identity Server 2020.2 is released today, including SSO 8.6 and CustomerID 5.6. 
<p>At the core, software development should be incremental, where small changes are delivered quickly, with high quality and continual improvement in mind.&nbsp;There should be several elements: the correction of some deviations, some feature improvements, some maintenance and ideally a new feature or two. Inside this release we have a little of all of these things for you, and we have focused on a new feature. Check out the release notes&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Identity+Server+2020.2+Release+Notes">here</a>&nbsp;for an in depth view of things. In brief, we have ensured our internal retooling functions well – and it does – we’re pleased with the ability to deliver code improvements quickly in a highly automated and testable manner. During this development cycle we delivered several patches to resolve deviations in our CustomerID application which also helped us to iron out the last wrinkles in the new CI. This allowed us to accommodate the security improvement required by Suomi.fi and create the SSO 8.5.1 patch in very short order.</p>
<p>Working with several customers, we elected to focus on Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as an addition to our many authentication methods. Many of our customers create their own UI and already&nbsp;have&nbsp;the ability or desire to create their own Quick Response (QR) code, which can ease user onboarding, although you can still offer the secret as a text string. So we set-about the task of code creation inside the SSO application,&nbsp;including the API control functions and logging functions essential to any SSO authentication.</p>
 Continuing to the end of 2020 
<p>Within the product, we are going to do some incremental improvements in the last months of 2020. There are some additional tooling changes that will ensure that we can bring updated&nbsp;third-party libraries&nbsp;into every release we make. We are also adding a section into the Release Notes, as requested, covering the life-cycle management of external components (like which Tomcat is in use, when will PostgreSQL being updated next etc). In late 2019, the OpenID foundation finalised their CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) method into CIBA Core 1.0. So while we had implemented a pre-spec version of CIBA in the summer of 2018, we now need to make a couple of small changes to our Ubisecure Backchannel Authentication Adaptor (UBAA) to be Core 1.0 compliant. We expect to integrate several new external authenticators via UBAA in the first half of 2021 and then open the adaptor methodology up to all of you – easy integrations to SSO is coming soon! In the next week or so, we will publish our 2020.3 pre-release notes – the goals and intentions of the team for the final development cycle of 2020.</p>
<p>This iteration, IDS 2020.2, has been tightly focused and IDS 2020.3 will be very focused as well. Additionally, we are working on the scoping and predictability of our engineering as well as adding communication of upcoming development plans; for example pre-release notes as details against top line roadmap items and life-cycle management found on the release notes. The goal is to ensure that we can understand your needs and dependably place them into a development timeline. Coupled with the new CI and automated release testing we have done over the prior year, I am confident that we will continue to support and serve our customers the best possible code and new feature additions on a predictable schedule.</p>
<p>As we move forward to the end of the year, our team continues to work remotely with business as usual. All of us at Ubisecure hope that all of you, your colleagues and families are well and can tolerate this social isolation. We are looking forward to a return to normal office days, coffee breaks and being able to meet you in person. Until that happens, we are happy to engage with you virtually. So if you have any questions over this release, or upcoming work, please don’t hesitate to contact your account team or our support department. We are happy to help with anything around your identity solution needs.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In this release cycle we have been solidifying our new CI. We created three CustomerID patch releases, each removing deviations from the core code base which are now rolled-up into CustomerID 5.6 available in this release. SSO has also been patched, to add functionality to Suomi.fi requiring algorithm changes (Suomi.fi required continual encryption via&nbsp;AES128-GCM, you can read about it in our announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/technical-announcements/ubisecure-sso-8-5-1-has-been-released/">here</a>, and the Suomi.fi announcement&nbsp;<a href="https://palveluhallinta.suomi.fi/en/ajankohtaista/uutiset/5f51e6b9fc2bb907bbb64186">here</a>). These smaller patches allowed us to review the CI and ensure that we have the ability to quickly correct and release tested software. This ability is core to our operational future and essential to offering you good service. The Engineering team are also constantly working to increase the automated test cases to increase the test coverage for our platform – this means that more and more of the features are automatically tested via UI and API before the code is released to you.</p>
 New in this release 
 Time-based One-time Password 
<p>With this release, we extend the Identity Platform capabilities to include Time-based One-time Password (TOTP). In SSO you are now able to configure a new TOTP authentication method to be used similarly to other OTP methods. A new TOTP API application has been created for handling the adding and removal of secrets for users when setting up their device. It should be noted that you will need to facilitate ways for the users to generate and set up their devices and utilise the TOTP API to insert the secret to the user’s account, as there is no self-service UI or QR code generation available within SSO in this initial release.</p>
<p>This initial release of TOTP complies with&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC 6238</a>, which is a generic implementation for Time-based One-time Password and should function with any authenticator application that supports the RFC standard.</p>
<p>Within SSO you will have the ability to create a TOTP secret via API call for each user, see the example “Your Secret Key” below on the left, but having your end users add that secret key to their authenticator application is still a manual process. Each user will have to copy and paste or manually type in the secret key to set up their authenticator application which will then generate the 6 digit TOTP code used each time they access your application. The use of a QR code to enter the secret (see the QR code link to Wikipedia below on right), could be created by your UI team to ease onboarding. But at this time a QR code generator is not available within our Identity Platform. We will be looking for your feedback to determine if you require a QR code generator – or if you will use commonly available generators within your own applications to facilitate the setup for users.</p>
<p><a href="https://totp.danhersam.com/"></a></p>
<p>The following use cases are supported on a per application basis – meaning you can continue to have a variety of applications requiring only those users permitted or those sessions which need stronger authentication using your RFC 6238 compliant authenticator of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Improvements and corrections 
<p>There are always continuous improvements and corrections being made to the Ubisecure Identity Server and this release is no exception.</p>
<p>You will find improvements made to our developer portal pages, such as here – <a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms">https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/System+Recommendations+and+Supported+Platforms</a> – with information of the browsers and operating systems we support, software requirements related to java and databases as well as hardware recommendation for running operational environments. We have also added more information to the additional security consideration page –<a href="https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Security+considerations+for+production+environments+-+SSO">https://developer.ubisecure.com/docs/display/IDS20202/Security+considerations+for+production+environments+-+SSO</a> – with recommendations on how to ensure that no system specific information is leaked to end users in an error situation.</p>

   CDR is here! But don’t panic if your bank isn’t quite there yet. We can help with our new ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators. 

<p>Well, it’s finally here. The Australian government’s<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0#:~:text=On%2026%20November%202017%2C%20the,and%20control%20over%20their%20data.&amp;text=Consumer%20data%20relating%20to%20mortgage,shared%20after%201%20November%202020."> Consumer Data Right</a> (CDR) regulation is taking effect – in phases – starting with bank loans and personal information for the Big Four banks. The rest of the industry will follow suit in 2021.</p>

<p>Understandably, the rollout of yet another new regulation tends to be met with a bit of resistance. But <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/cdr">CDR</a> has some significant upsides for banks that fully embrace the open standards requirement that come with it. It’s been argued that the open standards can lead to a new wave of greater innovation and consumer services. Here are three ways banks can benefit from CDR:.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#1. CDR can pave the way to greater uniformity of security and boost consumer confidence. Third-party global banking integrations have been quite loose with regard to security in the past. Lacking application programming interface (API) openness, some developers have resorted to insecure “screen scraping” techniques that left consumer data vulnerable. CDR requires openness, mandating industry-standard, security-conscious protocols that will increase consumer confidence in the way their data is handled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#2. CDR can lead to better customer and user experiences (CX/UX). Everything today is digital and online. Even processes previously handled exclusively face to face – like new customer onboarding and enrollment – can now be done remotely, without ever having to set foot in a branch office. Since many customers have an online-only relationship, the digital experience must be optimized. This means speed and security need to be core components of the offering, ensuring that there are no data loss or sync issues between your bank and a third-party provider. Secure uniformity and openness of APIs can help support this.</p>

<p>#3. CDR can help monetize data for new consumer services. A core focus of CDR is putting consumers in charge of their data. But this doesn’t eliminate opportunities for new service offerings and partnerships between banks and third-party API developers or other financial services organizations. When done properly, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/kuppingercole-leadership-compass-identity-api-platforms">opening up your APIs</a> – and by extension, customer data –&nbsp; can lead to new revenue opportunities.</p>

<p>But before any of this can happen, you need to become compliant with CDR. Maybe you’re already there, but is the job really done? Was it a struggle to become compliant because of the legacy IT systems you have in place? Will that solution scale to your current needs, as well as the evolving and changing CDR standard?</p>

<p>No matter where you are in the compliance journey, ForgeRock has solutions – called “Accelerators” – that can help. Let’s take a more detailed dive into some of the specifics so you can see for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock recently released <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/cdr-open-banking-accelerators">CDR Open Banking Accelerators</a> to help drastically speed up compliance with the Australian Government's CDR mandate. These accelerators make it easier for you to comply with CDR mandates by providing a fully compliant container-based reference implementation, along with comprehensive documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our accelerators are designed to minimize integration efforts, by deploying into your production environment rapidly and in an automated way. Identity architects, DevOps, developers, and project managers report that our accelerators have saved them up to two thirds of their total implementation time and cost. CDR Open Banking Accelerators can help you achieve a rapid ROI and improve the customer experience at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock CDR Open Banking Accelerators also ensure that the APIs used by financial providers prioritize customer authorization when sharing data with other requested providers. We designed the tools to adhere to CDR guidelines outlined by the Australian government.</p>

<p>ForgeRock can help you overcome compliance hurdles. Here’s how the CDR Open Banking Accelerators addresses four primary use cases within the Open Banking framework:</p>

  Gives Data Holders a plug-and-play, CDR-compliant endpoint, where Accredited Data Recipients can dynamically register themselves. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a compliant, centralized consent engine enabling Accredited Data Recipients to request access to customer data. 
	 Provides Data Holders with a MetaDirectory Cache Data Model and Sync Engine to create and maintain the required copy of the Registry. Provides Data Holders with a fine-grained <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a> service based on customer consent. This Core Banking API enables you, as an accredited Data Recipient, to access data the customer consents to. 
 <p>You can decide to simply comply with the CDR regulation, or you can use it as a springboard to compete in the new Open API economy. ForgeRock firmly believes that, in the near future, the quality of CDR implementations and broader API offerings will be a determining factor for customers choosing new services. As Data Recipients begin to offer innovative services using banking APIs, customers will start to expect to make use of these third-party services. Plus, non-mandatory APIs help progressive organizations like yours capitalize on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/financial-services/open-banking">Open Banking</a> revolution, so it’s a real opportunity to grow and evolve your business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re grateful to our trusted partner<a href="https://www.middleware.co.nz/#/"> Middleware NZ</a>, whose knowledge of the Australian banking market and technical acumen helped make the CDR Open Banking Accelerators a reality.</p>

<p>With a modern identity and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access management</a> (IAM) platform, you can transform your customers’ user experience. They’ll be able to control who can access their data and what can be done with it. And by empowering your customers, you’ll open up new and exciting innovation opportunities for your organization.&nbsp;</p>

Last month, the circulation of USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI increased by 299 million, 306 million, 301 million, and 26 million. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.  USDC has stepped out of Ethereum and has been deployed on Algorand and Solana, with a supply of more than $30&nbsp;million.  BUSD continues to grow on the&nbsp;BSC.  Stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the Financial Stability Board, and the IMF have issued regulatory frameworks or&nbsp;reports.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past month(September 26, 2020 ~ October 25, 2020, same below, the data report of the natural month will be provided from next&nbsp;month).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.510 billion to $22.13&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past month, Tether additionally issued 299 million USDT on Ethereum. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, DAI, PAX, HUSD, and GUSD increased by 306 million, 301 million, 25.6 million, 74.89 million, 96.12 million, and 510,000. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 194&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last month, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all decreased by&nbsp;215,000.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT decreased by 253,000 and the number of holding addresses of USDC increased by 33,000. The number of other stablecoins holding addresses has not changed&nbsp;much.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last month increased by an average of 6.55% compared to the previous&nbsp;month.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous month, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;11.83%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last month decreased by an average of 28.82% from the previous&nbsp;month.</p> 2. Stablecoin stepped out of&nbsp;Ethereum <p>About 70% of stablecoins still choose Ethereum as the main issuance platform, and except for USDT which chooses to be issued on multiple blockchains, most stablecoins choose Ethereum as the only issuance platform. During the continued congestion of Ethereum, in addition to the steady increase of USDT on Tron, stablecoins have gradually stepped out of Ethereum. USDC chose multiple smart contract platforms to deploy, while BUSD began to expand within its ecosystem.</p> USDC has been deployed on Algorand/Solana <p>The Centre Alliance announced several pieces of cooperation information in September and October, announcing that it would deploy USDC assets on Algorand, Stellar, and Solana. Among them, the supply on Algorand and Solana has reached $7.180 million and $25 million, and USDC on Stellar will be issued in the first quarter of&nbsp;2021.</p> BUSD continues to grow on&nbsp;BSC <p>As a stablecoin asset issued by Binance, BUSD not only exists in the form of ERC-20 on Ethereum but is also deployed on Binance Chain (BEP2) and Binance Smart Chain (BEP20). With the progress of mining on BSC, the number of holding addresses of BUSD on BSC has exceeded 9,100, which is the same as the number of holding addresses of BUSD on Ethereum. Since the bridge of assets is provided by Binance Exchange, it is not easy to count the supply of BUSD on each blockchain. However, according to bscscan, the supply of BUSD on BSC should have exceeded $40 million, among which the amount of BUSD on Pancake exceeds $18&nbsp;million.</p> 3. Stablecoins attracted global regulatory attention <p>As early as 2019, stablecoins have attracted the attention of global regulators. The concept of ‘GSC’ was first formally proposed in the ‘Global Stablecoin Evaluation Report’ of the G7 Stablecoin Working Group in October 2019. ‘Global’ mainly refers to the stablecoin spanning multiple jurisdictions. The Bank for International Settlements also released a report on strengthening cross-border payments in July 2020, suggesting that CBDC and global stablecoins can provide potential assistance for cross-border payments.</p><p>The rapid growth of stablecoins in 2020 has even attracted the attention of global regulators. The European Commission, the G20 joint FSB, and the International Monetary Fund have successively issued regulatory reports on stablecoin.</p> European Commission announced the regulatory framework for encrypted assets and stablecoins <p>The European Commission published the final draft of the regulatory framework for encrypted assets on September 24. The report is 168 pages long and elaborates on the background of the proposal, the current status of the development of encrypted assets, and the regulatory recommendations for stablecoins.</p><p>The report pointed out that although the scale of the encrypted asset market was still small and did not pose a threat to financial stability, this situation may change with the emergence of ‘GSC’. Because ‘Global Stablecoin’ has stable value and uses the network effects generated by companies promoting these assets to seek wider applications. The European Commission will create a comprehensive and holistic EU ‘stablecoin’ framework for encrypted assets that are not covered by the EU’s existing financial services legislation to mitigate the risks identified by the Financial Stability Board, especially financial stability risks.</p><p>The plan still needs to be considered by the legislative counterparts of the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the European&nbsp;Council.</p> The G20 joint FSB released a stablecoin regulatory report <p>On October 23, the FSB released the “Regulation, Supervision, and Supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement” report, which made high-level recommendations for the supervision, supervision, and supervision of the ‘GSC’ arrangement.</p><p>The FSB pointed out that the so-called ‘stablecoin’ is a specific type of encrypted assets that had the potential to improve efficiency in the delivery of financial services by linking their value to one or more other assets (e.g. sovereign currencies) to solve the high volatility of ‘traditional’ encrypted assets, but at the same time could pose risks to financial stability, especially in the case of mass adoption. Stablecoins have the potential to improve payment efficiency and promote financial inclusion, but the use of ‘GSC’ may have a huge impact on the justice of many countries.</p><p>The FSB was established after the G20 Summit in 2009. It was officially commissioned by the G20 to provide observation reports and policy recommendations for the global financial system, sponsored and led by the Bank for International Settlements.</p><p>The G20 is working with the IMF, the World Bank, and the BIS to discuss the complexity of the GSC in terms of practice and technology, including design and interoperability, and assess the potential and challenges of CBDC in cross-border payments. By the end of 2022, the G20 will work with the IMF, the World Bank, and BIS to complete the framework for regulating stablecoins and research on the design, technology, and experiments of&nbsp;CBDC.</p> The IMF issued a report showing that CBDC has potential, but it cannot solve all&nbsp;problems <p>A report issued by the IMF on October 16 stated that CBDC may benefit those countries that wish to increase control over their monetary policy, but it will not solve all&nbsp;crises.</p><p>The IMF pointed out that new digital currencies including CBDC and GSC had attracted regulatory attention. CBDC and GSC can reduce transaction costs through competition, broaden service channels through mobile devices, and promote financial inclusion. The cross-border use of digital currency will also bring risks and policy challenges. For countries with economic downturns, CBDC is not a panacea solution. It cannot save those countries with high inflation rates or similar domestic problems.</p><p>The report concluded that CBDC had not yet qualitatively changed the global pattern of currencies, but it may intensify the effects of currency substitution and currency internationalization. And if the GSC and the existing currency have the same accounting unit, it may have a currency effect similar to that of CBDC, and at the same time, there is a potential threat to financial stability. If a new GSC with an independent accounting unit appears (e.g. a new currency with a basket of currencies as a reserve), it can also provide better financial services, but it will have a more profound impact on global currency and financial stability.</p> Tips <p>This is what we’re sharing in this MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report, welcome to stay tuned for follow-up crypto stablecoin reports. We will provide you with more analysis of the development status, trends and international impact of stablecoins to help readers stay updated on the development status of stablecoin.</p><p>PS: MYKEY Lab has the final right to interpret the content of the article, please indicate the source for the quotation.

<p>Over the past few months Mydex CIC has been working for the Scottish Government on a project to test whether an ‘attribute led’ approach to public service provision can work. <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/05/13/digital-identity-scotland-prototype-draws-to-a-close/">The good news is: it can indeed work</a>, and that opens up a whole new world of opportunity for citizens, Government and service providers.</p><p>Under the approach we tested, public sector organisations provide individuals with verified attributes (details about them which have been checked using rigorous processes). Individuals store these attributes in their own Attribute (or personal data) Store, and can then share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>We need this sort of approach because. when applying for and using public services, the personal data citizens need to provide can range over many different aspects of their lives, to some depth (in some cases). Creating the infrastructure for sharing verified attributes means that the right bundles of data can be put together quickly, efficiently and safely — in ways that protect the citizen’s data and privacy. (<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">Verified attributes are bits of information</a> about individuals that have been generated or checked by responsible organisations using robust, widely accepted processes.)</p><p>By equipping citizens with the means to accumulate and share this information in a safe, easy and secure manner it is possible to achieve significant reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both citizens themselves and service providers.</p><p>In the prototype work we tested all the independent components that need to work together to deliver a resilient, scalable system. This system is designed to place citizens at the centre of data sharing about themselves, empowering them with their own attribute store, with the ability to reuse verified data about themselves on an ongoing basis. Key areas of work included testing different ways of authenticating the identity of participants, ensuring the robustness of all necessary technical underpinnings (such as APIs), working with citizens to design user-journeys that are easy and intuitive, and addressing related communications issues.</p><p>For those interested in the details, <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">the full report is available here</a>.</p> Taking the next&nbsp;steps <p>Thanks to the success of this prototyping work the Scottish Government is now able to move on to the next stage:<a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/10/01/digital-identity-scotland-a-beta-industry-event/"> a ‘beta phase’</a> that will test the operation of this approach in practice. If this beta phase is successful, it could bring far ranging benefits to citizens, service providers and Government, making it much easier and cheaper for public services to be provided and used whilst improving outcomes and the speeding up of access to services citizens&nbsp;need.</p><p>But it also has bigger implications. The provision of Attribute Stores by which citizens can receive and share these Verified Attributes changes the architecture of personal data collection and use — moving it from a situation where service providers are the only ones gathering and storing the information they need, with citizens holding none of this information, to a situation where some of the data service providers need is stored separately from them (in the citizen’s Attribute Store) and accessed when needed. <a href="https://futurescot.com/digital-identity-service-could-be-used-from-birth-to-create-lifetime-records-for-every-scot/?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=97043733&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_D1gas4oYmIQVhegdjVUK8L5-zuu18ngjg7HV6aIJE83InLTdOCiojxuOK0zStkqtr6tpUiDTsVe6V7OJH5hRz0PQ3ag&amp;utm_content=97043733&amp;utm_source=hs_email">For a press article on this, see&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the longer term, the creation of this new, independent layer of data sharing infrastructure could radically change how exactly how our digital economy works. What’s needed for this however, is an effective implementation strategy. We’ll discuss this in our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/proving-verified-attributes-work-3f9ca813d43f">Proving Verified Attributes Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology is Now Officially a Technical Provider for Enterprise Solutions through Cointelegraph Consulting  May this be just the beginning. <p>For a thorough adoption of blockchain technology, the road must go through enterprises — this is something we have always known at Ontology, and with the recent addition by Cointelegraph Consulting to its technical provider list after a rigorous screening, we are more confident than ever that enterprise solutions will be a cornerstone to not just the success at Ontology, but the entire blockchain industry as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/advertise#:~:text=Cointelegraph%20is%20the%20leading%20media,million%20unique%20visitors%20per%20month.">With over 5 million unique visitors each month and over 17 million page views</a>, Cointelegraph has rapidly established itself as one of the media anchors in the blockchain space. But the readers it attracts aren’t merely traders, enthusiasts, or bitcoin fiends — rather, Cointelegraph has quietly established itself as a legitimate mediator between established enterprises and blockchain technology providers. As a result, a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting">consulting arm</a> was launched that aims to “…connect the world between blockchain and traditional institutions of all sizes by bringing wider adoption of digital assets and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions through education and professional consulting services.”</p><p>In many ways, this match between Cointelegraph Consulting and Ontology was a predetermined match, as illustrated by the pre-existing enterprise case studies implemented by Ontology. The most recent example, with Daimler Mobility, saw the implementation of Ontology’s DeID to allow users to customize and personally manage their automotive experiences regardless of the car they’re sitting in. A decentralized identity solution is at the forefront of blockchain technology and provides unlimited potential for organizations since much of the digital trend these days revolves around data &amp; identity protection.</p><p>Another example of the pre-existing enterprise implementations is Ontology’s partnership with Kaiyun Motors and OGQ. By providing the technical support for a public chain, Kaiyun Motors has been able to store over 2 million data sets ranging from claims on autonomous vehicles, to real-time wear and tear data during last-mile logistics. Not only has this potentially saved lives on the road, but it has also possibly drastically cut down costs on claims and overdue maintenances for Kaiyun Motors. As for OGQ, Ontology’s public chain has recorded over 250 million pieces of digital asset content that have been uploaded on OGQ and granted over 14 million content creators to immutable possess their digital property such as emojis, images, videos, music, new fonts, stickers, and memes to&nbsp;fans.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.sagamarket.io/"> SAGA market</a> is another real-case application for Ontology’s public chain as over 200,000+ users and 10,000+ ecosystem partners rely on SAGA to access streams of decentralized data ranging from foreign exchanges to meteorology.</p><p>In addition to these in-depth case studies provided, Ontology also offers a series of enterprise solutions in the following sectors:</p>  <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">Automotive</a>: Component Authentication, simplifying the supply chain, and automating claim processes.  <a href="https://ont.io/marketplace">Data Marketplace:</a> Lowering transaction costs, adding a layer of security, improving data quality, and ensuring proper data&nbsp;access.  <a href="https://ont.io/attestation">Data Attestation:</a> Certification of data and identity, as well as providing proof of existence.  <a href="https://ont.io/finance">Digital Finance:</a> 5,000+ transactions per second, ONT ID to simplify the KYC&nbsp;process.  <p>Moving forward, Ontology will be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/consulting/vendors">officially listed</a> on Cointelegraph’s vendor page, as will be the case studies we mentioned above in addition to others. By focusing on decentralized identities, Ontology is able to provide a wide range of use cases for enterprises of all sectors. This doesn’t even take into account the newly launched <a href="https://ontscore.com/">OScore</a>, a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain — which also fully integrates with ONT ID to give users an added layer of identity protection, and control over who gets to access their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>We look forward to potential new use cases of implementing Ontology’s robust set of technical solutions for enterprise-grade problems.

  <p>With the increasing popularity of single-page apps and the growing API economy, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are becoming a very popular method for authenticating users. Rather than relying on the server to store the user’s state, JWTs encode information in a keyed payload stored on the client.</p>

<p>JWTs are not inherently less secure than server-side session storage. But developers should understand the tradeoffs and know what to do <a>if a JWT is compromised</a>. You should expire JWTs frequently and always <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/go/overview/">validate them before trusting them in your application</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using JWTs properly, they provide several benefits. For single-page applications—where much of the heavy-lifting is done in the browser—JWTs make a lot of sense. Assuming the client can decode the JWT and verify its signature, it doesn’t need to make another trip back to the server to authenticate the user. JWTs also make sense for highly performant, globally-distributed server-side applications. By storing user information in the JWT, each node can authenticate the user locally rather than querying an authentication service on every request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll create a Laravel API that uses JWTs provided by <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> to authenticate users. You’ll use custom <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/middleware">Laravel middleware</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php">Okta JWT Verifier package</a> to verify requests and restrict access to your API to authenticated users. If you’d like to download the final codebase, <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-laravel-jwt-example">it’s available on GitHub</a>. Otherwise, read on for the step-by-step process.</p>

 Using JWT Authentication to Secure a Laravel API 

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll use Okta to generate a JWT that allows users to call your API securely. You’ll then verify the JWT using Okta’s JWT Verifier package to ensure that users have a valid, non-expired token before they get your data. To keep this example simple, you’ll use a client credentials grant, but the same JWT returned in <a>standard Laravel authentication with Okta</a> would also work.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: Please ensure you have already installed PHP, Composer, and have signed up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">free Okta developer account</a>.</p>

 Setting Up a New Laravel Application 

<p>Before adding the API endpoints and authentication packages, you will need a fresh Laravel application with a database table and model. For this tutorial, you’ll create a <code>Location</code> model and database table that includes the names of several locations and their desirability on a scale of 1-10.</p>

<p>If you already have <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> installed, you can use it to create a new Laravel application from your command line:</p>

   <code>composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel okta-laravel-jwt
</code>   

<p>Then you’ll need to <code>cd</code> into the folder and install the dependencies.</p>

   <code>cd okta-laravel-jwt
composer install
php artisan key:generate
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This tutorial assumes you are using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x">Laravel 8</a>. While not considerably different from previous versions, you may notice some import paths have changed, so be sure to adjust this for your version of Laravel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Laravel abstracts away most differences between database providers, so you can use any database you like, but the simplest way to get started is with <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>. To use SQLite, create a new file to house your database:</p>

   <code>touch database/database.sqlite
</code>   

<p>And update the <code>DB_CONNECTION</code> environment variable in your <code>.env</code> file to <code>DB_CONNECTION=sqlite</code>. Remove all the other <code>DB_</code> environment variables as you don’t need them for a SQLite connection.</p>

<p>Next, use the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan">Laravel Artisan command</a> to create a new model and migration file:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:model Location --migration
</code>   

<p>You will need to allow mass-assignment of the <code>name</code> and <code>desirability</code> attributes on this model, so open up the <code>app/Models/Location.php</code> model file. Add the following <code>$fillable</code> property to the class:</p>

   <code>...
class Location extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'desirability'];
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll need to add the model’s attributes to the database using the migration. Open up the new migration file Laravel created when you ran the above Artisan command. It should be the last file in your <code>database/migrations</code> folder. Modify the <code>up()</code> method to include the <code>name</code> and <code>desirability</code> fields:</p>

   <code>...
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('locations', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table-&gt;id();
        $table-&gt;string('name');
        $table-&gt;unsignedInteger('desirability');
        $table-&gt;timestamps();
    });
}
...
</code>   

<p>Commit the migration to your database using the migration Artisan command:</p>

   <code>php artisan migrate
</code>   

<p>Finally, before you build the endpoints for your API, you can create some default seed data using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/seeding">Laravel’s Database Seeder</a>. Open up the <code>database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php</code> file and replace the contents with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
namespace Database\Seeder;

use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;
use App\Models\Location;

class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Seed the application's database.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function run()
    {
        DB::table('locations')-&gt;truncate();
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Aruba', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Jamaica', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Bermuda', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Bahama', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Key Largo', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
        Location::create(['name' =&gt; 'Montego', 'desirability' =&gt; 10]);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the seeder via the Artisan command to reset the database and create the six new locations:</p>

   <code>php artisan db:seed
</code>   

<p>Your Laravel application, database table, and model are now ready. In the next step, you’ll add the API endpoints needed to retrieve, create, and delete data from this table.</p>

 Adding and Testing the API Endpoints 

<p>In a production application, you’ll probably want to create a controller to contain your API’s business logic. Because this is just a demonstration, you can do all the work in <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/routing">Laravel’s route file</a>. Open up the <code>routes/api.php</code> file and replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Models\Location;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Http;

Route::prefix('locations')-&gt;group(function () {
    Route::get('/', fn() =&gt; Location::all());
    Route::post('/', fn(Request $request) =&gt; Location::create($request-&gt;all()));
    Route::delete('/{id}', fn(int $id) =&gt; Location::destroy($id));
});
</code>   

<p>The first route will return all locations when <code>GET /api/locations</code> is called, the second will create a new location when <code>POST /api/locations</code> is called, and the third will delete a location based on the <code>{id}</code> you pass into the <code>DELETE /api/locations/{id}</code> call. To test these new endpoints out, start your local Laravel server:</p>

   <code>php artisan serve
</code>   

<p>You can use <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> or <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> to call each endpoint described above. For example, when I call <code>http://localhost:8000/api/locations</code> in Postman, I get the following JSON response back:</p>

   <code>[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Aruba",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jamaica",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Bermuda",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "Bahama",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "name": "Key Largo",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "name": "Montego",
        "desirability": "10",
        "created_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z",
        "updated_at": "2020-09-07T17:34:51.000000Z"
    }
]
</code>   

<p>Now that your API is set up, you are ready to add JWT authentication.</p>

 Adding the Okta JWT Verifier 

<p><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/middleware">Middleware</a> is usually the best place for custom authentication and request validation logic. In this step, you’ll create a new Laravel middleware, use the Okta JWT verifier to make sure the user has passed a valid JWT in as their bearer token, and add this middleware to all of the <code>/api/locations</code> routes described above.</p>

<p>First, install the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-php">Okta JWT verifier</a> package and its peer dependencies using Composer:</p>

   <code>composer require okta/jwt-verifier firebase/php-jwt guzzlehttp/psr7 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
</code>   

<p>The JWT adapter we’ll use is <code>firebase/php-jwt</code>, <code>guzzlehttp/psr7</code> provides HTTP interfaces for the API requests this library makes to Okta’s servers, and the <code>http-interop/http-factory-guzzle</code> adds PSR-17 support. The <code>guzzlehttp/psr7</code> library will be getting this <a href="https://github.com/guzzle/psr7/issues/327">support in version 2.0</a>, but in the meantime, the interop library allows you to fill in the missing pieces.</p>

<p>To use the JWT verifier, you’ll need a new Okta application with a Client ID and the Issuer URI of your Okta Authorization Server.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta account and go to API &gt; Authorization Servers. Copy the Issuer URI and add it as the environment variable <code>OKTA_ISSUER_URI</code> in your Laravel application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To create a new server application, go to Applications and click the Add Application button in the top left. Select Service, Machine-to-Machine and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name for your application and click Next again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from this page and add them to your Laravel application’s <code>.env</code> file as <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID</code> and <code>OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET</code> respectively.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have your Okta application and credentials, you are ready to use them to verify JWTs in Laravel. Create a new middleware using the Artisan command:</p>

   <code>php artisan make:middleware VerifyJwt
</code>   

<p>Open up the new file at <code>app/Http/Middleware/VerifyJwt.php</code> and replace the contents with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\Adaptors\FirebasePhpJwt;
use Okta\JwtVerifier\JwtVerifierBuilder;

class VerifyJwt
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Instantiate the Okta JWT verifier
        $jwtVerifier = (new JwtVerifierBuilder())
            -&gt;setAdaptor(new FirebasePhpJwt())
            -&gt;setAudience('api://default')
            -&gt;setClientId(env('OKTA_CLIENT_ID'))
            -&gt;setIssuer(env('OKTA_ISSUER_URI'))
            -&gt;build();

        try {
            // Verify the JWT passed as a bearer token
            $jwtVerifier-&gt;verify($request-&gt;bearerToken());
            return $next($request);
        } catch (\Exception $exception) {
            // Log exceptions
            Log::error($exception);
        }

        // If we couldn't verify, assume the user is unauthorized
        return response('Unauthorized', 401);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>To use this middleware, you need to add it to your <code>Kernel</code> class and routes. Open <code>app/Http/Kernel.php</code> and add the following to your <code>$routeMiddleware</code> array:</p>

   <code>...
'jwt' =&gt; \App\Http\Middleware\VerifyJwt::class,
...
</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>routes/api.php</code> file again and add the middleware to your <code>locations</code> route group:</p>

   <code>...
Route::prefix('locations')-&gt;middleware('jwt')-&gt;group(function () {
...
</code>   

<p>This applies the new middleware to every endpoint within the group, but you could apply it selectively to specific routes if you wanted.</p>

<p>Restart your Laravel application and try the endpoints again. This time, the API will return a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response because you have not added a valid JWT to your request. In the last section, you’ll issue a JWT and use it to make requests to the API.</p>

 Issuing JWTs 

<p>Before you can issue a JWT and use it to authenticate users trying to access your new Laravel API, you need to create a custom scope in Okta to provide access. Go back to the API &gt; Authorization Servers page in the Okta Developer Console and click the pencil icon to edit the authorization server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Scopes tab and then the Add Scopes button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Give your scope a Name and Display phrase so you can identify it. In this example we’ll use <code>locations_api</code> for the scope name. Click Create when you’re finished.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that your Okta authorization server has a new scope specifically for your new API, you can get an access token with this scope. For demonstration purposes, you’ll use the Client Credentials grant to get an access token without user interaction. In a real application, you would likely have the application use an OAuth login flow and then issue the access token to the client application.</p>

<p>On the command line, use <code>curl</code> to get an access token, replacing the placeholder values in the command below with your own application’s client ID and secret:</p>

   <code>curl https://dev-XXXXXX.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d client_id=OKTA_CLIENT_ID \
  -d client_secret=OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET \
  -d scope=locations_api
</code>   

<p>When you run this command, Okta will issue an access token and return a JSON object which contains the JWT in a field called <code>access_token</code>.</p>

   <code>{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...",
    "scope": "locations_api"
}
</code>   

<p>Copy the value of the <code>access_token</code> field. Make a <code>GET</code> call to the <code>http://localhost:8000/api/locations</code> endpoint with the JWT in your <code>Authorization</code> header as a bearer token. In curl, the request will look like this:</p>

   <code>curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/locations' --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5b1o2N...'

<p>Laravel will use the Okta JWT verifier you added to your new middleware to verify and decode your token. If it’s valid and not expired, you should see the same list of locations as you did before you added authentication to the app. The same bearer token can be used to access the  <code>POST</code> and <code>DELETE</code> endpoints until the JWT expires.</p>

<p>While this application used a machine-to-machine application to generate a JWT, you could use any Okta-issued JWT with the proper scopes to get the same access to the API above. This decoupling of authentication from your application logic is one of the most significant advantages of using a third-party authentication provider like Okta. It allows you to build scalable, distributed, and secure Laravel APIs.</p>

Everyone is pretty much focused on one thing right now. Today is election day in the U.S. And while for some, a result either way amounts to an existential crisis, for Big Tech, it doesn’t really matter who&nbsp;wins. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-doesnt-much-care-who-wins-2020-election-5265548d-df6a-4a24-b387-1f0e147056ed.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The big picture: Individuals in tech are as passionate and fingernail-biting about Tuesday’s election as any other Americans. But the path ahead for the massive companies that have seized the industry’s reins over the past decade will only alter incrementally based on the polls’&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>On regulations:</p><blockquote>Trump’s term saw a dramatic shift toward government action against tech firms. The Justice Department has sued Google, action against Facebook by states and the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly imminent, and investigations of both Apple and Amazon remain&nbsp;open.</blockquote>  These processes are all ostensibly non-partisan and theoretically unaffected by a change in administration.But in practice, a new attorney general could soft-pedal or even scrap the Google&nbsp;suit.  Democrats have their own reasons for pursuing action against the big companies — but unlike Republicans, they’re less focused on claims of censorship and more on the concentration of corporate power and the spread of misinformation.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Whoever wins the White House, scrutiny of tech’s allegedly monopolistic behavior will continue.</blockquote><p>A Biden presidency could see the issue of privacy elevated, but given everything else going on at the moment, don’t expect it to be a priority in the short&nbsp;term:</p><blockquote>Tech companies control the hardware and software that shapes our public and private communications, and that has placed them at the center of a million controversies.</blockquote>  We hold them responsible when their platforms become channels for misinformation and hate speech, and we blame them when their collection of personal data becomes intrusive or&nbsp;harmful.  <blockquote>Democrats have typically been readier than Republicans to favor stricter privacy rules and tougher controls on online misinformation, and if they win the White House and Congress, they might find ways to advance legislation that has long been&nbsp;stalled.</blockquote>  But a Democratic administration would have a long list of priorities ahead of such&nbsp;action.  <blockquote>Be smart: Some tech leaders — most prominently, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg — have practically begged the government to enact nationwide (and preferably lenient) nationwide laws on privacy and content moderation. They’d love to stop winging their way through one ethical minefield after another and just play by some standard, easy-to-follow rules.</blockquote><p>A Biden administration likely won’t focus as much on platform bans such as TikTok and WeChat, but tensions with China will continue and a divided internet is still on the&nbsp;table:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, tech leaders expect U.S.-China tensions to continue, since each side sees the other as a long-term existential threat — but they also hope in the short term to keep getting what they need and selling what they&nbsp;can.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/trumps-campaign-website-hacked-by-cryptocurrency-scammers/">Trump’s campaign website hacked by cryptocurrency scammers — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/dutch-hacker-trump-twitter-account-password/">President Trump’s Twitter accessed by security expert who guessed password ‘maga2020!’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85QiwL7qiU">Krystal and Saagar: The WORST Moments From The Big Tech Congressional Hearing</a>  <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/scoop-polls-show-support-for-tech-antitrust-action/">Scoop: Polls show support for tech antitrust action</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/for-tech-ceos-capitol-hill-is-now-mandatory-c0da9092-f9af-4e5c-a24d-04867979dccc.html">For tech CEOs, Capitol Hill is now mandatory</a>   2. And so regardless of who wins tomorrow (or whenever they figure out the results), there’s still a pandemic going on. 2021 will see us continue building on all the trends from&nbsp;2020. <p>Here’s Ina&nbsp;Fried:</p><blockquote>The big picture: As mentioned above, tech faces pressures on the privacy and antitrust fronts, but the pandemic has also accelerated the digitization of even the most change-resistant parts of society, including health&nbsp;care.</blockquote><p>And Karen&nbsp;Weise:</p><blockquote>“It is a ‘big, getting bigger’ moment in general we’re seeing. Which ties in, of course, to the antitrust focus and stuff that’s happening right now. The pandemic is obviously aberrational, but we’ve seen that everything reinforces existing patterns in many&nbsp;ways.”</blockquote><p>Nothing we didn’t already know. 2021 will be an exciting year for GlobaliD.</p> 3. If election results won’t have much of an impact on Big Tech’s path, a Biden win could hurt Facebook. <p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>If Democrats sweep to power next week, as several pollsters predict, Facebook’s already lowly political fortunes are likely to take a sharp turn for the worse, Democratic congressional staffers and lobbyists say.</blockquote><blockquote>While the entire tech industry is fighting off demands by lawmakers for more regulation, Facebook is especially hard up for friends in Democratic circles, which could leave it on the outside as a possible Biden administration and Democratic Congress debate the future of the tech industry. Inside Facebook, some executives are bracing themselves for a tougher time if the political pendulum swings away from the Republicans, said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent years, Democrats’ ire toward Facebook has grown because of a perception that the social media app has become a conduit for President Trump and right-wing groups to spread disinformation and dehumanizing speech. They are still seething over Facebook’s failure to identify and block Russian actors from spreading disinformation to aid Trump during the 2016 presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>“Facebook is seen as having sucked up to the Trump administration and had a profoundly negative effect on the culture of America and — in particular — of political dialogue,” said Blair Levin, a Washington-based policy analyst for New Street Research, a boutique Wall Street research&nbsp;firm.</blockquote><p>The end&nbsp;result?</p><blockquote>But a swing in political power to the Democrats could further minimize the company’s role in critical debates looming in Congress over the next year. Those debates are expected to include proposals to reform antitrust laws, aimed at making it easier for regulators to force tech companies to unwind their past acquisitions and to change the legal immunity that protects them from lawsuits over user-posted content. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was among a handful of tech CEOs who appeared at a Senate committee hearing to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides that legal immunity.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-fb-3q-earnings-report-2020-11603992607?mod=djem10point">Facebook Posts Record Revenue Despite Ad&nbsp;Boycott</a>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2020-earnings-204642328.html?mc_cid=6fb48796ba&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">Facebook is losing users in the US and&nbsp;Canada</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-facebook-has-the-most-to-lose-from-biden-democratic-victories">Why Facebook Has the Most to Lose From Biden, Democratic Victories</a>   4. Speaking of Facebook, they recently launched their new streaming game app, but it won’t be available on&nbsp;iOS. <p>Because Apple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/26/facebook-launches-cloud-games-on-desktop-and-android-but-not-on-ios.html">won’t allow&nbsp;it</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook could bring cloud gaming to iOS if it enables the new product on the mobile web version of its service, but the company wants users to go to its apps instead, said Jason Rubin, Facebook’s vice president of special gaming initiatives.</blockquote><blockquote>“We don’t want people going to web Facebook 20 times a day. We have a great app,” Rubin said. “We would have to use Apple’s technology and browser on iOS, and that isn’t optimized to the benefit of cloud&nbsp;games.”</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook cloud gaming on iOS would allow iPhone and iPad users to find out what games their friends are playing, see lists that show top games on Facebook or play games with Facebook-unique features, Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“In many ways, consumers are being hampered,” Rubin&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 5.

That credential had to be acquired in a way that demonstrated consent, and presented for verification to a verifier in a way that allowed for selective disclosure of personal information. The solution had to support the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Verifiable Credential Data Model</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards/specifications</a>.

					 <p>As the developer platform for verifiable credentials, Trinsic has focused on abstracting the complexities of advanced open source technologies and protocols away into easy-to-use APIs &amp; SDKs used by hundreds of developers. We’ve also pioneered digital wallets in both technology and user experience, releasing the first wallet to achieve multi-vendor interoperability and introducing the iconic card-like UI which has other vendors around the world following suit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are pleased to launch the next big innovation for our developers and mobile app users.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing interactive connections 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At Trinsic, we seek to provide developers with the best, most flexible tooling for implementing any use case. That’s why after <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">pioneering connectionless credential exchange</a>, we’re now pleased to support connections that are more useful and powerful than ever before. This brings flexibility and additional functionality to the hundreds of developers and companies that build on Trinsic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Current digital wallet implementations fall short of the vision of self-sovereign identity (SSI) because they only allow wallet holders to respond to, not initiate, interactions with institutions. This reduces wallet holders to a passive role, which at best delivers suboptimal utility to the holder, and at worst can reinforce the unhealthy power asymmetries between institutions and people that exist today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections solve this problem by creating a two-way street between a wallet holder and an institution. Instead of a passive responder, the wallet holder is a peer who can initiate actions of their own. In addition, wallet holders can interact not only with institutions, but also with other wallet holders, to communicate securely and share verified information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interactive connections are supported in the new Trinsic Wallet 3.1.0 release available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streetcred-identity-agent/id1475160728">App Store for iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.streetcred.apps.mobile">Play Store for Android</a>. Like the other features in the Trinsic platform, interactive connections will continue to evolve over time based on the needs of our developer community. We’ve implemented four new features that help us get closer to the rich interactions people should expect with SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Proactive credential sharing  Interoperable chat messaging  Activity log  Connection invitation

					 <p>Historically, wallet holders couldn’t share information from their credentials unless someone requested it through something called a verification request (or ‘proof’/’presentation’ request). That means you wouldn’t be able to share, for example, your business card with a new connection, or your address with someone who needed directions to your home, unless those people somehow conjured up a presentation request to send you first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can now share information from your credentials in a way that others can verify instantly conveniently from the Trinsic Wallet. When sharing credentials proactively, make sure 1) you and your connection are using the same network and 2) both of you have the Trinsic Wallet mobile app open throughout the credential sharing process.</p>

					 <p>Basic messaging functionality has been highly-requested ever since we removed messaging during our rebrand from Streetcred ID to Trinsic. It was a <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2019/06/did_messaging_a_batphone_for_everyone.shtml">favorite feature of many</a>. Use cases range from the practical—eg., what if your name was misspelled in a credential offer—to the critical—developers in the UK and USA have created local contact tracing solutions using messaging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We chose to implement the feature using DIDComm—specifically the Aries Basic Message <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message">RFC 0095</a>—and display it in a chat-like interface on the Trinsic Wallet. That means messaging is interoperable between Trinsic and any other Aries-based implementations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Integrating communication and credential exchange tightly in a single experience ensures developers have the tools they need to create rich experiences with their users. The Trinsic API supports messaging (in beta) and has been used to send thousands of messages by a handful of developers. Our next release will include full messaging support in the API, SDKs, and documentation.</p>

					 <p>A historical log of activities with a given connection can now be found in the chat interface of the mobile application. You can view:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  messages you’ve sent or received  credentials you’ve shared or received  credentials others have shared with you  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our beta testers unanimously preferred embedding the activity inline with chat messages. At Trinsic, we frequently call upon familiar mental models to explain complex topics, like we did by introducing the credential card design to the market. Displaying historical credential exchange in a chat-like format invokes a similarly familiar mental model, making credential exchange even more accessible to people everywhere.</p>

 IDX and SkyDB join forces for a future of Web3 hackathon  The hackathon lasts through Nov.&nbsp;23 <p>In recent months, the Web3 ecosystem has seen an explosion of of new tools and platforms that allow developers to build mature, sophisticated dweb applications with functionality that was previously unimaginable.</p><p>To celebrate this evolution in Web3, <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX</a> is teaming up with <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a> to kick off a hackathon which gives you the opportunity to experiment with and build applications that combine these two new technologies. Our teams are offering a combined $12,000 in rewards paid out in Siacoin (SC), and to make things even sweeter there’s a consolation prize paid out to every eligible submission.</p><p>The hackathon kicks off today November 2nd on <a href="https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/skydb/onboard">Gitcoin</a>, and lasts for three weeks until November 23.

We’re more than happy to help discuss your IDX integration with&nbsp;SkyDB.   Build apps on a next-gen Web3&nbsp;stack <p><a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skydb-a-mutable-database-for-the-decentralized-web-7170beeaa985">SkyDB</a> is a decentralized database system built on <a href="https://siasky.net/">Sia</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX</a> is a decentralized identity system built on <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>. By combining these two technologies, developers can easily build full-stack, data-rich applications that give users direct control and full ownership over their information — all without running servers or siloing information to a particular key pair, application, or database technology.</p> SkyDB: A mutable DB for dweb&nbsp;apps <p>The SkyDB database allows developers to build any feature that requires a decentralized, mutable key-value store. Being able to store user and/or application data in a mutable but decentralized way opens up a world of new possibilities for dweb applications. You can use it to store user-generated content, files, media, application state, or any other type of dynamic information without worrying about managing one-off skylinks for each individual content update.

IDX provides a universal cross-platform identity (DID) for users that can be used everywhere across the Web3 ecosystem, a way to store/access public metadata such as profiles and social graphs, a way to associate your app’s data storage systems (i.e. SkyDB) to the user’s identity, a way to discover and import available third-party data sources for the user (even ones outside of the SkyDB ecosystem such as Filecoin files, TextileDBs, OrbitDBs, and much more!), and a way to publish schemas for your data so that others might easily make use of your application data within another application or&nbsp;context.</p><p>By design, IDX is completely agnostic as to which wallet users authenticate with and which backend configuration you choose to build with — including any blockchain and data storage system — so it easily integrates into the rest of your stack and allows you to build truly cross-platform interoperable applications. You can save data wherever you choose, and import data from other applications that may even be outside of the SkyDB ecosystem!</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX: A Devkit for Open Identity</a></p><p>// Good luck to all the hackers!

   Get Started With Our Identity Platform as a Service Checklist&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Every organization is looking to transition from legacy systems to a more modern IT infrastructure by leveraging cloud for cost savings, better user experiences, new revenue streams, and greater employee productivity. Why then have only 25% of organizations achieved their initial IT modernization objectives?&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.insightcdct.com/getattachment/cf7658e2-9678-496b-96e4-534094f3ccb5/The-2020-IDG-survey-ebook.aspx">IDG survey</a>, “The State of IT Modernization 2020,” organizations struggle to modernize, in part because they lack a clear strategy. Figuring out the best path forward is complicated. Most likely you’ve got a combination of competing priorities, outdated processes and tools, aging infrastructure, lack of in-house expertise, insufficient budget, and operational limitations around application development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modernizing your identity and<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management"> access management </a>(IAM) toolset is no exception. Determining the best strategy to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernize IAM</a> and leveraging a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud IAM platform</a> can also be a challenge. Identity drives user experiences, engagement, and productivity. If done right, you defend your organization and users — whether employees or consumers — against compromised accounts and data breaches, as well as differentiate your organization by providing exceptional user journeys. So what steps can you take to modernize IAM while taking infrastructure into account? You can start here by reading our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">Identity Cloud Checklist: Top 10 Considerations and Best Practices to Strategize IAM in the Cloud</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Don’t Compromise when Modernizing IAM&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>When it comes to modernizing IAM, many organizations settle for one of the following:</p>

  Switch to a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/evolution-idaas-saas-delivered-iam">IDaaS</a>-delivered IAM model built on simplicity and ease of use but supports&nbsp; limited use cases and cannot adequately support legacy, on-premises IAM systems, applications, and things.&nbsp; 
	 Stick with a legacy on-premises identity solution that offers fuller feature sets, but is complex, difficult to maintain, and offers no clear roadmap to get you to the modern security and useability features and functionality you ultimately need.&nbsp; 
	 Build an in-house cloud or hybrid solution – that is, if you have the skill set to build it and then keep maintaining and tuning it.&nbsp; 
	 Acquire multiple point IAM solutions that can only address specific use cases with no feature parity across deployment models, be it on-premises, private cloud, public cloud, hybrid, or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multicloud-hybrid-cloud-identity-solution">multi-cloud</a>.&nbsp; 
 <p>All these options have shortcomings, and none can provide the enterprise functionality that you need to support users and secure on-premises and cloud applications at scale. Additionally, as priorities and strategies shift, you need an IAM solution that can move with you. Cloud has played a significant role in how organizations modernize and secure user experiences but cloud is not a one size fits all solution. Many organizations operate in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">hybrid</a> world today, yet traditional options don’t make it easy for you to modernize. In fact, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3985689/understanding-cloud-data-management-architectures-hybrid">Gartner</a> states the majority of enterprises using data in the cloud will be living in a hybrid — and likely multicloud — deployment world for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

 Planning for the Future 

<p>If you haven’t already, you should start thinking about how to future-proof your IAM strategy. Look for an IAM solution that can be <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">easily deployed across any environment</a> to fit business needs as they evolve. You should also think about use cases and business outcomes. For example, you might find that initially you need to secure identity for employees, and, later, for your workforce, consumers, citizens, and things.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tailoring your IAM solution for your industry is also important. For example, if you are in a regulated industry, you will most likely need an identity cloud solution that can coexist with on-premises solutions, provide true <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/107430026/whitepaper/forgerock-identity-cloud-security-whitepaper.pdf">data isolation</a>, enable fine-grained transactional <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/authorization">authorization</a>, and integrate with leading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network#trust-network-frm">anti-fraud solutions</a>. If you are in healthcare, you will need to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">manage identity relationships</a> – such as parent and child and doctor and patient – and incorporate these relationships into <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/profile-and-privacy-management-dashboard">access and authorization decisions.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>And, of course, overall functionality, security, feature parity, availability, vendor support, and cost must also be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s lots to think about. Fortunately, we’ve taken the guesswork out of what to consider as you either start or evolve your identity strategy with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">Identity Cloud Checklist</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are just a few examples of the ways in which businesses accelerated digital business to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">respond</a> in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37577"]</p>
<p>“The onset of COVID-19 spurred rapid action to get digital commerce; contactless, remote customer relationships; remote learning; and working from home up and running within days and weeks,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/15859">Kristin Moyer</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “As Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) put it, ‘We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">Why Now Is the Time to Accelerate Digital</a></p>
<p>CEOs and boards want to accelerate digital business. Moyer says, “Great, there’s momentum. But I’ve never spoken with an executive leading digital business who says they’re trying to go as slow as possible. The real question is, how do you go faster?”</p>
<p>Gartner has identified four digital business accelerators that will help executive leaders make faster digital business progress through quick fixes, smart tactics and new directions.</p>
<p></p>
 Tactic No. 1: Win different 
<p>The pandemic uncovered new customers and sources of demand for businesses. Some organizations pivoted to new products and opportunities using existing systems. Now is the time to explore new business models, operating models and platforms to operationalize those opportunities. To win differently over the short-, medium- and long-term, executives should employ:</p>

 Quick fixes 
 
 Interview customers about their current challenges and needs 
 Speak directly to end users through the service contact center 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Drive deeper digitalization and intelligence into existing products 
 Enable more contactless customer interactions on a continuum of 100% digital to 100% human 
 
 New directions 
 
 Set up a strategy think tank to explore digital opportunities that are adjacent to their core market 
 Create a “virtual global tour” video of what’s going on digitally in their industry 
 
 Tactic No. 2: Unleash force multipliers 
<p>A force multiplier is an action that powers momentum. Multipliers can come through internal actions, such as a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">business model innovation</a> workshop. They can also come through external actions, such as an acquisition that enables moves into new geographic or product markets. Force multipliers can include:</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Ask every board member to bring an example of a digital business that impressed them to the next supervisory board meeting 
 Host product digitalization creativity workshops 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Launch an open <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-prepare-for-increased-digital-innovation/">innovation</a> challenge focused on new digital product opportunities 
 Sketch an “anti-strategy” — state what your company won’t do and what it won’t be 
 
 New directions 
 
 White-label a product or service from a digital-native partner 
 Empower business technologists (employees outside of IT who have technical skills) with self-service, automation and reuse 
 
 Tactic No. 3: Banish drags 
<p>A drag is a negative internal or external force that adds friction to the business. Examples of external drags are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cio-agenda-2021-invest-in-your-supply-chain-before-its-too-late/">supply chain disruptions </a>or government shutdowns. Internal drags include outdated processes or legacy systems. Ideas to banish drag include:&nbsp;</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Cancel large-scale, pre-crisis, non-digital programs&nbsp; 
 Fortify digital productivity by using crisis culture hacks focused on hope, belonging, agency and pride 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Use robotic process automation (RBA) to drive even deeper back-office automation 
 Shorten the decision distance by removing steps and intermediaries that come between experts and decision makers 
 
 New directions 
 
 Embed work design assessments into talent management activities to better sync work design with how work gets done 
 Formalize how processes can flex by creating boundaries for autonomy and proceeding with consent rather than waiting for consensus 
 
 Tactic No. 4: Redirect resources 
<p>The majority of CFOs report delaying capital investments. At the same time, they hope to redirect pandemic-related savings from areas like travel and entertainment to growth-oriented programs. Executives can recapture resources and redeploy them using tactics such as:</p>
 Quick fixes 
 
 Shut down marginal and low-volume non-digital channels or initiatives 
 Freeze enhancements to programs that will be less essential in a COVID world 
 
 Smart tactics 
 
 Shift more work from complex sourcing providers to gig workers 
 Create a talent marketplace to match internal skills to the initiatives that need them 
 
 New directions 
 
 Rightsize real estate leases and assets for a hybrid workforce 
 Sell legacy assets or business units that don’t align with the company’s digital future 
 Shift travel and entertainment savings to SaaS and cloud acceleration

The team at Meeco is excited to announce we rolled out major releases to our sandbox environment, publicly available SDKs, and other tools at the end of October. And drumroll please: we have released the new version of the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">Developer Portal</a>!




 




Among the features we’re rolling out, some of the highlights are detailed below. But first, we wanted to chat with Meeco’s Chief Product Officer, Jan Vereecken on why we’re developing these tools, our roadmap and his longer-term vision.




 Why is Meeco building developer-centric tools? 




Jan: Storing, retrieving and sharing data in a secure way is not easy. Right from its inception, this has been one of the focal points for Meeco. First of all, there are technical issues to solve but as a company, we are always thinking about the user experience.




<blockquote>We’re always asking ourselves… “we have the technology but what are the consequences for anyone that will use our technology?” <p></p></blockquote>




How can we create applications that behave in a very similar way as they do today but where privacy and security are built-in from the very foundation? Where raw data is only ever visible as close to the user as possible, namely on a device or computer running the web browser. Over the years we have been active in this space, we’ve built many applications for a variety of use cases, each time expanding, improving and refining our personal data management tools and products.




 




Last year, we had the chance to build the <a href="https://www.kbc.be/retail/en/products/payments/self-banking/on-your-smartphone/mobile/digital-safe.html">Digital Safe</a> for the Belgian retail bank <a href="https://www.kbc.be/retail/en.html">KBC</a>, which was awarded the <a href="https://kbc.be/bestbank">Best Bank </a>award for the fifth consecutive time. Just last week, Meeco was awarded a <a href="https://thefinnies.org.au/2020-finnies-award-winners/">Fintech Australia Finnie for Industry Collaboration and Partnerships</a> for this solution.



This focus on enabling our partners was how the idea of opening up our tools emerged. We wanted to make our internal tools available and release libraries that make it possible for other developers to build front end applications. Being able to integrate this capability with all the possibilities that come with it means more collaboration and better outcomes for people.<br>




<blockquote>“We want to position Meeco as a set of components that you can use in your product and make a better value proposition.”

</blockquote>




For me, it’s really important to eat our own dog food. Everything we release on the developer portal is used internally. The <a href="https://docs.meeco.me">Meeco docs</a> for example, is the first thing a developer reads when joining the company as it introduces them to the terminology and enables them experiment and develop an general understanding of what we are doing really quickly.




 




For us as a company, it is also a really good way to understand where we are missing certain information or when something is out of date. The idea behind it is actually dead simple, what is usable for us, also is for other companies.<br>




<blockquote>“For me, it is really important to eat our own dog food. Everything we release on the developer portal is used internally.” 



</blockquote>




Since launching the Developer Portal earlier this year, we have been delighted by the increasing interest from organisations and developers to build on our platform. More and more we hear that it’s the fastest way to manage the complexity of data privacy and make it simple to get started. We’re inspired by the organisation that want to tackle this problem in earnest. In the same way as a lot of people nowadays don’t start building their own database, logging infrastructure or cloud infrastructure, we want to position Meeco as a set of components that you can use in your product to make a better value proposition for people without asking them to trade their privacy for convenience. With our tools, it is possible to have both.








 What does this release mean for Meeco? 





<blockquote>“In scope, this change was truly massive. The team has been hard at work to make this possible and I believe it gives us a solid foundation to build upon.”





</blockquote>




Jan: I think this release, which is the 4th generation of our platform, emphasises our desire to open up the platform and invite others. We have been building and improving the software for quite some time and as a consequence we have a lot of experience in this space. Now we are making it easy for others to unlock the potential of our secure data vault, encryption tools and UI components.




 




This release opens up all of these possibilities for other developers to explore our product, read (in detail) documentation and make use of our tools. I always like to advise someone new to, at least, do the 15 minute <a href="https://docs.meeco.me/getting-started/quickstart">quickstart</a>. It allows you to create a new user account and save your first item to the vault. This seems trivial but if you read what is needed, there is actually a lot going on. The information is there, the code is there, the next step is simply to build. In scope, this change was truly massive. The team has been hard at work to make this possible and I believe it gives us a solid foundation to build upon.




 What other features are on the roadmap for Meeco? 





<blockquote>“Always, increasing security whilst focussing on usability. This combination is exactly what we are good at.” 

</blockquote>




Jan: We have a few really exciting upcoming features we are working on, but the ones I would like to point out are Delegated access, Meeco Identity Provider (Meeco IdP) and Wallet.




 





  Delegated access is a feature that allows users to do certain actions in another users’ vault. The first use case which uses this feature is the upcoming <a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it platform</a>, where grown-ups take control over what happens in the vault of their children. For example, how can mum and dad, both control what happens inside the vault of their child, while ensuring that all data is only every decrypted and encrypted on their respective devices. The tricky part here is the key management. You see, all encryption keys need to be shared between these users, without a middleman knowing that secret.  





 





  Meeco IdP is a service that we’ll extract out of existing services into a separate component. The goal here is twofold. On one hand, we are trying to simplify, where you’ll only need one access token to access all our services (vault, keystore, downloader) instead of a separate access token per service. On the other hand, we are also looking at better enterprise interoperability and tools that help us tap into standard flows (e.g. <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>). In our “lab”, we are also experimenting with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/did-siop">Self-Issued OpenID Connect Provider DID profile</a> (SIOP), a new way to authenticate yourself in a new, more decentralised, world.  





 





  We are seeing more and more use cases that can be powered by the use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">DIDs</a>. We are building a decentralised Wallet that stores, verifies and presents these credentials to interested parties. The accelerated adoption that we are seeing cause of what is happening in 2020 is something that we are investing in heavily. Our existing services, Vault and Keystore are also complimentary as we have observed in market that people want more possibilities, increased security but still with a focus on usability. This combination is exactly what we are good at.  





 





 What is your long term vision for the developer tools? 




Our personal data platform and developer tools are a core offering in Meeco. We want to make the components available and make it easy to use and integrate our tools to enable people and organisations to collect and protect data. First and foremost, we test everything by building with it first. If it helps us create better security, enable more user control, provide privacy by default or seamless enterprise integration, then it makes sense it will also help our partners. I am confident that others will also find them as useful once they invest a few hours and see what is possible.




 




We’ll keep improving the portal, tools and resources based on the feedback that we receive, so we would love to hear from you. We trust that these changes will bring lots of exciting possibilities for developers all over the world to enable everyone on the planet to collect, protect and permission their personal data.




 




You can see a list of the upcoming changes for the October 2020 release<a href="https://docs.meeco.me/releases"> here</a>  including a high-level summary of new and updated features such as:




 





  On-sharing – the ability to allow other users to share an item that has been shared with you if the item’s owner allows it. This includes a verification step to make sure the on-sharer has not modified the data.  





  Organisations – you can now create an account for your organisation and add members and services.  





  Accepting of shares – we’ve identified that sometimes the terms of a share need to be reviewed and explicitly accepted or rejected before seeing the data so we’ve now made this possible.  





  More efficient file attachments – we now have the ability to encrypt and upload an attached file one chunk at a time. This allows for handling of larger files, better performance on lower end devices, and even streaming of downloaded encrypted data into video players.  





  Improved Sharing – sharing is more streamlined, comprehensible and performant than ever before.  





  Sharing of encrypted files with other users.  





  Re-encrypting of shared data to cut down on the number of Encryption Keys needed to be stored/managed indefinitely.  




There are a range of other changes that will continue to be released between now and the end of the year. You will always find the latest information in our changelogs.




 




In the meantime, if you have any suggestions or queries please don’t hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@meeco.me">info@meeco.me</a>, we look forward to hearing from you!

Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@louishansel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Louis Hansel @shotsoflouis</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hammer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>Transmute builds solutions that solve real business problems. For this reason, we support a number of different decentralized identifier (DID) methods. While we are committed to providing optionality to our customers, it’s equally important to communicate the selection criteria behind these options so that customers can consider the tradeoffs of underlying DID-methods alongside the problem set they’re solving for. Essentially, we help them pick the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p> In the spirit of sharing and improving as an industry, here are the work-in-progress criteria we use to help customers assess what DID method is best for their use&nbsp;case:  Interoperability <p>This DID method meets the interoperability requirements of my business, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Other parties can verify my DID&nbsp;method.  I can switch out this DID method in the future if my business needs&nbsp;change.   Security <p>This DID method meets the security requirements of my business, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Approved cryptography for jurisdiction/industry  Ledger/anchoring preferences  Key rotation/revocation   Privacy <p>This DID method meets privacy requirements relevant to my use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Identifiers of individuals (data privacy and consent priorities)  Identifiers for companies (organization identity and legal protection priorities)  Identifiers for things (scaling, linking, and selective sharing priorities)   Scalability <p>This DID method meets the scalability needs of my business use case, for&nbsp;example:</p>  Speed  Cost  Stability/maturity   Root(s) of&nbsp;Trust <p>This DID method appropriately leverages existing roots of trust that have value for my business or network (or it is truly decentralized). For&nbsp;example:</p>  Trusted domain  Existing identifiers/ identity&nbsp;systems  Existing credentials  <p>We are currently using and improving these criteria as we co-design and implement solutions with customers.</p><p>For example, our commercial importer customers care a lot about ensuring that their ecosystem can efficiently use the credentials they issue (interoperability) without disclosing sensitive trade information (privacy). Government entities emphasize interoperability and accepted cryptography. Use cases that include individual consumers focus more on data privacy regulation and control/consent. In some instances where other standardized identifiers already exist, DIDs may not make sense as primary identifiers at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Examples of DID methods Transmute helps customers choose from today include: Sidetree Element (did:elem, Ethereum anchoring), Sidetree Ion (did:ion, Bitcoin anchoring), Sidetree Photon (did:photon, Amazon QLDB anchoring), did:web (ties to trusted domains), did:key (testing and hardware-backed keys), and&nbsp;more.</p> How do you think about selecting the right DID method for the&nbsp;job? <p>Let’s improve this framework together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/did-customer-4ca8b7957112">did:(customer)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) promises to deliver innovation and value in every industry for a variety of use cases. It’s already picking up steam in financial services, healthcare, and government sectors around the world. But in order to get widespread adoption, sustainable business cases need to be developed—not just use cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our recent expert-panel webinar, “Making Money with SSI,” we dive in to the details of creating a business out of SSI from experts who’ve done it. Whether you missed the webinar or just want to refer back to the best parts, we’ve got you covered with a full recording.

			 Intro to the business of SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before we got into the meat of the webinar, Riley Hughes, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Trinsic, kicked us off by briefly defining <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) and discussing the business value of SSI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He began by simplifying human identity into two parts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Intrinsic identity:&nbsp;This is what we see when we look in the mirror. It’s our gender identity, political identity, or cultural identity. It’s who we are in the context of our relationships with our closest confidants. It’s intrinsic to us and is the truest form of identity.  Extrinsic identity:&nbsp;This is how others, often institutions, identify us. A driver’s license is the most ubiquitous example. Although intended to prove your eligibility to drive on public roads, it is also how financial institutions, airports, and bars identify you. It works because institutions trust the DMV, and with a driver’s license, you always have the DMV vouching for you. And it isn’t limited to government ID—educational, professional, and membership credentials all work this same way.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Social sites, blogs, and other internet platforms help people express their intrinsic identity. However, up until now, there has not been a good way to share your extrinsic identity online. SSI is the answer to that problem because it reduces transaction costs of verification. Riley explains this concept in the video below.</p>

<p>Today, Apple Music, Spotify and other online music services allow several members of a family to access the same service plan using their own individual accounts. Does it sound familiar to you? The “family model” is also seen in popular services such as Nintendo Switch Online, YouTube Premium, etc.</p>
<p>A clear benefit of the family model is that the members of the household don’t need to share an account and password. This frees you from many problems: have you ever started playing movies in Netflix only to notice later that you chose the wrong profile by mistake? The mess is done: you’ve mixed your preferences and viewing history with your kids. Not to mention the security risks of sharing passwords and account access, and the lost revenue from companies whose users share a single account. A well-designed family model delivers one of the principles of good Identity and Access Management: every member has their own user account and credentials to access your services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And family plans aren’t exclusive of pure-online services. Think of a traditionally offline business – an amusement park, determined to get 90% of their customers to use its brand new mobile app. A child will use the app, but naturally without the same full admin access as mum or dad, such as being able to buy services, delete the account.</p>
<p>Now you might be thinking, is the family model valuable for entertainment only? Certainly not. The family model can also work miracles for a utility such as electricity distribution, or a mobile operator. Some mobile network operators such as <a href="https://www.moi.fi/liittyma-lapselle">Moi</a> (Finland) and <a href="https://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/phones-tablets/bt-mobile-family-sim-controlling-your-sims-11364143992036">BT</a> (UK) offer family plans. Let’s say David pays the bill and uses a family manager user interface to create accounts for his wife and kids and assign them credits to spend.</p>
<p>In all the previous cases, the family manager created the other users’ accounts, assigned them a role, and gave them certain access authorisation or the possibility to use credits. Not money, but access to or credits for a paid service.</p>
<p>The family model is identity delegation in its most basic form. To see the full power of identity delegation, let’s imagine this. What if when you create an account, the assigned role allows the user to:</p>
 
 Collaborate on a highly-sensitive project 
 Exercise power of attorney 
 Order products on behalf of your employer (partners and suppliers) 
 
<p>Now I will share with you three core use cases of how digital services across different industries can unleash the power of identity delegation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 [1] Collaborate on a highly-sensitive project 
<p>Another high value activity is to work on a sensitive project online, which is protected. A team of entrepreneurs is building an innovative product; let us say a Water Purification System. All is going well but the next phase in their plan requires external funding, so the team will apply for funding from a governmental agency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The application is 100% online and every user must authenticate to “using a verified identity, with strong authentication. The entrepreneurs start filling in all the forms, but they soon realise they need an accredited environmental specialist as nobody in the team can do a mandatory assessment. When the team finds the suitable specialist, Mr Park, the CEO, Scott Long, uses StartupCashPortal to send him an invitation (‘Add new user’) to contribute to the project. First, Mr Park opens the email invitation and then uses bank authentication to prove his identity, then he has access to the system to modify only the section of the funding application that concerns him.</p>
<p>As you see, this B2B use case of identity delegation gets even more interesting, but there is not money involved yet. The main benefit is that the third-party individual gains access to collaborate on sensitive information in a secure way with a verified identity. Imagine if the wrong person gains access to other sensitive projects; the governmental agency could face lawsuits because of the data breach.</p>
<p>Two key elements made this use case possible:</p>
 
 Authentication with a verified digital identity (e.g. bank authentication, electronic national ID card, Mobile Connect) 
 Identity delegation, a building block of modern CIAM systems. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 [2] Exercise power of attorney 
<p>Taking a step forward, what would happen if a company offers delegation on its own platform in order to make monetary transactions?</p>
<p>Imagine that a few years back you inherited a house along with seven members of your family. Now you all want to sell the property, but everybody lives in a different city and it’s nearly impossible to meet and sign the agreement all together. Also, due to some force majeure one member of the family, Uncle Zach, can’t sign for himself and instead will need to give power of attorney to Beth.</p>
<p>Luckily Beth finds real estate agency RealtyPower. They have launched a digital service with electronic identity delegation, which allows the family to find the best buyer, sell the house and sign all documents (including showing Zach’s power of attorney to Beth) remotely, making the online transaction secure and seamless. Both the family and the real estate company saved time and money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Example 2 was a B2C case with a monetary transaction. The same scenario can become B2B if you replace members of a family with companies, all sharing a very valuable asset, as the ownership of an office building. As you can imagine, the biggest value is in full B2B use cases like the one that comes next – example 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 [3] Order products on behalf of your employer (partners and suppliers) 
<p>FairCrops, a company in the agriculture industry, has hundreds of partners and resellers and has a web service called AgroPortal, which gives “extranet” access to these companies. Bob is the CEO of one of these partners, Bob’s Corner, so he can log in, search for products on the AgroPortal database, and place a purchase order. As this order is on credit, AgroPortal must make sure that the user is indeed Bob, and so has rights to place an order.</p>
<p>One year later, Bob’s company experiences amazing growth and he hires two people to take care of orders: Purchasing Manager, Mary, and Purchasing Assistant, Fred. Both need different levels of purchasing rights, which starts to make things complex. Here, identity delegation comes in as the perfect solution. Bob assigns Mary an admin user role on AgroPortal, which allows her to create new users, delegate rights, assign roles, and revoke any permissions herself. Next, Mary digitally invites Fred to create an account with limited rights as the Purchasing Assistant. This advanced schema of identity delegation empowers the B2B customer and takes the heavy burden out of the agroindustry producer’s staff.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the portal should make a well-informed choice of authentication method to ensure a good level of security, appropriate to the situation. An easy approach would be identity federation using a business identity (e.g. AzureAD) between these two companies. If federation is not possible, a national identification or a biometric-based authentication service could be the next best choices.</p>



Company: FairCrops agroindustry producer
Partner: Bob’s Corner, chain of stores
e-service: AgroPortal, order products, get specialised customer service



<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Can you see your organisation embracing a variant of one of these use cases? Can you see it as part of the digital transformation you are working now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The nuts and bolts of identity delegation 
<p>One question you might be asking yourself is, ‘how do we implement identity delegation?’&nbsp; The brilliance of these use cases is that once launched they look so easy. However, the nuts and bolts of identity delegation lie on a deep expertise of:</p>
 
 Proof of identity. Every person using these digital services must have proved their identity to the identity provider (bank, government) first to enable the verified digital identity. 
 The selection of the right authentication method. Different methods are best for different industries and purposes. 
 A user has to obtain the right privileges to complete their task (e.g. sign an agreement) while sharing the minimum possible personal data with the digital servicebank, or the civil registry, has detailed personal data about you, but the online service (e.g. RealtyPower) only needs to know a few pieces of that data. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubisecure has the most flexible, agile and proven identity delegation solution available today: Delegated Authority. Cybersecurity analyst, KuppingerCole, said “Ubisecure has demonstrated its value specifically in scenarios with complex B2B2C relationships, where its strength in delegating access is a differentiator to other providers in the market.” Find out more about Delegated Authority <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/delegated-authority/">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Midsize enterprise (MSE) CIOs began 2020 leaning in to the need to equip their organizations for digital business with modern infrastructure and strategic use of automation. They still are doing so, but with more urgency, as the pandemic economy forces them to make the most of their people, platforms and data, and still protect the enterprise from security threats.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technologies cited in this Hype Cycle offer MSE IT leaders a high degree of benefit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“MSE CEOs are looking to technology enablement from technology, automation, business intelligence, data and digital, as the No. 1 way to improve productivity/efficiency within their organizations, says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/43526">Mike Cisek</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “The technologies cited in this Hype Cycle offer MSE IT leaders a high degree of benefit and applicability.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>The 41 technologies in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Midsize Enterprises, 2020 reflect these complementary priorities in IT, with a focus on three particular themes driving CIO investments.</p>
 
 Data-driven culture: CIOs are delivering the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-4-data-and-analytics-trends-for-midsize-enterprises/">data and analytics </a>infrastructure and capabilities business leaders need to understand and act on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/data-sharing-is-a-business-necessity-to-accelerate-digital-business/">data-driven insights</a>. 
 Risk-based security: Trends related to remote worker and edge infrastructure have accelerated the need to strengthen security and simplify how IT teams deliver it. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-balance-risk-trust-and-opportunity-in-an-uncertain-world/">Risk-based security</a> allows CIOs to focus on high-priority areas of risk in an efficient and cost-effective way. 
 Infrastructure utility: Modernizing legacy infrastructure is a high priority for MSEs to enable <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/mitigate-the-challenges-of-remote-work-for-an-mse/">remote work</a> and higher productivity. Infrastructure utility solutions support distributed workloads to securely navigate between on-premises infrastructure and cloud-native architectures.

<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1iM2E0OWMzZTE3YmUxMWViYTlmNDBhMGQ2NmZkZGI0Nw=="></a></p>
 Workplace analytics 
<p>What is it? Insights about employee experience, engagement, collaboration and productivity, based on data from workplace applications, network traffic, user devices and other sources.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Workplace analytics provide one input on the state of individual and team productivity and collaboration. Workplace analytics can offer insights about, for example, the business impact of a new tool or policy, or which team members are overburdened or underutilized. Challenges remain with how analytics solutions access and integrate data, and employee concerns about privacy can delay adoption.</p>
<p>Time is short. Enterprises are still working out how to best use workplace analytics, but the potential benefits are high and will drive rapid adoption over the next two to five years.</p>
 Citizen data science 
<p>What is it? Tools that automate aspects of data preparation, exploration, pattern detection and modeling to enable business users to get value out of data assets without needing an expensive and high-demand data scientist to do the work.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-mse-cios-guide-to-citizen-it/">Citizen data</a> science makes data insights more accessible and applicable across the organization, while helping to optimize the value delivered by scarce specialty data scientists. Citizen data scientists also contribute domain expertise to ensure data initiatives align with the needs of the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the next two to five years, citizen data science will become more widespread</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Citizen data science is an emerging capability that should transform how businesses design and deploy next-generation analytics and machine learning. Over the next two to five years, citizen data science will become more widespread as BI and data science platforms add more augmented analytics capabilities.</p>
<p>Look for collaboration opportunities between specialist data scientists and citizen data scientists, and work to educate and advocate with business units about user enablement, responsible use, data ethics and other key issues.</p>
 Managed detection and response (MDR) 
<p>What is it? A 24/7 security threat monitoring, detection and response service that leverages advanced analytics, threat intelligence and human expertise to prevent or minimize security breaches. MDR technologies and deployments currently focus on network and endpoint security, as well as monitoring the cloud.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">Gartner Top 9 Security and Risk Trends for 2020</a></p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? MDR services allow enterprises to secure their networks and reduce the complexity of identifying and investing in the right mix of in-house people, processes and technology. MDR solutions<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-strategic-cost-optimization-action-items-for-security-leaders/"> provide particular value for organizations</a> that want a single, turnkey solution or that lack the internal resources to respond to threats when they occur. MDR may not be right for businesses that have already invested in point solutions for network security, such as endpoint detection and response.</p>
<p>MDR solutions will continue to mature and increasingly deliver high value over the next two to five years.</p>
 Firewall as a service (FWaaS) 
<p>What is it? A multifunction security solution delivered as a cloud-based service to protect multiple satellite offices or remote users. FWaaS provides a more flexible and centralized way to deliver enterprise firewall features to multiple locations.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? FWaaS gives distributed organizations an efficient way to deliver secure internet connectivity to all work sites (including remote work sites). FWaaS competes with secure web gateways and web application firewalls to achieve many of the same aims. Interest in FWaaS will grow over the next two to five years as solutions integrate more closely with SD-WANs and prove consistently good latency across all endpoints.</p>
 Hybrid cloud 
<p>What is it? A combination of integrated public and private cloud services that operate as separate entities. Distinct from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-organizations-choose-a-multicloud-strategy/">multicloud</a>, which is the use of two different cloud service providers, hybrid cloud includes some enterprise-managed infrastructure with the addition of service integration, cross-service security, availability/disaster recovery and other useful capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Hybrid cloud theoretically combines the cost optimization and flexibility benefits associated with cloud with the control and compliance capabilities of private infrastructure. About 10% of MSEs have implemented hybrid cloud for availability/disaster recovery purposes, but that number is expected to grow rapidly. MSEs seek to optimize their resources as they explore new business opportunities that require flexible infrastructure. Expect high benefit from this still-immature technology.</p>
 Hyperconvergence 
<p>What is it? Designed for IT leaders who want simplified solutions, hyperconvergence is a building-block approach to deploying software and infrastructure. Hyperconvergence vendors use off-the-shelf infrastructure and packaged software, which they can deliver as a service or in a public cloud.</p>
<p>How does it benefit my organization? Hyperconvergence is attractive to enterprises seeking IT management simplicity. Hyperconvergence allows IT teams to deliver or add functionality more frequently through modular solutions, instead of requiring business stakeholders to wait for less frequent but bigger upgrades.</p>
<p>The acquisition cost of hyperconvergence may be higher than for three-tiered compute, storage and networking implementations, but the management efficiency is often better, leading to faster response times. MSEs can eventually expect lower operational costs, especially if they standardize on hyperconvergence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This post was authored by Dev Bharel, who helps lead the SSI initiative at GlobaliD.</p>The opening circle at&nbsp;IIW<p>Last week, GlobaliD attended the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW), a longstanding biannual (un)conference that focuses on building collaborative environments where developers can share ideas and work on open industry standards together.</p><p>The idea of an unconference is a reference to the event’s unique format, where rather than having a set agenda, participants huddle together every morning to define the topics and sessions of the day (typically socratic style conversations).</p><p>Free of business interests, you’ll often see direct competitors collaborating on the latest and greatest standards in the industry. Talks can range from very technical machinations (such as of Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) to more socially focused talks about how to build a more Ethical Digital&nbsp;World.</p><p>All of which culminates in a highly influential gathering that has been the birthplace of frameworks such as OpenID Connect along with tons of other identity technologies.</p> GlobaliD and&nbsp;SSI <p>Attending on behalf of GlobaliD were myself, Dev Bharel, and Alexis Falquier. We are <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> architects who have been working on the initiative of migrating GlobaliD to open SSI standards, namely Hyperledger Aries and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Indy</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> is an umbrella organization under the Linux Foundation that houses a number of open source projects. The two projects of note for identity are Indy, an identity specific blockchain and Aries, a framework to build cross-chain identity agents that interact with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity documents (DIDs).</p><p>Alongside Hyperledger, there are also a number of nonprofit organizations that participate in conversations involving these open standards — the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, all of whom have hosted various working groups around the interoperability of these standards across the wider digital landscape.</p> GlobaliD’s open source SSI frameworks <p>GlobaliD led two sessions at IIW to showcase some select&nbsp;work.</p><p>In our first session, we open sourced our iOS and Android native Aries frameworks and donated them to the Hyperledger Aries project. These frameworks can be used by any organization to create mobile native Aries agents to receive and hold verifiable credentials. The frameworks are the result of months of intense work at GlobaliD to incorporate Aries agents into our platform.</p> GlobaliD Groups for SSI governance <p>In our second session, we unveiled our Dynamic Governance API using GlobaliD Groups. Employing GlobaliD Groups addresses the challenge of dynamic governance on an Indy-based chain. By dynamically managing membership lists using Groups, verifiers of credentials no longer need to worry about the nitty gritty of issuers within their organizations. All they need to know are the key parent organizations they want to accept credentials. This is especially helpful as issuer lists grow and as individuals join and leave those organizations.</p> Stay tuned for&nbsp;more! <p>We had a blast at IIW31. We’ll be publishing a series of blog posts in the coming weeks highlighting our time at the conference including a deep dive into Governance and Guardianship as it applies to self-sovereign identity.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">GlobaliD shares SSI code at the Internet Identity Workshop</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

However, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/workforce-solutions/remote-workforce">working remotely</a> requires that employees remain diligent when accessing an employer’s systems and internal applications securely.

<p>By Mike Kubzansky, CEO, Omidyar&nbsp;Network</p><p>2020 has challenged and consumed us — as individuals and as a society. From the pandemic to politics, to the severe economic downturn and the desperate cries for Black lives to matter; too many across the country and around the globe are struggling — financially, physically, and mentally.</p><p>We are at times scared, or angry, or resigned, and a pervasive sense of helplessness underpins so much of current daily life, across whole swathes of society. Yet so many people have remained remarkably resilient and resolute. We have donned our masks and taken to the streets to peacefully protest, help at food banks, or simply serve as poll watchers. We have prayed, meditated, eaten (and then tried to exercise) our way through this year of chaos and uncertainty. Several of us even got new kittens or&nbsp;puppies.</p><p>While everyone has different coping mechanisms, there is one thing I hope we all do:&nbsp;vote.</p><p>As political scientist Larry Sabato said, “Every election is determined by the people who show up.” Whether it’s by mail, drop box, in person, early, or on election day (masked, of course), we must all show up. We believe deeply in democracy. It is the bedrock of this nation, and it will only be of, for, and by all the people if we all vote. That’s why Omidyar Network signed <a href="http://adayfordemocracy.com/">A Day for Democracy</a> pledge to give our staff in the US time off to vote and do their civic&nbsp;duty.</p><p>And when voters do their civic duty, their votes must be counted. We are proud of the work of our sister organization, <a href="http://democracyfund.org/">Democracy Fund</a>, and many of our grantees like <a href="http://communitychangeaction.org/">Community Change Action</a>, <a href="https://demosaction.org/">Demos Action,</a> <a href="http://citizen.org/">Public Citizen</a>, and <a href="http://jwj.org/">Jobs With Justice</a> for their ongoing efforts to dismantle barriers to voting, so that everyone who is eligible can vote with ease — <a href="http://www.protecttheresults.org/">and can trust that election outcomes are legitimate</a>, so that we have genuine majority rule by a full and fully empowered electorate. It’s also why I signed on to <a href="https://medium.com/world-justice-project/a-joint-appeal-to-protect-the-rule-of-law-in-the-2020-u-s-elections-1f1f6876b351">World Justice Project’s letter</a>, along with a number of other foundation presidents, demanding that the rule of law is protected to ensure the security and integrity of the elections.</p><p>We cannot let expediency outweigh accuracy. We must be patient as election officials do their jobs and count every vote, even if it takes extra time before a winner is declared. Ensuring that every vote is counted will enhance the legitimacy of the election and strengthen our democracy.</p><p>While democracy is not a focus area for Omidyar Network — nor is improving its functioning our mission — it weaves through much of our work to strengthen technology and the economy. And pluralism, if true to its ideals, should have spillover benefits that improve democracy.</p><p>In Responsible Technology, we know that online platforms with outsized power can ravage our democracy by allowing unfettered hate, bigotry, racism, antisemitism, and disinformation to run rampant. We support organizations leading the <a href="https://www.stophateforprofit.org/">#StopHateforProfit</a> campaign to call on Facebook to change its policies that inflame intolerance and undermine democracy. We also support <a href="https://graphika.com/">Graphika’s</a> investigations into domestic disinformation and potential foreign interference in the 2020 election, as well as its partnership with the <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/">Election Integrity Partnership</a>, which identifies instances aimed to “prevent or deter people from voting or to delegitimize election results.”</p><p>In our call to <a href="https://omidyar.com/our-call-to-reimagine-capitalism-in-america/">reimagine capitalism</a>, we recognize that democracy and the economy are fundamentally intertwined. We cannot address one without taking into account the other. Concentrated economic power too easily spills over into political power. That has resulted in policies that prevent the economic interests of the many from being fulfilled. We are working to address these imbalances, and support communities, working families, and small businesses to have greater power and voice in the economic decisions that impact their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>We also cannot reflect on American democracy without reflecting on race. The US is still not living up to its democratic ideal in which all people are created — and treated — as equal. In addition to the continued horror of the 164 Black individuals who have been killed by police through August, we see every day continued work <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">to disenfranchise and suppress voting by Black and brown voters</a>. So it’s not surprising that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/election-nonvoters.html">some voters drop out of the system and choose to simply not participate</a> — real change has been too slow to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We know that change won’t always happen as quickly as we would like — or many times need — but it will happen. Voting is the first step on this journey toward a more just and equal&nbsp;future.</p><p>As President Obama said in Philadelphia at a rally last week, “Voting’s about using the power we have, and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned, and more responsive, and more focused on you and your lives and your children, and your grandchildren, and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote, and then get some change, and then vote some more, and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it&nbsp;right.”</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/keep-voting-until-we-get-it-right-88e3cb4611ab">Keep Voting Until We Get it Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network">Omidyar Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/schuetze">Christopher Schuetze</a></p><p>15 to 20 years ago, a virus scanner&nbsp;– or let me call it Endpoint Protection&nbsp;– on your private or corporate computer was standard. Today, you must also have something like a virus scanner on your endpoint device. But in 2020, is it sufficient to detect viruses, worms, and rootkits or botnets like we did in the past? There have been a lot of changes in the way attackers try to steal data, get access to your computers, or even block you from working with your computer. This evolution must be part of your strategy for protecting your endpoints. It is called Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EDPR) – adding Detection and Response to your virus scanner.</p>
 Scanning suspicious files based on a signature is dead 
<p>I hope you agree that when it comes to endpoint protection, a classic virus scanner alone is no longer enough in the fight against the "bad guys". Anti-malware is necessary, but you need a lot more besides. And yes, security for endpoint devices plays a central role in your overall security strategy – you might also call it “Zero Trust” strategy. Endpoints today are way more than traditional PCs and notebooks. It is any device you interact with, including computers, virtual desktops, servers, smartphones, tablets, and IoT or SCADA devices. They all must be part of your strategy to prevent harm to your organization.</p>
<p>Investing into a single tool that can detect malware based only on patterns is very outdated because attackers are now focused on collecting data from your organization or blackmailing you via a ransomware attack. Attackers are continually trying to trick your employees into clicking on links to enter their credentials on a manipulated website or to download malware to get access to your organization. Your strategy must cover this, and EDPR meets this requirement.</p>
 Protection means to detect before, during, and after the execution 
<p>Protecting an endpoint is a broad field, and with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, it is changing a lot. Real AI is much more efficient in detecting creatively implemented malware which might use exploits and change its signature frequently. Detection at runtime is essential, but difficult. Traditional tools focus more on pre-execution detection based on a static signature of a piece of malware.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking more at the behavior of a malware and having tools which help to detect an attack, even after it happened, is also important. If attackers are currently in your system and preparing a bigger attack by infecting your servers with ransomware, for example, this needs to be detected. This is called post-execution and typically involves forensic analysis to enable organizations to respond to an attack even after it has begun.</p>
 The focus of such tools must be understood 
<p>Defining the broad range of use cases to protect an endpoint can be overwhelming at first. In light of this, it could be useful to consider the following:</p>
 
 Protecting your endpoints with a combination of detection and prevention features. The local agent should be able to prevent an employee from executing a compromised file, as well as be able to detect malware post-execution, based on more complex detection mechanisms. 
 Threat intelligence features should detect threats based on the behavior of the threat and knowledge from other attacks and be able to respond automatically to such an attack to prevent further harm to your organization. 
 Advanced alerting and reporting mechanisms can help to identify the health state of endpoints on a central dashboard and be able to react to threats by collecting relevant information. 
 
<p>Do you use already use tools like this in your organization? Is the device you are currently using part of this protection strategy?

 Celebrating early-adopter suppliers of data from health, IoT, AI, and&nbsp;more <p>Ocean Market is now live, offering new opportunities for data owners to monetize their data while preserving privacy and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Whether personal data such as browser history data or latent business data that companies have accumulated over time, Ocean Market helps unlock and monetize it in a secure&nbsp;fashion.</p><p>As with many emerging technologies, early-adopter data suppliers in Ocean Market stand to&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>First, assets registered early will attract more buyers and stakers since the Ocean Market still has a relatively small amount of inventory.</p><p>Being part of the first batch of data suppliers on Ocean Market increases the chances that the suppliers’ data assets will be discovered for consumption and/or staking. This in turn will improve the overall asset ranking (by stake) and could lead to an increase in the overall value of the dataset now and over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Second, early stage data providers will be among the first to gain insights and track data consumption and value patterns.</p><p>Early stage data providers will start earlier on the path in gaining a deep understanding of this new breed of data monetization. Some early stage data providers may even decide to apply this knowledge to setting up their own Ocean-powered data marketplace.</p> Getting in on the Ocean&nbsp;Floor <p>Being an early stage Data Launch Partner means being one of the initial providers of datasets on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Early stage data providers are comfortable making their data available — and making money by selling it. They can make it available either via direct downloads or using Ocean Compute-to-Data to preserve privacy and control. They understand that making their datasets available helps unlock latent value (profit potential) of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Being a Data Launch Partner does not necessarily require a deep technical mastery of blockchain or artificial intelligence. Rather, early stage data launch partners recognize the opportunity created by Ocean Market to unlock more value from their latent&nbsp;data.</p> Announcing our pioneer Data Launch&nbsp;Partners <p>We are proud to announce some of the first Ocean Market Data Launch Partners representing innovative data-driven projects in IoT, healthcare and artificial intelligence. These pioneer data partners will or have already registered a variety of valuable datasets on Ocean Market that can be bought / consumed or staked on by the community.</p> Human Protocol <p>The <a href="https://www.hmt.ai/">HUMAN Protocol</a> creates a blockchain based, two sided marketplace. On one side, it enables requests to label large volumes of data. On the other, it allows for the workers who complete this work to be evaluated and remunerated.</p> Swash <p><a href="https://swashapp.io/">Swash</a>, one of the world’s first digital Data Unions, is venturing into new waters by integrating with Ocean. Swash enables crowdsourced, zero-party data monetization where individuals are rewarded for the value of their data as they surf the web. Meanwhile, data buyers, like advertisers, market intelligence and analytics companies, AI/ML innovators, brands, and researchers, can access unique consumer insights at scale and with ease from all over the&nbsp;web.</p><p>By redistributing data profits and unlocking new data assets, Swash aims to rebalance the data economy by paying people for their everyday contributions while sourcing access to high-quality, diverse data, straight from the&nbsp;user.</p> Thalus.ai <p><a href="https://thalus.ai/">Thalus.AI</a> is a data privacy first company, harnessing advanced machine learning methods for novel research. Thalus.ai accelerates research by embodying the principles of focused data collection and minimization, and can mitigate many of the systemic privacy risks and costs resulting from traditional, centralized machine learning and data science approaches. Thalus.ai is rooted in research and holds deep expertise in natural language processing, bioinformatics &amp; software engineering. Their in-house annotated datasets together with their platform built on federated learning and differential privacy can empower effective research &amp; development.</p> Transport Genie <p><a href="https://www.transportgenie.ca/">Transport Genie</a> is a precision monitoring company that monitors local environmental conditions as assets in transit. Transport Genie’s novel and award winning IoT ecosystem can be used in multiple use cases ranging from livestock animals, equine, fruits and vegetables, companion pets, and also sensitive pharmaceutical deliveries. They deal with not just terrestrial transportation but also in oceanic environments. Transport Genie’s main tenet is to have data to enable smart decisions to happen through the implementation of their solution.</p> How to become and early stage data&nbsp;provider <p>To become an early stage data provider, you simply register your data or data services on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>The first step is identifying which datasets to register, and to make sure they are accessible online — this can either be as binary files (csv, xls, txt etc. any format) or a proxy server that serves up these files on&nbsp;request.</p><p>Then, to Ocean Market (<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">https://market.oceanprotocol.com</a>), connect your Web3 wallet (top left), and click on the “publish” button (top&nbsp;middle).</p> Updates <p>[Nov 13, 2020]: Removed CivicTechHub as a data launch partner, because they intentionally against the best interests of the Ocean community soon after launch.

<p>Enterprises across the globe have been trying to minimize and remove passwords for years. Security is an obvious reason why, as attacks featuring lost or stolen credentials account for<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/2020/results-and-analysis/"> 80% of breaches</a>. Productivity also is a factor, since the amount of time your employees spend each year entering, resetting and keeping track of passwords wastes time and drains resources.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite such valid concerns, for many companies getting rid of passwords has been more a stretch goal than a reality—but that’s about to change. Passwordless adoption no longer requires a significant hardware investment to get started, with advancements in multi-factor authentication (MFA) device-level biometrics like facial and fingerprint recognition providing alternatives to passwords. And many employees who are familiar with these technologies outside of work are aware of their speed and ease-of-use benefits, and therefore are more receptive to using them in the workplace.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

   The Role of KYC for CIAM and Where Learning From KYC Will Help You in Getting Better in CIAM 
<p><br>Many solutions in CIAM focus on authentication, while others have their strengths in integrating with marketing automation. However, there is an additional angle, relevant for both highly regulated industries but also any other industries. It is the onboarding process, regardless of whether specific KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements must be formally met or not.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger will talk about the role and approaches of Identity Verification in the context of CIAM and how this maps to the entire onboarding process as well as recurring authentication. He will look at new technologies such as DID (Decentralized Identity), but also discuss how registration can be simplified if lesser requirements apply – e.g. by rethinking the flow and putting registration and verification to the end (or even further back – think about using the first successful shipping as part of verification).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_kuppinger"></a>

   A Flexible, Adaptable Architecture Framework to Meet the Accelerating Demands of a Digital Enterprise 
<p>Consumer identity and access management (CIAM) has arrived in the business processes of digital enterprises. Customers, prospects, devices, things and their relationships are becoming increasingly important. At the same time, the innovation cycles for customer-oriented applications are becoming shorter and shorter. And CIAM itself is facing continuously changing challenges.</p>
<p>The service-oriented paradigm of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric provides the perfect foundation for a steady evolution. This applies both to the CIAM system itself and to CIAM as a building block of a company-wide identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thus the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric serves as the umbrella for an entire IAM architecture. It supports distinctive features for CIAM where required, while ensuring efficiency and reuse wherever possible.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_22_reinwarth"></a>

<p>At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province of New Brunswick in Canada needed to enable digital access to COVID-19 test results. Simeio, working with New Brunswick’s Provincial healthcare arm MyHealthNB delivered a digital identity solution. This enabled secure access which was validated against authoritative data sources to proof identity. This also allowed New Brunswick citizens to stay safe and practice social distancing by obtaining results securely and confidentially. <br> <br> COVID-19 has driven healthcare organizations to enable virtual support and digital tools in a short window. For the foreseeable future in a world of physical distancing, the need for digital services will drastically increase. Digital Identity is at the core of enabling this shift as it facilitates secure access.</p>




<p>Healthcare organizations are the most vulnerable from a modernization perspective due to years of lack of investment and focus. The COVID-19 pandemic has put added strain for hospital organizations to modernize and shift their mode of delivery to virtual care. This session will speak about a use-case that highlights challenges a Canadian Province faced and what tools and solutions were developed to deliver expedited access the COVID-19 test results in 18 days.</p>
<p><br> Participants will learn:<br> 1. How COVID-19 has driven healthcare organizations to enable virtual support and digital tools <br> 2. How the Province of New Brunswick in Canada enabled digital access to COVID-19 test results<br> 3. How Simeio worked with the Province to deliver a digital identity solution which deployed secure access to COVID-19 results in 18 days</p>

  <p>Earlier in 2020, the European Union published “A European Strategy for Data” outlining its vision for a connected single digital market where the benefits of the digital economy could enhance the lives of its citizens, residents and trade partners.</p>
<p>However, we now find ourselves at a very real crossroad. A post-pandemic world will be a new type of normal. Amidst the tragic loss of lives there have been breakthroughs in science, new ways of working along with embracing new digital tools.</p>
<p>We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase where just because technology can, doesn’t mean it should. Personal data linked to identity, fuelled by AI sits at the centre of these decisions.</p>
<p>Enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.</p>
<p>This session will focus on the implementation of real-world case studies including standards, commercial models and technology choices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_dow"></a>

Hot on the heels of the Justice Department antitrust lawsuit against Google, state and federal investigators are now setting their sights on Facebook. <p>The Washington Post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/23/facebook-ftc-states-lawsuit/">reports</a>:</p><blockquote>State and federal investigators are expected to file antitrust charges against Facebook as soon as November, according to four people familiar with the matter, embarking on a massive legal challenge against the tech giant and its perceived ironclad grip over social&nbsp;media.</blockquote><blockquote>The timing reflects a frenzy of recent activity on the part of the Federal Trade Commission, which met privately Thursday to discuss the probe, and state attorneys general, who under the leadership of New York’s Letitia James have been scrutinizing Facebook for potential threats to competition, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a law-enforcement matter.</blockquote><p>Some context:</p><blockquote>Federal officials initiated their antitrust probe into Facebook last year after the company agreed to pay $5 billion to settle a government probe over a series of privacy scandals. The FTC, one of the country’s two competition enforcement agencies, specifically set its sights on Facebook’s purchase of its past rivals — Instagram, a photo-sharing app, and WhatsApp, a messenger service — and the extent to which the tech giant’s sprawling corporate footprint has come to violate antitrust laws.</blockquote><blockquote>State investigators revealed their own plans last October: James, the Democratic attorney general of New York, said at the time she would lead 46 other states and territories in a bipartisan, wide-ranging antitrust inquiry targeting Facebook. James said in a statement then that state enforcers had grown “concerned that Facebook may have put consumer data at risk, reduced the quality of consumers’ choices, and increased the price of advertising.”</blockquote><blockquote>Since then, Facebook has faced a slew of criticism from regulators nationwide who believe it brazenly has sought to expand its digital empire in a way that undermines competition and leaves its billions of users with worse service, including fewer privacy protections. A probe conducted by House lawmakers, concluded earlier this month, appeared to furnish fresh evidence of the company’s brass-knuckled tactics — illustrating for members of Congress the extent to which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had sought to neuter potential rivals before they could mount a serious challenge.</blockquote><p>In our current divisive political landscape, Big Tech is becoming bipartisan low hanging fruit, <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201023&amp;instance_id=23425&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=42074&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fe82c0355-0059-55c1-8125-cef5ea7c4ef8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">per the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/20/business/us-economy-coronavirus/reactions-to-google-news-what-business-leaders-policymakers-and-antitrust-experts-are-saying?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">applauded the Justice Department’s lawsuit</a> this week accusing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html?te=1&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;emc=edit_ot_20201026">Google of illegally protecting its monopoly</a> over search and search advertising.

The Markup has a plan (and a browser) to wrap its arms around&nbsp;it</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/paul</a>— <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-instagram-eu-investigation-allegedly-exposed-data-underage-users-2020-10?utm_source=reddit.com">The EU is investigating Instagram for allegedly exposing the contact data of up to 5 million underage&nbsp;users</a>   2. Big Tech has gotten so big and powerful and has swallowed up so many rivals and upstarts that we’re going to need some government action to help ensure a more competitive and innovative digital landscape. But it’s also not the type of thing we can completely rely on the government for. <p>For one, the solutions aren’t very obvious and getting to any sort of constructive outcome will be a long, embattled process.</p><p>Then we have to consider why governments are ticked off at Big Tech in the first place. On the one hand, there are good intentions. We want to ensure fair competition and marketplaces and we want to create an environment that fosters real innovation.</p><p>On the other hand, this is also a question of power and who wields it. Because in some ways, it’s about Big Tech stepping on Big Government’s toes.</p><p>We’re seeing this kind of dynamic play out in the government’s fight against end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">the EFF</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/ctomc">/ctomc</a>):</p><blockquote>The last few months have seen a steady stream of proposals, encouraged by the advocacy of the FBI and Department of Justice, to provide “lawful access” to end-to-end encrypted services in the United States. Now lobbying has moved from the U.S., where Congress has been largely paralyzed by the nation’s polarization problems, to the European Union — where advocates for anti-encryption laws hope to have a smoother ride. A series of leaked documents from the EU’s highest institutions show a blueprint for how they intend to make that happen, with the apparent intention of presenting anti-encryption law to the European Parliament within the next&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>The public signs of this shift in the EU — which until now has been largely supportive toward privacy-protecting technologies like end-to-end encryption — began in June with a speech by Ylva Johansson, the EU’s Commissioner for Home&nbsp;Affairs.</blockquote><blockquote>Speaking at a webinar on “Preventing and combating child sexual abuse [and] exploitation”, Johansson called for a “technical solution” to what she described as the “problem” of encryption, and announced that her office had initiated “a special group of experts from academia, government, civil society and business to find ways of detecting and reporting encrypted child sexual abuse material.”</blockquote><p>Which goes back to the problem of there being no obvious solutions — since much of the discussion around a “technical solution” essentially amounts to a backdoor.</p><p>(There have been some more creative solutions discussed during our open mic sessions such as the inclusion of bots in certain Group&nbsp;chats.)</p><p>But this is generally the classic type of situation that we already see in the world of money laundering and terrorist funding — whereby efforts to tackle really bad problems end up hurting the general populace (in this case, sacrificing their right to privacy on mainstream platforms) while doing little to catch the bad guys (who will find alternative solutions anyway).</p> 3. The public narratives about Bitcoin went mainstream this year (in a positive&nbsp;way) JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Photo:&nbsp;Fortune<p>Now just to be clear, this isn’t really the type of place where we talk about crypto prices and whether they’re going up or down. There’s plenty of outlets for that elsewhere.</p><p>The main point here is how the narratives have truly shifted in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Wall Street’s biggest banks have been long term skeptics of cryptocurrency with JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon a notable naysayer not many years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Here’s JPMorgan — one of Wall Street’s premier institutions — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-gold-millennials-jpmorgan-price">now</a>:</p><blockquote>Writing to clients in “Flows &amp; Liquidity,” one of JPMorgan’s flagship publications, the authors said that characterizing bitcoin as a “risk” asset rather than a “safe” asset is “more appropriate” based on the leading cryptocurrency’s increased positive correlation with the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index since&nbsp;March.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin’s function as a risk asset is “likely more of a reflection of a need for an ‘alternative’ currency rather than a need for a ‘safe’ asset or ‘hedge’.”</blockquote><blockquote>“To some extent, this is also true with gold,” the authors add, although the yellow metal’s volatility is notably lower than bitcoin’s.</blockquote><blockquote>How investors currently perceive bitcoin’s value implies that it could “compete more intensely” with gold as an “alternative” currency over the coming years, the analysts wrote. Bitcoin’s role as a gold competitor is amplified by millennial investors’ interest in cryptocurrency, according to the note, and the inevitability of the younger investor demographic becoming “over time a more important component” of the investor universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin’s market capitalization would have to increase by a factor of 10 before it could match the total private sector investment in gold, the author’s note, adding that “even a modest crowding out of gold as an alternative currency over the longer term would imply doubling or tripling of the bitcoin price from&nbsp;here.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In other words, the potential long-term upside for bitcoin is considerable.”</blockquote><p>So yeah, the tune has&nbsp;changed.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is something young people are excited about. It’s not just about Bitcoin. It’s about what it represents and the innovative potential of the blockchain space at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Young people are particularly attuned to the concept that our lives will become increasingly digital and crypto is really the next step in that evolution in terms of digital value. (The same could be said about digital identity, self-sovereign identity, and digital&nbsp;trust.)</p><p>In any case, another company pledges to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin">hold a portion of its cash reserves in&nbsp;crypto</a>:</p><blockquote>In a press release on Wednesday, the fintech group said it will convert up to 10% of its cash reserves into the cryptocurrency as part of a long-term strategy to “protect investors’ assets from currency debasement.”</blockquote><blockquote>With interest rates in the U.K. at a record low of 0.1%, Mode said it would also seek to diversify away from low-interest money market instruments to maximize the value of returns from its recent initial public offering.</blockquote><blockquote>“Faced with the challenges of COVID-19 and with U.K. interest rates at the lowest level in the Bank of England’s 326-year history, our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin has only increased,” said Jonathan Rowland, Mode’s executive chairman.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2020-10-21-PayPal-Launches-New-Service-Enabling-Users-to-Buy-Hold-and-Sell-Cryptocurrency">PayPal Launches New Service Enabling Users to Buy, Hold and Sell Cryptocurrency</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-new-york-conditional-bitlicense-paxos-cryptocurrency">PayPal Embraces Crypto, Igniting Market as Mainstream Adoption Inches Closer — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/uk-listed-firm-mode-putting-10-of-cash-reserves-into-bitcoin">UK-Listed Firm Mode Putting Up to 10% of Cash Reserves Into Bitcoin — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fedtakes-cautious-approach-to-possibly-issuing-digital-currency-11603132490?mod=hp_lista_pos2">Fed Takes Cautious Approach to Possibly Issuing Digital&nbsp;Currency</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-bretton-woods">Does the IMF Want a New ‘Bretton Woods’ Moment? — CoinDesk</a>   4.

<p>Being able to use Ceramic directly from the convenience of your web browser is one of the core functionalities required to fulfill the vision of a permissionless dataweb. <a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/3id-connect">3ID Connect</a> enables this by providing a sandboxed IdentityWallet instance which users can authenticate to using any of their existing Ethereum wallets, and soon other Blockchain wallets as well. This tutorial will show you how to combine 3ID Connect with Ceramic in order to start building your app using dynamic, tamper resistant documents!</p> Using Ceramic on the&nbsp;web <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Typescript Ceramic implementation</a> provides two main ways to interact with the ceramic network, Ceramic Core and Ceramic http-client. The former implements the entire protocol and relies on a js-ipfs instance to be available, the latter relies on a Ceramic Daemon which you can run from your terminal. Both of these implementations consume a DID Provider which is used to communicate with a wallet with DID support (see <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2844">EIP2844</a>). In the <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic">Building on Clay tutorial</a> we described how to use the http client together with an instance of <a href="https://github.com/3box/identity-wallet-js/">IdentityWallet</a>. This is good if you want to dive into fundamentals, but 3ID Connect enables us to connect to a DID directly from the comfort of your Ethereum wallet. This DID will also be linked together with the ethereum address using&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a>.</p><p>In this tutorial we will be using Ceramic Core, which means that we’re running the entire Ceramic protocol inside of the&nbsp;browser!</p> Setup 3ID Connect with&nbsp;Ceramic <p>First let’s install the needed packages. Currently the 3ID Connect version with Ceramic support is available using the next flag. In the example we will be using ceramic-core, but you can use ceramic-http-client as&nbsp;well.</p> $ npm install --save 3id-connect@next @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core <p>Using 3ID Connect to authenticate to Ceramic is fairly straight forward once the basic flow is setup. In the example below we use an “injected ethereum provider” that’s available on window.ethereum. You can of course use any ethereum provider that you&nbsp;like.</p> import { ThreeIdConnect, EthereumAuthProvider } from '3id-connect'  const threeIdConnect = new ThreeIdConnect()  // Usually the following three steps are taken when<br>// a user choose to connect their wallet<br>const addresses = await window.ethereum.enable()<br>// Create 3id connect instance<br>const authProvider = new EthereumAuthProvider(window.ethereum, addresses[0])<br>await threeIdConnect.connect(authProvider)  // create a Ceramic instance<br>import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-core'<br>import IPFS from 'ipfs'  const didProvider = await threeIdConnect.getDidProvider()<br>const ipfs = await IPFS.create()<br>const ceramic = await Ceramic.create(ipfs, { didProvider })  Create documents in the&nbsp;browser <p>We can now start using Ceramic directly in the browser! Below are just some examples that you can also try out on the <a href="https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/">Web Playground</a> which comes with 3ID Connect and Ceramic already set up. First, open the developer console and then click connect. The 3ID Connect modal will appear, and once approved, you will see “Connected with DID: did:3:&lt;yourDID&gt;” in the console. Once this appears, then you can run the below commands directly in the console. Note, if you’d like to reset the 3ID Connect iFrame state, clear application data for 3idconnect.org from localStorage.</p> const jsonSchema = {<br>  "type": "object",<br>  "$schema": "&lt;http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#&gt;",<br>  "required": [<br>    "title",<br>    "description"<br>  ],<br>  "properties": {<br>    "title": {<br>      "type": "string"<br>    },<br>    "description": {<br>      "type": "string"<br>    }<br>  },<br>  "additionalProperties": false<br>}  const doc1 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', { content: jsonSchema })  // This will throw an error because it's missing the "description":<br>const doc2 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {<br>  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },<br>  content: { "title": "Client Document" }<br>})<br>// Uncaught Error: Validation Error: data should have <br>// required property 'description'  // We can create the document if we provide all required fields:<br>const doc3 = await ceramic.createDocument('tile', {<br>  metadata: { schema: doc1.id },<br>  content: {<br>    title: "Client Document",<br>    description: "A Ceramic Document created from the browser."<br>  }<br>})  // Now we can of course also update the document:<br>await doc3.change({<br>  content: {<br>    title: 'Client Document',<br>    description: 'This document has now been updated from the browser'<br>  }<br>}) <p>That’s it for this tutorial!

We know staying abreast of shifting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">privacy </a>laws can be challenging, which is why we have a dedicated team of experts monitoring the landscape to ensure our services help you stay compliant.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>An area we continue to watch closely is the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling from July 16, 2020 regarding the transfer of personal data. As part of the ruling, the court confirmed that the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (SCCs) remain a valid and lawful method for transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States and other countries. At the same time, it decided to invalidate the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.</p>

			<p>The Swiss data protection regulator has followed the CJEU’s ruling and deemed the Swiss-US Privacy Shield framework inadequate for protecting Swiss/US data transfers.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is the impact?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

			<p>For ForgeRock customers, none. The continued support of SCCs means there is no disruption to the way we do business with you.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>ForgeRock was never certified under the EU-US or Swiss-EU Privacy Shield frameworks. We have always relied on SCCs to safely and legally transfer customer’s personal data from the EU and Switzerland to our services.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>This means our customers can be assured that they may continue to use ForgeRock’s services by relying on the SCCs that are currently in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/99022421/legal-document/ForgeRock%20Data%20Protection%20Addendum.pdf">Data Protection Addendum</a>.</p>

			 What are SCCs?&nbsp; 

			<p>The SCCs are a set of standard contractual terms providing sufficient safeguards for the protection of personal data of EU individuals, when transferred from Europe to the US and other countries. The ruling supports our belief that SCCs stand up to our 'cast-iron' commitment to the security and protection of our customers’ data.</p>

 Ocean V3 Is Now&nbsp;Live  One Step Closer to an open Data&nbsp;Economy <p>Ocean Protocol was conceived in 2017 as a trustless, decentralized data and AI sharing service. We took all our learnings from four years in blockchain and melded the concepts of big data and AI to paint a vision of how a new Data Economy could arise if data could be shared freely, while protecting privacy and giving the data owners control. From 2017 until now, we worked tirelessly to realize the vision outlined in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> and adhere to the timelines and scope of the&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/roadmap">roadmap</a>.</p><p>Today, with the release of Ocean V3, we celebrate another milestone in the journey to give people back power and control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ocean V3 is a core piece needed to unlock a new Data Economy. The logic and functionality for access control for Ocean V3 has been rebuilt from the ground up to simplify the on-boarding for Web3 natives, leverage the Ethereum network’s decentralized trust architecture, removing technical complexity inherent in a Proof-of-Authority network and integrate with state-of-the-art tooling for decentralized finance (#DeFi) that has appeared and matured during&nbsp;2020.</p><p>A core component of Ocean V3 is the datatoken. Datatokens are ERC20 tokens that represent both the value of the data asset and provide the access control to the data asset. We proposed the idea of a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-tokens-1-data-custody-1d0d5ae66d0c">datatoken in November 2019</a>, and since then we have made it the heart of Ocean V3 because it radically simplifies the user interaction for data sharing, while leveraging existing Web3 mental models for custody, wallets, liquidity, staking and&nbsp;farming.</p><p>With Ocean V3, we also introduce Ocean Market, an open data marketplace for the community. It is built on the foundation of datatokens. As a first example of Ocean V3’s composability, Ocean Market directly leverages Balancer DEX technology for staking, automatic pricing of data, and data curation.</p><p>Leading up to Ocean V3, we explained various relevant concepts:</p>  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/should-product-market-fit-come-before-tokens-6c542a75c8dc">interplay</a> between product/market fit and&nbsp;tokens,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">verification</a> of token models using Token Engineering concepts,  impetus for the Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-swap-completed-new-contract-live-f0768423b3e1">token&nbsp;swap</a>,  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean token</a>&nbsp;model,  the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">sustainability loop</a> for Web3 projects, including Ocean,  the simplified technical <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">architecture</a> in Ocean&nbsp;V3,  how to re-purpose <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">#DeFi building blocks</a> for data (datatokens)  an introduction to the community-targeted <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Ocean <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data&nbsp;Farming</a>,  the role of <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">staking</a> on&nbsp;data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-selling-data-in-ocean-market-9afcfa1e6e43">selling</a> data in the Ocean&nbsp;Market.  <p>We opened up our channels to guest contributors, to hear broader perspectives about an emerging Data&nbsp;Economy:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-alex-svanevik-daos-as-business-a43cd6f5dcd7">Alex Svanevik</a> and his perspective as a data scientist,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-data-economy-silvan-jongerius-gdpr-ce14db0ff2d">Silvan Jongerius</a> — GDPR and&nbsp;data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/voices-of-the-data-economy-robert-miller-healthcare-data-be78e2c19c84">Robert Miller</a> — healthcare data,  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/a-privacy-preserving-public-private-statistics-ecosystem-for-europe-cdc3b67a6614">Andreas Fauler</a> — governments and&nbsp;data.   A Call to Action — Ocean V3 is now fully available to the community <p>Ocean V3 takes to heart the start-up and Web3 principles to launch products early and incorporate the feedback of users as soon as possible. The team has contracted security audits, updated the libraries, updated documentation, revamped the website and tested the user flows in the Ocean Market. Now the community can play an even more active&nbsp;role.</p><p>Ocean V3 is fully functioning, but there’s a lot of work to be done to improve the user flows and add features in the Ocean Market, dozens of integrations are needed to weave Ocean into the fabric of business, and vulnerabilities may exist and need to be&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>The Ocean Market is a blank slate. It needs to be filled with valuable and relevant data that can be shared and monetized. For this, we ask the community to step in and find new data to fill the Ocean. The upcoming Data Economy Challenge will have a special emphasis — where teams and individuals can earn bounties and grants on filling the Ocean with high-quality data.</p> Looking Ahead <p>The final milestone to be accomplished from our original vision is to increase the control of the community over the protocol. For this, we will activate the OceanDAO and reduce the ability of the Ocean core team to intercede into the Ocean token contract, the Ocean smart contracts and community funding.</p><p>In 2021, all community efforts will be on raising awareness and encouraging adoption of Ocean Protocol as the de facto standard for the Data Economy. We will be asking for community support with integrations with other Web3 tools and services, porting Ocean smart contracts to other L1 technologies such as Polkadot, xDAI, Binance Smart Chain and others, and of course filling the Ocean with data and AI services.</p><p>We would like to thank all the community members for joining into the vision and helping to make it your own and to the countless contributors throughout this four year journey that have made Ocean Protocol, a community project for everyone. With our foundation of state-of-the-art technology and the rapidly growing Ocean community, let’s spread the message that it’s now possible to truly own our&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Ocean Protocol Network Deployments Past, Present, and&nbsp;Future <a href="http://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> *&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a> One-Liner <p>Ocean Protocol V3.0 is now deployed to Ethereum mainnet. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/master/docs/deployments">Here</a> are the addresses.</p> Summary <p>Towards a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-data-economy-b6fd8ecac4c4">Web3 Data Economy</a> for the planet, we envision Ocean deployed as a thin data asset layer for many blockchain networks. It starts with a single deployment, and expands pragmatically. Here’s the&nbsp;summary.</p><p>Ocean V1 (and V2) was deployed decentralized and permissioned:</p>  Network. Ocean smart contracts run on a dedicated <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">permissioned</a> <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">EVM</a>&nbsp;network.  Contracts. A small group of people can <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/making-ocean-protocols-smart-contracts-and-it-s-governance-unstoppable-45cf99dc1b65">upgrade the smart contracts</a>, in a multi-sig setting.  <p>As of Ocean V3.0, Ocean will be decentralized and permissionless:</p>  Network. Ocean smart contracts are deployed to <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a> — the leading permissionless smart contract network. For testing, they’re also on Rinkeby. Specific deployment addresses are listed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/master/docs/deployments">here.</a>  Contracts. The aim is to move away from a small handful of gatekeepers. Here’s how: contracts will not have upgradeability built in. Therefore the only way to upgrade contracts is by community consensus to use a new set of smart contracts. Sometimes, less is&nbsp;more.  <p>Then, Ocean V3.x will deploy to one EVM-compatible chain as a “sister” deployment to Ethereum mainnet. Thus, users can choose between low gas costs (sister chain) or high security (Ethereum mainnet).</p><p>After that, we envision community-driven Ocean deployments to many more chains. The rest of this article elaborates.</p> Decentralized, Consistent, Scalable. Pick Any&nbsp;Two. <p>The ideal blockchain network is Decentralized, Consistent, and Scalable&nbsp;(D,C,S):</p>  Decentralized means no single point of failure, the ideal version being permissionless (no gatekeepers)  Consistent means prevents double-spends, and sufficiently secure.  Scalable means it can serve planet-scale needs.  <p><a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.bigchaindb.com%2Fthe-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc">We discovered in 2016</a> that it’s hard to get all three (D,C, S) at once. You can get two, but not three. A bit later, others <a href="https://github.com/taoeffect/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/c375e1f42f871463c80daa68ca0120993936a8c4/topics-and-advance-readings/Slepaks-Triangle.pdf">also</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170311180536/https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ">realized</a> this. This challenge is now commonly known as the Scalability Trilemma.</p> Ocean V1 &amp; V2: Decentralized &amp; Permissioned <p>In fall 2018, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">underwent a process</a> to decide where to deploy Ocean contracts. At the time, no network in production met all three (D,C,S). Therefore, something would have to hold us over until full D,C,S solutions came&nbsp;along.</p><p>These were the most realistic options:</p>  <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>. It’s permissionless-Decentralized and Consistent. Scalability was our biggest concern, especially for data science users who expect performance. Nonetheless, we test-deployed Ocean contracts to Ethereum mainnet. Ocean V1 contracts were complex, so it took about 2 days to successfully deploy them 😬. This would have been a recurring problem, as we had a steady stream of upgrades planned. Second, each data purchase involved several wallet confirmations, which would have been painful for&nbsp;users.  <a href="https://www.poa.network/">POA Network</a>. While Consistent and Scalable, it was permissioned (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority">Proof-of-Authority</a>), not permissionless Decentralized. It has a sneaky ninja trick to avoid extra layer of legals to bound liability for node operators: each node operator must be a <a href="https://www.poa.network/features/known-validators">US public notary</a>, and US public notaries have sworn to be “of public service”. The engineer in me adores the elegance of this. However it also means that each operator must be in the US. Being confined to a single jurisdiction — and one without great regulatory clarity — was a showstopper for&nbsp;us.  Dedicated Ocean network, to start. Like POA Network, it would be Consistent and Scalable, and only permissioned Decentralized. It meant extra devops work and legal work. But there were no showstoppers.  <p>Given the tradeoffs of the other choices at the time, we selected “Dedicated Ocean network”. We created a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-poa-vs-ethereum-mainnet-decd0ac72c97">permissioned</a> EVM network called <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/pacific-network/">Pacific</a>, and deployed Ocean smart contracts to it. For security, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> live on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>, and connect to Pacific with an <a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/introducing-the-erc20-to-erc20-tokenbridge-ce266cc1a2d0">ERC20 Token Bridge</a>. Creating and maintaining this dedicated network and bridge was a lot of extra devops work and legal&nbsp;work.</p> Ocean V3.0: Permissionless <p>Ocean V3 contracts are <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-architecture-overview-9f2fab60f9a7">much simpler</a> than the V1 and V2 contracts due to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837?source=---------3----------------------------">datatokens</a> architecture. This includes lower gas usage, and fewer Ethereum transactions for equivalent actions. Finally, we have realized that data scientists are accustomed to some latency with Web2 payments; we don’t need to be radically better than that. (Ethereum mainnet latency is within those&nbsp;bounds.)</p><p>In short, the constraints that prevented us from deploying Ocean to Ethereum mainnet for Ocean V1 and V2 are no longer&nbsp;present.</p><p>We can deploy Ocean to Ethereum Mainnet now. So, we are. Ocean V3.0 is deployed to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>This means that Ocean V3 also meets the Ocean “V5” target of being permissionless, specified in the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-roadmap-setting-sail-to-2021-70c2545547a7">Ocean</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">roadmap</a>. We’ll also be retiring Pacific, and rescinding pause in Ocean&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> remain on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>; therefore no bridge to Ethereum mainnet is needed for utility of Ocean smart contracts.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that Ethereum’s scale issue is solved, of course. It just means that it’s finally feasible for Ocean to be on Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Ocean V3.x Deployment to a Sister&nbsp;Chain <p>In the months leading up to Ocean V3 release (during Q3 2020), Ethereum gas costs have greatly risen with the rise of&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://trent.st/content/2014-10-28%20mcconaghy%20-%20blockchain%20big%20data.pdf">Since 2014</a>, we’ve been interested in blockchain scalability. We built <a href="http://www.bigchaindb.com">BigchainDB</a> as a scalability solution for database-style blockchains. I wrote the <a href="https://blog.bigchaindb.com/the-dcs-triangle-5ce0e9e0f1dc">DCS article</a>. And we’ve kept a close eye on scalability solutions.</p><p>We’ve been especially interested in ones that minimize changes to Ethereum mainnet. There are several EVM-compatible chains that solve DCS now. These include <a href="https://www.xdaichain.com/">xDai Chain</a> (via <a href="https://forum.poa.network/t/posdao-white-paper/2208">POSDAO</a>), <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-evm/">EVM on Substrate</a>, and <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollups</a>. They can all be viewed as a “sister” chains to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>We plan a “sister” deployment of Ocean to xDai Chain for Ocean v3.x. This will likely be V3.1, depending on priority to other&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Each chain has a way to connect to Ethereum mainnet, for a flow of OCEAN token and datatokens to and from the sister chain. For example, xDai uses <a href="https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge">Arbitrary Message Bridge</a>&nbsp;(AMB).</p><p>It’s acceptable if the sister chain has a lower security, since users would have the choice between higher security (Ethereum mainnet) or lower gas costs (the sister, at potentially lower security). Then:</p>  Data assets that start high value or need high security can continue to deploy directly to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  And, lower-value data assets can first get deployed to the sister network, then “graduate” to Ethereum mainnet if they increase sufficiently in value&nbsp;[1].  Ocean bridge.&nbsp;[<a href="https://www.pickpik.com/baltic-sea-bridge-denmark-sea-bridge-sunset-abendstimmung-93785">Image</a>] Multi-Network Deployment <p>Over time, we envision every blockchain network to have an Ocean-powered data resource permissioning layer. We envision them being interconnected with datatokens and OCEAN flowing everywhere.</p><p>We envision Ocean as an add-on library in <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate/">Parity Substrate</a> and <a href="https://cosmos.network/sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>, making it only an “import” away for <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> and <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> blockchain families respectively [2]. It would support EVM, and eventually WASM directly. We’re particularly excited about <a href="https://www.parity.io/substrate-2-0-is-here/">Substrate 2.0</a>’s support for off-chain data integration.</p><p>We see integrations with <a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698">rollups</a> technologies, including <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK variants</a> and optimistic variants (e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-virtual-machine-alpha-cdf51f5d49e">OVM</a>). Each can be seen as a layer 2 solution. Or it can be seen as its own chain, that happens to inherit Ethereum mainnet’s security (but with other tradeoffs).</p><p>We expect to see deployment to other EVM-based networks such as <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain">Binance Smart Chain</a>, <a href="https://matic.network/">Matic Network</a>, <a href="https://skale.network/">SKALE Network</a>, <a href="https://near.org/">NEAR Protocol</a>, and <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>; each with their respective bridges.</p><p>We envision deployment onto federated networks for consortia like <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/technology/energy-web-chain/">Energy Web&nbsp;Chain</a>.</p><p>Finally, we eventually see deployment to non-EVM blockchains, especially ones that can hold a lot of data like <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">arweave</a>, or ones with built-in oracles like <a href="https://aeternity.com/">aeternity</a>.</p><p>Going onto all these networks will be a process that will take multiple years. But over time, Ocean will become a ubiquitous access control layer across the entire Web3 ecosystem, aka the new internet. We see this as crucial towards global data sovereignty for individuals, companies, cities and&nbsp;nations.</p><p>In all these deployments, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN tokens</a> will remain on <a href="http://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum mainnet</a>, and bridged to other networks.</p><p>We will be encouraging the broader community to do each of these deployments, with funding from <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">OceanDAO</a> or the respective chain’s grant mechanisms.</p><p>In each of these deployments, with the interest of Ocean sustainability (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">as described here</a>), there will be <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3?source=user_profile---------0-----------------------">small transaction fees</a> that go to the Ocean community via a&nbsp;bridge.</p>Each network is its own island. We envision a future where every network has Ocean — and they’re all connected.

  <p>Hello and welcome back to&nbsp;ForgeTalks. Today's episode is part one of a two-part series finale. Joining me for these two episodes are ForgeRock CEO, Fran Rosch, and cybersecurity luminary and founder of NightDragon and ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/investors">board</a> member, Dave DeWalt. It was a wide-ranging discussion that captured their views of the security landscape in 2020 and how <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">digital identity</a> can play a central role in stopping attackers from successfully stealing your data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Watch this episode to hear about:&nbsp;</p>

  How conditions in 2020 have created a "perfect storm" for cybersecurity threats 
	 Why organizations have to move faster than ever to combat the increasing threat 
	 And how digital identity can help not only protect organizations from <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">cybersecurity</a> attacks, but also improve their <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">customer experiences</a> and take advantage of unprecedented opportunity 
  
 


<p>I hope you enjoy this amazing&nbsp;ForgeTalks&nbsp;episode. Make sure you check out next week's <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/forgetalks-future-cybersecurity-part-2">episode</a> where I continue my conversation with Dave and Fran.

					  26.10.2020. In diesem Jahr ist alles anders. So fand auch das Digital Trust &amp; Identity Forum des bitkom heute virtuell statt. Mehrere hundert Teilnehmer verfolgten die spannenden Diskussionen und Vorträge rund um alles was in den Themen digital Identity, Vertrauensdienste und die Umsetzung der eIDAS-Verordnung als Basis für eine europaweite, elektronische Kommunikation und sichere Identifizierung aktuell wichtig ist. <p>Dominik Deimel engagierte sich mit dem Vortrag “comuny Trust Service Ecosystem – die Zukunft liegt in der Kollaboration!”. Er beschrieb, warum digitale Services von Unternehmen in regulierten Märkten verifizierte Kundendaten benötigen – egal ob bei Kontoeröffnung, Zugang zur elektronischen Patientenakte oder auch beim voll digitalen Abschluss eines &nbsp;Versicherungsvertrags. Die Anzahl der Use Cases steigt kontinuierlich und für Unternehmen zählt Flexibilität in der Prozessgestaltung und Einfachheit in der Umsetzung als Top Prio bei der Auswahl passender Lösungspartner. Doch aktuell ist kein Dienstleister in der Lage, diesen Anspruch übergreifend zu erfüllen ohne klassische Lock-In Effekte.</p><p>Die Antwort auf dieses Dilemma heißt Kollaboration der Anbieter in Ecosystemen, die ausreichend Spielraum für eigene unternehmerische Freiheitsgrade und gleichzeitig Transparenz bei der Anbieterauswahl für den Kunden gewährleisten. Über einen solchen Ansatz lassen sich sehr flexibel Use Cases und Branchenlösungen erzeugen, die dann optimalerweise als in sich gekoppelte As-a-Service-Leistung zum attraktiven Preis am Markt angeboten werden. In dem Vortrag wurde das Geschäftsmodell und die technische Lösung des comuny Trust Ecosystems Ansatz und die Möglichkeiten der Use Case Generierung am Beispiel des Gesundheitswesen aufgezeigt und diskutiert.</p><p>#eIDAS #bitkom #speaker #event #comuny #Kollaboration #future-of-trust #ecosystems #trust-services</p><p><a title="https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm" href="https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm">https://eidas-summit.de/eIDAS-Summit-Programm</a></p>

<p>This past week was the <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a>. We had record-breaking attendance reaching over 400 participants from all over the world.</p> Two new Conferences coming up inspired by IIW  The Justice Layer conference&nbsp; <p>November 17-19&nbsp;</p><p>By the <a href="https://www.internetbar.org/">Internet Bar Organization</a> and <a href="http://iofoundation.io/">The IO Foundation</a> to work real-world products/projects, <a href="https://peacetones.org/">PeaceTone</a>s and <a href="http://bee1world.org/">Bee1World</a>. . You can read Jeffrey Aresty’s vision of the <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/litigation_journal/spring2016/justice-layer-internet.pdf">Justice Layer</a> from the American Bar Association site.&nbsp;</p><p>A bit more about this event and some of the people behind it. I (Kaliya) had the great pleasure of meeting Jean Q. at RightsCon in Tunisia. He was empathetic in our conversation - I was a bit burnt out but didn’t really know it. He is taking a unique approach relative to many of the other human rights-oriented groups. He believes, that to make human rights real in the digital realm,  tools need to be built for software developers, who he sees as front-line human rights workers.</p> <a href="http://www.thoughtfulbiometrics.org/">Thoughtful Biometrics (un)Conference</a> <p>January Dates TBD</p><p>I (Kaliya) have been working with Jack and Asem on this event to bring together a range of perspectives about biometric technology from scientists who are developing them, systems designers who use them, and civil society advocacy groups concerned about their use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Universal Declaration of Digital Rights <p>Thanks to Johannes Ernst for sharing a draft of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y9C-5TPYmRruRQqJq39-HePk3ypWLDpSAEVzuonOH2Q/edit">Universal Declaration of Digital Rights</a>, which is meant to affirm the Universal Declaration of Human rights, and uphold their application in the digital sphere. </p><blockquote><p>all states should recognise and promote universal respect for and observance of both fundamental human and digital rights in physical domain and the digital spaces environment and ensure that these rights are upheld as core elements of a free, open and representative society</p></blockquote> New Protocols - or old ones improved.&nbsp; <p><a href="https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/filling-in-the-gnap-a032453eaf8c">Filling in the GNAP</a></p><p>Justin Richer identity protocol writer and implementer extraordinaire has a very excellent post explaining the new GNAP and all the things that lead to it, including OAuth, OpenID, TxAuth, OAuth3, and OAuth.XYZ. This protocol is a big deal and will be important. It’s just beginning the journey through IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) the main standards body of the internet.&nbsp; </p> IIW Presentations&nbsp; <p>Mike Jones long time OpenID leader and MSFT employee shares his OpenID 101 presentation from IIW this last week. It is a great overview of the key design principles of OpenID and how we got to now with the protocol <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/OpenID_Connect_Introduction_20-Oct-20.pdf">OpenID Presentation at IIW XXXI</a>.</p> KERI&nbsp; <p>This was a hot topic at IIW with quite a few sessions about it next we will have some of those session notes and recordings for you here are two good posts:&nbsp;</p><p>DIF continues its series explaining key things.

<p>We are often asked by prospects evaluating open source identity and access management platforms about the difference between the Gluu Server and Keycloak.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, we have not deployed or operated Keycloak. However, at a high level, we can offer a few points of differentiation between the two platforms.</p>
 Product vs. Project 
<p>There is a big difference between a project and a product. There are long term and short term projects, but by nature projects are temporary and are often not suitable for mission critical production environments. Products, on the other hand, need to live in production for many years.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the Keycloak website (emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RH-SSO product derives from a specific version of the Keycloak community and is maintained, patched, and supported by Red Hat commercially for as long as the terms of your support contract. The Keycloak community project, on the other hand, is never patched.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by RH’s own admission, Keycloak open source offering is a bleeding edge project that is never patched.</p>
<p>The Gluu Server Community Edition, on the other hand, is a product that is in production at many organizations.</p>
 Niche vs. Pure Play 
<p>Choosing an IAM platform is a long term decision. Once you start building the platform into your larger enterprise architecture, the switching costs become extremely high.</p>
<p>Keycloak and RH SSO contribute no meaningful amount to RH’s bottom line, and RH may or may not continue to invest in the software. We’ve seen in the past RH say “the liability of the product exceeds the revenue opportunity.” It’s not enough to patch a server. The SSO market is moving fast as new vulnerabilities and application development paradigms emerge. Is RH committed for the long term to not only support, but to innovate?</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole business is built around the Gluu Server. Gluu will never stop innovating (or end of life) our flagship product.</p>
 Support 
<p>Red Hat does not provide commercial support for Keycloak. They instead derive product offerings (i.e. RH SSO) from community projects (i.e. Keycloak) which are branded and maintained separately.</p>
<p>Gluu, on the other hand, makes a large investment in supporting our customers and the open source community alike. We do not hold back features for a commercial version. Everyone gets the same Gluu Server software bits.</p>
<p>We rely on large organizations with mission critical requirements to <a href="https://gluu.org/pricing">pay for support</a>, but that doesn’t stop us from helping the open source community of DIYers and small (and large!) businesses adopt and use this critical security tool.</p>
 OS specific 
<p>Gluu is committed to building packages for many popular Linux distributions, currently Red Hat, Centos, Ubuntu, and Debian.</p>
 Team vs. Company 
<p>Our experience is that developers ask a lot of hard questions, the criticality of support is high, and a fast response time is critical. As Keycloak / RH SSO is a small part of RH’s business, it may take time for Redhat to get the right team engaged on a production (or development) issue.</p>
<p>Gluu’s whole company is focused on the Gluu Server, and our business, support and developer staff is engaged in supporting and extending the product each and every day.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>As a pure play IAM vendor, Gluu will never end-of-life the Gluu Server, or waver from its commitment to support and innovate our open source platform.</p>
<p>Options are good for consumers, and we like to see other organizations offer open source identity and access management tools to the community. In fact, we make use of the good ones (like Shibboleth) in our stack!</p>
<p>Our recommendation: use Keycloak at your own risk… you may be locked into an obscure, end-of-lifed product in the not too distant future.[:]</p>

 The future of Web3 identity has&nbsp;arrived <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">IDX</a> is a brand new SDK for building with decentralized identity and user-centric data from the 3Box Labs team. IDX is in alpha but if you’d like to start experimenting, <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">join our discord</a> and jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">docs</a>.</p> A new era for Web3 development <p>The Web3 vision for an internet that is open and interoperable, where users control their information requires a decentralized, cross-platform identity system. To this end, IDX is an open source JavaScript/TypeScript library that exposes high-level developer APIs to various meta-protocols and standards for decentralized identity. Not only is IDX powerful and flexible enough to meet all of your user and data management needs, but it wraps everything in an easy-to-use package that makes decentralized identity accessible to all Web3 developers.</p><p>Designed to be cross-platform and highly configurable, IDX is compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and a wide variety of user and application data storage options including <a href="https://ceramic.network">Ceramic</a>, <a href="https://textile.io">Textile</a>, <a href="https://orbitdb.org">OrbitDB</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://sia.tech">Sia</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Stores</a> — so you can seamlessly integrate decentralized identity with the rest of your Web3 tech stack. With IDX, developers can now build much more sophisticated and powerful Web3 applications that rival and even exceed what’s currently possible on&nbsp;Web2.</p> Why decentralized identity? <p>If you’ve ever asked yourself any of these questions, then you should definitely consider adding a decentralized identity system to your development stack.</p>  How can I create a universal identifier to associate data resources from a variety of platforms to a single&nbsp;user?  How can I improve my user experience with decentralized social profiles?  How can users create a unified Web3 identity that links many different accounts within and across various blockchain platforms?  How can users establish trust and reputation by connecting their Web3 identity to existing Web2 social accounts (i.e. Twitter), various anti-sybil systems (i.e. <a href="https://brightid.org">BrightID</a>), domain names (i.e. DNS, <a href="https://ens.domains">ENS</a>, <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a>), and identity verification services (i.e.&nbsp;KYC)?  How can users create a universal and portable social graph of followers, friends, and contacts?  How can I store user and application data in various centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in a way that isn’t siloed to my application, gives users ultimate control and portability over their data, and works with all of their existing wallets/accounts?  How do I discover and import data that a user has created on another application, platform, or network so that I can use it inside my&nbsp;app?   IDX: An open identity framework for&nbsp;Web3 <p>Decentralized identity and user-centric data management are complex, broad-ranging capabilities that touch almost every other aspect of your app architecture. IDX removes the all of the guesswork from implementing these in a scalable and future-proof way.</p> Build with unified digital identities <p>Using IDX, all applications can access a shared, globally-available identity layer that contains unified users identities. Built 100% on permissionless protocols, IDX enables users and their most important information to seamlessly flow and interoperate across platforms, while giving users the ownership and control they demand. In a way, the identity capabilities offered by IDX sort of function as a decentralized Keybase but with much greater flexibility and decentralization.</p>A unified digital footprint!<p>The core of each identity consists of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> which acts as a globally-unique ID and an <a href="https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/cip/idx/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md">identity index</a> which keeps track of an identity’s information. IDX allows developers to deploy identities as well as create, read, update, and delete a variety of metadata and information related to the identity, including but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Multiple user profiles for different contexts or applications  Portable social graphs, from followers to contacts and&nbsp;family  Links to multiple blockchain accounts from different protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, NEAR, Flow,&nbsp;etc)  Links to existing social accounts (Twitter, Github, Discord, Matrix,&nbsp;etc)  Links to domain names (DNS, ENS, Unstoppable, Handshake, etc)  <p>All DIDs, identity indexes, and metadata are securely stored on Ceramic’s permissionless document management network. Because all information is publicly available (but optionally encrypted) and linked via the identity index, any bit of information can be cross-resolved by querying based on any other information. For example you could lookup a user’s profile based on their DID, their Ethereum account, or their Twitter handle; or you could lookup a user’s Filecoin account based on their Polkadot account. We are working with <a href="https://thegraph.com">The Graph</a> on indexing these identity structures which will open up many new opportunities in this&nbsp;realm.</p> Integrate with data storage solutions <p>Unified identities are the gateway to a world of additional functionality for your application. If you also need a way of storing and managing user data, you have three main&nbsp;options.</p>  Use the IDX library to directly store documents on the Ceramic Network and add references to those documents in the user’s index. For this option, no additional software is needed; it works out of the box with&nbsp;IDX.  Store data in alternative data storage systems such as Filecoin, IPFS, Sia, Arweave, Textile, OrbitDB, Secure Data Stores, or Ethereum contracts and use IDX to add references to this data in your user’s index. For this option, you would need to separately install these technologies in your app alongside IDX.  Use a combination of the different data storage solutions above for your application, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, while mapping everything in your user’s&nbsp;IDX.  <p>Whichever data storage configuration you choose, IDX allows all data to be controlled by the user, discoverable by others, and portable across platforms. This is true regardless of where the data resides (servers or decentralized networks) or which application first created the&nbsp;data.</p>The identity index contains mappings to various data&nbsp;sources Share data across applications and&nbsp;silos <p>As described above, the key aspect of IDX that de-silos information, promotes interoperability, and enables user control is the identity index. It provides a standard interface which allows any application or developer to set and query all available data that belongs to a user so that they might make use of it within their application. The identity index serves as the information root for each user and makes everything discoverable.</p><p>To further promote interoperability, the identity index allows developers to:</p>  Publish schemas, names, and descriptions for data points they are adding to the index, so others can more easily consume this information  Publish endpoints for where this information can be found, whether a DocID on Ceramic, a CID on IPFS/Filecoin, a contract on Ethereum, or an endpoint for a hosted&nbsp;service  Request permission to access encrypted data points in the&nbsp;index   Developing with&nbsp;IDX <p>The following section outlines how to get started building with IDX. For more supporting materials, <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">read the&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> Installation <p>First, we’ll need to install the main IDX library and associated dependencies:</p> npm install @ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client @ceramicstudio/idx @ceramicstudio/idx-constants  Query an&nbsp;identity <p>Then we can use these libraries to connect IDX to a Ceramic network and interact with the documents associated to a given DID. This example shows how to simply query the basic profile for a given&nbsp;user.</p> import Ceramic from '@ceramicnetwork/ceramic-http-client'<br>import { IDX } from '@ceramicstudio/idx'<br>import { definitions } from '@ceramicstudio/idx-constants'  // Use Ceramic devnet<br>const ceramic = new Ceramic('&lt;https://ceramic.3boxlabs.com&gt;')  // Use IDX-provided definitions aliases<br>const idx = new IDX({ ceramic, definitions })  // Get the basic profile of a known DID supporting IDX<br>async function getProfile(did) {<br>  return await idx.get('basicProfile', did)<br>}  Save data <p>More advanced examples involving authentication and setting content can be found in the <a href="https://idx.xyz/docs/guide-authentication">IDX documentation</a>.</p><p>Remember, IDX is still in alpha. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback on what we’ve built or how to use it, please <a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">reach out on&nbsp;Discord</a>.</p> About <p>IDX is an open source library that is built and maintained with 💜 by the 3Box Labs team, creators of <a href="https://github.com/3box/3box-js">3Box.js</a>, a leading decentralized identity and data storage solution for Ethereum that has been used by 30,000+ users and 1,000+ projects. IDX is a smarter, mature evolution of 3Box.js. All DIDs and profiles created using 3Box.js will be automatically migrated to IDX once the library goes into production. We are working on various solutions to migrate user data that has been saved in spaces and threads to other IDX compatible data storage systems including Ceramic, Textile, and OrbitDB. If you have questions about this migration process or timeline, please reach&nbsp;out.</p> Resources <p><a href="https://idx.xyz">Website</a><br><a href="https://idx.xyz/docs">Docs</a><br><a href="https://chat.idx.xyz">Discord</a><br><a href="https://github.com/ceramicstudio/js-idx">Github</a><br><a href="https://twitter.com/identityindex">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/3box/idx-a-devkit-for-open-identity-48edc88e8e85">IDX: A Devkit for Open Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/3box">3Box</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that we are building on <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot,</a> a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple chains together in a single network with the aim of accelerating the integration of both ecosystems and increasing levels of trust and data sovereignty for users across the industry. Parity Technologies, one of the drivers behind the Polkadot ecosystem, will provide Ontology with technical support to integrate its Decentralized Identity (DeID) solution, making it available on a range of other blockchains within the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>The integration of Ontology’s DeID is part of a wider effort for Ontology to build a parachain on Polkadot. We envision that the parachain will provide a series of credit-based services on decentralized identity and cross-chain communication. These credit services will include OScore as well, our newly launched credit scoring system designed to seamlessly accelerate the potential to borrow or lend based on a user’s cryptocurrency transaction and asset management history.</p><p>In addition, this parachain will bring cross-chain liquidity to the Polkadot network. Through this, we wish to further accelerate the development of the DeFi ecosystem and lower the barrier of entry for developers. An example of how this is implemented in the DeFi space is the recently launched Wing platform — a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi platform purely dedicated to the practices of lending digital assets governed by the Wing DAO community. This will in turn boost the liquidity of digital assets such as ONT, ONG and DOT. Ontology plans to bid on a parachain slot and create one of Polkadot’s first Initial Parachain Offerings (IPO).</p><p>Eric Wang — the Ecosystem Development Lead at Parity, stated that “Ontology is an industry leader in the development and deployment of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to working closely with the Ontology team to increase the use of ONT ID 2.0 through Polkadot to realize the benefits of digital identity, privacy for DeFi projects and&nbsp;beyond”.</p><p>Parity’s Head of Engineering in Asia, Yaoqi Jia said “the Parity Asia team consists of talented engineers who are very excited to provide support to help guide Ontology in creating a truly impactful parachain.”</p><p>Developed over the past couple of months, the Ontology <a href="https://github.com/siovanus/DID-substrate">parachain</a> currently consists of a DID Substrate pallet, with plans for further integration of other custom components. Further plans for the Ontology parachain include:</p>  Ontology OScore — an off-chain DID authorization mechanism to manage wallet-identity relationships and provide ID-based credit scores for on-chain actions related to digital&nbsp;assets.  The integration of Ontology’s distributed data exchange framework (DDXF), permitting both token association and data tokenization.  Expanding DID’s use cases from users to also include data and resources, providing authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for DID based resource instances via on-chain data access control with data-tokens (tokenization), and association of its value. DDXF provides on-chain AAA for data interoperability cross&nbsp;systems.  <p>Through the integration of our bespoke digital identity and credit-based solution into the Polkadot ecosystem, along with the help of Parity’s leading engineering team, this collaboration will further accelerate user trust, privacy, and data sovereignty, as well as empower the development of the broader DeFi sector. Ontology looks forward to joining forces with more ecosystem allies to redefine trust and connect the missing pieces of a decentralized financial ecosystem.</p><p>About Polkadot</p><p>Polkadot is a sharded blockchain that seamlessly connects multiple diverse chains together in a single network, allowing them to exchange data securely and process transactions in parallel. In this way, Polkadot solves major scalability issues that have impeded blockchain development. Polkadot has also introduced a highly advanced open governance system that will allow the network to innovate and grow at a much more rapid pace than legacy networks. Applications from decentralized finance and energy to IoT and gaming will thrive on Polkadot, challenging the centralized platforms of Web 2.0.
