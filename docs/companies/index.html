<p>“If you want to follow what’s happening in AI, it helps to know where the conversations are happening.” </p>



<p>That doesn’t just mean the headlines and white papers; it means the standards bodies, working groups, and protocol discussions shaping the infrastructure AI systems will have to live with (and live inside). Some of these efforts put “AI” right in the name. Others are quietly solving problems that have been around for a while, which AI has now made urgent.</p>



<p>At IETF 123 in Madrid, AI topics were everywhere, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not. Just like every other event I’ve been to this year, it’s clear that AI is no longer a side topic. But it’s also not one big monolith. A working group with “AI” in the title might be useful, or it might be entirely orthogonal to the problems you’re facing. And meanwhile, some of the most critical technical work is happening in groups that never mention AI at all.</p>



<p>This post is a snapshot of both: a look at where the “AI conversations” are happening in the standards world, and where the deeper technical groundwork is being laid, whether or not anyone’s calling it AI.</p>

 Where AI is the elephant in the room 



<p>Some of the most relevant work wasn’t framed as AI-specific at all… at least, not when it started.</p>



<p>Delegation chaining, for example, is a topic that’s been simmering in OAuth land for a while. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">identity chaining draft</a> defines a way to preserve identity and authorization information across trust domains. Useful for distributed architectures in general and now getting a lot more attention thanks to agentic AI models that need to act across domains, on behalf of users, and maybe other agents.</p>



<p>If you’re designing systems that involve third-party APIs, partner orchestration, or AI-driven workflows, this isn’t theoretical. It’s the difference between “this agent can complete a task” and “this agent just leaked PII across environments you can’t audit.” (This is often what’s happening right now; it’s a terrifying prospect, but I digress.)</p>



<p>Same story for WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments). AI doesn’t appear in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/wimse/about/">charter</a>, but the group is wrestling with exactly the kinds of problems that show up when AI agents act like software workloads, make API calls, and need identity and trust across services.</p>



<p>These efforts weren’t built for AI, but they are shaping the environment in which AI agents will operate.</p>



 Where AI is the headline 



<p>There’s also a growing set of efforts waving the AI banner from the start. Here are a few places to watch if you want to keep a product roadmap aligned with emerging standards and activities.</p>



 AI Preferences (IETF AIPREF) 



<p>This working group is focused on standardizing how people (and systems acting on their behalf) express preferences about how their data is used in AI systems. Think training, inference, and deployment. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/aipref/about/">Their charter</a> is about giving users the power to say “yes,” “no,” or “only under these conditions.”</p>



<p>Why this matters: Consent banners and privacy policies are blunt instruments. If your app collects user content, you might soon need a finer-grained way to handle “don’t train on this” or “only use for personalization.” Product teams working on personalization, LLM features, or customer data ingestion should keep this on their radar.</p>



 Web Bot Authentication (BoF) 



<p>Born out of a hallway conversation, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/webbotauth/about/">Web Bot Authentication</a> group is asking what it means to authenticate bots—especially AI-powered ones—when they interact with websites meant for humans.</p>



<p>Why this matters: If your web properties are being used (or abused) by AI scrapers, this work could define how to tell the difference between legitimate agents and free-riders. This could impact content licensing models, rate-limiting strategies, and even customer support bots.</p>



 AI Agent Protocol (side meeting) 



<p>This one hasn’t formalized into a working group yet, but a side meeting at IETF 123 kicked off discussions about protocols for AI agents to act autonomously online by invoking APIs, collaborating with each other, making decisions, etc.</p>



<p>Why this matters: If you’re building or integrating with AI agents—anything from internal copilots to customer-facing assistants—expect questions soon about how they authenticate, how their actions are logged, and what delegation looks like at runtime.</p>



<p>(Also, please don’t schedule the next AI Agent meeting opposite WIMSE again. Some of us have to clone ourselves as-is.)</p>



 Beyond the IETF 



<p>Other standards bodies are also entering the fray. Here’s a quick tour of where else things are heating up:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/agentprotocol/">W3C AI Agent Protocol Community Group (CG)</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/agentprotocol/"> </a>is developing protocols for AI agents to find each other, identify themselves, and collaborate across the web. It’s early days, but think of it as DNS and HTTP for agentic AI. 



 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/aikr/">W3C AI K</a>R CG is focused on knowledge representation, i.e., how to structure information so AI systems (and people) can reason over it consistently. It is relevant to anyone dealing with search, ontologies, or explainability. 



 <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/">OpenID Foundation AI Identity Management CG</a> is mapping out how identity systems need to adapt to agentic AI. It’s not creating protocols (yet), but its members are watching government regulation closely.

 Signals to watch 



<p>Standards are slow… until they’re not. You don’t need to read every draft, but here are some signs that these efforts are going mainstream:</p>



 
 MCP (Model Context Protocol), which lets AI agents act autonomously by invoking APIs or services, is <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/17/the-mcp-bandwagon/">not a standard</a>, but it’s being adopted or piloted by major platforms like cloud providers and browsers. To function securely, it depends on underlying standards for identity chaining, authentication, and authorization—things like OAuth, delegation models, and token handling. 



 Vendor AI agent SDKs start referencing delegation models or bot authentication best practices. 



 Your compliance team starts asking about AI consent and model provenance. 
 



<p>When that happens, product managers will need to have answers or at least know where to look for them.</p>



 If you’re building anything touched by AI 



<p>This is just one slice of what’s happening in the standards space. No one—myself included—can keep up with it all. And if I try to AI-clone myself, who knows what hallucinations might creep in! But hopefully there’s enough cross-pollination between these (and other) efforts that we won’t be reinventing wheels or missing blind spots entirely.</p>



<p>If you’re an architect, engineer, or product leader, now’s a good time to:</p>



 
 Start mapping where AI agents (or their proxies) may interact with your system 



 Review your assumptions about trust, delegation, and human intent 



 Assign someone to monitor the relevant working groups or participate, if you can 
 



<p>Standards work isn’t glamorous, but it’s how the internet keeps functioning. And right now, the decisions being made will shape how agentic AI interacts with everything from your login flows to your support tools.</p>



<p>With luck—and a little planning—the next wave of automation won’t break the web. Or your roadmap.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>00:00:26 Welcome back to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>Today we’re diving into the latest round of AI buzz — but from the standards world. Specifically, we’ll unpack what happened at IETF123 in Madrid and how it connects to a much bigger, messier, and louder story: the infrastructure needed to support AI.</p>



<p>00:00:51 If you feel like there’s way too much going on in AI and standards right now to keep track of, you’re absolutely correct.</p>



<p>00:01:00 One of my goals in this episode is to give you a map — not of every working group or proposal, but of the most relevant conversations shaping the AI systems your teams will build on, run into, or be regulated by.</p>



 



 Agentic AI and Why It Matters 



 



<p>00:01:22 Let’s talk about agentic AI, because it’s especially interesting.</p>



<p>00:01:28 The term refers to AI systems that can take autonomous action.</p>



 
 Large language models integrated into agents that can invoke APIs 



 Systems that make decisions and complete multi-step tasks 



 Agents that interact across systems — for a user, or even for another agent 
 



<p>00:01:53 This is a big shift. Like most computing shifts, it won’t work unless the plumbing underneath is solid — identity delegation, authentication, policy enforcement.</p>



<p>00:02:18 So where is that plumbing discussed? Some of it happens in AI-specific groups, but much of the critical work is in mature standards groups that don’t even mention AI in their charters.</p>



 



 Delegation Chaining 



 



<p>00:02:51 One example is delegation chaining in OAuth/authorization.</p>



<p>00:03:01 This draft defines a way to preserve identity and authorization across multiple trust domains.</p>



<p>Why it matters:</p>



 
 AI agents often act on behalf of users across multiple systems 



 Without it, product teams end up “duct taping” credentials to every interaction — not scalable 



 A scheduling agent booking travel crosses multiple trust boundaries 
 



<p>00:03:44 This work began before AI hype took off — but agentic AI makes it urgent.</p>



 



 Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments (WHIMSY) 



 



<p>00:04:05 Another crucial effort is WHIMSY — short for Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments.</p>



<p>00:04:21 It tackles how services, bots, APIs, and AI agents assert identity across environments.</p>



 
 Relevant for agentic AI because these identities aren’t tied to human sessions 



 Helps establish runtime identity for autonomous systems 
 



<p>00:04:52 Takeaway: If it doesn’t say AI, it can still be vital to AI infrastructure.</p>



 



 AI-Focused Standards Groups at IETF 



 



<p>00:05:01 Of course, there are groups with AI in their name and charter.</p>



 AI Preferences Working Group (AI-Pref) 



<p>00:05:08 This group is creating a standard way for users (or systems) to express data-use preferences for AI:</p>



 
 Training 



 Inference 



 Deployment 
 



<p>The aim is to move beyond vague privacy policies toward technical mechanisms for enforcing user preferences.</p>



 Web Bot Authentication (BoF) 



<p>00:05:58 A discussion about how bots — especially AI-powered ones — should identify themselves when accessing human-oriented websites.</p>



<p>Questions under debate:</p>



 
 Are bots allowed? 



 How should they authenticate? 



 How do we distinguish helpful agents from malicious scrapers? 



 Who’s accountable when things go wrong? 
 



 AI Agent Protocol (Side Meeting) 



<p>00:07:02 This informal discussion explored whether the IETF should standardize protocols for AI agents to discover, invoke, and communicate.</p>



<p>Connections to existing work:</p>



 
 MCP (Model Context Protocol) is emerging in pilots 



 Secure use depends on OAuth delegation chaining and other identity models 
 



 



 Beyond IETF: W3C and OpenID Foundation 



 



<p>00:08:14 Standards work isn’t just at the IETF.</p>



<p>W3C Community Groups:</p>



 
 AI Agent Protocol CG – protocols for how agents identify, collaborate, and operate on the web 



 AI Knowledge Representation CG – structuring domain knowledge so AI systems can reason and explain themselves 
 



<p>OpenID Foundation:</p>



 
 AI Identity Management CG – mapping use cases, identifying gaps, tracking regulations 



 Not building protocols, but providing a regulatory and technical landscape view 
 



 



 What Product Teams Should Do 



 



<p>00:09:27 For product managers and executives, here are the practical takeaways:</p>



 
 Understand where delegation fits in your systems 



 Define identity for non-human actors — avoid relying on user credentials 



 Implement technical enforcement of consent for AI agent actions 



 Track compliance triggers early to avoid future architectural rework 
 



<p>00:10:44 Watch for signals:</p>



 
 MCP or delegation models adopted by major vendors 



 New authentication guidance for bots and agents 



 Increased compliance chatter about AI-related access 
 



 



 Final Thoughts 



 



<p>00:11:10 This is just one slice of a fast-moving standards space.</p>



<p>If the right people connect across groups, we can avoid duplication, fill gaps, and lay the groundwork for agentic AI that’s safe, scalable, and standards-aligned.</p>



<p>00:11:39 Keep your eye on the standards — even if your platform isn’t “AI-first,” its infrastructure is being shaped right now.</p>

 Behind every digital interaction is a technical standard working quietly in the background. Here, we explore some of the most important in the digital identity space and explain how they’ll affect how you verify customers very soon. 



 



<p>Over the past few years, the European Union (EU) has garnered much attention in its goal to transform how people interact with governments, businesses, and each other online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Central to its mission is the rollout of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity EUDI) Wallet</a>, a secure, portable digital identity solution set to become the foundation for cross-border services, e-government, and AML-compliant onboarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two regulations in particular, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a>, are redefining how identity and trust are managed across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the core of the transformation lie technical standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These are legally binding through Commission Implementing Regulations (CIRs), which lay the groundwork for secure, interoperable, and compliant digital identity services.</p>



<p>For example, earlier this year, IDnow became <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">one of the first companies in Europe </a>to receive certification under the latest ETSI standard for remote identity proofing, signifying a crucial step toward meeting eIDAS 2.0 and AMLD 6 requirements. One of the most important technical standards we achieved was the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 certification, which is widely considered the ‘compliance benchmark’ for remote identity verification in Europe.</p>



<p>Technical standards ensure interoperability across borders, promote security by design, and create the certainty businesses need to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’ve championed the EU’s vision for a more harmonized approach to digital identity from the start. Our priority has always been to promote open, secure standards that allow technical innovation to thrive. In a regulatory environment that began shifting from voluntary best practices to mandatory rules, we welcome the clarity and opportunity that harmonized standards bring to the market, to institutions, and above all, to users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For IDnow’s regulatory and standards department it is important to keep looking ahead to what comes next and how it will affect the everyday lives of people. Standards play a crucial role in ensuring that impact is not only manageable, but truly beneficial. This remains the bedrock of our mission.</p>

 Why standards matter. 



<p>Behind every digital interaction, such as verifying your identity for bank account opening or digitally signing a contract, there are technical standards working quietly in the background. These standards ensure that systems speak the same language, that data remains secure, and that services can be trusted no matter where in the EU (or beyond) they are used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations like ETSI, CEN, and ISO play a critical role in setting these benchmarks. They bring together experts from governments, tech companies, and the public sector to define how trust services, digital identity, and secure onboarding should work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the EUDI Wallet and new trust services move from concept to implementation, these standards are not just technical specifications or guidelines; they are becoming the legal foundation for the way digital identity is handled across Europe.</p>



 Laying the foundation for trust. 



<p>The shift toward standards-driven digital identity and trust services offers better technology and builds a harmonized, secure, and legally enforceable ecosystem across borders. With the EUDI Wallet and the upcoming AMLR, Europe is setting a global precedent in how identity, privacy, and trust should be handled in the digital age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standards from ETSI and CEN are already embedded in the first wave of EU’s CIRs and will directly guide how identities are verified, wallets are certified, and trust services are recognized. These aren’t abstract technical documents anymore; they’re becoming the blueprint for how millions of people will access digital services, from banking to healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What often goes unseen is the deep, ongoing work that makes this possible. At IDnow, our regulatory and standards team has been deeply engaged behind the scenes as we work alongside our colleagues at ETSI, CEN and ISO to shape these standards in a way that balances security, innovation, and practical deployment. It’s this kind of collaboration that enables digital services to scale with confidence and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More specifically, IDnow has recently contributed to the following standards and technical reports:</p>



  ETSI TR 119 476-1. A feasibility study of how selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented in the EUDI Wallet. IDnow was one of the main contributors to this technical report.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  ETSI TS 119 461: Requirements that define how identity proofing must be performed when enrolling for a Qualified Certificate or a Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes. The standard can also be applied to Personal Identification Data (PID) enrollment to the EUDI Wallet and AMLR guidelines. IDnow has been co-editors and contributors to both versions of this standard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  ETSI TS 119 431: Specifies how remote signing with Qualified Certificates should be deployed in a remote Qualified Signature Creation Device. IDnow designed the new approach to only rely upon identification for one-time Qualified Electronic Signatures, which streamlines the remote signing process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  CEN TS 18098: Outlines how to onboard PID to EUDI Wallets. IDnow has been co-editors of the chapters related to identity proofing during the on-boarding process.  



<p>Regardless of whether you’re a wallet provider, financial institution, or public sector authority, now is the time to take a close look at how your internal systems align with these evolving standards. After all, these specifications are not optional; they are rapidly becoming the rulebook for trust in Europe.</p>

<p>Munich, August 12, 2025 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announced that several of its flagship products had achieved ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 certification, the technical standard widely considered the ‘compliance benchmark’ for remote identity verification in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 was selected by the European Commission as the standard for AML-compliant identity verification for qualified trust services and the upcoming Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR).</p>



<p>The certification was awarded following rigorous testing by the accredited conformity assessment body, QSCert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obtaining certification in ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 establishes IDnow as one of the first providers in Europe to fulfill the stringent biometric and security standards necessary for compliant identity verification in line with evolving European regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 and AMLD6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why this matters for European businesses&nbsp; 



<p>With rising threats from deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated types of online fraud, especially in the finance, mobility, and telecom sectors, the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 standard outlines a comprehensive European framework for compliant identity verification services, including requirements for presentation attack detection, injection attack detection, and biometric-integrity assurance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This milestone is not only a technical and security achievement; it is a practical commitment to advancing digital onboarding in the most regulated industries. We’re proud to lead the way in enabling compliant, secure, and user-friendly identity verification across all major digital channels.</p>Armin Berghaus, Founder and Managing Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



 What comes next&nbsp; 



<p>As one of the first identity verification providers to be certified under the latest eIDAS 2.0 requirements, and the Extended Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) security standards, IDnow enables customers to adopt a variety of compliant identity verification solutions, each of which fulfill existing and upcoming European regulatory expectations and trust service requirements:&nbsp;</p>



  Expert-led video identity verification&nbsp;  



  Automated identity verification&nbsp;  



  NFC (Near Field Communication) identity verification&nbsp;  



  Electronic ID card (eID) verification&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet verification (which all EU banks will need to accept by 2027)&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>All above options are supported by IDnow’s identity verification and fraud prevention platform, which combines certified biometric checks, real-time fraud prevention, and seamless orchestration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2027, all banks that operate in Europe will be required to work with providers that are certified to the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 standard, allowing IDnow customers to have peace of mind today that its range of expert-led, automated and wallet-based identity verification solutions meet existing and upcoming EU regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This latest certification confirms IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof technology partner for regulated businesses across Europe,” added Berghaus. “It represents our intention for IDnow to continue to provide the most flexible and future-proof identity verification and fraud prevention platform for businesses navigating complex European compliance and customer experience demands.”</p>

<p>Credit unions worldwide are facing increasing AML scrutiny, especially in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Australia. This article explores KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in these jurisdictions, and shows how iComply helps automate up to 90% of compliance tasks—while preserving member privacy and trust.</p>
 
 Credit unions are the lifeblood of community banking across many of the world’s leading economies. From rural Canada to urban Australia, they offer cooperative financial services rooted in trust, mutual benefit, and member care. But in 2025, those same institutions are being held to banking-grade compliance standards—particularly when it comes to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF). 
<p>With national regulators ramping up inspections and issuing new guidance, credit unions must modernize their approach to KYB, KYC, AML, and even KYT – without alienating members or overwhelming staff.</p>
 Global AML Expectations for Credit Unions 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC (federal), BCFSA or FSRA (provincial) 
 Requirements: Identity verification for members and beneficial owners, ongoing PEP/sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulator: NCUA, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD rule compliance, beneficial ownership verification for legal entity accounts, SAR filing, and compliance with the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA and PRA 
 Requirements: Customer due diligence, screening against the UK Sanctions List, ongoing monitoring, and robust AML/CTF controls under MLR 2017 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: Member identification, source of funds checks, transaction monitoring, suspicious matter reporting (SMRs), and annual AML program reviews 
 
 What Credit Unions Must Do 
<p>To comply across jurisdictions, credit unions typically must:</p>
 
 Verify identities of natural persons and business account holders 
 Conduct beneficial ownership checks for corporate members 
 Screen members and transactions for PEPs, sanctions, and suspicious patterns 
 Maintain audit-ready documentation and report to regulators 
 
 Why Compliance Is Especially Challenging for Credit Unions 
 
 Lean compliance teams and manual review processes 
 Multiple disconnected systems for ID, screening, and reporting 
 Tight budgets with little room for complex vendor integration 
 Member-first culture that resists high-friction onboarding

 The Supply Chain Transparency Crisis <p>Global supply chains are under more pressure than ever. Delays in verifying suppliers, counterfeit goods slipping through the cracks, and unproven ethical sourcing claims have left retailers and manufacturers scrambling to protect trust. Traditional verification systems (slow, manual, and vulnerable to manipulation) can’t keep up.</p><p>Without instant proof of business registration, certifications, or compliance status, production stalls. Counterfeit goods remain a multi-billion-dollar problem, undermining brand reputations and putting consumers at risk. Ethical sourcing claims often rely on unverified labels, leaving “fair trade” or “sustainably sourced” promises open to doubt.</p> How VDCs Transform Supply Chain Operations <p>Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are cryptographically signed records that can be instantly checked for authenticity. In supply chains, they replace the patchwork of PDFs, phone calls, and manual forms with secure, real-time verification.</p><p>They work across global trade systems, integrating with logistics software, ERP platforms, and customs processes. Whether it’s confirming a supplier overseas or verifying a product’s compliance with safety regulations, VDCs allow companies to act in seconds instead of weeks.</p> Real-World Examples of VDC Impact  Walmart <p>Faced with delays, counterfeits, and unverifiable ethical claims, <a href="https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us/blog/post/blockchain-in-the-food-supply-chain.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Walmart implemented VDCs</a> to:</p>  Verify suppliers in seconds with cryptographic certainty.  Authenticate products from source to shelf.  Prove ethical sourcing through tamper-proof records.The result: faster time to market, stronger consumer trust, and reduced risk.   Amazon <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/post/amazons-plan-for-digital-ids?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Amazon is exploring VDCs</a> to streamline marketplace seller onboarding, reducing the time from application to listing, while keeping counterfeit goods out of its ecosystem. This protects both customers and legitimate sellers.</p> Target <p><a href="https://corporate.target.com/sustainability-governance/responsible-supply-chains?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Target</a> safeguards its quality standards by verifying supplier credentials and tracking product origins. VDCs provide data-backed proof that meets consumer expectations for safety and integrity.</p> Tesla <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biserdimitrov/2020/04/14/how-tesla-and-bmw-are-leading-a-supply-chain-renaissance-with-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Tesla is testing VDC-based tracking</a> for raw materials, ensuring that minerals like cobalt meet strict sustainability and human rights criteria before they enter the supply chain.</p><p>Across industries, VDC adoption is building supply chains that are faster, more resilient, and more transparent.</p> The Business Case for VDC Adoption in Supply Chain <p>Companies are embracing VDCs for three main reasons:</p>  Speed: Supplier verification shrinks from months to days, accelerating launches.  Fraud prevention: Cryptographic verification blocks fake credentials and counterfeit products.  Transparency: Real-time, verifiable records meet regulator and consumer demands for proof.  <p>In competitive markets, proving your supply chain story isn’t just compliance, it’s a differentiator.</p> What’s Next for Supply Chain Credentials <p>Emerging trends promise to make VDCs even more powerful:</p>  Blockchain integration for immutable supply chain records.  IoT tracking to connect physical goods to digital credentials in real time.  AI-driven verification for smarter fraud detection.  <p>With regulators moving toward requiring verifiable transparency, adoption will soon shift from competitive advantage to a baseline requirement.</p> The Bottom Line <p>Verifiable digital credentials are no longer futuristic, they’re here and already transforming global commerce. From Walmart’s operational gains to Tesla’s sustainability tracking, the results show that verification delays can be eliminated, counterfeits shut out, and ethical sourcing backed by proof.</p><p>If your organization is ready to explore VDCs for supplier verification, product authentication, and ethical sourcing, SpruceID can help design and deploy systems that meet global standards and build consumer trust.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, neobanks have gone from quirky fintech experiments to mainstream financial players with millions of customers. They’ve disrupted the banking industry with slick mobile-first experiences, instant account opening, low-cost international transfers, and a level of UX design that traditional banks could never match. They’ve made banking feel as simple as ordering coffee on an app.</p>



<p>But here’s the paradox: the same features that make neobanks so attractive to customers also make them magnets for regulatory scrutiny. Their speed, scale, and minimal friction create an environment where financial crime risks can flourish if not properly managed.</p>



<p>This article lays the groundwork for our exploration of how neobanks can balance innovation and anti-money laundering (AML) obligations. We’ll examine the forces driving their rise, the inherent compliance vulnerabilities in their operating models, and why regulators are increasingly focused on this sector.</p>



 



<p>The Rise of the Neobank</p>



<p>Neobanks emerged to solve what traditional banks couldn’t—or wouldn’t—address: customer frustration with slow, outdated systems and poor digital experiences. By building technology from scratch and skipping costly branch networks, they’ve delivered:</p>



 
 Faster onboarding – Account opening in minutes, not days or weeks. 



 Lower fees – Leaner cost structures allow for free or low-cost accounts. 



 Feature agility – Rolling out new features like budgeting tools, crypto access, or instant payments in weeks instead of months. 



 Borderless finance – Serving customers across multiple jurisdictions without physical presence. 
 



<p>It’s a model that’s captured millions of users, especially younger demographics who value speed and convenience over tradition. According to industry reports, Europe alone now has over 50 active neobanks, with combined customer bases in the tens of millions.</p>



 



<p>Innovation’s Compliance Catch-22</p>



<p>Innovation in financial services is a double-edged sword. The very attributes that make neobanks competitive also introduce AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) vulnerabilities:</p>



 
 Frictionless onboarding can reduce verification steps that deter fraudsters. 



 High growth velocity strains compliance teams and processes. 



 Cross-border operations complicate sanctions screening and KYC due to jurisdictional differences. 



 API-driven ecosystems with third-party integrations create additional exposure to weak links in the compliance chain. 
 



<p>The pattern is familiar: a neobank launches lean, scales rapidly, and focuses on growth KPIs. Compliance, while acknowledged, is often treated as a parallel track rather than an embedded function. This works—until it doesn’t.</p>



 



<p>The Regulatory Lens</p>



<p>Regulators have made it clear: they expect neobanks to operate at the same AML/CTF standard as any major bank. In fact, given the heightened perceived risk, they often scrutinize neobanks more closely.</p>



<p>In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has penalized multiple neobanks for failing to keep financial crime controls in step with growth. One cited case noted that the bank “underwent exponential growth” but “its financial crime controls… failed to keep pace with its growth.”</p>



<p>In Lithuania, Revolut was fined €3.5 million in 2025 for weaknesses in AML prevention, including inadequate ongoing monitoring and insufficient enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers.</p>



<p>These are not isolated incidents. Similar enforcement actions have played out across Europe and beyond. The pattern is consistent: initial praise for innovation gives way to public penalties when compliance gaps surface.</p>



 



<p>Why Neobanks Are a Unique Compliance Challenge</p>



<p>Neobanks aren’t just smaller versions of traditional banks—they’re structurally different:</p>



 
 Tech-first architecture means rapid deployments, frequent product updates, and short development cycles, which can leave little time for compliance testing. 



 Lean staffing models often result in under-resourced compliance functions. 



 Global customer acquisition creates complexity in AML rules and sanctions obligations. 



 Appeal to underserved and high-mobility customers can inadvertently increase exposure to higher-risk profiles. 
 



<p>Traditional banks have decades of experience embedding compliance into their operations. Neobanks are often building this muscle while already sprinting to capture market share.</p>



 



<p>The Cost of Getting It Wrong</p>



<p>The penalties for failing to meet AML obligations are not just financial:</p>



 
 Regulatory fines can reach millions. 



 Reputational damage can trigger customer churn and investor unease. 



 Operational disruption from remediation programs diverts resources from innovation. 



 Licensing risk if authorities impose restrictions or revoke permissions. 
 



<p>Perhaps most damaging is the erosion of trust. In digital banking, where customers can switch providers in minutes, trust is as valuable as capital.</p>



 



<p>Why Compliance Must Be a Growth Enabler</p>



<p>Too often, compliance is seen as the brakes on innovation. In reality, when done well, it’s the safety harness that lets you go faster without falling.</p>



<p>Proactive compliance enables:</p>



 
 Faster market entry – By meeting licensing requirements without delay. 



 Better partnerships – Banks, payment processors, and card networks favor well-governed partners. 



 Higher valuations – Investors prize resilience and risk management. 



 Customer confidence – Security and trust are competitive advantages. 
 



<p>Embedding AML and CTF controls into the innovation process ensures that growth is sustainable. It also protects the very agility that defines neobanks.</p>



 



<p>The Road Ahead</p>



<p>The future will not get easier for neobanks from a compliance perspective. Regulatory convergence, global political instability affecting sanctions regimes, and rising expectations for real-time monitoring are raising the bar.</p>



<p>Those that succeed will be the ones that:</p>



 
 Design compliance into their products from day one. 



 Leverage technology to scale AML without scaling headcount linearly. 



 Foster a culture where compliance and innovation are not in conflict but in partnership. 
 



 



<p>Lessons from the UK and European Enforcement Actions</p>



<p>When it comes to neobanks, nothing makes the compliance message land quite like a high-profile regulatory fine. In the past few years, the UK and Europe have provided more than a few cautionary tales, and these cases reveal a consistent pattern: innovation raced ahead while financial crime controls lagged behind.</p>



 



<p>The FCA’s Verdict: Growth Without Guardrails</p>



<p>In July 2025, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Monzo £21 million for AML control failures. The summary was blunt: the bank “underwent exponential growth” but “its financial crime controls failed to keep pace.”</p>



<p>The FCA found:</p>



 
 Accounts opened with implausible addresses. 



 Weak onboarding checks for higher-risk customers. 



 Gaps in ongoing transaction monitoring. 



 Insufficient escalation of suspicious activity. 
 



<p>The result? Regulatory penalties, a reputational dent, and costly remediation efforts that consumed management attention.</p>



<p>Key takeaway: Scaling customer acquisition without proportionally scaling compliance capability is a recipe for regulatory trouble.</p>



 



<p>Revolut in Lithuania: A European Echo</p>



<p>In April 2025, Lithuania’s central bank fined Revolut €3.5 million for AML prevention shortcomings. Issues included:</p>



 
 Failure to conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk customers. 



 Inadequate ongoing monitoring. 



 Underinvestment in compliance resources. 
 



<p>Lithuania’s enforcement demonstrated that even highly valued fintechs with sophisticated technology stacks are not immune if compliance discipline slips.</p>



<p>Key takeaway: Global brand recognition and tech prowess do not offset the need for fundamental AML hygiene.</p>



 



<p>The Broader European Picture</p>



<p>Across Europe, regulators have issued similar findings:</p>



 
 Customer due diligence gaps – Failing to collect and verify sufficient KYC data at onboarding. 



 Sanctions screening lapses – Outdated watchlists, missed updates tied to geopolitical events. 



 Transaction monitoring weaknesses – Rules not calibrated to detect suspicious patterns, leading to missed SAR filings. 
 



<p>These issues weren’t confined to one jurisdiction. The common thread is that fast-growing neobanks underestimated the operational complexity of AML compliance.</p>



 



<p>Common Failure Modes</p>



<p>By examining these cases side-by-side, we can identify recurring weaknesses:</p>



 
 Reactive Compliance – Waiting for regulators to point out gaps rather than self-identifying and addressing them. 



 Under-resourced Teams – Compliance departments stretched too thin to handle growing volumes and complexity. 



 Static Processes – Onboarding and monitoring rules that don’t adapt to new products, geographies, or threat vectors. 



 Data Silos – KYC, transaction, and sanctions screening systems not fully integrated, causing missed risk signals. 
 



 



<p>The Cost Beyond Fines</p>



<p>It’s tempting to see these cases as simply financial penalties, but the damage runs deeper:</p>



 
 Customer trust erosion – Negative headlines shake confidence in the brand. 



 Partner skepticism – Banking partners, card issuers, and payment networks may impose stricter oversight or limits. 



 Valuation impact – Investors may demand higher risk premiums or delay funding rounds. 



 Operational drag – Remediation programs can freeze new feature rollouts and product launches. 
 



<p>In digital banking, where switching costs are low, trust lost can be market share lost.</p>



 



<p>Lessons for Today’s Neobanks</p>



<p>From these enforcement actions, a set of actionable lessons emerges:</p>



 
 Scale Compliance in Parallel with Growth<br>Budget for compliance headcount, training, and technology in proportion to customer growth. Don’t let product and marketing run ahead unchecked. 



 Embed Ongoing Monitoring Early<br>Don’t treat transaction monitoring as a post-launch add-on. Build adaptive monitoring capabilities from the start. 



 Maintain Live Sanctions Lists<br>Automate sanctions updates and integrate them into real-time screening workflows. 



 Invest in Integration<br>Break down data silos. Ensure KYC, AML, and transaction monitoring systems feed into a single customer risk profile. 



 Run Proactive Audits<br>Simulate regulatory inspections to identify weaknesses before they’re found for you. 
 



 



<p>Why This Matters More Now</p>



<p>The stakes are higher in 2025 than ever before:</p>



 
 Regulatory convergence is making it harder to exploit jurisdictional gaps. 



 Political instability is driving rapid sanctions changes. 



 Criminal networks are getting more sophisticated in exploiting digital banking loopholes. 
 



<p>In this environment, learning from past failures isn’t optional—it’s survival.</p>



 



<p>Embedding Compliance into the DNA of Innovation</p>



<p>For neobanks, the challenge is not just about meeting regulatory requirements—it’s about weaving compliance into the very fabric of their innovation processes.</p>



 



<p>Compliance as a Design Principle</p>



<p>In too many neobanks, compliance is treated as a bolt-on function: a gate at the end of product development. That mindset inevitably creates tension between product teams eager to launch and compliance teams tasked with slowing them down. The alternative is embedding compliance checkpoints directly into the product lifecycle:</p>



 
 Discovery and planning – Risk assessments for new features before development begins. 



 Development – Compliance engineers and analysts embedded with product squads. 



 Testing – AML and KYC workflows included in QA testing. 



 Launch – Go-live contingent on compliance sign-off. 
 



 



<p>Agile, But Accountable</p>



<p>Neobanks thrive on agile development cycles. To preserve speed without sacrificing compliance:</p>



 
 Build modular compliance components (e.g., KYC APIs, sanctions screening engines) that can be reused across products. 



 Create automated test suites to check compliance functionality during each sprint. 



 Maintain a shared risk backlog alongside product backlogs to ensure transparency. 
 



 



<p>Leveraging Technology for Built-In Compliance</p>



<p>The right tech stack allows compliance to scale with innovation:</p>



 
 Real-time onboarding checks – ID verification, biometric matching, and sanctions screening embedded in account creation flows. 



 Continuous transaction monitoring – AI-driven analytics that adjust to new transaction types as they are released. 



 Regulatory change tracking – Automated updates to rules and screening lists. 
 



 



<p>Cultural Integration</p>



<p>Processes and tools only work if the culture supports them. Embedding compliance into innovation requires:</p>



 
 Leadership buy-in that compliance is a growth enabler. 



 Cross-functional training so product managers understand AML obligations. 



 Shared KPIs that measure both feature delivery and compliance quality. 
 



 



<p>Measuring Success</p>



<p>You know compliance is embedded when:</p>



 
 New products launch without last-minute compliance delays. 



 Compliance alerts and escalations decrease in volume but increase in accuracy. 



 Regulatory audits confirm alignment between product design and AML frameworks. 
 



 



<p>The Core Pillars of a Neobank AML Framework</p>



<p>If embedding compliance into the innovation process is the philosophy, the AML framework is the architecture. For neobanks, this architecture must be more than a compliance checklist—it’s the foundation for operational resilience, regulatory trust, and customer confidence.</p>



<p>A mature AML framework has three interlocking pillars: real-time transaction monitoring, dynamic sanctions screening, and continuous customer due diligence (CDD). Each pillar reinforces the others, and together they create a 360-degree risk view that scales with the business.</p>



 



<p>Pillar 1: Real-Time Transaction Monitoring</p>



<p>Neobanks operate at the velocity of digital life—instant transfers, round-the-clock payments, multi-currency flows. Traditional end-of-day batch monitoring isn’t enough. Real-time transaction monitoring allows suspicious activity to be flagged and acted on before damage is done.</p>



<p>Key capabilities for neobanks:</p>



 
 Rule-based detection for known risk patterns (e.g., structuring, rapid movement between accounts, sudden high-value activity). 



 Machine learning models to identify anomalies beyond pre-set rules, learning from historical data and analyst feedback. 



 Behavioral baselining to compare current activity against a customer’s historic profile. 



 Immediate interdiction capabilities to pause or block transactions pending review. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: For neobanks, speed is the product. The monitoring system must match that speed without overwhelming analysts with false positives. That means tuning detection thresholds dynamically and using tiered alert routing to focus resources where risk is highest.</p>



 



<p>Pillar 2: Dynamic Sanctions Screening</p>



<p>In a geopolitical climate where sanctions lists can change overnight, static screening is a liability. Neobanks must integrate dynamic, automated sanctions updates into both onboarding and ongoing monitoring.</p>



<p>Essential practices:</p>



 
 Daily or real-time sanctions feed updates from multiple jurisdictions (OFAC, HMT, EU, UN, etc.). 



 List version control for auditability—knowing exactly which list version was in force at any point. 



 Name matching algorithms that handle transliteration, aliases, and fuzzy matches to reduce missed hits. 



 Screening at every touchpoint—account opening, beneficiary addition, incoming/outgoing transfers. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: Sanctions risk is not confined to politically exposed persons. It includes corporate entities, shipping vessels, crypto wallets, and more. Leading neobanks expand their screening universe to cover all relevant counterparties and payment paths.</p>



 



<p>Pillar 3: Continuous Customer Due Diligence (CDD)</p>



<p>Customer due diligence isn’t a one-and-done process. For high-growth neobanks, the initial KYC check is only the start. Risk profiles change over time—customers move, change jobs, switch geographies, or alter transaction behavior.</p>



<p>Best-in-class CDD involves:</p>



 
 Periodic reverification—timed to risk tier or triggered by behavioral changes. 



 Enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk segments, such as politically exposed persons or customers in sanctioned jurisdictions. 



 Ongoing adverse media checks to detect reputational or criminal exposure. 



 Customer risk scoring updates that incorporate transaction monitoring outcomes. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: Continuous CDD is where many neobanks stumble because it requires operational discipline. Automating reverification triggers and linking them to transaction and sanctions data allows compliance to scale without massive headcount growth.</p>



 



<p>Integrating the Pillars: The Unified Risk Profile</p>



<p>The power of these pillars is fully realized when their data feeds converge into a single, dynamic customer risk profile. In practice, this means:</p>



 
 Identity data, sanctions status, and transaction behavior live in one dashboard. 



 Risk scores update automatically as new information arrives. 



 Alerts are contextualized—analysts see the full picture, not just a fragment. 
 



<p>This unified view accelerates investigations, improves SAR quality, and satisfies regulator expectations for audit-ready, data-driven decision-making.</p>



 



<p>Building for Scale and Flexibility</p>



<p>For neobanks, AML frameworks must be elastic—capable of scaling transaction volumes, adding new geographies, and integrating emerging payment types without breaking. That requires:</p>



 
 Cloud-native infrastructure to handle variable loads. 



 API-first design to plug in new data sources or analytics modules. 



 Configurable rules engines so compliance teams can respond rapidly to regulatory changes. 



 Cross-functional governance to ensure AML changes align with product and customer impact. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: The future of AML will be defined by adaptability. Neobanks that treat compliance rules as code—versioned, tested, and deployed like any other software—will respond faster to evolving risks and regulations.</p>



 



<p>Measuring Framework Effectiveness</p>



<p>An AML framework should be managed like any other strategic asset, with defined performance metrics:</p>



 
 Detection rate of true suspicious activity vs. false positives. 



 Average investigation time from alert to disposition. 



 Regulatory findings in audits or inspections. 



 Customer impact metrics to ensure controls don’t degrade user experience. 
 



<p>Regular internal reviews, coupled with independent assurance, keep the framework sharp and credible.</p>



 



<p>Leveraging Technology to Scale Compliance with Growth</p>



<p>As neobanks expand, their compliance challenge grows not just in size, but in complexity. More customers mean more transactions, more jurisdictions, and more potential exposure to financial crime typologies. The question for leadership is no longer whether to invest in compliance technology—it’s how to design a regtech strategy that scales in lockstep with the business.</p>



 



<p>The Scaling Challenge</p>



<p>Compliance processes that work for 100,000 customers can quickly collapse under the strain of 10 million. Manual reviews, fragmented systems, and static rule sets become bottlenecks. Worse, they create blind spots that bad actors can exploit.</p>



<p>Scaling compliance is not about throwing more people at the problem. It’s about building technology-driven capabilities that can:</p>



 
 Process high transaction volumes in real time. 



 Adapt to new products, payment types, and regulatory changes without months of re-engineering. 



 Support analysts by automating low-risk decisions and prioritizing high-risk cases. 
 



 



<p>AI-Driven Transaction Monitoring</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence has moved from buzzword to baseline in AML monitoring. Machine learning models can:</p>



 
 Detect subtle anomalies in transaction patterns. 



 Adjust risk scores dynamically based on behavior changes. 



 Reduce false positives by learning from historical analyst decisions. 
 



<p>For neobanks, AI monitoring is not just about detection accuracy—it’s about maintaining speed. In a digital-first environment, detection and interdiction need to occur in milliseconds, not hours.</p>



<p>Leadership insight: Successful AI deployment requires clean, well-labeled data and ongoing human oversight. Treat models as dynamic components that evolve with customer behavior and threat landscapes.</p>



 



<p>Automated Sanctions and PEP Screening</p>



<p>Automating sanctions updates and politically exposed person (PEP) screening ensures that no transaction slips through due to outdated lists. Modern solutions:</p>



 
 Pull real-time feeds from multiple regulatory sources. 



 Apply fuzzy logic and transliteration handling to capture name variations. 



 Re-screen customers continuously, not just at onboarding. 
 



<p>Integration is critical—sanctions and PEP status should directly influence transaction monitoring and customer risk scoring.</p>



 



<p>API-First Compliance Architecture</p>



<p>An API-first approach ensures that compliance services—KYC verification, sanctions screening, risk scoring—can be embedded anywhere in the neobank’s ecosystem. This enables:</p>



 
 Consistent application of controls across web, mobile, and partner integrations. 



 Rapid rollout of compliance capabilities to new products without duplicating effort. 



 Centralized policy updates that propagate instantly to all touchpoints. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: API-first design is not just about technology; it’s about governance. Central compliance APIs ensure that policies are applied uniformly, preventing gaps between products or regions.</p>



 



<p>Workflow Automation and Case Management</p>



<p>As alert volumes grow, manual case triage can overwhelm teams. Advanced case management systems:</p>



 
 Automatically assign alerts based on risk, complexity, and analyst expertise. 



 Aggregate KYC, transaction, and sanctions data into a single investigation view. 



 Trigger escalation workflows with clear audit trails. 
 



<p>Automation doesn’t replace analysts—it frees them to focus on the cases where human judgment adds the most value.</p>



 



<p>Cross-Platform Data Integration</p>



<p>In high-growth neobanks, data often sits in silos—onboarding systems, payment platforms, fraud detection, CRM. Integrating these data streams is essential for a unified view of customer risk.</p>



<p>Modern compliance platforms use:</p>



 
 Data lakes to consolidate structured and unstructured data. 



 Real-time ETL pipelines to ensure information is current. 



 Graph analytics to map relationships between accounts, devices, and transactions. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: Data integration is a force multiplier—improving detection rates, reducing false positives, and accelerating investigations.</p>



 



<p>Regtech Partnerships</p>



<p>Neobanks don’t need to build every compliance capability in-house. The regtech ecosystem offers:</p>



 
 Specialist vendors for identity verification, sanctions screening, blockchain analytics. 



 Cloud-native AML platforms with pre-built integrations. 



 Machine learning tools tuned for financial crime detection. 
 



<p>The key is selecting partners that can scale with your volumes and adapt to your risk profile.</p>



 



<p>Balancing Automation with Human Oversight</p>



<p>Automation drives efficiency, but regulators expect human accountability. Neobanks must:</p>



 
 Maintain documented oversight of automated decisions. 



 Periodically review and recalibrate rules and models. 



 Ensure escalation paths are clear when systems flag potential issues. 
 



 



<p>Building a Technology Roadmap</p>



<p>Compliance technology should be guided by a multi-year roadmap aligned with business growth. This includes:</p>



 
 Forecasting alert volumes based on customer acquisition targets. 



 Prioritizing automation in the highest-impact areas. 



 Planning for cross-border regulatory requirements. 



 Building in flexibility for emerging risks (e.g., new payment rails, digital assets). 
 



<p>Leadership insight: Your compliance tech roadmap is as strategic as your product roadmap. Both should be developed in parallel to avoid costly retrofits.</p>



 



<p>Measuring ROI on Compliance Technology</p>



<p>The return on investment isn’t just about cost savings—it’s about avoided losses, reduced regulatory risk, and accelerated growth. Key metrics include:</p>



 
 Reduction in false positive rates. 



 Investigation time per alert. 



 Successful prevention of suspicious transactions. 



 Audit findings and regulatory feedback. 
 



 



<p>The Proactive AML Mindset</p>



<p>Up to this point, we’ve discussed the frameworks, pillars, and technologies that enable neobanks to manage AML compliance. But the real differentiator—the factor that separates market leaders from those perpetually reacting to crises—is mindset.</p>



<p>A proactive AML mindset shifts the organization from compliance as a defensive necessity to compliance as a strategic asset. It is a philosophy where anticipating risks is as important as detecting them, and where every employee—from engineers to executives—understands their role in safeguarding the bank’s integrity.</p>



 



<p>From Reactive to Predictive</p>



<p>Many neobanks begin with a reactive posture: respond to regulator queries, adjust after a penalty, patch gaps only when exposed. This cycle erodes trust and burns resources.</p>



<p>Proactive AML leaders break the cycle by:</p>



 
 Identifying emerging risks before they become incidents. 



 Analyzing global enforcement actions to anticipate potential vulnerabilities. 



 Engaging regulators early to align on expectations before launching new products. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: A proactive stance is not about over-engineering controls—it’s about ensuring that risk assessment drives product design and operational planning.</p>



 



<p>Embedding Risk Intelligence</p>



<p>Proactive compliance leaders create feedback loops that feed risk intelligence into decision-making at all levels:</p>



 
 Frontline data capture – Customer interactions, onboarding anomalies, and transaction irregularities are logged and analyzed. 



 Cross-functional review – Product, compliance, and data science teams collaborate to assess risk implications of new features. 



 Threat intelligence integration – Data from industry bodies, law enforcement, and open-source intelligence enriches internal monitoring. 
 



<p>By making risk data accessible and actionable, the organization gains a real-time understanding of its exposure.</p>



 



<p>Continuous Risk Assessment</p>



<p>Proactive AML programs never treat risk assessment as an annual event. They:</p>



 
 Conduct rolling assessments by product line and geography. 



 Update risk registers when new threats or typologies emerge. 



 Use simulation exercises to stress-test controls under realistic scenarios. 
 



<p>Example: If geopolitical events trigger rapid sanctions updates, a proactive bank runs immediate simulations to assess which customers or transactions are impacted, rather than waiting for a regulator to flag them.</p>



 



<p>Building a Culture of Vigilance</p>



<p>Culture is the connective tissue between strategy and execution. In a proactive AML environment:</p>



 
 Compliance is a shared responsibility – Developers build with AML in mind; marketing understands how campaigns can affect customer risk profiles. 



 Training is continuous – Not a one-off onboarding module, but regular updates tied to real-world incidents. 



 Leaders set the tone – Executives talk about compliance in terms of customer trust and brand equity, not just regulation. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: Culture change happens when compliance is framed as protecting customers, not policing them.</p>



 



<p>Regulator Engagement as Partnership</p>



<p>Proactive AML leaders view regulators as partners in stability, not adversaries to be appeased:</p>



 
 Share roadmap updates for new products and features. 



 Seek input on control frameworks before launch. 



 Demonstrate transparency in audits, showing not only what works, but what’s being improved. 
 



<p>This approach builds credibility and can influence how regulators interpret and apply requirements.</p>



 



<p>Leveraging Proactive Technology</p>



<p>The same technology that powers detection can also power prevention:</p>



 
 Predictive analytics to flag accounts trending toward high-risk behavior. 



 Scenario modeling to test how control changes would affect detection rates. 



 Automated risk scoring that adjusts onboarding requirements dynamically based on emerging threats. 
 



<p>These tools shift the timeline from post-event investigation to pre-event intervention.</p>



 



<p>Measuring Proactivity</p>



<p>You can’t manage what you can’t measure. Metrics for a proactive AML mindset include:</p>



 
 Time from emerging risk identification to control implementation. 



 Percentage of high-risk accounts flagged before first suspicious transaction. 



 Frequency of voluntary disclosures to regulators. 



 Staff participation in AML improvement initiatives. 
 



 



<p>The Business Case for Proactivity</p>



<p>Proactive AML isn’t just risk mitigation—it’s a growth strategy:</p>



 
 Faster licensing approvals – Regulators trust banks that demonstrate forward-looking controls. 



 Stronger partnerships – Payment networks, correspondent banks, and fintech collaborators prefer low-risk partners. 



 Customer loyalty – Trust is a key driver for retention, especially when switching is frictionless. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: In digital banking, your AML reputation travels as fast as your onboarding process. Proactivity shapes that reputation.</p>



 



<p>Sustaining the Mindset</p>



<p>Proactivity is not a one-time project; it’s an ongoing discipline. It requires:</p>



 
 Governance structures that keep compliance visible at the board level. 



 Budget commitment for continuous tech upgrades and training. 



 Regular external reviews to challenge internal assumptions and uncover blind spots. 
 



 



<p>Compliance as a Competitive Advantage</p>



<p>In the public imagination, compliance has long been the department of “no”—the place where innovation slows and bureaucracy reigns. But for forward-thinking neobanks, compliance is evolving into something very different: a core business capability that accelerates growth, attracts investment, and builds lasting customer trust.</p>



 



<p>Redefining the Role of Compliance</p>



<p>To position compliance as a differentiator, leadership must reshape its internal and external perception:</p>



 
 From cost center to value creator – Demonstrating that effective compliance unlocks partnerships, licensing, and market access. 



 From gatekeeper to enabler – Embedding compliance expertise in product teams so that controls are built in, not bolted on. 



 From reactive to proactive – Moving from fixing issues to anticipating and preventing them. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: The compliance function’s strategic value lies in reducing friction for the business while enhancing risk resilience.</p>



 



<p>Building Trust as a Brand Asset</p>



<p>In an industry where customer trust can be won or lost in a single news cycle, a strong compliance record becomes part of your brand promise.</p>



<p>How trust translates to advantage:</p>



 
 Customer acquisition – Consumers increasingly choose financial providers based on safety and reputation. 



 Retention – Trust reduces churn, especially in competitive markets where switching is easy. 



 Referrals – Satisfied customers amplify your message, and trust is a powerful referral driver. 
 



<p>Case point: Neobanks that proactively communicate their security and compliance posture often outperform peers in customer satisfaction surveys.</p>



 



<p>Gaining the Edge with Regulators and Partners</p>



<p>Regulators favor institutions that make their job easier. Transparent, well-documented compliance processes:</p>



 
 Streamline licensing in new jurisdictions. 



 Enable quicker approval for new products. 



 Reduce the intensity of ongoing supervisory engagement. 
 



<p>Similarly, correspondent banks, payment processors, and card networks prefer partners who won’t bring reputational or regulatory risk.</p>



<p>Leadership insight: Strong compliance can shorten the path to market for strategic initiatives.</p>



 



<p>Operational Efficiency Through Compliance Excellence</p>



<p>A mature compliance program doesn’t just detect risk—it optimizes resources:</p>



 
 Automated processes reduce manual reviews. 



 Integrated systems eliminate duplication of effort. 



 Data-driven decisions improve allocation of investigative resources. 
 



<p>Result: Compliance becomes a contributor to operational efficiency, not a drag on productivity.</p>



 



<p>Differentiating in Crowded Markets</p>



<p>In markets saturated with digital-first banks, product features alone rarely sustain differentiation. Compliance excellence is harder to copy.</p>



<p>Differentiation levers:</p>



 
 Speed with safety – Rapid onboarding without compromising due diligence. 



 Transparent policies – Clear communication about security and compliance measures. 



 Customer empowerment – Giving users visibility into their own security status and account protections. 
 



 



<p>Leveraging Technology for Competitive Positioning</p>



<p>Regtech investments aren’t just for risk management—they can be positioned as customer value propositions:</p>



 
 Real-time alerts for unusual activity. 



 Seamless biometric re-authentication. 



 Instant sanctions or fraud checks for new payees. 
 



<p>These features not only enhance safety but also reinforce the brand’s innovation credentials.</p>



 



<p>Storytelling the Compliance Journey</p>



<p>The way you communicate your compliance story matters:</p>



 
 Publish transparency reports with statistics on monitoring, SARs filed, and fraud prevented. 



 Share case studies of how controls prevented customer harm. 



 Highlight compliance certifications and third-party audits. 
 



<p>This builds confidence among customers, partners, and regulators alike.</p>



 



<p>The Competitive Risks of Weak Compliance</p>



<p>Conversely, the absence of strong compliance can destroy competitive advantage:</p>



 
 Fines and penalties signal operational weakness. 



 Reputational damage drives customer flight. 



 Increased scrutiny slows product launches and market expansion. 
 



<p>In competitive markets, even one major compliance failure can set back growth plans by years.</p>



 



<p>Embedding Compliance into Corporate Strategy</p>



<p>To truly make compliance a competitive advantage:</p>



 
 Include compliance leaders in strategic planning discussions. 



 Align compliance KPIs with corporate growth objectives. 



 Ensure budget and resources match the scale of compliance ambitions. 
 



<p>Leadership insight: If compliance is absent from the boardroom, it will always be an afterthought.</p>



 



<p>Final Thoughts: From Obligation to Opportunity</p>



<p>The neobanking sector was born from disruption. But in financial services, the most enduring disruptors are those who can pair innovation with resilience. Compliance—especially AML and sanctions compliance—is not just a hurdle to clear. It’s a foundation to build upon.</p>



<p>A neobank that can innovate quickly and demonstrate to regulators, partners, and customers that it operates with integrity has a strategic edge. It wins licenses faster, launches products with fewer delays, attracts more favorable partnerships, and builds brand loyalty that can weather market turbulence.</p>



<p>The mindset shift is clear:</p>



 
 Compliance is not just about avoiding fines—it’s about earning trust. 



 It’s not a drag on innovation—it’s the enabler that makes innovation sustainable. 



 It’s not a defensive posture—it’s a forward-leaning, competitive strategy. 
 



<p>For neobank leaders, the question is no longer “How much will compliance cost us?” but “How much more valuable will our business be when compliance is our strength?”</p>



<p>Those who answer that question with conviction—and back it with action—will define the next generation of digital banking success.</p>

 Everything You Need to Know About Facial Recognition Search in 2025 
<p>Facial recognition search has quickly shifted from science fiction to everyday reality. Whether it’s tracking down an online impostor, securing access to a building, or reconnecting with an old classmate, the technology is becoming a go-to tool for both professionals and curious individuals. The magic lies in matching a human face to an image in a database or on the internet. The process is fast, accurate, and surprisingly accessible to anyone who knows where to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Facial Recognition Search and Its Process 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">Facial recognition search</a> works by analyzing a photo or video to find and match an individual’s face in a database or on the internet. Unlike traditional image search, which focuses on colors, shapes, or objects, this method analyzes unique facial features. Think of it as the digital equivalent of recognizing a friend in a crowd only faster, and without the need to squint.</p>
<p>The process involves three main steps:</p>
 
 Detection – AI locates a human face in an image or video frame. 
 Mapping – The software pinpoints facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and jawline. 
 Matching – These mapped points are then compared with saved facial data to identify a possible match.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Facial recognition online services often combine large-scale public image databases with advanced AI. Tools like a facial recognition finder make it possible to track down a person from a single uploaded photo. Below is a simplified workflow example:</p>

Technology Used


1

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Technologies Behind Facial Recognition Search 
<p>The engine that drives facial recognition search is built from a combination of AI, deep learning, and specialized software. At the core, a face recognition SDK allows developers to integrate recognition capabilities into apps or websites.</p>
<p>But accuracy alone isn’t enough. To ensure the search result is from a real, live person and not a printed photo or screen replay, security layers like a face liveness detection SDK or liveness detection SDK are used. These tools can detect blinking, slight movements, and even texture differences in skin to confirm authenticity.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick comparison between traditional image search and facial recognition search:</p>

 Popular Uses of Facial Recognition Search 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Security and Law Enforcement 
<p>Security agencies use internet facial recognition search tools to identify suspects, missing persons, or unauthorized access attempts. A facial recognition lookup can pull records from vast criminal and public databases within seconds.</p>
 2. Social Media and Online Networking 
<p>Ever spotted someone in a photo but couldn’t recall their name? Facial recognition online services help identify people from public social media images. A good facial recognition finder can track old friends or even verify profiles.</p>
 3. Business Applications 
<p>Banks and e-commerce platforms now use a face <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">liveness detection SDK</a> to confirm the identity of customers during transactions. This prevents fraud and speeds up onboarding for new accounts.</p>
<p></p>
 Free and Paid Facial Recognition Search Options 
<p>Many are tempted to try a free facial recognition search for quick results. While free tools can be useful for casual searches, they often come with limited accuracy and smaller databases. Paid services usually provide:</p>
 
 Larger and more up-to-date databases 
 Stronger privacy protections 
 Faster search times

<p>Artificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed, and biometric authentication with liveness detection—once considered the gold standard in digital identity verification—is now under siege. Deepfakes, synthetic media, and AI-generated spoofing tools are more accessible and convincing than ever. Traditional systems relying on cloud-based analysis or static liveness checks are dangerously outdated.</p>
<p>Deepfakes, synthetic media, and AI-generated spoofing tools are more accessible and convincing than ever. Traditional facial recognition systems, especially those relying solely on cloud-based analysis or passive liveness checks, are completely obsolete, despite their prevalence in fintech, DeFi, and digital banking worldwide. At the same time, threat actors no longer need sophisticated tools to bypass standard facial recognition systems. A free, anonymous email account, some AI video gen software off the internet, and a still image or two from any social media account are now enough to fool most identity verification platforms – this is because they do not process the data locally.</p>
<p>The Threat</p>
 
 
<p>AI-powered fraud now makes it possible to bypass many KYC onboarding processes with nothing more than a still image, a free email account, and widely available deepfake software.</p>
 
 
<p>Cloud-based verification platforms introduce additional risk—sending sensitive biometric data offshore, often to vendors with questionable ownership, opaque data handling, or ties to jurisdictions that undermine privacy and sovereignty.</p>
 
 
<p>Fintechs and DeFi companies face heightened exposure, especially when relying on providers in the UK, US, Canada, and EU that use offshore subprocessors or outdated verification models.</p>
 
 
<p>Most systems labeled as “liveness detection” perform only surface-level checks before sending the image to the cloud for advanced processing. This forces them to rely on outdated 2D image processing often provided by questionable offshore data processors, making them easy targets for presentation attacks using photos, deepfake videos, or even AI-generated avatars. Biometric systems that were once built to stop fraud are now frequently bypassed by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“AI-driven fraud is exploding across legal, real estate, and financial services. This is a technology arms race. The only way to win is to meet AI with better AI, backed by privacy-first architecture. With our edge-computing biometrics, your users’ most sensitive data never leaves their device, and fraud attempts never reach your systems.” said Matthew Unger, CEO at iComply</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iComply Platform: Built for the Next Era of Threats</p>
<p>We’ve spent the last five years engineering and refining a better Live Face Match biometric authentication system that can perform any type of check directly on the user’s device. This not only addresses these modern threats, it is a game changer for personal data privacy and national data sovereignty.&nbsp;Our latest release of the iComply platform delivers randomized, concurrent liveness and biometric testing. Performed entirely on-device via our proprietary edge computing architecture to detect and neutralize generative AI spoofing before it can infiltrate your onboarding process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Fall 2025 Release Highlights 
<p>1. Advanced Multi-Expression Live Face Match Testing: Enhancements to performance and concurrent processing of both biometric face matches and liveness detection algorithms. Our platform doesn’t just check for motion and a face match; it challenges users to perform randomized facial expressions and micro-movements in 3D, making it nearly impossible for pre-recorded or deepfaked media to replicate. Each expression is evaluated independently alongside biometric confidence scores and device metadata to create your confidence threshold, which can be customized based on your risk tolerance.</p>
 
 
<p>Real-time 3D facial recognition combined with randomized micro-expression prompts.</p>
 
 
<p>Concurrent biometric and liveness analysis makes pre-recorded or AI-generated forgeries virtually impossible to pass.</p>
 
 
<p>Independent scoring for each challenge, combined with device metadata, allows for fully configurable pass/fail thresholds.</p>
 
 
<p>2. Edge Computing for Real-Time AI Fraud Detection: Unlike API driven KYC or identity verification systems, our identity and biometric checks are performed directly on the user’s device through edge computing. Edge-computing ensures your customer data is always processed locally, in the country where they are at that moment, and validated before you touch it. This reduces exposure, accelerates processing time, and ensures biometric data never leaves the device, drastically improving both privacy and security. With this release, Pro and Enterprise accounts can now leverage enhanced configurability and data localization control for emerging regulations covering data privacy, security, and sovereignty.</p>
 
 
<p>All biometric processing happens locally, on the user’s device. This ensures that data never leaves the country of origin. Zero data leakage. Zero third-party processing.</p>
 
 
<p>No reliance on offshore cloud processors means significantly reduced attack surface, zero transmission risk, and compliance with emerging data sovereignty laws.</p>
 
 
<p>Enhanced configurability for Pro and Enterprise clients to meet national and sector-specific privacy mandates.</p>
 
 
<p>3. Enhanced Threshold Controls for Precision Matching: Manage thresholds for biometric confidence score, adjust pass criteria, and the number of facial expressions required to be completed successfully.</p>
 
 
<p>Dynamically set biometric confidence thresholds (e.g., 70%, 85%, 95%) based on your risk profile.</p>
 
 
<p>Adjust requirements based on the risk and use case of the biometric verification event.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI Isn’t Going Away, But Neither Are We<br>
Organizations can no longer rely on “good enough” systems from five years ago to stop the threats of today. AI-generated fraud is evolving faster than most compliance teams can adapt.

<p>The rise of AI agents is one of the most significant shifts unfolding across the internet today. From booking travel to managing work tasks, agents are quickly becoming powerful tools that act on behalf of users. In fact, by next year, there may be more non-human agents online than human users. The promise is clear: automate the drudge work and reclaim your time.</p><p>But as the excitement grows, a critical piece of the conversation is being overlooked—identity. How do we know which agent is acting? Who authorized it? What is it allowed to do? And how do we prevent misuse when these agents gain access to sensitive systems or personal data?</p><p>In our latest live session,&nbsp;<a href="https://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Labs</a>&nbsp;CEO Nick Lambert sat down with Peter Horadan, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vouched.id/?ref=blog.dock.io">Vouched</a>, to explore these questions in depth.

<p>Scams have been accelerating rapidly. The Global Anti Scam Alliance (GASA) <a href="https://www.gasa.org/post/global-state-of-scams-report-2024-1-trillion-stolen-in-12-months-gasa-feedzai">estimates</a> that scammers stole $1 trillion from victims in 2024, and crypto is no stranger to this worrying trend. In the United States, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf">$9.3 billion</a> (56%) of all scam losses recorded in 2024 were in crypto. These trends are becoming more noticeable across an increasing number of jurisdictions, as shown below:</p>

  UAE regulators are intensifying AML enforcement across licensed firms. This article explains how to implement privacy-first KYC, UBO checks, and audit-ready workflows using iComply.

<p>With the UAE’s Executive Office for AML/CFT ramping up inspections in 2025, licensed entities must demonstrate stronger KYC and AML controls. This article explores how regulated firms can implement privacy-first onboarding, continuous screening, and full audit-ability using iComply.</p>
 
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made major strides in aligning with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) frameworks. Since being grey-listed by the FATF in 2022 and then removed in 2024, the UAE has doubled down on enforcement – particularly through the Executive Office for AML/CTF (EMLO). 
<p>In 2025, firms regulated by the UAE Central Bank, Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) should expect heightened inspections and cross-agency coordination.</p>
 Who This Applies To 
<p>The UAE’s AML/CFT regime applies to a wide range of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), including:</p>
 
 Real estate brokers 
 Auditors and accountants 
 Law firms 
 Dealers in precious metals/stones 
 Trust and company service providers (TCSPs) 
 Crypto and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) 
 
<p>Licensed financial institutions – including payment firms, forex dealers, investment managers, and private banks – are also under close watch.</p>
 What Regulators Expect in 2025 
<p>Under the updated AML/CFT laws and EMLO directives, licensed firms are expected to:</p>
 
 Perform customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due diligence (EDD) 
 Identify and verify beneficial ownership (UBO) 
 Monitor for suspicious transactions and PEPs 
 Conduct sanctions screening aligned with the UAE National Sanctions List 
 Maintain audit-ready compliance records and risk assessments 
 
 Challenges Facing UAE Firms 
<p>1. Fragmented AML Systems<br>
Many firms rely on disconnected tools that lack unified case management, increasing audit risk.</p>
<p>2. Manual and Offshore Data Processing<br>
Non-local cloud providers may expose firms to data residency violations or delays in response time.</p>
<p>3. Regulatory Complexity<br>
Multiple regulators with overlapping mandates mean firms must build systems that satisfy a range of agency expectations.</p>
 How iComply Supports UAE AML Compliance 
<p>iComply offers a unified KYC and AML platform built for global and local compliance—including full support for UAE-specific requirements.</p>
 1. Real-Time Identity and Entity Verification 
 
 Edge-based KYC verifies natural persons and legal entities locally on the device 
 No raw PII is transmitted unencrypted or stored offshore 
 Supports Arabic documents and character sets 
 
 2. Continuous AML Screening and PEP Monitoring 
 
 Screen clients and transactions against UAE and global sanctions lists 
 Detect politically exposed persons and adverse media in real time 
 Configure frequency and thresholds by client type and jurisdiction 
 
 3. UBO Discovery and Documentation 
 
 Map complex corporate structures and nominee owners 
 Collect and validate supporting documents with automated triggers 
 Maintain evidence of CDD and EDD per risk category 
 
 4. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Document onboarding, screening, investigations, and decisions in one secure portal 
 Export audit logs for inspections by EMLO, SCA, DFSA, or ADGM 
 
 5. UAE-Compliant Deployment Options 
 
 Host data within the UAE to meet local data sovereignty laws 
 Full multilingual support, including Arabic 
 Consent management and document retention controls included 
 
 Case Insight: Payment Processor in Dubai 
<p>A DIFC-licensed payments firm adopted iComply for KYC and AML compliance. Results in 90 days:</p>
 
 Automated verification for 100% of onboarding cases 
 Reduced average review time from 2 days to under 30 minutes 
 Received positive feedback during DFSA audit with no findings 
 
 2025 Regulatory Outlook 
 
 EMLO Inspections: Random and risk-based audits will intensify across sectors 
 UAE Sanctions Enforcement: New alignment with international partners will expand list coverage 
 Risk-Based Program Mandates: Regulators will expect documented risk assessments and justifications for CDD scope 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Whether you’re a VASP, DNFBP, or financial institution, the bar for AML compliance in the UAE has never been higher. Leading firms are already investing in scalable, privacy-first solutions.</p>
<p>Contact iComply to learn how our platform helps UAE-regulated entities stay compliant, secure, and audit-ready in 2025 and beyond.</p>

 Q1: What is&nbsp;DeFAI?   A term describing projects that merge Decentralized Finance (DeFi) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently used to label this emerging segment in Web3. Similar to “DeSci” (Decentralized Science).  Naming: Similar to “DeSci” (Decentralized Science).   Q2: When will the HPP website and mainnet go&nbsp;live?   Mainnet Launch: Originally planned for Q4, now targeted for Q3 2025 (ahead of schedule). Progress is on track; nearing the end of the planned&nbsp;window.  Website Launch: Advanced stage — wireframes complete, style guide implemented, interactive elements reviewed. Branding draws from CRT distortion and terminal-style visuals, reflecting the “early era” feel of AI. Likely to launch before the&nbsp;mainnet.  <p>Note: The <a href="https://www.hpp.io/">hpp.io</a> site is already live with content for testnets and the private&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Q3: When will AIP-21 rewards be distributed?   Airdrop Start: After mainnet&nbsp;launch.  Vesting: Rewards have a long vesting&nbsp;period.  Expected Timing: Likely this quarter, soon after mainnet goes&nbsp;live.   Q4: Are the AIP-21 swap ratios still accurate?   Yes. Ratios were set at the time of the AIP-21 vote based on agreed project valuations. These remain locked and will not&nbsp;change.   Q5: Do holders need to take action for the&nbsp;swap?   If on Exchanges: Swaps may be automatic if the exchange supports&nbsp;it.  If Off-Exchange: May require using a bridge or manual&nbsp;process.  <p>General Guidance: Follow official channels for detailed instructions.</p>  Expect a generous grace period for swapping.  Token migrations are becoming more common — always track official updates for your holdings.   Q6: How is HPP an upgrade to the existing Layer&nbsp;1?   AI Integration: Aergo L1 (current mainnet) will gain the AI technologies being developed for HPP (e.g., off-chain computation, verifiable AI interaction).  Enterprise Use: Aergo remains the enterprise/private chain option, with forks for specific deployments (e.g., public&nbsp;sector).  Dual-Layer Advantage: HPP Mainnet enables easier integration with exchanges, AI-native dApps, and multiple blockchains without L1 modifications.   Q7: Community concern about low trading volume and price movement only on&nbsp;news   Price changes are not always tied to news; many announcements have no lasting effect, and derivatives can even push prices&nbsp;down.  Volume is important as a sign of utility, but isolated charts can mislead; always compare them with broader market&nbsp;trends.   Q7: Will HPP mainnet launch in late Q3 or early&nbsp;Q4?   Confirmed: Target remains end of Q3&nbsp;2025.  Airdrop: Will start after mainnet launch, following the vesting schedule.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-20-recap-defai-airdrop-and-more-660999a40fa2">Aergo Talks #20 Recap: DeFAI, airdrop, and more</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Choosing the right identity verification (IDV) partner is one of the most critical security decisions you'll make. As organizations fortify their defenses, it’s clear that verifying the identity of your workforce requires a fundamentally different approach than verifying customers.  The stakes are simply higher. For customer verification, the primary goal is often a smooth, low-friction

<p>Choosing the right identity verification (IDV) partner is one of the most critical security decisions you'll make. As organizations fortify their defenses, it’s clear that verifying the identity of your workforce requires a fundamentally different approach than verifying customers.<br><br>The stakes are simply higher. For customer verification, the primary goal is often a smooth, low-friction sign-up process. For your workforce, the goal is ironclad security to prevent a breach. The reality is that many IDV solutions on the market are repurposed customer onboarding tools, not purpose-built platforms designed to stop a skilled attacker from impersonating an employee.<br><br>This guide is designed to help you look beyond the surface-level features and assess whether a vendor can truly meet the security demands of a modern enterprise. Use these questions to find a genuine partner and a solution that is truly workforce-grade.</p> 
 Core Capabilities and Security  
<p>The foundation of any IDV solution is its ability to accurately verify an identity while defending against advanced, modern attacks.</p> 
 1. How do you protect against deepfakes and other advanced impersonation attacks?  
<p>To protect against modern threats, your first question should focus on a vendor's strategy for tackling sophisticated fraud. Threat actors now use AI to create deepfakes for both presentation attacks (showing a fake image to a camera) and injection attacks (bypassing the camera to feed a fake video stream directly into the system).</p> 
<p>A workforce-grade solution should deliver:</p> 
  
  Advanced Liveness Detection: The best solutions employ sophisticated liveness checks to distinguish between a live person and a spoof like a mask or recording.&nbsp;  
  Injection Attack Prevention: A vendor should offer technology that prevents attackers from bypassing on-device cameras, making it nearly impossible to inject a deepfake into the verification stream.  
  
 2. What verification methods do you offer beyond a simple document check?  
<p>While document verification is essential, a resilient IDV platform must offer a wide array of options to create a multi-layered defense and ensure all employees can be verified successfully.</p> 
<p>A top-tier vendor should provide a flexible framework that includes:</p> 
  
  Geolocation and IP Intelligence: A modern IDV solution should analyze passive risk signals like the user's IP address and device location.  
  Biometric Matching: Comparing a user's live selfie to the portrait on their government ID is a necessary feature for modern verification.  
  Workforce-Specific Workflows: The most innovative solutions provide methods uniquely suited for an enterprise environment. One such powerful, context-aware method is manager attestation, where a supervisor can digitally vouch for an employee's identity through secure chat or video call.  
  
 Deployment and Integration  
<p>A solution's value is directly tied to how well it integrates with your existing technology stack without causing major disruptions.</p> 
 3. How does your solution integrate with our key workforce workflows and technology stack?  
<p>To avoid creating information silos and clunky workarounds, an IDV solution's value multiplies when it is deeply embedded into the systems where identity is most critical. For maximum efficiency and security, a vendor should offer:</p> 
  
  IAM and IdP Integration: Out-of-the-box connectors for major Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Identity Provider (IdP) platforms like Okta, Microsoft Azure AD, and Ping are crucial for managing employee access and credential resets.  
  Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): To combat candidate fraud early in the hiring process, integrations with ATS platforms to verify an applicant's identity, ensuring the person you interview is the person you hire are important.  
  Help Desk and Ticketing Systems: The ability to integrate into your existing help desk or ticketing platform is essential for securely handling high-risk workflows like password and MFA resets.  
  SIEM Integration: A vendor should be able to seamlessly integrate with your SIEM systems. This allows your security team to feed identity event logs into a centralized platform for auditing, threat analysis, and compliance monitoring.  
  Standards-Based Integration: Look for solutions built on open standards like OIDC and SAML, as this ensures broad compatibility and future-proofs your investment.&nbsp;  
  
 4. What is the deployment process like, and what resources are required from my team?  
<p>The deployment model should align with your organization's infrastructure and technical capabilities. A cloud-native platform offers superior scalability and easier integration. For organizations looking to address urgent threats, it's best to prioritize vendors that offer ready-to-use solutions rather than a lengthy, resource-intensive implementation project.</p> 
 The User Experience  
<p>Security measures should empower productivity, not hinder it. The employee experience is paramount for adoption and success.</p> 
 5. What is the end-user journey like for initial verification and future re-verifications?  
<p>The process should be fast, intuitive, and require minimal effort from the employee. The best user experience is achieved through:</p> 
  
  App-less Workflows: Forcing users to download a separate application creates unnecessary friction. A vendor should offer app-less web experiences that allow users to complete verification on any device with a browser.  
  Seamless Re-verification: It is critical that a solution is designed to handle re-verification and the re-binding of an identity to a new device. Products that treat every verification as a one-time event are poorly suited for managing the employee lifecycle, where device changes are common.  
  
 6. Do you support flexible workflows for different risk levels and use cases, like help desk support?  
<p>A one-size-fits-all approach to identity verification is inefficient. A modern IDV platform must allow for fully customizable and configurable workflows that can be tailored to specific use cases and risk levels. For example, a vendor should be able to integrate with your call center operations. This allows help desk agents to securely trigger a verification flow before performing high-risk actions like a password reset, which is a common vector for attack.</p> 
 Security, Compliance, and Data Privacy  
<p>Handling sensitive employee data requires the highest, non-negotiable standards of security and certified compliance.</p> 
 7. What are your security certifications and how do you ensure compliance with data privacy regulations?  
<p>A reputable vendor must demonstrate its commitment to security through widely recognized, independent certifications. You should require proof of:</p> 
  
  Security and Trust Certifications: SOC 2, ISO, and FIDO2 certifications are essential benchmarks.  
  Regulatory Compliance: The solution must support compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, as well as regulations like HIPAA.  
  Identity Standards Adherence: The platform should be compliant with identity standards from NIST, ideally up to Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3) for the highest-risk environments.  
  
 8. How do you store and protect our employees' personally identifiable information (PII)?  
<p>A vendor's data handling policies are a direct reflection of its security posture. The ideal approach is one that minimizes your organization's data exposure. You should look for a vendor that:</p> 
  
  Employs Strong Encryption: All data, both at-rest and in-transit, must be encrypted using strong standards like AES-256.  
  Minimizes Data Retention: The best practice is to hold Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for the shortest time necessary. An attestation-only model, where the raw data is destroyed after a short period, significantly reduces your risk and is superior to models that store PII indefinitely.  
  
 Finding Your Workforce Identity Verification Partner  
<p>Choosing an IDV vendor is about more than buying a tool; it's about establishing a partnership to navigate evolving threats. By asking these questions, you can identify a provider who understands the unique challenges of workforce security and is committed to your long-term success.</p> 
<p>At HYPR, we built our HYPR Affirm solution on these foundational principles. We believe that true workforce security demands purpose-built technology that is both highly secure and easy to use.

<p>In the booming Web3 ecosystem, the allure of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is undeniable. While many perceive NFTs as expensive digital assets, there are actually numerous legitimate and exciting ways to acquire them without spending a dime. This guide will uncover the best ways to earn free NFT in 2025, from participating in community airdrops and play-to-earn games to exploring free minting opportunities.</p>



 What Are NFTs and Why Earn Them for Free? 



 What Are NFTs? 



<p><a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-an-nft">NFTs are unique digital assets</a> recorded on blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Unlike regular cryptocurrencies, each <a href="https://blog.herond.org/the-complete-guide-to-nft-marketplace/">NFT is one-of-a-kind</a> and cannot be replicated, representing verifiable ownership of digital items such as art, music, or in-game assets.</p>









 Why Own Free NFT? 



<p>NFTs offer more than just collecting. They hold potential for value appreciation, can grant access to exclusive communities, and provide utility in gaming or DeFi applications. Owning an NFT means you’re part of a unique digital space with real benefits.</p>



 Why Is Free NFT Great for Beginners? 



<p>Free NFTs are perfect for newcomers because they offer a low-risk entry point into the Web3 world. You can acquire digital assets without any financial investment, reducing the barrier to entry and giving you a chance to explore the ecosystem with high reward potential if the <a href="https://opensea.io/">NFT’s value</a> grows.</p>



 Why Use Herond Browser for Web3?

Browse confidently, knowing your digital assets and personal data are better protected against common Web3 threats.</p>

<p>Navigating the world of cryptocurrency can feel overwhelming, especially for newcomers looking to dive into exciting new projects. If you’ve heard the buzz around Chill Guy Coin and are wondering how to add this unique digital asset to your portfolio, you’ve come to the right place. This guide is specifically designed for new crypto enthusiasts, breaking down the process into simple, easy-to-follow steps. We’ll show you exactly how to buy Chill Guy Coin safely and efficiently, so you can join its growing community with confidence.</p>



 What is Chill Guy Coin (CHILLGUY)? 



<p>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/just-a-chill-guy/">Chill Guy Coin (CHILLGUY)</a> is emerging as a distinctive meme coin designed to foster a relaxed yet engaged community. Unlike many high-stress crypto projects, CHILLGUY aims to cultivate a laid-back atmosphere, focusing on community building and fun rather than aggressive speculation. Built on a decentralized blockchain, CHILLGUY offers a unique entry point for those looking to participate in the meme coin space with a focus on good vibes and organic growth.</p>









 Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Chill Guy Coin 



 Set Up a Solana Wallet 



 Download Phantom or Solflare; secure private keys: 



<p>Download <a href="https://phantom.com/">Phantom</a> or Solflare: To start your Solana journey, choose a popular and user-friendly wallet like Phantom or <a href="https://www.solflare.com/">Solflare</a>. These wallets let you manage your SOL tokens, NFTs, and interact with dApps seamlessly.</p>



<p>Secure Private Keys: The most crucial step is to securely back up your private keys or seed phrases. This unique sequence is the master key to your funds.</p>









<p>Offline Storage is Key: Losing this phrase means losing access to your assets forever. Always write it down physically and store it in a safe, offline location, away from any digital threats or prying eyes.</p>



 Use Herond Browser for safe wallet setup 



<p>Boost Security with Herond Browser: For enhanced safety during Solana wallet setup, opt for Herond Browser.</p>



<p>Built-in Protection: Herond’s core features include Herond Shield, which actively blocks intrusive ads and malicious trackers.</p>


 
 


<p>Prevent Phishing &amp; Malware: This robust protection creates a cleaner, safer environment for all your Web3 activities, crucial for sensitive tasks like wallet creation.</p>



<p>Safeguard Digital Assets: By choosing Herond, you’re actively protecting your digital assets right from the start of your crypto journey.</p>



 Fund Your Wallet 



 Buy SOL via Exchanges or Mobile Pay 



<p>Acquire SOL (Solana’s native cryptocurrency) from major centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken.</p>









<p>Alternatively, use mobile payment services such as Apple Pay or Google Pay for quick purchases where available.</p>



 Transfer SOL to Your Wallet 



<p>Initiate a withdrawal of SOL from the exchange or platform where you purchased it.</p>



<p>Carefully paste your unique Solana wallet address (from Phantom or Solflare) into the recipient field.</p>



<p>Always double-check the address before confirming the transaction to prevent loss of funds.</p>



<p>Once transferred, your SOL will appear in your wallet, ready for use in the Solana ecosystem.</p>



 Choose a Trusted Exchange or DEX 



 Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) for Easy Access 



<p>Platforms: Consider user-friendly options like Bitget, KuCoin, or Gate.io for purchasing Chill Guy Coin.</p>



<p>Trading Pair: You’ll typically find CHILLGUY traded against stablecoins like USDT (e.g., CHILLGUY/USDT pair).</p>



<p>Benefit: Offers a familiar, secure environment with simple interfaces and often supports various payment methods, making initial acquisition straightforward.</p>









 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) for True Web3 Spirit 



<p>Platform: Use a DEX like Raydium on the Solana network for direct wallet-to-wallet trading.</p>



<p>Official Contract Address: Always use the official CHILLGUY contract address to avoid scams: <code>Df6yfrKC8kZE3KNkrHERKzAetSxbrWeniQfyJY4Jpump</code>.</p>



<p>Benefit: Provides greater control and transparency, enhancing your Web3 experience by keeping you in full control of your assets, especially when paired with a secure browser like Herond.</p>



 Buy CHILLGUY 



 On a Centralized Exchange (CEX) 



<p>Register &amp; verify: Start by registering an account on your chosen CEX (e.g., Bitget, KuCoin) and complete the mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) verification.</p>



<p>Deposit Funds:Deposit funds into your CEX account using fiat currency (bank transfer, credit card) or by transferring existing cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Purchase CHILLGUY: Once funds are confirmed, navigate to the relevant trading pair (e.g., CHILLGUY/USDT) and execute your purchase to acquire the tokens.</p>



 On a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) 



<p>Connect Wallet:Connect your Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom or Solflare) directly to a DEX platform such as Raydium.</p>



<p>Swap Tokens: Select SOL as the currency you’re swapping from and CHILLGUY as the token you wish to receive.</p>



<p>Confirm Transaction: Confirm the transaction within your connected wallet. This method offers direct, peer-to-peer trading on blockchain, especially secure with a browser like Herond.</p>



 Store Securely 



<p>Once you’ve acquired your <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-create-a-meme-coin-with-no-coding-skills-needed/">Chill Guy Coin</a>, securing your investment is paramount. While centralized exchanges can be convenient for buying, it’s generally recommended to transfer your CHILLGUY to a self-custody wallet like Phantom. Phantom, being a popular and user-friendly Solana wallet, gives you direct control over your assets, reducing reliance on third-party platforms. For maximum security, especially for larger holdings, consider moving your CHILLGUY to a hardware wallet. Devices like Ledger or Trezor store your private keys offline, providing an impenetrable layer of protection against online threats. Always remember, “not your keys, not your crypto.”</p>



 Verify Purchase 



<p>After completing your purchase of Chill Guy Coin, it’s always a good practice to verify your transaction <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-mine-bitcoin-in-2025/">on the blockchain</a>. The easiest and most reliable way to do this is by using Solscan, the leading block explorer for the Solana network. Simply copy your wallet address or the transaction ID from your exchange or DEX and paste it into the search bar on Solscan. You’ll then be able to see the full details of your transaction, including its confirmation status and the amount of CHILLGUY successfully sent to your wallet. This step ensures peace of mind and confirms your new assets are safely in your control.</p>



 Tips for Maximizing Success 



 Engage in Solana Ecosystem for Potential Airdrops 



 
 Actively participate in the Solana network by trading, staking SOL, or holding NFTs. 



 This increases your on-chain activity, potentially qualifying you for future token or NFT airdrops from new projects. 



 Beyond rewards, it enriches your overall Web3 experience 
 



 Monitor @ChillGuyCoin on X and Telegram for Community Events 



 
 Stay connected with the Chill Guy Coin community by following their official channels on X (@ChillGuyCoin) and Telegram. 



 These platforms are the primary sources for announcements, community events, AMAs, contests, and exclusive opportunities. 



 Active participation can lead to special rewards and keep you informed. 
 









 Use Herond Browser to avoid phishing scams and trackers 



 
 Prioritize security when engaging with the crypto ecosystem by using Herond Browser. 



 Herond’s advanced features, including Herond Shield, actively block malicious sites, deceptive pop-ups, and intrusive trackers. 



 This ensures a safer browsing environment, protecting your wallet and personal information from threats during Web3 interactions. 
 



 Avoid new wallets or VPNs to meet eligibility criteria 



 
 Stick to your primary, consistently used wallet for genuine engagement to increase your chances of meeting criteria for valuable distributions. 
 



 
 To maintain eligibility for potential airdrops and community rewards, generally avoid creating new wallets or using VPNs solely for qualifying purposes. 
 



 
 Many projects use anti-bot measures that may flag such activities. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Buying Chill Guy Coin doesn’t have to be complicated, even for new crypto enthusiasts. By following these straightforward steps – from setting up your secure Solana wallet, funding it properly, and choosing a trusted exchange, to confirming your purchase and securing your assets – you’re well-equipped to join the CHILLGUY community. Remember, staying informed and prioritizing security are key. With Herond Browser, you gain an extra layer of protection, ensuring your Web3 journey is as smooth and safe as possible.

 Upgrading Legacy Blockchain Systems with AI-Native Infrastructure  Case Study: NHIS and Aergo. A Blueprint for Public Sector Blockchain Adoption  Background <p>The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea pioneered blockchain adoption in the public sector by launching a high-throughput Timestamping Authority (TSA) system built on the Aergo Enterprise platform. This system verifies and records the issuance of key documents, including insurance contracts, care applications, and official certifications, with over 400,000 transactions processed daily. The system is projected to handle over 1.8 million transactions per day once the upcoming services are fully deployed.</p> Key Features of the Aergo-Based TSA   Immutable Timestamping: Each document issuance is timestamped and anchored to the Aergo blockchain.  System Integration: Deployed with zero downtime, fully integrated into NHIS’s legacy&nbsp;systems.  Environmental Efficiency: Reduced reliance on paper documentation and physical verification processes.  Security &amp; Auditability: Enhanced traceability and document verification for public trust and regulatory compliance.  <p>This Aergo-powered system is widely recognized as one of the most successful enterprise blockchain deployments in the public&nbsp;sector.</p> How HPP Could Evolve the NHIS TSA: From Timestamping to Intelligence <p>Although HPP is not currently implemented by NHIS, future upgrades of similar public systems could benefit significantly from integration with HPP’s AI-native infrastructure. The House Party Protocol is designed to enhance legacy blockchain systems by combining verifiable AI execution, decentralized governance, and modular scalability.</p><p>Here’s how HPP could enhance a use case like NHIS’s TSA&nbsp;system:</p> 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection Using AI&nbsp;Agents <p>Current Limitation<br> Fraud detection in the current TSA is largely external or manual, relying on human audits or external tools to identify document forgery, duplicate claims, or anomalous patterns.</p><p>HPP Advantage<br> HPP integrates a Fraud Detection System (FDS) that uses intelligent agents to flag suspicious behaviors in real-time. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Detecting attempts to submit forged care applications or duplicate insurance claims.  Flagging statistically abnormal combinations (e.g., elderly care requests submitted by unusually young applicants).  <p>These agents run on ArenAI, HPP’s AI execution layer, and automatically initiate fraud reviews, reducing risk while accelerating operational trust.</p> 2. Document Intelligence Through Noösphere +&nbsp;SLM <p>Current Limitation<br> The Aergo TSA verifies the timestamp and issuance of documents, but not the content of documents. There’s no native understanding or validation of what is inside each&nbsp;form.</p><p>HPP Advantage<br> HPP’s Noösphere infrastructure powers off-chain SLM (Small Language Model) inference, enabling systems&nbsp;to:</p>  Analyze document contents for consistency (e.g., checking for contradicting information across multiple submissions).  Classify and tag public documents automatically.  Feed results into smart contracts that enforce policy (e.g., deny requests that don’t meet minimum medical criteria).  <p>This creates a hybrid system where off-chain AI logic is made on-chain verifiable through Proof-of-Inference, increasing transparency and auditability for automated decisions.</p> Final Thought <p>As public institutions pursue digital transformation, the NHIS case offers a proven foundation. However, the next generation of infrastructure will require more than just timestamping. HPP demonstrates how AI-native Layer 2 blockchain architecture can enhance public systems into intelligent, verifiable, and programmable digital services — transitioning beyond record-keeping to real-time decision-making and automation.</p><p>Note: The HPP enhancements described are exploratory and not affiliated with NHIS at the time of&nbsp;writing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/how-hpp-could-transform-public-blockchain-use-b0a4191db725">How HPP Could Transform Public Blockchain Use</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Helpdesks are critical support hubs, but their central role makes them prime targets for sophisticated social engineering attacks. These attacks exploit human psychology, tricking helpdesk personnel into divulging sensitive information or compromising security, often by targeting credential resets. When attackers convince an agent to reset a legitimate user's password, they bypass security, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. The devastating impact was demonstrated by the 2023 MGM attack, reportedly initiated via a helpdesk social engineering tactic, causing significant disruptions and financial losses. Understanding and preventing these threats is crucial for organizational strength.</p> 
 Defining Helpdesk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Helpdesk social engineering attacks are sophisticated tactics where cybercriminals manipulate helpdesk personnel through deception. The core objective is unauthorized access, often via credential resets. Attackers impersonate legitimate users, perhaps an executive needing urgent access, using publicly available information to sound convincing. This circumvents technical defenses, allowing free movement within networks for data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or further attacks. The 2023 MGM breach, costing over $100 million in reported damages, exemplifies the profound financial and reputational harm from such a successful helpdesk social engineering attack.</p> 
 How Common Social Engineering Attacks Are Performed on Helpdesks  
<p>A typical helpdesk social engineering attack is a carefully orchestrated sequence:</p> 
  
  Reconnaissance: Attackers gather employee details from public sources (social media, company websites, data breaches) to create a believable persona.  
  Impersonation: They contact the helpdesk, posing as a legitimate employee, often a high-authority figure or a distressed user, sometimes using caller ID spoofing or deepfake voice technology.  
  Exploiting Weak Verification: Attackers exploit flaws like knowledge-based authentication (KBA), finding answers through research or dark web data to bypass security questions.  
  Building Trust and Pressure: They use psychological tactics: 
    
    Urgency: Creating immediate crises to rush the agent.  
    Authority: Impersonating executives to imply repercussions for delays.  
    Insider Knowledge: Using researched details to sound credible.  
      
  Credential Reset/Modification: Trust established, they convince the agent to reset a password or enroll a new MFA device.  
  Exploitation: With new credentials, they gain unauthorized access for data exfiltration, malware installation, or fraud.  
  
<p>These attacks are prevalent; reports from 2023 indicated that a significant percentage of organizations experienced credential compromises linked to social engineering, with an increasing shift to voice and video-based tactics.</p> 
   
<p>Train your helpdesk staff to adopt a mindset of "verify, don't trust." This means questioning every request for credential changes or sensitive access, regardless of how urgent or authoritative the request seems. Always use established, out-of-band verification methods, such as calling the user back on a pre-registered, known phone number, rather than relying solely on information provided during the current interaction.</p> 
 The Weakest Link: Flaws in Traditional Identity Verification  
<p>Traditional helpdesk identity verification methods often present critical vulnerabilities:</p> 
  
  Reliance on Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA): Easily compromised as answers to security questions are often publicly available or found in data breaches.  
  Static Credentials (e.g., Passwords): Vulnerable to phishing and brute-force attacks; a compromised password grants persistent access.  
  Lack of Multi-Factor Verification Enforcement: Helpdesks may have weak processes allowing MFA bypass or re-enrollment without stringent identity proofing.  
  Human Error and Pressure: Agents, under pressure and manipulation (urgency, authority), may overlook red flags or deviate from protocols.  
  Inconsistent Procedures: Lack of standardized verification protocols allows attackers to "shop around" for a less vigilant agent.  
  
<p>The inherent limitations of static credentials, once compromised, give attackers sustained access, enabling extensive network exploration and damage before detection.&nbsp;</p> 
 Implementing Low-Friction Authentication<br>  
<p>Low-friction authentication is crucial to combating helpdesk social engineering by making authentication seamless without compromising security. Complex, slow processes can inadvertently lead staff to bypass protocols or fall prey to quick-fix social engineering.</p> 
<p>Passwordless authentication eliminates the primary target for phishing—passwords—and offers numerous benefits:<br></p> 
  
  Enhanced Security: FIDO-based solutions use phishing-resistant public-key cryptography, making compromise significantly harder.  
  Superior Usability: Eliminates password memory burdens, frequent resets, and lockouts, providing a faster, intuitive login for users and reducing password-related helpdesk calls.  
  Reduced Attack Surface: No passwords to steal, crack, or breach, drastically shrinking potential attack vectors.  
  Cost Savings: Directly reduces helpdesk call volumes related to password issues, translating into significant operational savings.<br>  
  
<p>Biometrics, for example, transforms login into a natural, quick action while providing a higher level of security assurance.</p> 
 The Role of Generative AI in Helpdesk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and deepfake technology, is rapidly enhancing the sophistication and scale of helpdesk social engineering attacks, making them harder to detect. For a deeper dive, read our blog on <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">preventing generative AI attacks</a>.&nbsp;<br></p> 
<p>AI's role includes:<br></p> 
  
  Advanced Pretexting: LLMs generate highly plausible, contextually aware scripts for calls, emails, or chats, mimicking corporate language and adapting tone for credibility.  
  Deepfake Voice Cloning: AI clones target voices from audio samples, enabling convincing "vishing" attacks where helpdesk agents believe they're speaking with the legitimate person. This was a key concern highlighted in HHS alerts.  
  Deepfake Video: While still evolving for real-time helpdesk use, deepfake video could enable visual impersonation during video calls, adding another layer of authenticity.  
  Automated and Scalable Attacks: AI automates reconnaissance, personalized message generation, and simultaneous social engineering attempts, allowing large-scale, targeted campaigns with less manual effort.  
  Adaptive Strategies: AI systems can learn and refine their deceptive approaches based on responses, increasing their agility and making them harder to defend against with static security measures.<br>  
  
   
<p>As generative AI makes impersonation easier, organizations must move beyond knowledge-based authentication. Implement identity verification methods that are inherently resistant to AI-generated fakes, such as live liveness detection for biometrics or multi-factor verification that relies on device-bound cryptographic keys rather than shared secrets.<br></p> 
 Real-World Examples of Helpdesk Social Engineering  
<p>The threat of helpdesk social engineering is not theoretical; it's a proven and ongoing attack vector. Here are some notable instances and warnings:</p> 
 HHS Sector Alert  
<p>Helpdesk social engineering is a persistent threat. The Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) within the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) has issued alerts detailing sophisticated tactics.</p> 
<p>HHS Sector Alert: HC3 highlighted threat actors (e.g., "Scattered Spider") using advanced social engineering. These attackers call helpdesks, impersonating employees (often in financial roles), using sensitive, likely breached, information (e.g., last four SSN digits) to pass initial verification. They then claim a broken phone, persuading helpdesk staff to enroll a new, attacker-controlled MFA device. This grants access to corporate resources, exploited for payment fraud or ransomware. HHS specifically noted the potential for AI voice impersonation, making remote identity verification increasingly challenging.<br></p> 
 How to Prevent the Helpdesk from Social Engineering  
<p>Preventing helpdesk social engineering requires a multi-faceted approach combining strong technology, comprehensive training, and robust policies.<br></p> 
 Using Deterministic Controls to Stop Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Stopping AI-fueled social engineering and deepfake attacks means adopting deterministic controls over probabilistic methods like passwords. Deterministic controls offer higher certainty about user identity, often involving multi-factor verification (MFV) that uses inherently secure and hard-to-spoof methods.<br></p> 
<p>Recommended steps to harden the credential reset process:<br></p> 
  
  Implement Phishing-Resistant MFA: Prioritize FIDO2-based authentication (e.g., hardware security keys, biometrics with device-bound keys) which uses public-key cryptography, making it resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be a baseline for sensitive access and helpdesk-initiated changes.  
  Introduce Dynamic Verification: 
    
    Identity Proofing: Require strong identity proofing for account creation and high-risk operations like resets. This includes live liveness detection during video calls or leveraging trusted third-party services.  
    Out-of-Band Verification: Always verify identity via a channel not controlled by the attacker, such as calling a pre-registered phone number or sending a code to a secure, verified email.  
      
  Limit Resets via Secure Channels &amp; Enforce Stringent Escalation: Define strict protocols for resets. Require multi-layer approvals for high-risk requests and implement "cooling-off" periods for new device enrollments from unusual locations. Exceptions should involve supervisory review and additional robust identity proofing.  
  Emphasize Automation and Self-Service: Empower users with secure self-service password reset and account recovery using strong, phishing-resistant MFA. This reduces helpdesk burden and minimizes the attack surface.<br>  
  
 Strengthening Workplace Security with Robust Identity Proofing  
<p>Effective identity proofing is paramount for preventing unauthorized access. While authentication confirms credential possession, identity proofing confirms the claimant's true identity, crucial against social engineering where attackers have valid information but aren't the legitimate user.</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Robust identity proofing practices are essential throughout the employee lifecycle:</p> 
  
  Onboarding: Ensures only legitimate employees gain initial access through verified IDs, background checks, and biometric enrollment.  
  High-Risk Transactions/Requests: For actions like helpdesk password resets or sensitive data access, identity proofing should be re-applied or elevated. This includes biometric verification with liveness detection, document verification, or live video verification with a trained agent.  
  Continuous Monitoring: Integrating identity proofing with continuous monitoring detects anomalous behavior, triggering strong proofing protocols if a user attempts unusual actions (e.g., new device enrollment from a foreign IP).  
  
<p>Strengthening identity proofing builds a more resilient defense against social engineering, significantly hindering impersonation attempts.</p>

<p>A second phone number is&nbsp;an additional phone number that you can use on your existing device, separate from your primary number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You use a second phone number to shield your personal phone number in situations where you don’t want to give out your private line.</p>



<p>Second phone numbers (or secondary phone numbers, as they’re sometimes called) can be either tied to a traditional SIM or operate on an internet connection (VoIP numbers). VoIP or “voice over IP” phone numbers are assigned to a user and not to a physical location. A VoIP second phone number is often called a virtual phone number.</p>



<p>Second phone numbers are usually kept permanently or long-term for things like separating work and personal life, signing up for services, travelling, shopping online, and interacting with people and organizations you don’t know or trust. They can help you organize your communications, manage and secure accounts and services, reduce the risk of scams to your private line, and protect against unwanted contact.</p>



<p>Considering a person’s personal phone number is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/shocking-privacy-facts-our-ceo-told-naomi-brockwell-about-cell-phones/">most valuable piece of data</a> to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">advertisers</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">criminals</a>, shielding it with a second phone number is a smart privacy move. But what can be even smarter is protecting your personal phone number with a bunch of secondary phone numbers and using them for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">different purposes in your work and personal life</a>.</p>



 MySudo offers 9 secondary phone numbers on one device 



<p>One of the most popular features of <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> all-in-one privacy app is that you can quickly commission 9 secondary phone numbers on one device—and do it <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-2-things-mysudo-does-differently-from-most-other-apps/">without giving away your personal information</a> (except for UK numbers which require identity verification).</p>



<p>Second phone numbers on MySudo are VoIP numbers, so they’re private virtual phone numbers.</p>



<p>But where MySudo differs from other services is that each of the 9 phone numbers sits within its own <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">digital identity or persona</a> called a Sudo, so you’re effectively running 9 separate identities or personas for any purpose you choose.</p>



<p>Even better, each Sudo also has a dedicated secure <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, optional <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual card</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>, and a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handle</a> for free end-to-end encrypted messaging and calling without a phone number at all.</p>



<p>Sudos are useful for opening accounts, booking flights and hotel rooms, paying for food delivery and ride share, online dating, volunteering, and selling secondhand—any activity where you’re asked for your personal information but don’t want to give it away.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the benefits of MySudo phone numbers? 



 
 MySudo numbers are real, unique, working phone numbers in area codes or geographies of your choice. Numbers are currently available in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Each phone number has customizable voicemail, ringtones, and contacts list.
 
 MySudo numbers are fully functional for messaging plus voice, video and group calling. Calls and messages with other MySudo users are end-to-end encrypted. Calls and messages out of network are standard. 



 MySudo phone numbers don’t expire. Your phone numbers will auto-renew so long as you maintain your <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">paid plan</a>. 
 
 



 You can use MySudo phone numbers for short-term or long-term activities. Follow the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">4 steps to setting up MySudo to meet your real life privacy needs</a>. 



 You can mute the notifications of, or delete, a number you no longer want.* 



 MySudo numbers are VoIP numbers, which means they work over the internet instead of traditional phone lines or cellular networks. VoIP numbers can’t become a unique identifier to all your other personal information like a personal cell number can and can’t be tracked like a cell number that’s connected to cell towers through its SIM card.&nbsp; 



 MySudo numbers give you a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">second chance at digital privacy</a>.&nbsp;

 FAQs 



 What’s the difference between a second phone number and a temporary phone number? 



<p>A second phone number is an additional number you keep long-term or permanently for a particular purpose alongside your main phone number. You use it to shield your personal phone number for privacy and security reasons. A temporary phone number is similar but is typically created for short-term or one-off use and may expire automatically or be intentionally discarded after a single use or short time. Another name for temporary phone numbers is disposable phone numbers.</p>



 Are second phone numbers safe? 



<p>Second numbers are safe when you use a reputable service like <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>.</p>

             What if machines could think fast - but humans still made the call? 
<p>Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) is transforming the tempo and effectiveness of military operations. As AI and autonomous systems proliferate, HMT provides a pathway to harness these technologies while preserving human judgement, accountability, and ethical oversight. This article explores the components, challenges and strategic implications of HMT - and why it matters now more than ever.</p>
 Why HMT is a Defence Imperative 
<p>As warfare becomes more data-rich and multi-domain, decision-making must keep pace. AI and autonomy offer an edge - faster analysis, predictive insights, and operational agility - but only if integrated in a way that upholds trust, legality, and clarity over decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human-Machine Teaming blends human intuition with machine efficiency. In doing so, it enables better decisions under pressure, enhances resilience across domains, and aligns with the UK's strategic defence objectives.</p>
 What Human-Machine Teaming Really Means 
<p>HMT is not about replacing people. It’s about integrating AI into workflows in a way that enhances, rather than overrides, human oversight. Depending on the operational scenario, different interaction models apply:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Humans retain full control, using AI for suggestions or data processing.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL): AI executes tasks with human supervision and veto rights.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Human-out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL): AI operates autonomously in pre-defined, bounded scenarios.</p>
<p>Designing the right level of autonomy for each mission type is key. Trust and transparency are not optional - they are foundational.</p>
 Designing for Human Needs – Not Just Tech Specs 
<p>Sociotechnical system design recognises that technology and its users are deeply interconnected. A User-Centred Design (UCD) approach helps ensure that AI tools are not just technically capable but operationally usable - understanding not only what the system does, but how, when and why humans interact with it.<br>
Effective HMT depends on this holistic understanding: the tasks, contexts, cognitive loads, and decision paths of real-world operators.</p>
 The Role - and Limits - of AI in Decision-Making 
<p>AI excels at processing high volumes of data - from sensor feeds to open-source intelligence - and can surface critical insights at speed. But without explainability, even the most sophisticated AI may be unusable in high-stakes environments.</p>
<p>Mission-ready AI systems must be:<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Explainable: Able to show how and why a recommendation was made.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reliable: Consistently accurate under variable conditions.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aligned: Reflective of commander intent and mission objectives.</p>
<p>Importantly, AI isn’t always the right answer. Sometimes simpler solutions such as conventional deterministic algorithms may be more suitable.</p>
 Addressing Human Factors: Cognitive Load and Trust 
<p>Operators face immense cognitive demands, especially in ambiguous or fast-moving scenarios. The best HMT systems reduce complexity, offering clear, intuitive interfaces and enabling confident, accountable decision-making.</p>
<p>But trust must be earned. Trust is the cornerstone of Human-Machine Teaming. Operators need to feel in control, even when machines act autonomously</p>
<p>Over-reliance on automation can lead to skill fade; lack of trust can result in underuse. Striking the right balance - and training operators to understand both the strengths and limits of AI - is critical.</p>
<p>Ethical and Legal Responsibility: Why Human Oversight Matters</p>
<p>The UK’s Ministry of Defence is clear: the integration of AI must uphold International Humanitarian Law and moral accountability. The principle of Meaningful Human Control ensures humans remain responsible - even in the use of lethal force.</p>
<p>JSP 936: Dependable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in defence is the policy framework governing the safe and responsible adoption of AI in MoD. It requires:</p>
 
 Transparent AI design 
 Clear chains of command 
 Robust validation and testing 
 Guardrails to prevent bias or adversarial exploitation 
 
<p>These aren’t checkboxes. They’re essential to operational legitimacy and public trust.</p>
 Barriers to Adoption - and How to Overcome Them 
<p>Despite the benefits, barriers to seamless HMT adoption remain:</p>
 
 Data Interoperability: Legacy systems and siloed data hinder integration. 
 Infrastructure Constraints: AI capabilities may outpace existing platforms. 
 Training Gaps: Operators must be equipped to interpret AI outputs - not just act on them. 
 
<p>Solutions include test environments (‘sandboxes’), joint human-AI training, and inclusive design processes that involve end users from day one.</p>
 Strategic Alignment and Future Roadmap 
<p>HMT aligns directly with the UK’s Strategic Defence Review, which prioritises AI, data exploitation and multi-domain integration. As a key enabler of faster, decentralised operations, HMT supports defence ambitions for greater agility and resilience.</p>
<p>Thales UK, with partners, is actively:</p>
 
 Developing common frameworks to support HMT evaluation 
 Embedding human sciences into system design 
 Collaborating with users to ensure real-world relevance 
 Supporting ethical standards for autonomy in defence 
 
 What Comes Next? 
<p>To realise the full potential of HMT, the defence community must commit to sustained investment in:</p>
 
 Human-centred AI R&amp;D 
 Training and skills development 
 Transparent procurement processes 
 Cross-sector collaboration with industry and academia 
 
<p>Human-Machine Teaming isn’t a future vision - it’s today’s operational need. As the pace and complexity of operations increase, defence forces must adopt technologies that support faster, more informed decision-making. This should be done with an ethical-AI by design approach, that preserves moral and legal accountability, but retains the pace of relevance.</p>

 Introduction <p>The convergence of AI and blockchain technology is no longer a futuristic concept — it’s happening now. Imagine large language models (LLMs) like Claude or ChatGPT directly interacting with blockchain networks. Developers could build decentralized applications in a far more intuitive and efficient manner.</p><p>We’ve developed the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Metadium blockchain to make this vision a reality. This server empowers AI models to interact with the Metadium network using natural language, enabling seamless accessTJ to core blockchain functions.</p><p>(This technology is already integrated into MChat, which was recently launched.)</p> Metadium + MCP: A Perfect&nbsp;Match <p>Metadium is a next-generation blockchain platform optimized for decentralized identity (DID) management. It supports DID protocols, smart contracts, and token standards such as MRC20 and MRC721, allowing users to retain complete control over their digital identities.</p><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, enables AI models to interact with external systems in a structured way. With MCP, AI can go beyond text generation and execute real-world tasks through direct system integration.</p> Key Features  1. Comprehensive Account Management <p>The Metadium MCP server supports a wide range of blockchain account operations:</p>  Balance Check: Retrieve METADIUM token balances for up to 20 addresses simultaneously  Transaction History: Access both external and internal transaction logs  Token Tracking: View MRC20 and MRC721 token holdings and transfer&nbsp;activity  Mining Records: Trace mined blocks by a specific&nbsp;address   @mcp.tool()<br>async def get_metadium_balance(addresses: List[str]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get METADIUM Balance for one or more addresses (max 20)"""<br>if len(addresses) == 0 or len(addresses) &gt; 20:<br>raise ValueError("addresses must contain 1–20 items")<br># … implementation details  2. Smart Contract Integration <p>Developers can seamlessly interact with smart contracts:</p>  ABI Retrieval: Access verified contracts’ Application Binary Interface  Source Code: View the source code of verified contracts  Contract Verification: Automate source code verification for new contracts   3. DID&nbsp;Support <p>Specialized tools for managing Metadium’s decentralized identity&nbsp;system:</p>  DID Stats: Track issuance by hour, day, or&nbsp;month  Total Issuance: Retrieve the real-time total number of issued&nbsp;DIDs   async def get_total_issued_dids() -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get total number of issued DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)"""<br>function_selector = "0xa1707e7b" # Call the nextEIN() function<br>call_data = {"to": MAINNET_DID_REGISTRY, "data": function_selector}<br># … Contract call via JSON-RPC  4. Full Ethereum JSON-RPC Compatibility <p>As an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, Metadium supports all standard JSON-RPC API functions:</p>  Block Info: Retrieve detailed block data by hash or&nbsp;number  Transaction Handling: Send transactions, track status, and fetch&nbsp;receipts  Gas Estimation: Predict gas requirements for transactions  Event Logs: Filter and view smart contract event&nbsp;logs   Technical Architecture  Modular Design <p>The MCP server is organized into clearly separated modules:</p> ├── api_client.py # HTTP/JSON-RPC client<br>├── accounts/ # Account-related features<br>├── contracts/ # Smart contract features<br>├── eth_namespace/ # Ethereum-compatible API<br>├── statistics/ # Network statistics<br>└── others.py # Utility functions  Asynchronous Processing <p>All blockchain interactions use Python’s async/await to ensure high performance and responsiveness through concurrent requests:</p> async def make_jsonrpc_request(<br>method: str, params: List[Any] = None, request_id: int = 1<br>) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:<br>response = await client.post(JSONRPC_API_BASE, headers=headers, json=payload)<br>return response.json()  Human-Friendly Data Transformation <p>Hexadecimal blockchain data is automatically converted into readable decimal format for both AI models and end&nbsp;users:</p> def add_decimal_fields_to_block(block_data: Dict[str, Any]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>hex_fields = ["baseFeePerGas", "difficulty", "gasLimit", "gasUsed", …]<br>for field in hex_fields:<br>if field in result and result[field].startswith("0x"):<br>decimal_value = hex_to_decimal(result[field])<br>modified_result[f"{field}_decimal"] = decimal_value  Real-World Use&nbsp;Cases  1. AI-Powered Blockchain Analytics <p>Developers can ask Claude natural-language queries&nbsp;like:</p><p>“Analyze DID issuance patterns over the past 7 days and list all MRC20 token transfers from this contract in chronological order.”</p> 2. Smart Contract Development Support <p>Smart contract developers can speed up their workflows:</p><p>“Fetch the ABI of this contract, estimate gas costs for each function, and suggest optimization strategies.”</p> 3. DeFi Application Monitoring <p>DeFi operators can monitor systems in real-time:</p><p>“Calculate the total value locked (TVL) in our protocol and summarize key events over the past 24&nbsp;hours.”</p> Closing Thoughts <p>The Metadium MCP server is an innovative tool that bridges the gap between AI and blockchain. By enabling developers to interact with decentralized systems using natural language instead of complex APIs, it lowers the barrier to entry for building powerful Web3 applications.</p><p>The integration of Metadium — pioneering in decentralized identity — with cutting-edge AI capabilities opens up new possibilities across the blockchain ecosystem. We hope this tool empowers more developers to explore the world of Web3 and build truly transformative applications for the next digital&nbsp;era.</p><p>The Metadium&nbsp;Team</p> Metadium 블록체인을 위한 MCP 서버: AI와 디지털 신원 관리의 새로운&nbsp;만남  들어가며 <p>인공지능과 블록체인 기술의 융합은 더 이상 먼 미래의 이야기가 아닙니다. 특히 Claude, ChatGPT와 같은 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)이 블록체인 네트워크와 직접 상호작용할 수 있다면, 개발자들은 훨씬 더 직관적이고 효율적인 방식으로 탈중앙화 애플리케이션을 구축할 수 있을&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>이러한 비전을 실현하기 위해, 우리는 Metadium 블록체인을 위한 Model Context Protocol(MCP) 서버를 개발했습니다. 이 서버는 AI 모델이 Metadium 네트워크의 다양한 기능들을 자연어로 쉽게 활용할 수 있도록 도와주는 혁신적인&nbsp;도구입니다.</p><p>(이 기술은 최근에 서비스를 시작한 MChat에 적용되었습니다.)</p> Metadium과 MCP: 완벽한&nbsp;조합 <p>Metadium은 디지털 신원 관리에 특화된 차세대 블록체인 플랫폼입니다. 분산 신원 증명(DID), 스마트 컨트랙트, 그리고 다양한 토큰 표준(MRC20, MRC721)을 지원하며, 사용자들이 자신의 디지털 신원을 완전히 통제할 수 있는 환경을&nbsp;제공합니다.</p><p>Model Context Protocol(MCP)은 Anthropic에서 개발한 프로토콜로, AI 모델이 외부 시스템과 구조화된 방식으로 상호작용할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이를 통해 AI는 단순한 텍스트 생성을 넘어서 실제 시스템과의 통합된 작업을 수행할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> 핵심 기능&nbsp;살펴보기  1. 포괄적인 계정&nbsp;관리 <p>Metadium MCP 서버는 블록체인 계정과 관련된 모든 작업을&nbsp;지원합니다:</p>  잔액 조회: 최대 20개 주소의 METADIUM 토큰 잔액을 한 번에&nbsp;확인  트랜잭션 내역: 일반 트랜잭션부터 내부 트랜잭션까지 상세한 이력&nbsp;추적  토큰 관리: MRC20과 MRC721 토큰의 전송 내역 및 보유 현황&nbsp;조회  채굴 이력: 특정 주소가 채굴한 블록 목록&nbsp;확인   @mcp.tool()<br>async def get_metadium_balance(addresses: List[str]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get METADIUM Balance for one or more addresses (max 20)"""<br>if len(addresses) == 0 or len(addresses) &gt; 20:<br>raise ValueError("addresses must contain 1–20 items")<br># … 구현 세부사항  2. 스마트 컨트랙트&nbsp;통합 <p>개발자들이 가장 관심을 가질 만한 기능 중 하나는 스마트 컨트랙트와의 완벽한&nbsp;통합입니다:</p>  ABI 조회: 검증된 컨트랙트의 Application Binary Interface 정보&nbsp;추출  소스 코드 확인: 검증된 컨트랙트의 원본 소스 코드&nbsp;조회  컨트랙트 검증: 새로운 컨트랙트의 소스 코드 검증 프로세스&nbsp;자동화   3.

 Identity assurance is the goal 

<p>When we think about authentication, we think of gaining access to sensitive resources. We want some level of barrier so the data isn’t publicly available. It’s not enough to merely add a barrier, though. Wouldn’t it be more useful to have assurances that the user’s credentials are uniquely theirs and that no one can impersonate them? It’s more than a fence around the data; we also have assurances that the user accessing the data is who they say they are. It sounds great in theory.</p>

<p>We want to balance security requirements with our users’ comfort in an ideal world. Increased security requirements may increase user friction points. The more friction points a user encounters, the lower their satisfaction, engagement, and app usage – the balance point changes depending on the app user and the data sensitivity. For example, requirements may differ for public applications catering to consumers (B2C) versus internal applications used within an organization’s workforce.</p>

<p>Let’s navigate this balancing act together so you can find the right path for your needs.</p>

 Demystifying authentication factors 

<p>Before we dive into possible solutions, let’s review the three authentication factor categories:</p>



    
    
      Something you know <br>
      Knowledge factors include passwords and PINs
    


    
    
    Something you have<br>
    Possession factors include devices such as smart cards, security keys, phones, and tablets
    


    
    
    Something you are<br>
    Inference factors include biometrics such as fingerprints and facial recognition
    



<p>Authentication relies on one or more factor categories to establish identity assurances before granting users access to applications.</p>

 Embrace phishing-resistant authentication 

<p>The best-in-class, more secure, and recommended authentication methods are phishing-resistant. Phishing-resistant authentication is more difficult to hack and mitigates unauthorized access due to intercepting PINs and sign-in links.<br>
Phishing-resistant authentication relies on biometrics and specialized devices or equipment to prevent an attacker from accessing your application.</p>

<p>Phishing-resistant factors include the following forms.</p>

 Smart cards and PIV cards 

<p>Large enterprises, regulated industries, and government entities widely use smart cards and PIV cards. These organizations may issue smart cards for attaching personal profiles to shared workstation access, as seen in banks or hospitals. Organizations may issue cards to their workforce even when the employee uses an issued laptop as an extra security measure.</p>

<p>Pros: Secure, can be uniquely tied to the user, and well utilized in industries</p>

<p>Cons: Requires a physical device that can be lost or stolen, not scalable to use for public and consumer security due to hardware requirements and convenience</p>

 Security keys and hardware devices 

<p>Hardware security keys are another elevated security mechanism organizations use for their workforce. Security keys can have differing levels of security, from the older and less secure Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) keys, Near Field Communication (NFC) keys that require a secondary device such as a phone, and keys requiring biometrics. For the highest level of security, you’ll want to use keys and hardware with biometric capabilities. Security keys work by storing the credentials on hardware, which requires registering the key on each device you use. While keys that plug into computers may be familiar, biometric-capable hardware, such as a laptop, and capable software can also be a phishing-resistant authentication factor. Okta FastPass on a biometric-capable computer is an example of a phishing-resistant hardware device.</p>

<p>Pros: Biometric-based hardware devices are highly secure.</p>

<p>Cons: It may require a physical device, you need to register the key on each device you use, and it isn’t scalable for public and consumer security due to hardware requirements and convenience. Device manufacturers can make them small and lightweight for convenience, alleviating concerns about relying on bulky equipment. But what happens if the user loses or damages this device? How long would it take before they have access to the system again?</p>

 FIDO2 with WebAuthn and Passkeys 

<p>FIDO2 and WebAuthn combined are a strong authentication factor that utilizes biometrics on capable devices and new capabilities in web frameworks to increase user security reliably. This factor requires a biometric-capable device meeting FIDO standards, such as a phone or a laptop, and capable software. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">World Wide Web Consortium spec for web authentication</a> (WebAuthn) means JavaScript-based web apps can support phishing-resistant authentication right in the browser. The difference between phishing-resistant hardware factors, such as security keys or Okta FastPass on biometric devices and Passkeys, is discoverability and the ability to port credentials. Instead of storing credentials on the hardware, discoverable FIDO authentication stores credentials outside software, such as in the iCloud Keychain or Android Keystore. The credential storage makes authenticating on the same site across different devices within the same ecosystem possible without re-registering.</p>

<p>Pros: Biometric-based FIDO authentication is secure, scales for public and consumer users, and there is no need to carry a security key or card</p>

<p>Cons: Each app must support this authentication method, and consumers must own capable devices</p>

<p>For the highest levels of identity security, use phishing-resistant factors.</p>

 Phishing-resistant factors decision tree 

<p>We recommend phishing-resistant factors at Okta as they offer the best application protection. You have identity assurances built in, along with authentication security. Consider this decision tree for your authentication needs:</p>

<p></p>

 Avoid weak authentication methods 

<p>We no longer live in a world where passwords alone are good enough to secure sensitive resources. Studies have shown that over <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">80% of data breaches result from compromised credentials</a>. We must elevate authentication methods by avoiding weak credentials and preferring more substantial forms. Look towards industry leaders in cybersecurity, including companies such as Okta, nonprofit foundations such as OWASP, and government standards such as <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">NIST</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-management">NCSC</a>, to guide you towards strong factors and away from weak ones. In particular, be wary of legacy factors.</p>

 Avoid security questions as a factor 

<p>Cybersecurity organizations do not recommend security questions, as they are neither secure nor reliable. Security questions are vulnerable to social engineering attacks. It’s best to avoid this method.</p>

 SMS one-time codes are unsafe 

<p>Attackers can access those messages through SIM-swapping and interception attacks. NIST proposes deprecating SMS as an authentication factor, so consider alternate authentication methods.</p>

 Email Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) have similar security issues as SMS 

<p>Using email for TOTP presents similar security issues as SMS codes. Attackers can intercept email. Emails may mistakenly get flagged as spam. Email delivery delays can result in configuring longer time validity periods, causing lower security.</p>

 Avoid password antipatterns 

<p>Passwords must evolve by allowing longer character lengths and character variety. Avoid antipatterns such as complexity requirements and forced password resets. Enforce strong passwords by checking them against compromised password databases. Password managers can offset user risks by recommending unique, strong passwords for each site and applying the stored passwords. Still, password managers aren’t failproof, and users may use insecure passwords for the password manager themselves.</p>

<p>These factors do offer a weak barrier to sensitive resources, but a key element is missing: identity assurance. The weak authentication factors lack the safeguards to ensure the users making the authentication challenge are who they say they are.</p>

 Elevate authentication security with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) 

<p>Passwords alone require caution, but a combination of passwords and other factors elevates identity security. A single legacy authentication factor is rarely secure enough to protect any resource; it isn’t safe enough to access your users and Okta configuration.</p>

<p>Adding factors such as authenticator apps supporting TOTP and push authentication increases the barriers to sensitive data. Raising the barriers helps protect your application by requiring more effort for impersonators trying to hack accounts. However, using the weakest authentication factors combined isn’t as strong as phishing-resistant.</p>

 Combine strong authentication factors 

<p>The best way to ensure authentication security and reasonable identity assurances is to combine moderate to high authentication factors. Doing so supports good security with secure fallback systems. For example, if you can’t use phishing-resistant authentication in a consumer scenario, layer a password with push authentication. Allow the consumer to opt into Passkeys while supporting MFA. For workforce scenarios, issue hardware keys as a backup factor in addition to Okta FastPass.</p>

<p>Okta’s authentication policy builder can help you create strong authentication requirements to access Okta services and applications protected by Okta’s sign-in while tailoring session lifetimes to your needs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s time we evolve our application’s authentication security and favor phishing-resistant factors.</p>
</blockquote>

 Customize authentication requirements dynamically 

<p>Identity security isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. FIDO2 with WebAuthn factors such as Okta FastPass for workforce use cases and Passkeys for consumer use cases can be the standard methodology.</p>

 Consider Adaptive MFA for conditional authentication requirements 

<p>Complex use cases call for more tailoring. Your needs may change depending on use factors such as geographic location, IP addresses, device attributes, and threat detection. Identity Providers offer solutions that help you tailor authentication security. For example, Okta supports features such as <a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/adaptive-authentication/">Adaptive MFA</a>, which adjusts authentication requirements depending on context, and <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/itp/overview.htm">Identity Threat Protection</a>, which continuously monitors threats and can react by terminating authenticated sessions. If your industry requires the highest levels of identity security or your application contains highly sensitive resources, look to these options.</p>

 Revalidate identity for sensitive resource requests 

<p>Identity assurances don’t have to happen only at application entry. When sensitive actions and data require elevated authentication, consider using the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-step-up-authentication-when-to-use-it/">Step Up Authentication Challenge</a> to protect resources. The Step Up Authentication Challenge is an OAuth standard for requiring secure factors or recent authentication when performing actions within the application.</p>

<p>Third-party interactions may require identity assurances. While we primarily think about authenticating as a solo activity, think about the case where someone calls into a help center for support. The help center agent needs to verify identity remotely, and we don’t want to rely only on weak methods such as passwords or pins. Consider using <a>Client-Initiated Back-channel Authentication (CIBA)</a> for your application in cases like this.</p>

<p>What do all these recommendations mean for developers working on these applications? How can we take advantage of identity security best practices?</p>

 Build secure apps by applying identity security concepts 

<p>We developers have a tough job. We must ensure our applications meet compliance requirements and guard against security threats, all while delivering product features. Authentication is foundational, but not your entire product line. It’s an expectation that doesn’t drive product innovations for your app, but detrimental when implemented incorrectly.</p>

 Use an Identity Provider (IDP) that supports OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>To best protect your application and free yourself from getting into the weeds of implementing authentication, delegate it to your Identity Provider (IdP) whenever possible. When you delegate authentication to an IdP like Okta, you can access industry-recognized best practices, such as using OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards with user redirect for the authentication challenge. Redirecting the user to the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget frees you from managing authentication methods manually. It allows you to leverage the Sign-in Widget user challenge with the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) for phishing-resistant authentication factors. Using the Okta Identity Engine means your app accesses the latest and greatest features for secure identity management.</p>

 Delegate authentication to your Identity Provider (IDP) 

<p>When you redirect the user to Okta for sign-in, you make authentication Okta’s problem. And that’s great because it provides you with the most security and the least amount of work. Your Okta administrator can configure authentication policies and add business rules to those authentication user challenges. You don’t have to worry about how to implement WebAuthn in your app, ensuring you have all the user controls to handle push notifications, or track sign-in context to adapt authentication factors. It’s all handled. All you need to know is whether the user completed authentication challenges, and then you can return to delivering features.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned a browser redirect for sign in degrades user experience or if your application’s use case demands a custom look and feel, you can customize the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget’s styles. When you combine a custom-branded Sign-In Widget with a custom domain, your users may never know they leave your site. We’re continuing to build out capabilities in this area so you can deliver both secure identity and branding requirements. Be on the lookout for content about customizing sign in.</p>

 Use a vetted and well-maintained OIDC client library 

<p>A vetted, well-maintained OIDC client library increases implementation speed, lowers developer effort, and, most importantly, is crucial for authentication security. Because OAuth 2.1 and OIDC are open standards, writing your code to handle the required transactions is tempting. Resist the temptation for the sake of your application security and the efforts for the continued maintenance that good authentication libraries require. It’s too easy to introduce developer error in something like the Proof-Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) verification steps or to miss something in the token verification, for example. <a href="https://salt.security/blog/traveling-with-oauth-account-takeover-on-booking-com">Many more subtle errors can adversely affect your application</a>. Resist the temptation.</p>

<p>The standards can also change over time, such as adding new protection mechanisms or introducing breaking changes. Writing custom implementation means changes and maintenance become your responsibility, and you <a href="https://darutk.medium.com/oauth-oidc-mistakes-7f3bb909518b">can’t presume prior spec knowledge is good enough, as specs can change</a>. Resist the temptation and take this responsibility off your plate.</p>

<p>Ideally, use a vetted, well-maintained OIDC client library that is <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified-openid-connect-implementations/">OIDC-certified</a> or the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/">Okta SDKs</a>. Okta’s SDKs not only securely handle the OAuth handshake and token storage for you, but you’ll also get built-in support for the latest advancements in OAuth specs, such as Step Up Authentication Challenge, CIBA, and more.</p>

 Join the identity security evolution 

<p>Protect your workforce and customers by elevating authentication factors using phishing-resistant factors. Allow Okta to work for you by configuring strong authentication policies. Enable dynamic authentication factors and threat detection in your Okta org to mitigate data breaches and strengthen your reputation.</p>

<p>In your software applications, leverage Okta SDKs to redirect users to the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget to quickly gain access to the more secure authentication factors efficiently and seamlessly. Then, build more safety in your apps by adding the Step Up Authentication Challenge to maintain identity security. Staying updated with the latest security best practices and thoughtfully integrating OAuth specs are essential to secure identity management.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply these key takeaways</p>
   
     Use phishing-resistant factors for authentication wherever possible, preferring Passkeys and Okta FastPass depending on use case and target audience 
     Offer strong MFA options as a backup authentication methods 
     Delegate identity management and authentication to an Identity Provider (IDP) supporting OAuth 2.1 and OIDC 
     Use an OIDC client library to redirect users to sign in through an Okta-hosted sign in page 
     Consider using OAuth extension specs to elevate identity assurances continuously throughout the lifetime of a user session

<blockquote>TL;DR <br>Smart contracts are powerful but limited. They can’t think, adapt, or process complex real-world data. This becomes a major bottleneck as Web3 intersects with AI, RWA, and scientific computation. Noosphere introduces a verifiable off-chain intelligence layer, enabling smart contracts to securely delegate off-chain inference and computation.</blockquote> Limitations of Smart Contracts <p>Smart contracts revolutionized the game by introducing decentralized, deterministic, and transparent automation. But as the use cases for Web3 evolve, touching AI, real-world assets, and scientific modeling, those same design principles begin to feel limiting.</p><p>Smart contracts were never meant to think. They can’t infer, predict, adapt, or process complexity the way humans (or AI) can. This bottleneck has become one of the biggest blockers to building intelligent dApps.</p><p>While this design ensures security and transparency, it severely limits the capabilities of Web3 applications. Smart contracts cannot:</p>  Perform AI inference (e.g., LLM-based responses)  Aggregate multi-source or time-sensitive data  Execute heavy off-chain computations  Dynamically interact with complex, uncertain real-world conditions  <p>This forces developers to&nbsp;either:</p>  Build oversimplified logic directly on-chain, or  Depend on centralized APIs or external scripts, undermining decentralization and verifiability.  <p>Without off-chain computation, smart contracts can’t process large datasets, verify model outputs, or manage economic incentives related to data generation and verification. Worse, the absence of verifiability creates a black box. As a result, decentralized applications across DeFi, DeSci, and RWA are often stuck between being too limited to be useful or too centralized to be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>What we need is not just more data. We need a programmable, auditable, and privacy-preserving delegation layer that brings intelligent logic to on-chain while preserving decentralization.</p><p>That’s where Noosphere comes in. It enables smart contracts to securely delegate off-chain computation to verifiable agents, bridging the gap between on-chain determinism and off-chain intelligence. With Noosphere, decentralized applications can reason, adapt, and act intelligently without sacrificing decentralization, privacy, or auditability.</p> What Noosphere Enables <p>With Noosphere, developers can:</p>  Request off-chain computation directly from smart contracts, including LLM inference, risk assessments, or simulations.  Receive verifiable responses and integrate them securely into on-chain workflows.  Build privacy-preserving, intelligent dApps using a unified framework that combines compute infrastructure, oracles, and verification layers.  Orchestrate AI agents that are programmable, auditable, and trustless.  <p>By serving as a decentralized coordination and verification layer for off-chain logic, Noosphere upgrades the capabilities of smart contracts across all major&nbsp;sectors.</p> Real-World Applications   DeFAI Agents (via ArenAI): Agents powered by off-chain AI models that autonomously allocate assets, hedge risks, or rebalance portfolios across chains, integrated directly into&nbsp;DeFi.  DeSci Protocols: Scientific research platforms can outsource high-performance modeling (e.g. protein folding, climate simulation) to Noosphere agents.  On-Chain RWA Intelligence: Tokenized real-world assets (real estate, receivables) gain real-time valuations, credit scores, or logistics tracking via AI models verified through Noosphere.  Decentralized Compliance &amp; KYC (with Booost): AI agents trained on regulatory data assess AML risk or compliance patterns and return auditable scores. When paired with Booost’s proof-of-humanity, it enables dynamic, compliant onboarding across ecosystems.  Inference Markets for Synthetic Datasets: Researchers can generate and verify AI-based interpretations in medical, legal, or financial contexts. Tokens are staked to incentivize validation, with outputs coordinated and verified through Noosphere.  <p>As decentralized applications evolve beyond static logic and into intelligent, adaptive systems, the need for verifiable off-chain computation becomes urgent. Noosphere fills this gap, not by replacing smart contracts, but by extending their capabilities with off-chain AI reasoning, data coordination, and secure delegation. Whether you’re building in DeFi, DeSci, RWA, or beyond, Noosphere unlocks the infrastructure to make your dApps not just programmable, but truly intelligent.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/noosphere-a-gateway-to-verifiable-off-chain-intelligence-9eb6a4523fb5">Noosphere: A Gateway to Verifiable Off-Chain Intelligence</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  A mobile driver’s license (mDL) is a type of cryptographically verifiable digital credential that you hold in a digital wallet on a mobile device. You can now issue and verify mDLs in Indicio Proven — along with other popular credential formats and communications protocols.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 By Helen Garneau<p></p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/mdoc-mdl-and-choosing-the-right-digital-credential-for-the-job/">A mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> is a digital credential built on the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a> standard. It is stored directly on a user’s device, can be verified cryptographically, and works in both online and offline settings using Bluetooth or NFC.</p>
<p>This means you can digitally verify someone’s identity without relying on real-time access to a central database or system. This also means you can carry a government-issued credential in your mobile wallet and present only the specific data needed for a given interaction, such as confirming your age or license status. These credentials are self-contained, shared with consent, and designed to protect privacy.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is the easiest way for organizations to issue and verify mDLs with minimal friction and helps you establish a foundation for portable digital identity while reducing fraud and supporting regulatory compliance while allowing individuals to manage their own identity information.</p>
 How to Issue and Verify mDLs with Indicio Proven 
 
  Select your deployment approach<br>
Choose Indicio’s hosted option or deploy Indicio Proven within your own infrastructure. Both support quick integration with your existing systems. 
  Define your credential schema<br>
Start with the ISO 18013-5 mDL schema or customize it with region-specific or sector-specific fields such as military service, donor status, or endorsement codes. 
  Add document verification<br>
Use one of Indicio’s partners, like <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/regula-and-indicio-partner-to-transform-identity-verification-with-verifiable-credentials/">Regula</a>, to validate documents and biometric data before issuing digital credentials. 
  Issue to a secure mobile wallet<br>
Once the identity is verified, Proven issues the mDL directly to a wallet controlled by the user. The credential stays on their device and under their control. 
  Support flexible verification<br>
Enable verification online through APIs or offline through NFC or Bluetooth. The system respects consent and limits data exposure by design. 
  Scale to meet future needs<br>
The same infrastructure can issue and verify other credentials, including travel credentials, health records, and proof of residency. No additional systems are required to expand.

<p>“Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation. These terms get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.” </p>



<p>That distinction matters when designing resilient infrastructure that supports trust.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. 



 Disinformation is deliberately deceptive content, often politically or financially motivated. 



 Malinformation is factual information used out of context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most of our efforts to address these problems focus on content, activities like fact-checking, moderation, and takedown requests. And those are important. But after sitting through multiple sessions at <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20</a> last month, I came away thinking about the architectures that enable or undermine digital trust in the first place. (Did you see my post <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/29/wsis20-and-identity-governance/">last week</a> on learnings from WSIS+20?)</p>



<p>Remember, trust doesn’t start with content. It actually starts with infrastructure.</p>



<p>The people in those WSIS+20 rooms weren’t talking about disinformation in the abstract. They were talking about humanitarian workers in the field, where timely, accurate, and secure information can be a matter of life and death. They talked about public health campaigns, peacekeeping missions, and journalists trying to survive in an environment where lies move faster than truth. And in almost every session, it became clear that the technical underpinnings of the Internet—especially in crisis and conflict settings—are being overlooked.</p>

 Identity is part of the equation 



<p>While identity wasn’t explicitly discussed in these sessions, it’s a critical part of establishing authenticity, which in turn helps build trust. IAM systems can’t prevent disinformation, but they can help validate source integrity and support accountability.</p>



 
 Verified senders can be identified without compromising privacy. 



 Digital credentials can establish provenance for content or data. (Shout out to the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> work here!) 



 Attribute-based access can help ensure information reaches the right people in the right roles. 
 



<p>I’m not promoting centralized control or surveillance. What I want is to build confidence in the systems we rely on to make decisions, especially in high-stakes environments.</p>



 Disinformation and infrastructure resilience 



<p>Something I thought about as I settled down with my notes after the event, though it wasn’t phrased this way quite like this during any of the sessions: When infrastructure fails, it doesn’t just disrupt services; it disrupts the foundation of trust that identity and information systems rely on. Several sessions at WSIS+20 focused on resilient digital infrastructure, especially in the context of sustainability and the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Speakers from IEEE, CERN, and disaster risk reduction agencies reminded us that resilience is more than just a technical property; it’s what enables everything. Disinformation thrives when infrastructure fails. That includes failures of availability, integrity, and interoperability. When identity systems falter, the ability to authenticate sources, validate messages, and maintain digital trust during crisis response suffers, too.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure often isn’t designed to serve people in remote or underserved areas. 



 Technical standards don’t always account for multilingual or multi-platform accessibility. 



 Short-term, market-driven decisions prioritize scalability over long-term resilience. 
 



<p>Standards developers and IAM professionals know this at a technical level. Heck, I wrote about this a few weeks ago in a post on <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/01/resilience-in-standards/">resilience in standards.</a> But what’s often missed is how infrastructure failure becomes a governance issue. When people lose trust in digital systems, they distrust more than just the failed platform. They also start to distrust institutions and even each other.</p>



 Resilience isn’t for other people 



<p>IAM systems face similar challenges: do we build for edge cases, or optimize for the majority? Whose threat model are we prioritizing? How do we balance user experience with verifiability?</p>



<p>Just to make it more complicated, there is the fact that technology designed to protect can also exclude.</p>



 
 Overly strict verification requirements can lock out vulnerable populations. 



 Misapplied protections can be used to suppress journalism or advocacy. 



 “Safety” features can become surveillance tools in the wrong hands. 
 



<p>Even well-intentioned systems can marginalize people when their design doesn’t include a wide range of needs and experiences.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem. And digital identity experts and standards architects have a role to play.</p>



 Closing the loop: From resilience back to disinformation 



<p>The sections above touched on how resilient, inclusive infrastructure supports digital trust. But let’s not lose sight of the central theme: disinformation. It spreads most easily where infrastructure is brittle, trust is low, and identity signals are weak or absent. That’s why the work of IAM professionals and standards developers matters—not just for security or compliance, but for defending the conditions in which truth can survive.</p>



 So, what can identity professionals do? 



<p>I love it when a plan comes together, and the plan here is to think about fighting disinformation and improving the resilience of our systems.</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal: Build IAM systems that account for low-connectivity, low-trust environments. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern: Support verifiable claims, provenance metadata, and strong-but-private identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations: Push for feedback loops between standards bodies, policymakers, and civil society. Ask who is being served and who isn’t. 
 



 And what can standards architects do? 



 
 Define and document trust assumptions: Clearly state what the system assumes about message integrity, source authenticity, and the broader infrastructure. Make those assumptions visible and testable. 



 Design for degraded conditions: Create standards that support verifiability even when connectivity is intermittent, metadata is partial, or infrastructure is compromised. 



 Include threat models beyond fraud: Consider disinformation campaigns, information suppression, and adversarial use of identity signals in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process: Include journalists, humanitarian responders, civil society groups, and policy experts in standards development. Their use cases will expand your view of what “interoperable” and “resilient” really mean. 
 



 Building for trust means building for everyone 



<p>Trust isn’t just about whether users believe your system is secure. It’s about whether they believe the Internet is still a place where truth can be found and relied upon. That belief erodes when digital systems exclude marginalized, underserved, and underrepresented users, whose experiences and threat models are often left out of design decisions. And that erosion creates fertile ground for disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation to take root.</p>



<p>This connection wasn’t made explicitly in the WSIS+20 sessions, but it became clear to me: trust in digital systems isn’t separate from trust in public discourse. If we want to defend the truth, we have to build systems that serve the whole public, not just the easy parts of it.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem, and identity has a role to play.</p>



<p>This work is messy. It spans disciplines, sectors, and priorities. But if we want trustworthy systems, we have to build them with and for the people who rely on them most. That starts with looking beyond our immediate use cases and asking harder questions about who benefits, who’s left out, and what it means to build for trust in a world where truth itself is contested.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest<br>[00:00:04]</p>



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity — from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Disinformation, Really? 



<p>[00:00:29]</p>



<p>Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation.</p>



<p>They may sound similar, but these terms have crucial differences. And if we want to design digital systems that truly support trust and accountability, those differences matter.</p>



<p>This week, I’m sharing an unexpected takeaway from my time at WSIS+20 in Geneva. I left that event with a strong belief that disinformation isn’t just a content problem — it’s an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And that infrastructure includes identity.</p>



 



 Defining the Terms 



<p>[00:01:05]</p>



<p>Let’s start with some clear definitions — because words matter.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. Think: hearing a rumor and passing it along without realizing it’s untrue. 



 Disinformation is intentionally deceptive, crafted and spread to influence behavior or opinion, often politically or financially. 



 Malinformation is true, but used maliciously — like doxing someone or leaking sensitive context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most efforts to combat these focus on content — fact-checking, takedowns, moderation policies. And that work is vital.</p>



<p>But what I heard in the WSIS sessions wasn’t just about policies. It was about digital infrastructure.</p>



 



 Real-World Impact: Why Infrastructure Matters 



<p>[00:02:00]</p>



<p>Here are a few stories that helped this hit home:</p>



 
 Humanitarian workers struggling to communicate securely in conflict zones. 



 Journalists fighting to survive and tell the truth amid algorithmic lies. 



 Peacekeeping missions and public health campaigns racing to get accurate information out before disinformation spreads faster. 
 



<p>In all these cases, trust didn’t hinge on whether someone flagged a tweet. It depended on whether the underlying systems could support or sabotage the truth.</p>



 



 Technical Failures Become Governance Failures 



<p>[00:03:02]</p>



<p>If your network goes down, people will turn to unofficial channels.<br>If your logs are incomplete or timestamps unverifiable, message integrity falls apart.<br>If your system can’t authenticate a sender, how do you know whether or not to act?</p>



<p>That’s not just a technical failure — it’s a governance failure.</p>



<p>And when people lose trust in digital systems, the consequences ripple outward:</p>



 
 Trust in platforms erodes 



 Trust in institutions falters 



 Trust in each other breaks down 
 



 



 Where Identity Comes Into Play 



<p>[00:03:45]</p>



<p>Interestingly, identity wasn’t a primary topic in most disinformation sessions. But it kept showing up — just at the edges.</p>



<p>Because when you ask:</p>



 
 Who sent this message? 



 Has it been tampered with? 



 Is this authentic? 
 



<p>You’re really asking identity questions.</p>



<p>Identity systems can help us answer those questions without sacrificing privacy, by:</p>



 
 Establishing provenance 



 Enabling verified senders to be trusted faster 



 Supporting credentials that show who said what, and when 



 Ensuring information flows to the right people at the right time 
 



<p>While identity and access management alone can’t solve the disinformation crisis, they’re essential tools in restoring trust in the systems where that information travels.</p>



 



 Designing for True Resilience 



<p>[00:04:50]</p>



<p>Another recurring theme at WSIS+20 was resilience. Not just uptime and backups — real resilience.</p>



<p>How systems perform in messy, unpredictable, even dangerous environments.</p>



<p>Sessions on sustainability, infrastructure, and disaster response included speakers from IEEE, CERN, physicists, and others who manage risk daily.</p>



<p>One takeaway stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Resilience isn’t just technical — it’s a social contract.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When resilience breaks down, we’re breaking that contract. We’re designing for the well-connected, the resourced, the mainstream — not for:</p>



 
 Remote communities 



 Multilingual populations 



 Low-trust or high-risk environments 
 



<p>And identity systems? They struggle with this all the time.</p>



 



 Exclusion Creates Fertile Ground for Disinformation 



<p>[00:06:02]</p>



<p>Strict verification protects against fraud. But what if you’re a displaced person without documents?</p>



<p>In trying to protect, we often exclude. And where people are excluded, disinformation grows.</p>



<p>Because people turn to what’s available. If trustworthy systems aren’t available — or don’t work for them — they’ll turn to anything that is.</p>



<p>So bringing this back full circle, disinformation thrives where:</p>



 
 Systems can’t verify sources 



 Users don’t trust what they see 



 Infrastructure fails or excludes 
 



<p>If your digital trust infrastructure — identity included — only works in ideal conditions, then you’ve built perfect conditions for disinformation.</p>



 



 Why Identity Standards Matter 



<p>[00:07:01]</p>



<p>Identity and access management (IAM) standards matter because they define the defaults.</p>



<p>They determine:</p>



 
 What’s interoperable 



 What can be verified 



 Whether truth can be seen, heard, and trusted 
 



<p>So if you’re an identity professional, what can you actually do?</p>



 



 What Identity Professionals Can Do 



<p>[00:07:25]</p>



<p>Here are some tangible steps to start with:</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal<br>Consider low-connectivity and low-trust environments. Build for those, too. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern<br>Support verifiable claims, embed provenance, and use privacy-preserving identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations<br>Don’t outsource this to policymakers. Collaborate with:
 
 Standards groups 



 Civil society 



 Policymakers 



 Employers 
 
 
 



<p>Ask hard questions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who’s being served? Who’s being left out?</p>
</blockquote>



 



 For Standards Architects: You Are My People 



<p>[00:08:20]</p>



<p>If you work on protocols, specs, or standards, here’s your to-do list:</p>



 
 Define layout and trust assumptions<br>Spell out what the system presumes about message integrity and infrastructure. 



 Design for degraded conditions<br>Don’t assume perfect metadata or nonstop uptime. 



 Think beyond fraud<br>Include disinformation, suppression, and misuse in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process<br>Bring in:
 
 Journalists 



 Emergency responders 



 Civil society leaders 
 
 
 



<p>Their use cases will expand your understanding and improve your solutions.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts: Trust as a Design Mandate 



<p>[00:09:30]</p>



<p>Trust isn’t just about security. It’s about whether people believe in digital systems at all.</p>



<p>When systems exclude people — by design or by neglect — trust erodes.<br>And in that erosion, disinformation thrives.</p>



<p>That’s what stood out to me most at WSIS+20.</p>



<p>If we want to fight mis-, dis-, and malinformation, we can’t just treat it as a content problem.</p>



<p>We must treat it as an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And identity professionals and standards architects?<br>We’re part of the solution.</p>



<p>It’s messy work. Cross-disciplinary. Politically thorny. Often frustrating.<br>But if we want trustworthy systems, we must build them for everyone — not just the easy users.</p>



<p>So keep asking:</p>



 
 Who’s benefiting? 



 Who’s being left out? 
 



<p>Make it explicit. Even if it’s uncomfortable.</p>



<p>What does it really mean to build for trust, in a world where truth itself is constantly contested?</p>



<p>Food for thought. And thank you for listening.</p>

<p>Real estate professionals in Canada are under increasing pressure to detect financial crime risks, verify source of funds, and document transactions with greater accuracy. This article explores how firms can modernize AML compliance and implement seamless ID and fund verification to align with new FINTRAC expectations in 2025.</p>
 
 In recent years, Canada’s real estate market has become a focal point in the country’s fight against money laundering. From the Cullen Commission in British Columbia to new enforcement guidance from FINTRAC, regulators are calling for stronger controls on source of funds (SoF) verification, politically exposed person (PEP) screening, and recordkeeping across all phases of real estate transactions. 
<p>Whether you’re a broker, law firm, developer, or mortgage specialist, the message is clear: AML in real estate is no longer optional or reactive – it must be continuous, defensible, and digitally enabled.</p>
 AML Risk in Canadian Real Estate 
<p>According to the Cullen Commission’s findings, real estate has been used extensively to launder proceeds of crime through:</p>
 
 Anonymous corporate ownership structures 
 All-cash or mortgage-free purchases 
 Layered legal or nominee arrangements 
 Limited scrutiny on source of wealth and funds 
 
<p>As a result, FINTRAC and provincial regulators now expect:</p>
 
 Identity verification of buyers, sellers, and intermediaries 
 Screening for PEPs and sanctions lists 
 Verification of source of funds for high-risk transactions 
 Retention of detailed records for compliance audits 
 
 Challenges Facing Real Estate Professionals 
<p>1. Fast-Moving Transactions<br>
Closings often occur in days, not weeks, leaving little time for thorough due diligence.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Party Workflows<br>
Agents, lawyers, lenders, and title insurers all play a role, but often lack a unified system for compliance.</p>
<p>3. Paper-Based Verification<br>
Manual document checks or emailed PDFs increase human error and audit vulnerability.</p>
<p>4. Increasing Expectations Without Clear Tools<br>
Few real estate platforms offer seamless AML functionality built-in—leaving professionals exposed.</p>
 How iComply Helps Canadian Real Estate Professionals 
<p>iComply provides a purpose-built compliance platform that streamlines real estate onboarding, risk screening, and documentation across all stakeholders.</p>
 1. Identity Verification &amp; Screening 
 
 Verify buyer, seller, or trustee identity via secure, edge-based document checks 
 Screen for sanctions, PEP status, and adverse media in real time 
 Reduce onboarding friction with a white-labeled portal 
 
 2. Source of Funds Verification 
 
 Collect proof of funds documents (bank statements, pay stubs, letters of employment) 
 Trigger enhanced due diligence for high-risk geographies or transaction sizes 
 Maintain encrypted document trails for FINTRAC review 
 
 3. Multi-Party Case Collaboration 
 
 Connect agents, lawyers, and underwriters in a single compliance file 
 Assign responsibilities and review logs within the platform 
 Avoid duplication and data leakage 
 
 4. Audit-Ready Logs and Reporting 
 
 Track all actions taken, documents reviewed, and risk decisions made 
 Export audit logs to support FINTRAC reviews or provincial regulator inspections 
 
 Case Insight: Vancouver Brokerage 
<p>A mid-sized real estate firm in Vancouver adopted iComply to improve due diligence on international buyers. Results:</p>
 
 Reduced average onboarding time by 60% 
 Detected three high-risk entities linked to offshore trusts 
 Passed a FINTRAC examination with a favourable rating 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 Mandatory SoF Checks: FINTRAC is expected to formalize source of funds verification as a standard requirement for higher-risk real estate transactions 
 Shared Responsibility Models: Regulators may clarify roles and expectations across brokers, lenders, and counsel 
 Provincial-Federal Alignment: Expect closer cooperation between real estate councils and federal AML authorities 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Real estate firms that adopt proactive AML strategies today will be best positioned to grow, protect clients, and weather increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>Speak with iComply to see how we help Canadian real estate professionals verify clients, screen for risk, and ensure every transaction is compliance-ready.</p>

<p>Identity verification is a — if not the — critical component of security, trust, and compliance across multiple global industries. From fintech and banking to gaming, crypto exchanges, healthcare and a lot more — businesses rely heavily on remote onboarding processes to bring new users onto their platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While technology and the digital economy has made these processes more seamless than ever, with convenience comes risk. One of the main threats to the integrity of the entire digital onboarding ecosystem is posed by AI-generated synthetic identities and deepfakes, which are capable of undermining even the most robust Know Your Customer (KYC) systems.</p>



 The rise of deepfakes in digital identity fraud 



<p>Deepfakes and AI-generated identities are no longer the stuff of science fiction. They are real, accessible, and alarmingly convincing. There are now many software tools out there (we’re not going to name them here) that are highly effective document/image creators — using this software, even non-technical users can now generate hyper-realistic IDs, selfies, and documents in minutes. These tools allow users to tweak lighting, facial expressions, document layouts, and other graphic and aesthetic qualities to mimic authentic identification documents and live images.</p>



<p>The implications and threats are massive — and serious. Fraudsters can now generate identities that pass KYC checks that were until only recently considered robust.. A recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-generated-passport-passed-kyc-check-real-world-failure-soltesz-g7gqf/">LinkedIn post by compliance expert Viktoria Soltesz</a> went viral when she shared how an AI-generated fake Polish passport successfully passed a real KYC verification process. This wasn’t an isolated incident — it’s a wake-up call to the industry that legacy verification systems are vulnerable to new-age synthetic identity fraud and criminals with the imagination and determination to circumvent contemporary security standards.&nbsp;</p>



 How fraudsters are exploiting generative AI 



<p>Criminals are now using AI-generated images and documents to commit identity theft, facilitate money laundering, and take over legitimate accounts. While some criminals develop deepfake identities and documents ‘in-house’, they are also readily available for sale on the dark web. The use of deepfakes by criminals is also multifaceted and not always obvious: they can be used to manipulate financial systems by layering, structuring, or smurfing funds — the process of breaking up large amounts of money into smaller parcels that can be more easily laundered into the financial system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI-generated selfies and IDs are often indistinguishable to the human eye. They may include correct document layouts, real-looking shadows, and even seemingly valid metadata. This sophistication makes manual review increasingly ineffective, especially when fraudsters experiment with hundreds of variations before finding one that successfully bypasses verification.</p>



 KYC-Chain: Advanced deepfake detection for a new threat landscape 



<p>To meet the challenge of this emerging threat, KYC-Chain has developed a multi-layered approach to detecting deepfakes and AI-generated documents. Our platform combines AI-powered image analysis, behavioral biometrics, metadata forensics, and real-time liveness detection to uncover even the most convincing forgeries.</p>



<p>Here’s how we break down and detect the deception:</p>



 Metadata Forensics 



<p>Many AI-generated files carry subtle yet identifiable inconsistencies in metadata. For example, an ID photo may lack traditional camera information or include signs of software rendering. KYC-Chain’s end-to-end onboarding platform inspects the digital fingerprints of files to uncover these anomalies. When an image’s EXIF data shows discrepancies or reveals generation tools like Photoshop or AI engines, it triggers further scrutiny.</p>







 Advanced Liveness Detection 



<p>While static images can be manipulated easily, mimicking human motion is far more difficult. KYC-Chain’s <a href="https://kyc-chain.com/introducing-kyc-chains-passive-liveness-feature/">passive liveness detection</a> employs motion-based verification, analyzing the micro-movements of the user’s face, blinking patterns, and depth cues. Deepfakes often fail to pass the reality-check here, as generated videos lack natural eye and facial muscle behavior.</p>



 AI-Trained Detection Models 



<p>We continuously update our AI detection layers with real-world examples of AI-generated fraud attempts. These models are trained to spot patterns, pixel-level anomalies, and inconsistencies that human reviewers might miss. Whether it’s unnatural skin texture, odd lighting reflections, or inconsistencies in typography on IDs, our system picks up on clues invisible to the naked eye.</p>







<p>Surprise! This is not a real person.</p>



 Multi-Factor Scoring and Escalation 



<p>KYC-Chain doesn't rely on a single red (or green) flag to provide a judgment call on an identity’s authenticity. Our system scores verification attempts across multiple layers — metadata, liveness, image consistency, MRZ validation, and behavioral cues before taking a decision to tell a compliance officer that the submitted document/selfie is fake or real.</p>



 How does it work? 



<p>KYC-Chain’s end-to-end onboarding platform can be seamlessly integrated into our clients’ APIs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The verification process itself is simple:</p>



 
 Users are prompted to upload scans of their ID document, take a selfie and submit other key KYC information.&nbsp; 



 The data is then processed through our multi-layered authentication system to identify anomalies and potential indicators of fabricated or false information.&nbsp; 



 If anomalies or inconsistencies are detected, the onboarding process is halted and a report is sent to the relevant compliance team for escalation. 
 







 Protecting businesses and consumers in the age of AI 



<p>For businesses — whether it’s a startup or a major financial institution — the consequences of failing to detect AI-driven fraud can be severe: regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and increased exposure to financial crime. For users and customers, AI-powered fraud can lead to identity theft, accounts being compromised, and privacy breaches.</p>



<p>Take a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fraud-us-government-theft-60-minutes/">recent report by CBS News</a> that quoted senior former anti-fraud officials in the US: they believe the cost of fraud to taxpayers in the country is close to US$1 trillion per year. According to the report, the reasons why fraud — in particular identity fraud — is so pervasive and widespread, is that it is not only criminal gangs that are carrying out fraud. Adversarial state actors are also carrying out fraud on an industrial scale, using it as an illegal economic weapon to extract wealth from their enemies — at the expense of both taxpayers and their governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With so many resources at fraudster’s disposal, the challenge of fighting back against them is immense. As fraudsters evolve, so must the tools to fight them. KYC-Chain is constantly developing ways to stay ahead of the curve, investing in R&amp;D and collaborating with partners across compliance, cybersecurity, and AI ethics to build the KYC, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terror Financing (CTF) systems that will ensure the integrity of the digital economy tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a world where it's becoming increasingly hard to tell what's real, trust is the most valuable currency. That’s why we're focused not just on detection, but also on prevention and education. We empower our clients to understand the risks and arm them with tools to mitigate them.</p>



<p>Whether you're a fintech startup scaling rapidly or an enterprise managing millions of verifications, your KYC strategy needs to be future-proof. Deepfakes aren’t going away — but with KYC-Chain, you can stay one step ahead.Want to see our AI deepfake detection in action? <a href="https://kyc-chain.com/demo/">Book a demo</a> today and experience the next generation of KYC protection.</p>

<p>Imagine I got a FaceTime call from my daughter right now, tears streaming down her face, desperately pleading for help. “Dada, I’m stuck somewhere. I need some money right now. I lost my wallet. Could you just send me an Apple gift card?” The voice is unmistakably hers. The face looks exactly right. My parental instincts would kick in, and the probability of me actually getting taken by it and sending her money would be very, very high. Except my daughter is safely at home, completely unaware of what just happened. I would have just become the latest victim of an AI voice cloning attack that required nothing more than a 15-second voice sample to execute.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks are happening every day, and cybersecurity experts are warning that we’re on the brink of an epidemic that will make traditional phone scams look like child’s play.</p>
 From Comedy Central to Criminal Enterprise: The Evolution of Voice Mimicry 
<p>Voice attacks aren’t new. For decades, skilled impressionists have made careers out of mimicking celebrities on Comedy Central and late-night television. Turn on your TV, go watch any stand-up comedy where people mimic the voice of somebody else. Not everybody is good at mimicry, there are a few people who are really good at it, and that’s their skill set, and they make a living out of it.</p>
<p>So, what’s the difference? What once required rare talent and years of practice can now be accomplished by anyone with a smartphone and access to AI tools.</p>
<p>You can literally take a voice sample of 20 seconds, 15 seconds, and trust me, getting a voice sample of any user is a piece of cake. You can record them in a meeting, in webinars, at conferences. Taking a voice sample of a person, feeding it into an AI engine, and having AI generate paragraphs of text in your voice couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>The technology combines voice cloning with face swapping capabilities, creating what security professionals call “deepfakes”, AI-generated content that can make anyone appear to say or do anything. Unlike the obvious robotic voices of yesterday’s scam calls, these new attacks are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>
 The Perfect Storm: Why Voice Cloning Attacks Are About to Explode 
<p>Currently, sophisticated voice cloning technology requires some technical expertise to deploy effectively. But that barrier is rapidly disappearing. But before you snap your fingers, trust me, this is going to be in the palms of every individual on this planet because they are building AI agents, voice bots, chatbots, and all of them are available as apps on your phone.</p>
<p>The democratization of AI tools means that what once required specialized knowledge will soon be as simple as downloading an app. Combined with the wealth of voice samples available through social media, video calls, and public speaking engagements, attackers will have unprecedented access to the raw materials needed for convincing impersonations.</p>
<p>Consider the attack surface: every Zoom meeting, every Instagram story, every TikTok video, every voicemail message becomes potential ammunition for cybercriminals. For public figures, executives, or anyone with an online presence, avoiding voice sample collection is virtually impossible.</p>
 From Spam Calls to Family Emergencies: The Human Cost of AI Deception 
<p>The implications extend far beyond individual financial losses. Traditional text-based scams already trick thousands of people daily with messages claiming, “I’m stuck at an airport. I need an Apple ID or gift card.” Now imagine those same scenarios playing out with the actual voice and face of a loved one making the plea.</p>
<p>Imagine what’s going to happen to all these spam calls that people have been receiving over time. Those text messages that you get, saying, “I’m stuck at an airport. I need an Apple ID or an Apple Card or a gift card,” and people fall for it. Imagine that happening in the age of AI. It’s going to be rampant.</p>
<p>The psychological impact cannot be overstated. When a scammer can perfectly replicate your child’s voice expressing genuine distress, the emotional manipulation becomes exponentially more powerful. Traditional security awareness training that teaches people to “verify before you trust” becomes significantly more challenging when the verification methods themselves can be compromised.</p>
<p>For organizations, the threat is equally severe. Help desk calls from “employees” requesting password resets, IT support requests from “executives” demanding immediate access, and vendor communications requesting urgent payment changes all become potential attack vectors when voice authentication can be spoofed with AI precision.</p>
 The $4.4 Million Question: Counting the Cost of Deepfake Breaches 
<p>While comprehensive data on AI voice cloning losses is still emerging, the broader cybersecurity landscape provides sobering context.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach"> According to IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, the average cost of a data breach has reached a record high of <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/ibm-cost-data-breach-2025/">$10.22 million for US companies</a>, while the global average was $4.44 million.</p>
<p>The reputational damage may prove even more costly. Consumer trust, once lost, can take years to rebuild. According to recent research, <a href="https://vercara.digicert.com/news/vercara-research-75-of-u-s-consumers-would-stop-purchasing-from-a-brand-if-it-suffered-a-cyber-incident">75% of consumers would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident</a>. For organizations that handle sensitive customer data or financial transactions, a successful deepfake-enabled breach could trigger regulatory investigations, class-action lawsuits, and permanent customer defection.</p>
<p>Beyond direct financial losses, there’s the operational disruption. Companies targeted by sophisticated social engineering attacks often must shut down systems, reset credentials enterprise-wide, and implement emergency security protocols that can paralyze operations for days or weeks.</p>
 Beyond Traditional Defenses: The Rise of Liveness-Based Authentication 
<p>Traditional security measures are proving inadequate against AI-powered impersonation attacks. Standard multifactor authentication, password policies, and even basic biometric systems can be circumvented when attackers can convincingly impersonate authorized users during help desk interactions.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’re addressing this challenge head-on. If somebody is using biometrics to authenticate into a system, be it face, be it voice, be it anything, if we have the ability to identify that it’s crossed a certain threshold of risk with relationship to it being a deepfake or fake or AI-generated content, we can raise those signals. Our systems then have the ability to determine the kind of access they need to provide or even prevent access altogether based on those signals.</p>
<p>The solution lies in what we call “liveness detection”, technology that can distinguish between live human interaction and AI-generated content. We’ve developed systems that combine multiple authentication factors, including live facial scanning compared against government-issued credentials, to create what I call a “risk threshold” that determines whether access should be granted.</p>
<p>We look at all the fraud signals from various factors to generate what we call a risk threshold that could tell our systems what that system should or should not do with that access request or authentication attempt. The way we have designed our platform is to ensure that all the signals that we get when a user authenticates into the system, be it video, be it live ID, be it selfie, be it a document scan, or be it voice, we analyze these signals comprehensively.</p>
<p>This marks a shift away from reactive security measures that only respond after a breach has occurred. Instead, we focus on proactive security that works to stop threats before they happen.</p>
<p>Being proactive means putting systems in place that can detect voice attacks, deepfakes, and other forms of AI-generated impersonation early in the process. That kind of prevention is becoming essential as these attacks grow more advanced.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe it’s our responsibility to help users and organizations recognize and block these threats before any damage is done. Our biometric authentication platform is built to detect signs of manipulation in real time and prevent unauthorized access based on those signals.</p>
 Building Deepfake-Resistant Organizations: The Path Forward 
<p>The window for preparation is rapidly closing. As AI voice cloning tools become more accessible and sophisticated, organizations must implement robust detection and prevention measures before they become targets.</p>
<p>The most effective defense combines technological solutions with updated security protocols. This includes implementing liveness-based biometric authentication for all system access, training staff to recognize potential deepfake scenarios, and establishing verification procedures that don’t rely solely on voice or video confirmation.</p>
<p>For individual protection, the advice is equally urgent: establish out-of-band verification methods with family members, be skeptical of urgent financial requests regardless of apparent source, and understand that if something seems emotionally manipulative, it very well might be.</p>
<p>The threat of AI voice cloning isn’t a distant future concern, it’s a present-day reality that’s about to become exponentially more dangerous. Organizations and individuals who take proactive steps now will be far better positioned to defend against the inevitable wave of sophisticated impersonation attacks heading our way.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go, but companies are recognizing that threats like this are no longer a fairytale. They are very real. We believe that identity is the entry into any organization or into any IT assets. We need to be 100 times more careful and stringent about how we do deepfake checks.</p>

 The European Union passes major regulation to allow the private sector to read eIDs via Near Field Communication. 



<p>In a significant milestone in the evolution of Europe’s digital identity framework, the European Commission has adopted <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/1208/oj/eng">Regulation (EU) 2025/1208</a>, which authorizes private sector companies to access key data stored in the chips of electronic identity documents (eIDs), most notably the bearer’s portrait (DG2) via <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">Near Field Communication (NFC)</a> technology.</p>



<p>The regulation, which amends the original Commission Decision 2025/1218, came into force on July 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With NFC, identity verification moves from passive image capture to active chip-based validation, fundamentally transforming how businesses can confirm identities across onboarding journeys.</p>



 What’s changed and why it matters. 



<p>Until recently, access to the chip on EU member states’ national ID cards and biometric passports was largely restricted to border authorities. With Regulation 2025/1208 now adopted, private entities can legally read the facial image stored in DG2, provided the holder consents, using NFC technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This opens the door to more accurate, secure, fast, and automated identity proofing across industries like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">financial services</a>, insurance, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">telecom</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/nfc-based-id-verification-shared-mobility/">mobility</a>, without compromising on privacy or regulatory integrity.</p>



 Let’s break it down: What’s in the chip? 



<p>eMRTDs (electronic Machine-Readable Travel Documents), such as biometric passports and eID cards, store personal data in a secure chip embedded in the document. This structure follows the globally recognized <a href="https://elibrary.icao.int/product/421430">ICAO 9303 standard,</a> developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which ensures interoperability and security across international borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chip’s contents are organized into Data Groups (DGs), each designed to hold specific types of information:</p>


 
 
 
 DG1: Machine-readable zone (MRZ) data (e.g. name, date of birth, document number)&nbsp; 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Retrieve electronic data from ID holder in secure way.</p>

 
 
 
 DG2: Biometric facial image (high-resolution portrait of the bearer) 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Biometric match to selfie.</p>

 
 
 
 DG3: Fingerprint data (accessible only to border and police authorities) 
 

<p>Private sector access? No.<br>Use case: Reserved for border and police use only.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>By reading the encrypted data directly from the chip, IDnow’s NFC-enabled verification confirms the authenticity and integrity of the document and the portrait photo, ensuring the person presenting it is its rightful holder.</p>

 Meet strict regulatory frameworks with confidence. 



<p>With NFC-enabled verification, businesses can:&nbsp;</p>



  Validate ID authenticity through cryptographic signatures&nbsp;  



  Verify the portrait from the chip (DG2) against a selfie or video for liveness detection&nbsp;  



  Read DG1 and DG2 simultaneously for cross-checking document and biometric consistency&nbsp;  



  Reduce false positives and manual review, accelerating onboarding&nbsp;  



<p>NFC-based identity verification isn’t just technically superior, it’s also compliant with both existing and emerging regulations:&nbsp;</p>



  National frameworks: Compliant with current schemes such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gwvideoidentv-german-financial-sector/">GWG (Germany</a>), <a href="https://www.fma.gv.at/en/financial-market-supervision-in-austria/">FMA (Austria)</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI (France)</a>, and others across the EU.&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a>: The EU’s revised digital identity regulation, requiring high-assurance identity proofing methods for Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), banks, and government services&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/future-of-amlr-identification-2027/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a>: Recently approved and set to replace national laws by mid-2027. NFC supports fully automated, risk-based identity proofing in line with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">Customer Due Diligence (CDD)</a> expectations.&nbsp;  



<p>So, whether you’re serving regulated industries or managing onboarding at scale, NFC verification gives you a future-proof foundation.</p>



 The IDnow NFC advantage. 



<p>IDnow’s NFC identity verification is already live and battle-tested across Europe, with tens of thousands of verifications processed every month.&nbsp;</p>



  Available globally: All new passports, residence permits, and national ID cards in the EU include NFC chips. Globally, most passports include this chip by default. In some regions, driving licences and other documents are also adopting chip-based formats.&nbsp;  



  Available for mobile app and mobile SDK integrations: Developer-friendly SDKs and APIs make it simple to integrate NFC into existing onboarding flows across platforms.&nbsp;  



  UX / speed: Onboarding can be completed in under one minute. Just tap the document. No manual data entry needed.&nbsp;  



  Conversion Rate: NFC onboarding shows higher success rates compared to optical scanning, thanks to improved read accuracy and fewer drop-offs.&nbsp;  



  Automation Rate: NFC verifications are fully automated, with no need for manual agent review. This accelerates onboarding and scales efficiently.&nbsp;  



  Security and data integrity: Cryptographic signature checks detect cloned or forged chips. Data is read with 100% accuracy, straight from the issuing authority.  



 NFC = No barriers to implementation. 



<p>IDnow’s NFC-enabled identity verification is available and fully compliant today. With Regulation (EU)&nbsp;2025/1208&nbsp;adopted, the private sector now has a clear legal foundation to access biometric data, such as the facial image stored on the chip of eID documents, with the user’s consent. This enables immediate integration of NFC verification into onboarding journeys.</p>



<p>Forward-thinking organizations that move early can gain a competitive edge by offering faster, more secure, and regulation-ready identity verification. Don’t wait for market-wide adoption, now is the time to optimize your onboarding flows and lead the way.</p>



 How it works: NFC-powered identity proofing, step by step. 



<p>So, what happens when a user taps their ID document with their phone? NFC-based identity verification transforms onboarding from a manual, error-prone process into a fast, secure, and fully automated journey. By reading encrypted data directly from the chip, rather than relying on photos or scans, IDnow ensures every verification is accurate, fraud-resistant, and compliant with the latest regulations.&nbsp;</p>



  Static capture: Capture the document’s MRZ to generate the key and decrypt the chip.&nbsp;  



  NFC readout: Instantly read secure data from the chip.&nbsp;  



  Selfie check: Capture a selfie for biometric face comparison and liveness detection.&nbsp;

Het anti-witwasbeleid is strenger dan ooit, maar de middelen waarmee het wordt uitgevoerd: mensen, spreadsheets, verouderde systemen zijn vaak niet meegegroeid.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine you’re checking into a hotel after a long flight. You’re tired, hungry, and just want your key. But instead of fumbling with paperwork, the receptionist simply scans your passport and boom, your details are verified, and you’re all set. No typing. No waiting. No drama.</p>
<p>That seamless experience? It’s powered by passport recognition, a rapidly evolving technology that’s rewriting how we verify identity in real time.</p>
<p>So what’s under the hood of passport recognition, and why does it matter for businesses, governments, and consumers alike? Let’s explore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Passport Recognition? 
<p>Passport recognition refers to the automated process of scanning and extracting information from a passport’s data page using computer vision and AI. It’s often part of a broader ID document recognition SDK, which can process various identity documents beyond passports, such as driver’s licenses or national IDs. It allows machines to identify and authenticate passports with high accuracy and often in seconds.</p>
<p>The core components include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) to extract name, passport number, expiry date, etc.
<p></p> 
 Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) decoding, where standardized passport data is stored.
<p></p> 
 Document validation using holograms, microprint, and UV patterns.
<p></p> 
 Face matching, comparing the passport photo to a live image or selfie.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Think of it like giving computers the ability to read and verify your passport like a border officer, only faster and with fewer errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Traditional Passport Checks Don’t Cut It Anymore 
<p>Manual passport checks are vulnerable to:</p>
 
 Human error (typos, missed fakes)
<p></p> 
 Delays at airports, hotels, or secure facilities
<p></p> 
 Fraud through forged or tampered documents
<p></p> 
 
<p>In a world where speed and security matter equally, automated passport recognition offers a compelling alternative.</p>
<p>Quick stat: According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 73% of travelers prefer to use biometrics instead of passports for identity verification. That number is growing fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Passport Recognition Technology Works 
<p>Let’s lift the hood and see how the magic happens.</p>
 Step-by-Step Passport Recognition Process: 



Step
Description


1. Image Capture
A camera or mobile device captures the passport’s data page.


2. MRZ Detection
The system locates and isolates the machine-readable zone.


3. OCR Extraction
Characters from the MRZ and other fields are read via OCR.


4. Data Validation
The system checks for authenticity: font, format, expiry date, etc.


5. Face Match (Optional)
Compares the passport photo with a live selfie or stored biometric.



<p>With today’s advanced AI, the whole recognition flow wraps up in under three seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passport Recognition vs Traditional OCR: What’s the Difference? 



Feature

Passport Recognition


Accuracy
85–90%
97–99%


Security Features
None
Validates holograms, UV, microprinting


Facial Biometrics

<p>Passport recognition is not just OCR on steroids it’s an entirely smarter approach built for identity assurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Industries Benefiting from Passport Recognition 
<p>From airports to Airbnb, industries across the board are embedding this technology into their platforms. Here’s where it’s making waves:</p>
  Travel &amp; Border Control 
 
 Automated border gates (e-gates)
<p></p> 
 Self-check-in kiosks
<p></p> 
 Immigration pre-screening
<p></p> 
 
<p>“With passport recognition, airports can reduce processing time by up to 40% during peak hours.” SITA Air Transport IT Insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Healthcare &amp; Insurance 
 
 ID verification during telehealth appointments
<p></p> 
 Onboarding for digital health insurance
<p></p> 
 Prescription fraud prevention
<p></p> 
 
  Banking &amp; Fintech 
 
 KYC during account registration
<p></p> 
 Cross-border remittance validation
<p></p> 
 Preventing identity fraud in loan applications
<p></p> 
 
  Hospitality &amp; Rentals 
 
 Faster hotel check-ins
<p></p> 
 ID verification for short-term rental platforms (e.g., Airbnb)
<p></p> 
 VIP loyalty programs linked to passport data
<p></p> 
 
  Education &amp; Exams 
 
 Verifying student ID for international admissions
<p></p> 
 Securing online proctoring systems
<p></p> 
 
<p>The bottom line? If you deal with real humans and legal identity documents, passport recognition can tighten your security and smooth your UX.</p>
<p></p>
 The Power of Passport Recognition + Face Verification 
<p>On its own, passport recognition is impressive. But pair it with face verification, and the security multiplies.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 User scans their passport using a smartphone or webcam.
<p></p> 
 System extracts data and photo from the passport.
<p></p> 
 User takes a selfie or a live video.
<p></p> 
 The system uses AI to verify the passport photo against a real-time selfie.
<p></p> 
 Verification result is returned within seconds.
<p></p> 
 
<p>This combo stops impostors in their tracks, including those armed with stolen documents or digital fakes.</p>
<p> Bonus Tip: Want higher fraud resistance? Add <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">id document liveness detection SDK</a> capabilities to confirm the person behind the document is physically present not a still image or a video spoof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Using Passport Recognition in 2025 
<p>Let’s get specific about the benefits:</p>
  Speed 
<p>Verifies documents in under 3 seconds. Perfect for high-traffic systems and instant KYC.</p>
  Accuracy 
<p>Uses deep learning and AI to extract data with up to 99% accuracy even from worn or wrinkled documents.</p>
  Compliance 
<p>Helps meet global identity regulations like:</p>
 
 <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (Europe)
<p></p> 
 eIDAS (EU)
<p></p> 
 KYC/AML (Global finance)
<p></p> 
 HIPAA (U.S. Healthcare)
<p></p> 
 
  User Experience 
<p>No long forms. No typos. No delays.</p>
<p>Just scan, verify, done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Case Study: How Banks Use Passport Recognition 
<p>A leading European neobank integrated passport recognition into its digital onboarding.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
 
 Manual ID verification took 6–12 hours
<p></p> 
 20% drop-off due to long wait times
<p></p> 
 
<p>After:</p>
 
 Verification in under 60 seconds
<p></p> 
 Conversion rate improved by 37%
<p></p> 
 Fraud attempts decreased by 45%
<p></p> 
 
<p>Talk about ROI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges to Watch Out For 
<p>While powerful, passport recognition isn’t without its hurdles.</p>
  Low-Quality Images 
<p>Crinkled pages, bad lighting, or glare can cause recognition failures. Always guide users to scan in good light.</p>
  Document Forgery 
<p>Some fake passports can bypass simple OCR-only systems. That’s why layered security with AI, facial matching, and liveness detection is a must.</p>
  Device Limitations 
<p>Older mobile devices may struggle with camera quality. Make sure your SDK supports fallback options or minimum device specs.</p>
<p></p>
 Choosing the Right Passport Recognition SDK 
<p>Not all tools are created equal. Here’s what to look for in a solid passport recognition solution:</p>
 
  MRZ extraction &amp; validation
<p></p> 
  Face matching capability
<p></p> 
  Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
<p></p> 
  Real-time results (&lt; 3 seconds)
<p></p> 
  Built-in compliance (GDPR, KYC, AML)
<p></p> 
  Developer documentation &amp; SDK support
<p></p> 
 
<p>Some top players also include open-source demo tools, sample UIs, and REST APIs to make integration smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that technology, when put to good use, has the power to transform lives and communities. That’s why, when <a href="https://www.bell.ca/">Bell Canada</a>, one of our valued customers and a longstanding champion of youth mental health, invited us to join their annual fundraising golf tournament for <a href="https://kidshelpphone.ca/">Kids Help Phone</a>, we enthusiastically accepted.</p>
 More Than a Game: An Event with Impact 
<p>Every year, Bell Canada brings together the brightest minds from across IT, InfoSec, Fraud, and business leadership for an event that’s about so much more than golf. This gathering is the single most critical fundraising event for Kids Help Phone, the national organization at the forefront of supporting youth in crisis. As the only 24/7 e-mental health service for young people in Canada, Kids Help Phone provides an essential lifeline to children and teens, many of whom have no other support system.</p>

For some, Kids Help Phone is their only resource in moments of vulnerability, fear, or confusion. This statistic underscores the vital importance of the organization’s work, and why sustained support matters.</p>
 Partnering for Good 
<p>For 1Kosmos, participation in this event went far beyond sponsorship. It represented an opportunity to walk alongside Bell Canada in championing cybersecurity, mental wellness, and community care, pillars that are deeply aligned with our own values. It was inspiring to connect with leaders and teams from across the technology spectrum, all united by the goal of uplifting youth and shaping a safer, more supportive future.</p>
 Thank You, Bell Canada and Kids Help Phone 
<p>We extend our deepest thanks to Bell Canada for their vision and leadership in supporting Kids Help Phone, and to the tireless staff and volunteers who make a real difference in the lives of young Canadians every day.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we look forward to continuing our partnership and our shared commitment to protect, empower, and uplift, on and off the golf course.</p>

			 Apex Digital 3.0 is Live – The Future of Finance Starts Now 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>To truly scale tokenisation, we need a global force at the heart of capital markets. A player with the reach, trust, and operational strength to be able to bring all stakeholders out of fragmented and manual systems into the future of on-chain finance.</p>
<p>That player is Apex Group.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Apex Group launched Apex Digital 3.0, the digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges traditional finance with on-chain finance at scale.</p>
<p>This is a turning point for our industry. Apex Digital 3.0 is not a product, it’s a movement to transform global finance, redefine distribution, and unlock liquidity. For the first time, a global asset servicer now offers blockchain-powered infrastructure for tokenisation and stablecoins, covering everything from regulatory setup, structuring to issuance, compliance, servicing, and global distribution.</p>
<p>In today’s market, launching a tokenised product is slow and fragmented. Issuers must juggle multiple providers, face regulatory complexity, and often wait months, only to end up with limited liquidity and poor distribution. It’s impossible to scale that way.</p>
<p>With Apex Digital 3.0, we’ve changed the game. Everything is integrated. Tokenising existing assets or natively issuing ones on-chain can be done within a few weeks. What’s more, Apex Group clients, who already entrust them to operate over $3.5 trillion in assets, can now move on-chain seamlessly, without changing the tools or workflows they know.</p>
<p>To them, it simply feels like an upgrade, and they will gain new capabilities. It includes 24/7 subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers; access to multiple secondary trading venues and borrowing or lending in a real-time DeFi application. No disruption. Just a next-generation investor experience.</p>
<p>What truly sets Apex Digital 3.0 apart is its ability to bring all stakeholders together, including issuers, investors, allocators, and distributors. Tokenised assets can connect directly with existing investor pools, including through multiple distribution channels and physical events like Apex Invest. This dramatically enhances both liquidity and distribution, solving one of the most critical and long-missing pieces in the industry.</p>
<p>Tokenisation finally works, at scale. Tokeny’s technology is the foundation of this transformation. We’re delivering blockchain capability that integrates across the entire value chain and fund lifecycle, enhancing the experience and value for all of Apex Group’s clients.</p>
<p>Daniel and Luc are proud to be appointed to lead Apex Digital 3.0, powered by the full strength of the Tokeny team. Our mission becomes bigger: To transform financial markets and unlock access for all. Just as Microsoft put a computer on every desk, we’re building the digital infrastructure to put private assets in every portfolio, bringing the future of finance to everyone.</p>
<p>This marks a brand new chapter, and we’re proud to be writing it with you!</p>

 1. Can I have confidence to hold&nbsp;Aergo?   Confidence should be grounded in understanding the current direction and internal activity of the&nbsp;project.  Aergo has undergone major changes and is now transitioning into HPP (House Party Protocol), a more modern and AI-aligned infrastructure.  A Living Roadmap is actively maintained, offering transparent updates about progress, team deliverables, and launch timelines.  Investors are encouraged to review the roadmap and evaluate their belief in the foundation’s vision.   2. Why migrate from Aergo to&nbsp;HPP?   A major community governance vote in March 2025 (AIP-21) resulted in overwhelming support for migrating Aergo into HPP, representing a new direction.  The goal of HPP is to modernize the infrastructure, introduce AI-native functionality, and align with current market needs, particularly in areas such as modular architecture, agent-based execution, and scalability.  HPP maintains the legacy of Aergo while positioning the ecosystem for growth in the next 3–5&nbsp;years.  The community vote saw near-unanimous support and had higher participation than many larger market-cap projects.   3. How will the token migration from Aergo to HPP work on exchanges?   The migration process is exchange-dependent. Each exchange may handle the conversion differently (e.g., automatic swap, opt-in, withdrawal only).  The team is working closely with major partners and will provide detailed guidance as each exchange finalizes its&nbsp;plan.  Community members should stay tuned on official channels (Telegram, X) for updates related to their preferred platforms.   4. When is HPP mainnet launching?   The public mainnet is targeted for Q3 2025, which is ~3 months earlier than initially projected in the March&nbsp;AIP.  The testnet has already been completed, and the private mainnet is now live, with developer tools being actively rolled&nbsp;out.  The team is deliberately not announcing an exact date to maintain flexibility and ensure&nbsp;quality.  Rushed deadlines can cause avoidable bugs and quality&nbsp;issues.  Precise dates can lead to price manipulation through derivatives trading or “sell-the-news” behavior.   5. Why keep the launch date&nbsp;private?   HPP is a digital product, not constrained by logistics like physical goods or theater releases.  A flexible launch date allows for rigorous QA and performance testing before going&nbsp;live.  Avoiding a public date also prevents speculative volatility, as many traders use fixed timelines for leverage and price&nbsp;swings.  The team prioritizes quality and stability over&nbsp;hype.   6. When is Booost launching on&nbsp;HPP?   Booost is already deployed on testnet and is currently running on the private&nbsp;mainnet.  While technically live, its public launch is imminent, pending final readiness checks.  Booost’s integration is a key milestone in showcasing HPP’s support for identity verification and anti-deepfake primitives.   7. What is VaasBlock building on&nbsp;HPP?   VaasBlock is building W3DB.io, a Web3-native intelligence and verification platform.  Think of it as a cross between IMDB, Crunchbase, and CoinMarketCap, focusing on projects and individuals.  Community members can contribute by: verifying project and team data, training AI models, and tagging and labeling datasets.  In return, they can earn token&nbsp;rewards.  HPP was selected as the base layer due to its multi-chain design, existing exchange access, and built-in support for AI-integrated workflows   8. What’s the “next big news” that could make Aergo&nbsp;pop?   The community member’s question assumes a correlation between announcements and price, but this is rare unless connected to major macro headlines or&nbsp;figures.  That said, the HPP mainnet launch is arguably the most significant upcoming milestone in terms of long-term fundamentals.  However, no one can guarantee whether it will result in a price “pop” — and speculation shouldn’t drive strategic decisions.   9. Why is engagement low? What about marketing?   A community member voiced concerns about low social media engagement and marketing visibility.  The team responded with the following key points:<br>1) HPP does not engage in artificial engagement tactics like bots or paid shill armies.<br>2) Most projects with unusually high engagement have manipulated metrics, which don’t reflect real community or product traction.<br>3) VaasBlock uses a marketing effectiveness score that evaluates campaigns based on their actual impact (price, volume, etc.) rather than vanity&nbsp;metrics.  According to that model, Aergo/HPP ranks in the top 20% of current Web3 projects.  The team is focused on building lasting value, not temporary hype.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-19-token-roadmap-and-exchange-fb4486211a7d">[Aergo Talks #19] Token, Roadmap, and Exchange</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>U.S. nonprofits must now comply with AML regulations that require verifying partner organizations, grantees, and key stakeholders. This article explores how NGOs can implement efficient KYB workflows that support transparency and risk management – without compromising mission alignment or donor confidence.</p>
 
 Nonprofits and NGOs operating in the United States are increasingly being drawn into the regulatory spotlight. While historically exempt from many financial compliance requirements, today’s nonprofits – especially those with international operations, grant-making activities, or large donation flows—must now consider how to comply with know-your-business (KYB) and AML standards. 
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have flagged the misuse of charitable organizations as a financial crime risk, prompting increased expectations for due diligence and transparency.</p>
 AML Expectations for U.S. NGOs in 2025 
<p>Although not all nonprofits fall under Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations, those that:</p>
 
 Partner with foreign NGOs 
 Disburse grants or funds abroad 
 Receive high-risk donations or funding 
 Operate in or near sanctioned jurisdictions 
 
<p>…are expected to implement stronger controls for:</p>
 
 Beneficial ownership checks of partners and grantees 
 Screening for PEPs, sanctions, and adverse media 
 Documentation of financial flows and governance structures 
 
<p>Many large donors and financial institutions now require NGOs to demonstrate AML and KYB compliance as part of their funding eligibility or banking relationships.</p>
 Key Challenges for Nonprofits 
<p>1. Mission vs. Compliance Tension<br>
Nonprofits often fear that intrusive checks could alienate partners or deter grassroots engagement.</p>
<p>2. Resource Constraints<br>
Lean teams and limited budgets make enterprise-grade compliance tools impractical.</p>
<p>3. Complex Partnership Networks<br>
Sub-grantees and foreign affiliates may operate with different legal, cultural, or documentation norms.</p>
<p>4. Donor and Reputational Risk<br>
Failure to vet grantees properly could result in diverted funds, scandal, or funding suspension.</p>
 How iComply Supports KYB for Nonprofits 
<p>iComply offers a configurable KYB solution tailored to the needs of donor-driven and mission-aligned organizations.</p>
 1. Entity Verification for Partners and Grantees 
 
 Validate EINs, incorporation status, and legal representatives 
 Confirm banking and operational legitimacy 
 Request and review key documentation (bylaws, governance structures, etc.) 
 
 2. UBO Discovery and Risk Screening 
 
 Identify the real owners or controllers of partner organizations 
 Screen individuals and entities against OFAC and international sanctions lists 
 Flag politically exposed persons and adverse media links 
 
 3. Low-Friction Onboarding 
 
 Send white-labeled onboarding requests to partners and affiliates 
 Guide users through structured KYB flows without requiring technical expertise 
 Preserve relationship integrity with customizable language and guidance 
 
 4. Risk-Based Review and Recordkeeping 
 
 Automate risk scoring and escalation rules 
 Maintain audit-ready logs of verification outcomes and partner engagements 
 Export data for funders, auditors, or internal governance reviews 
 
 Case Insight: Global Health NGO Based in DC 
<p>A U.S.-based nonprofit distributing grants in Latin America implemented iComply’s KYB workflows for vetting sub-recipients. In less than 8 weeks:</p>

				  Indicio’s flagship product supports the issuance, holding, and verification of SD-JWT VCs, Europe’s choice of Verifiable Credential for privacy-preserving digital identity in the European Union Digital Wallet (EUDI).  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>By 2026, the European Union has mandated that every member country provide its citizens, residents, and businesses with a secure, interoperable digital wallet so that they can use Verifiable Credentials to prove who they are and share information across borders, platforms, and services, online and offline, across all EU member states.</p>
<p>For its Verifiable Credential format, the EU will use SD-JWT VCs.</p>
 What is&nbsp; SD-JWT VC? 
<p>The acronym stands for Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token Verifiable Credential. </p>
<p>A JSON Web Token is a standardized way to share digitally-signed information between parties. Selective disclosure means that this information can be shared selectively, thereby enabling a party to restrict the data they share to the specifics needed for a given purpose. Verifiable credential means the JWT includes the specific data formats as well as validation and processing rules required to express Verifiable Credentials.</p>
 Why is this important? 
<p>Simply put, it enables data privacy and increases security.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand this is by looking at how we share information to access resources using physical credentials, like a driver’s license.</p>
<p>To verify age for purchasing an age-restricted item, a person would present a physical ID that contained their date of birth, typically a driver’s license, passport, or national ID card. But in presenting that ID, the person verifying it would be able to see all the personal data on the ID. </p>
<p>In an age of identity theft, this is no longer tenable. But it is also unacceptable in terms of data privacy. Selective disclosure is non-negotiable for the European Union. EU data privacy law —&nbsp;GDPR —&nbsp;requires organizations minimize the data they collect, process, and store to fulfill a specific purpose; selective disclosure makes minimization easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to issue and verify SD-JWT Verifiable Credentials with Indicio Proven</p>
<p>Access Indicio Proven, either using its interface or its API, and connect your existing IAM, CRM, HR software, identity provider, API, or database. Select the SD-JWT VC from the menu and start issuing credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven’s verifier software automatically accepts SD-JWT VCs, so you have&nbsp; immediate interoperability with all EU digital wallets..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Why go with Indicio Proven for your EU credential solution? 
<p>Indicio was the first to demonstrate interoperability between SD-JWT VC and AnonCreds credentials in a single workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll shortly enable similar interoperability with mdoc/mDL and W3C VC credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, if you want to interoperate globally, Proven has proved itself in the real world.</p>
<p>There are two other important reasons for choosing Indicio Proven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It enables you to scale rapidly to any level of issuance or verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has the most powerful governance solution in the marketplace, allowing you to easily orchestrate credential roles, trust lists, and workflows in hierarchical ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because governance is cached as a machine-readable file for each credential issuer, holder, and verifier, offline verification is possible using BLE, NFC, or Wifi Aware.</p>

 The Rising Threat of Candidate Fraud  
<p>Remote work has drastically changed hiring, unintentionally creating new opportunities for fraud. Reports indicate a significant jump in fraudulent activity, with some analyses suggesting one in six applicants for remote roles show signs of fraud. Experts project that by 2028, AI-generated job applicant profiles could account for one in four candidates globally. This surge in remote onboarding fraud poses serious threats, including financial losses, security risks, and legal issues. To combat this, strong identity verification is now essential for modern fraud prevention.</p> 
<p></p> 
<br> 
  
 Types of Candidate Fraud: Breaking Down the Tactics  
<p>Fraudsters use various clever methods to get into organizations. Understanding these tactics is key to building effective defenses.</p> 
  
  Fake Qualifications Fraud: This involves candidates fabricating resumes, exaggerating qualifications, or providing false references to secure a job they're not fit for. This can include inventing work histories or boosting grades.  
  Synthetic Identity Fraud: A more advanced technique, where fraudsters combine real and made-up personal information to create a new, seemingly legitimate identity. This makes detection harder for standard background checks.  
  Deepfake-based Impersonation: Leveraging AI, fraudsters generate realistic video and voice simulations to impersonate real people during video interviews, making it very difficult to tell if the person is genuine.  
  Stolen Identity: Criminals steal legitimate job seekers' personal data and use it to apply for jobs and pass checks. This victimizes the individual whose identity is stolen and risks the hiring company onboarding a malicious person.  
  
<p></p> 
 Understanding the Business Implications of Candidate Fraud  
<p>The fallout from candidate fraud goes far beyond just a bad hire, affecting many different parts of a business.</p> 
  
  Financial Losses: Bringing on unqualified individuals can lead to lower productivity, mistakes, and potential financial liabilities due to misconduct or poor performance, directly hitting your company's bottom line.  
  Reputational Damage: If it comes out that your company hired people with fake credentials or if fraudulent activity becomes public, it can severely damage trust among clients, partners, and the general public, harming your brand's reputation.  
  Legal and Regulatory Noncompliance: Failing to properly check candidates can lead to not following industry-specific rules and data protection laws, resulting in significant legal penalties and hefty fines.  
  Security Breaches: Fraudulent employees, especially those with bad intentions, pose a direct risk of data theft, loss of intellectual property, or other critical security breaches that can have devastating effects on your organization.  
  Operational Disruption: Having unqualified or fraudulent staff can disrupt workflows, require expensive extra training, and lead to higher employee turnover, all of which hinder efficient business operations and how you use your resources.  
  
 Hiring Fraud Prevention Tactics for Human Resources  
<p>To effectively fight the growing problem of candidate fraud, HR departments need to adopt proactive and strong prevention strategies.</p> 
 Implement a Top-Notch Identity Verification Solution That Follows Best Practices  
<p>Putting a comprehensive identity verification solution in place is absolutely crucial. Such a solution should simplify and automate identity-proofing processes, offer additional re-verification steps at important moments, and accurately verify identities while balancing strict security with ease of use for candidates. This includes verifying candidates during onboarding.</p> 
 Stronger Interviewing Techniques  
<p>Go beyond basic interviews and add more advanced methods:</p> 
  
  Conduct live technical assessments to truly verify claimed skills.  
  Make video interviews mandatory and use technology to check for deepfakes and AI-generated voice simulations.  
  Cross-check social media profiles for anything odd or inconsistent with the information provided.  
  
 Background Screening Enhancements  
<p>Boost your background screening processes:</p> 
  
  Use reputable third-party background check providers that employ advanced fraud detection techniques.  
  Consider continuous employee monitoring even after the initial onboarding to spot any suspicious behavior or changes.  
  
 Use Zero Trust &amp; Identity Security During Hiring<br>  
  
  It's time to team up with your security crew and embed cutting-edge zero trust and identity security into your entire hiring pipeline. This powerful partnership creates a proactive defense against fraud right from the start.  
  Ditch those old-school passwords. They're a major weak spot for phishing and brute-force attacks. By embracing passwordless methods like biometrics or FIDO passkeys, you slam the door on fraudsters trying to steal credentials to access your systems.  
  Then, supercharge your verification with zero trust principles and FIDO passkeys. The core idea is simple but revolutionary: "never trust, always verify". Every single access request is questioned until it's proven legitimate. This enables continuous authentication, so even if a bad actor slips through the cracks initially, their movements are instantly flagged and restricted. FIDO passkeys are the perfect tool for this, providing a highly secure and slick way to ensure only the verified individual can advance at every step of the hiring journey.&nbsp;  
  
<p></p> 
 Candidate Fraud Real-World Cases  
<p>The threat of candidate fraud isn't just theoretical; it has real, tangible consequences for businesses worldwide. These aren't isolated incidents but a growing trend that highlights the critical need for advanced identity verification and constant vigilance.</p> 
<p>The HYPR blog post, "<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">HYPR Unmasks a Fake IT Worker: North Korea Isn't the Only Threat</a>," shares a firsthand account of how HYPR successfully stopped a potential fraud attempt involving a highly sophisticated impersonator. This incident clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of robust identity verification in a real-world situation. The fraudster presented a convincing resume and tried to mimic legitimate behavior, but HYPR's system was able to detect the deception, preventing a potentially damaging security breach.</p> 
<p>Beyond individual cases, broader patterns of hiring fraud illustrate the severity of the problem:</p> 
 The North Korean IT Worker Scheme  
<p>Reports detail how fraudulent IT workers, sometimes linked to state-sponsored activities, infiltrate companies using fake identities. They pose as remote software engineers, using fake profiles and stolen identities to gain employment. These schemes often aim to steal data or funnel illicit wages back to their countries, posing both financial and national security risks.</p> 
 Financial Sector Impersonation  
<p>The financial sector has seen cases where individuals with false credentials or stolen identities gained access to critical systems. Such incidents lead to significant financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Impersonators might use fake certifications to get roles in sensitive departments, then exploit their access for fraud or data theft.</p> 
 The Rise of AI-Generated Resumes  
<p>With generative AI tools, companies now regularly encounter applicants submitting entirely computer-generated resumes and cover letters that are hard to distinguish from genuine ones. Additionally, deepfake technology enables interview fraud where candidates use AI to create convincing video and voice simulations for remote interviews, making it difficult to identify genuine candidates.</p> 
 Protect Your Business Against Hiring Fraud with HYPR Affirm  
<p>Strong authentication and verification processes are no longer just an option; they’re an absolute necessity. Hiring fraud is constantly evolving, with new and more sophisticated tactics emerging daily. Traditional background checks and manual verification methods simply aren’t enough to keep pace with the cleverness of modern fraudsters.</p> 
<p>This is precisely where a dedicated, robust identity verification solution like HYPR Affirm becomes indispensable. HYPR Affirm is specifically designed to prevent candidate fraud by confirming the true identity of every applicant, right from the initial application stage through to onboarding.

  Document Verification: Authenticating government-issued IDs, passports, and other official documents for signs of tampering or forgery, ensuring their legitimacy.  
  Liveness Detection: Ensuring that the person presenting the identity is a real, live individual and not a spoof, a photograph, or a sophisticated deepfake.  
  Location: Verifying the candidate's physical location against expected or declared information to detect inconsistencies that may signal fraud.  
  Manager Attestation: Enabling a step-up escalation for complex cases by allowing a manager or help desk agent to conduct a live chat and video call for final verification.  
  
<p>HYPR Affirm verifies candidates at critical touchpoints throughout the hiring journey, creating a formidable barrier against deception. This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risks associated with various types of fraud, including:</p> 
  
  Synthetic identities: By cross-referencing multiple data points and using advanced algorithms to detect fabricated personal details.  
  Deepfake impersonations: By employing sophisticated liveness detection and forensic analysis during video interactions to ensure the person on screen is genuinely real.  
  Stolen credentials: By verifying that the individual applying is indeed the legitimate holder of the presented identity documents.  
  
<p>This comprehensive approach safeguards your entire hiring process, shielding your business from the profound consequences of financial loss, potentially devastating security breaches, and irreparable damage to your reputation. With HYPR Affirm, you can confidently build your team, knowing that you're bringing on genuine talent, not an elaborate deception.</p> 
 Key Takeaways  
  
  Candidate fraud is a growing danger, made worse by remote hiring, leading to significant financial losses and security vulnerabilities.  
  Fraudsters use many different methods, including fake qualifications, synthetic identities, deepfake technology, and stolen personal data.  
  The business implications are severe, covering financial losses, harm to reputation, legal non-compliance, and security breaches.  
  Implementing a comprehensive identity verification solution, improving interviewing techniques, enhancing background checks, and adopting zero trust principles are all crucial for effective prevention.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>Candidate fraud, increasingly fueled by remote hiring and sophisticated tactics like deepfakes, poses significant financial, reputational, and security risks to businesses. Combating this evolving threat requires a multi-faceted approach, including robust identity verification, improved interviewing techniques, enhanced background checks, and a strong zero-trust security posture.</p> 
<p>This is where HYPR Affirm comes in, offering a powerful defense. It provides deterministic, high-fidelity identity proofing to ensure that only verified individuals join your team.

  ‘STEM for ALL’ : Thales Joins the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Programme 
prezly

Thu, 07/31/2025 - 14:52


             
 As a Sponsoring Organisation with SgIS, Thales will provide Singaporean undergraduate students scholarships in a comprehensive programme that includes internship, mentoring and a starting career with Thales.  
 With this initiative, Thales is extending its ‘STEM for ALL’ programme to Singapore, the first launch outside Europe, with its dedicated mission to advance STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education amongst youth. 
 In its inaugural intake, four nominated scholars will undertake engineering or research roles in strategic sectors including air traffic management, public security, cybersecurity and digital identity, working within Thales businesses and research labs like the Thales Digital Factory. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 
©&nbsp;Thales

<p>With engineers comprising one-third of Thales Singapore’s 2000+ employees, the Group has a strong interest in promoting STEM education and growing the next generation of engineering talent. On 29th July, Thales was proud to join SgIS as a Sponsorship Organisation at its launch event and to present awards to the scholars, aligning with the government’s mandate to develop young talent in Singapore’s strategic sectors. </p>
<p>Established in 2012, SgIS is an initiative which partners government and industries to nurture a strong core of Singaporean talent in 16 strategic industries which include Aerospace &amp; Aviation and Engineering. It is the only government-led, multi-industry scholarship under the Ministry of Education which provides talented Singaporean students access to close to 150 Sponsoring Organisations, giving them development opportunities as they further their studies and begin their professional careers. </p>
<p>Throughout May and June, over 100 potential candidates with diverse skillsets were introduced to Thales by SgIS and invited to an Open Day to get to know Thales’ businesses. From this, over 40 were taken through rigorous technical assessments, following which 12 were further shortlisted for panel interviews with Thales experts and business leaders to further assess their technical expertise and leadership attributes. </p>
<p>Four talented candidates from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) were the final recipients of the Thales award.

  <p>Digital applications constantly deal with identities. It’s important to verify identity at the application’s front door through authentication. Several mature and sophisticated techniques and standards for user authentication, such as <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)</a>, allow a trusted identity provider (IDP) to securely authenticate the user before allowing access to an application.</p>

<p>However, front door authentication is not the only context in which identities must be verified.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
 
   Update your email address through a bank’s customer service 
   Recover the userID/password through HelpDesk 
   Securely perform a transaction at a retail Point of Sale (POS) system 
   Authenticate with browser-constrained devices, such as smart speakers 
   Authenticate from a shared kiosk 
 

<p>In each of the above cases, though the identities need to be verified, it might not be possible or appropriate to have the user perform authentication through an interactive login interface such as a web browser.</p>

 How applications handle identity verification today 

<p>While it’s popular to leverage secure IDP and standards to provide initial authentication through a login interface, identity verification in places such as above is built in an ad hoc manner. Depending on design, some applications do this inefficiently with a terrible customer experience, while others are less secure and vulnerable.</p>

 Let’s step through identity verification scenarios 

<p>Consider identity verification needs where you can’t rely on a traditional user authentication process, such as when multiple parties or browser-constrained systems are involved. Let’s examine those cases and identify identity security pitfalls.</p>

 Update email address for bank accounts 

<p>Consider a user calls customer service to update the email address associated with their bank account. Often, the helpline personnel ask the user for certain personally identifiable information ( PII) answers such as last name, date of birth, and last 4 digits of social security number. Upon verification, the helpline personnel updates the email address through the customer care application, which performs privileged operations on the bank’s identity database to change the user record.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are problems with the approach.</p>

<p>First, the customer experience is not great. The customer also needs to provide PII information for verification, which an attacker can guess or obtain using <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/social_engineering">social engineering</a>. This can easily lead to an account takeover, where a fraudulent actor can successfully pass the verifications and infiltrate the account with a new email ID.
The second issue is that the customer care application needs to change the user profile from the backend without authentication. The application would typically use powerful credentials to perform such a privileged operation. For example, an application can obtain and use a token with user management privileges to call the user update API. Such a token allows updating user accounts in the banking system directory, but it can be misused if the token leaks.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to get some form of token that provides the application with just enough privilege to update only the calling user profile? That way, it could adhere to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege">least privilege</a> principle of security.</p>

 Point of Sale (POS) payment 

<p>This is another interesting scenario. When a user tries to pay in the retail Point of Sale (POS) system with a bank account, they won’t be comfortable signing in to their bank account on a shared device and providing their credentials.</p>

<p>Instead, it would be ideal if the POS system allowed secure payments with an alternative form of verification, where the user does not need to provide their credentials in a public system!</p>

<p>Can we do something to decouple user authentication from the application?</p>

 Use CIBA to verify identity transactions securely and consistently 

<p>The idea is to decouple authentication from the application so that it can be initiated on one device and verified on another. Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) allows exactly that separation.</p>

<p>CIBA is a relatively new authentication flow based on <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> in which the client can initiate an interaction flow to authenticate the users without having end-user interaction from the consumption device. The flow involves back-channel communication from the client to the OAuth 2.0 authorization provider without redirecting through the user’s browser (consumption device). The authentication would be verified independently from a separate authentication device, such as a phone or smartwatch, in possession of the user and securely enrolled with the provider.</p>

 CIBA enables a smooth authentication experience 

<p>Consider the following flow for our banking email address use case.</p>

<p></p>

 
   The customer care application initiates an authentication event for the user. It sends a direct CIBA request to the authorization server. 
   Unlike a regular login page, the user is redirected to, the authorization server sends a push notification to the user’s phone. 
   The authorization server is notified when the user accepts the notification on her phone/smartwatch. 
   The authorization server then issues a user token to the application. The application uses the user-scoped token to complete the target operation, which is updating the email address. 
 

<p>A few benefits of this approach are:</p>
 
   The user experience becomes smoother during verification. It also can instill confidence in users that the system operates securely. 
   Push notification offers higher security than other out-of-band user authentication methods, such as SMS one-time code (OTP). 
   The application token can be narrowly scoped to the user, providing the least privileged access. 
 

<p>Here is a simplified flow of a transaction using CIBA.</p>

<p></p>

 CIBA builds upon OAuth 2.0 and OIDC 

<p>CIBA is an extension on top of OIDC, which itself is based on the OAuth 2.0 framework. It brings in a new OAuth 2.0 grant type in the family: <code>urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba</code>. As customary with the OIDC discovery endpoint, CIBA introduces additional metadata parameters, such as <code>backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported</code> and <code>backchannel_authentication_endpoint</code>. The discovery document payload looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "issuer": "...",
    "authorization_endpoint": ".../authorize",
    "token_endpoint": ".../token",
    "userinfo_endpoint": ".../userinfo",
    "jwks_uri": "...",
    "grant_types_supported":[
      "authorization_code",
      "refresh_token",
      "password",
      "urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba"
    ],
    "backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported":["poll", "ping", "push"],
    "backchannel_authentication_endpoint": "",
    ....
}

</code>   

<p>The <code>backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported</code> parameter needs some additional commentary. The specification defines three different modes of notifying the client about the completion of authentication.</p>
 
   Poll: In this mode, the client keeps polling the authorization server until the authentication is complete or the event times out. In case of successful authentication, the final poll returns the tokens to the application. This mode is the simplest and easiest to implement. 
   Ping: When the authentication is complete, it will call back to a registered URL of the client, notifying the status. The client makes a request to the authorization server for tokens. 
   Push: When the authentication is complete, it will call back to the client’s registered URL with the tokens. 
 

<p>Ping and Push modes are more complex to implement and need additional metadata and implementation steps on the client side. However, it saves network trips caused by the polling cycle.</p>

<p>Since the CIBA request uses a back-channel, it must contain a parameter that the authorization server can use to identify the user. Typically, the parameter is supplied using the <code>login_hint</code> or <code>id_token_hint parameter</code> of the request.</p>

<p>The authentication device performs out-of-band authentication instead of the traditional authentication flow, where the client interacts with the authorization server sequentially. In practical implementations, it would be a push notification to a device such as a phone or smartwatch. The device needs to be securely registered to the authorization server for the user so that it knows where to send the authorization request. The push notification can be delivered by embedding the mechanism in the application’s mobile application or using a companion authenticator application.</p>

 Security considerations when using CIBA 

<p>CIBA is vulnerable to attacks akin to an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mfa-fatigue-hackers-new-favorite-tactic-in-high-profile-breaches/#google_vignette">MFA fatigue attack</a>. Consider the case where an attacker guesses a user ID or infiltrates a user account and repeatedly attempts to carry out a sensitive transaction implemented using CIBA authorization. The real user might get overwhelmed by repeated push notifications and accept one.</p>

<p>A related scenario is when the attacker has a list of user IDs and initiates transactions for each. While most users would ignore the push prompt, a small percentage could approve the request.</p>

<p>In summary, CIBA suffers from a weakness where an attacker can force-initiate an authorization event. In certain scenarios, a more secure alternative is the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628">device code flow</a>, where a user can actively initiate authorization on their device using a QR code or one-time code.</p>

<p>Also, CIBA should not be used in a same-device scenario where the consumption and authentication devices are the same.</p>

 CIBA support in Okta 

<p>CIBA is not yet widely implemented. Okta has been an early adopter of the CIBA standard.</p>

<p>CIBA is rapidly gaining traction in the banking industry. <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi">FAPI</a> specifications, developed based on the OAuth 2.0 token model, include the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-ciba.html">CIBA profile</a>. CIBA, along with complementary product offerings such as <a>Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)</a>, make up the key components required for highly regulated identity.</p>

<p>In Europe, CIBA can help implement the decoupled authentication flows outlined by <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/implications-around-psd2-and-open-banking/">PSD2 and UK Open Banking</a>. <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/banking-and-finance/the-consumer-data-right">Consumer Data Right (CDR)</a> in Australia is expected to include the specification soon.
Beyond the banking industry, CIBA is promising to provide enhanced security and user experience for the Helpdesk, customer service, retail Point of Sale (POS), Interactive Voice Response (<a href="https://www.ttec.com/glossary/interactive-voice-response">IVR</a>), and shared kiosk-based applications.</p>

<p>Okta supports CIBA in poll mode, a feature called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-ciba/main/">Transactional Verification</a>. The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/">Okta authorization server</a> includes the CIBA grant as part of the support.</p>

<p>The authentication process is supported by allowing the creation of a mobile push authenticator using <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/10/showcase20-introducing-the-okta-devices-sdk-and-api-a-better-way-to-secure-and-delight-mobile-users/">the Okta device SDK</a>. This SDK can be easily embedded in the organization’s mobile application or as a separate companion application. Check out the iOS and Android guides on how to implement a branded push authenticator using the SDK. The guides include sample applications to get you quickly started building the experience.</p>

 Use CIBA for secure identity verification in your apps 

<p>Digital applications are crucial for every business, and securing them is paramount. It’s not enough to protect just the front door with authentications. Applications must always be vigilant during their operations and operate on a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture">zero-trust</a> model. CIBA is an important tool to ensure that applications enforce continuous and secure authorization in appropriate contexts without compromising the user experience.</p>

<p>A masked email address is a unique, automatically generated email address that you can use to shield your primary email from spam and email scams like <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams">phishing attacks</a>.</p>



<p>Email masking adds a layer of protection between you and your inbox—and with data breaches and fraud at <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">record highs</a>, masked email, as well as email aliases, temporary email, and disposable email, are now popular privacy tools.</p>



<p>But if you’re searching for truly private and secure email, you can do much better than masked email. MySudo has loads of benefits over other email options and we’ll cover them all here—but first, let’s do the 101 on masked email.</p>



 Is a masked email the same as an email alias? 



<p>Email masking is sometimes confused with email aliasing, but they’re not the same.</p>



<p>An email alias is a secondary email address (usually a variation of your primary email address) that sits in your primary inbox—whereas a masked email is an entirely separate email account that gets forwarded to your primary email inbox.</p>



<p>But a masked email is not a temporary email or a disposable email, either.</p>



<p>A temporary email address is usually set up to receive one-off messages, has no sending capability, and will auto-expire after a set time or set number of uses.</p>



<p>A disposable email is like a temporary email but typically lasts longer. It may have limited sending capability for replies. You can throw away your disposable email whenever you’re done with it.</p>



 How does email masking work? 



<p>While your primary email provider can handle your email aliases, you’ll need a third-party provider to run your masked email service. Here’s what happens:&nbsp;</p>



 
 You create a masked email address through a service like Apple’s iCloud Private Relay, Firefox Relay, or a custom domain. 



 When someone sends an email to your masked address, the service forwards the email to your real inbox. 



 You read the email in your real inbox without the sender ever knowing your real email address. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Depending on the service you choose, replies will go either:</p>



 
 Via the service: Some masked email services let you send email from the masked address, so the recipient sees the masked email address, not your real email address, or 



 From your real inbox: If you reply to an email that’s been forwarded from the masked email service, the service will rewrite the “From” address to keep your real email hidden. 
 



<p></p>



<p>You can disable or delete your masked email at any time.</p>



 What type of email is MySudo email? 



<p>MySudo email is a popular secure email service with full send and receive support. It’s entirely separate from your personal email account and intentionally protects your personal email from spam and email-based scams.</p>



<p>MySudo email is better than masked email in at least 4 ways:</p>



<p></p>



 <br>1. MySudo is more than email; it’s a complete private identity management solution 



<p>Your MySudo email sits within a secure <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=You%20assign%20each%20of%20your,goods%2C%20or%20booking%20local%20services.">Sudo digital identity</a> which you set up, manage and retain until you decide to delete it. While email is a popular feature of a Sudo, each Sudo contains so much more, to make it a complete private identity management solution. Here’s what’s in each Sudo:</p>



 
 1 email address – for end-to-end encrypted emails between app users, and standard email with everyone else 



 1 handle – for end-to-end encrypted messages and video, voice and group calls between app users 



 1 private browser – for searching the internet without ads and tracking 



 1 phone number (optional)* – for end-to-end encrypted messaging and video, voice and group calls between app users, and standard connections with everyone else; customizable and mutable 



 1 virtual card (optional)* – for protecting your personal info and your money, like a proxy for your credit or debit card or bank account 
 



<p></p>



<p>*Phone numbers and virtual cards only available on a paid plan. Phone numbers available for US, CA and UK only. Virtual cards for US only.</p>



<p>Masked email services usually provide only disposable or relay email addresses, not full identity separation like MySudo does.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>2. You can have up to 9 separate email accounts with MySudo 



<p>The <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">top plan</a> on MySudo entitles you to up to 9 separate Sudo digital identities, which means you can actually maintain up to 9 separate email accounts at any one time (plus 9 secondary phone numbers, private browsers, handles, and optional virtual cards).</p>



<p>The real power comes when you apply those 9 separate Sudos to different purposes in your busy life: shopping, dating, classified selling, travel, social media accounts, and more. Anywhere you don’t want to use your personal email, phone, and credit card, use your Sudo details instead. You stay private, safe and organized.

<p></p>



 <br>3. MySudo email is end-to-end encrypted between MySudo users 



<p>MySudo email is end-to-end encrypted between MySudo users. This gives you much greater privacy and control, especially for sensitive communications. You can easily <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">invite friends and colleagues to the app</a>, so you can email, call, and message each other securely.</p>



<p>Most masked email services only forward email and don’t secure or end-to-end encrypt it beyond basic TLS during transmission.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>4. You can sign up to MySudo without giving away your personal email or any other info 



<p>Many masked email services tie the masked address to your real identity behind the scenes, but MySudo doesn’t. In fact, we can’t. That’s because MySudo won’t ask for any of your&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>, like primary email address or phone number, when you set up and log in to your account. Instead, your account is protected by an authentication and encryption&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">key</a>&nbsp;that never leaves your device.</p>



<p>We’ll only ask for personal information if you opt-in to use the optional MySudo&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/?s=virtual+cards">virtual cards</a> feature and for UK phone numbers, because for these services we must do a one-time verification of your identity by law.</p>



<p>So, don’t waste your time setting up masked email or email aliases for privacy. Instead, go straight to <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>, where you can have up to 9 secure email addresses that shield and protect your personal email—and loads of other privacy and security features besides.</p>



<p>Download MySudo for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysudo-protect-your-identity/id1237892621">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anonyome.mysudo">Android</a>.</p>

					 Signal to Sale: How Ultrasonic Tech is Solving Retail’s Attribution Problem 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>For all retailers, the physical store remains crucial for customer conversion, but the rapid expansion of digital channels has created a non-linear path from awareness to purchase. The exponential increase in consumer touchpoints makes it nearly impossible for industry leaders to draw a clear line across the whole customer journey. This disruption in the funnel universally impacts big box stores, CPGs, and small brick-and-mortar merchants alike.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
					 How are companies supposed to invest resources into promotion campaigns when conversion metrics are basically a shot in the dark? 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>The Problem: In today’s retail ecosystem, merchants only truly know their customers at checkout, but by then, it’s too late. If businesses could identify their consumers throughout the entire shopping journey, they could present personalized offerings at critical stages of the buying process and understand full attribution of which promotions worked and which didn’t.</p><p>The Game Plan:</p>  Recognize which customers viewed certain TV promotions at-home  Identify customers when they enter the store  Present customers with personalized offerings during their shopping experience to increase spend or highlight higher margin items  Cultivate unique shopping experiences that increase word of mouth marketing  Gamify the checkout experience to make consumers excited for their next visit.  <p>With this equation, your retail store doesn’t become an option; it becomes the destination.</p><p>The Solution:&nbsp;LISNR’s Radius, an ultrasonic SDK capable of sending data over inaudible sound using standard speakers and microphones. Radius transmits data using frequencies higher than what humans can hear allowing these “tones” to be layered over TV broadcasts and in-store music/announcements. Our Zone66 tone profile can send data over 30 feet from standard speakers and can be used to identify a consumer and their relative location within the physical store. Once identified, merchants can send personalized offerings directly to the consumer’s device as they are in front of specific products.</p><p>Furthermore, LISNR offers Quest, a loyalty management platform that enables tracking of consumers’ purchase history and incentivizes future purchases. Utilizing the gamified nature of Quest at checkout, consumers can track their progress toward rewards and redemption, keeping the store top of mind.</p>

					</a>
				 
								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									 The Proliferation of LISNR-Enabled Digital Touchpoints <p>LISNR capitalizes on digital touchpoints by enabling the delivery of valuable and personalized offers directly to consumers at various touchpoints found in everyday shopping experiences. By integrating with LISNR, retailers can enable attribution within their existing infrastructure.</p> At-Home Television <p><br>Retail media, CTV, and linear TV ad spend is projected to be around $5 billion in 2025, according to MediaPost. Retailers clearly understand the value in advertising through television; however, realizing the ROI is much more difficult. How can businesses confidently attribute an advertisement to an uptick in purchases at checkout? The answer is Radius.</p>								 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									<p>Radius’ ultrasonic tones can be played simultaneously with a normal TV audio broadcast. Image 1 shows an example of a Radius tone at a frequency far above standard broadcast audio being played at the human audible level. Retailers can utilize any audio stream to encourage their consumers to open their app and engage or receive a promotion. What better way to embrace the ever-present second screen?</p>

									See a TV broadcast advertisement delivery in action
					
					</a>
				 
								 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Retailers can either broadcast a single offer to all consumers or offer a personalized coupon based on their previous shopping behavior.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
												
																					Image 1: Radius tone being broadcast at a frequency higher than human hearing
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									 In-Store Audio <p>In-store audio, whether music or PA announcements, is commonplace in retailers and is often drowned out as white noise. As a result, in-store audible advertisements often fall short, with retailers relying on consumers to be actively listening. Again, Radius can break this paradigm.</p><p>By operating simultaneously with in-store audio, consumers are seamlessly presented with personalized offers via their device. The Radius SDK even allows data to be transmitted over three distinct audio frequencies or “channels” to prevent overlapping messages. Image 2 demonstrates how three distinct data streams can be played simultaneously over audio.</p><p>For this use case, retailers can broadcast “Zone IDs” in-store to locate consumers and present relevant messaging. Once the consumer’s device receives the Zone ID for the store, the retailer’s backend app logic is able to present the consumer with a personalized offering. App logic can also be set up to limit the amount of promotions a consumer receives in a given timeframe.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
							 
			 
		 
						 
				 
				 
				 
												
																					Image 2: Radius tones being broadcast over 3 different channels
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									 At-Checkout <p>Many of today’s shopper cards or loyalty programs are either a black box for consumers, or a percentage discount disguised as loyalty points. This does nothing to create loyal or engaged customers. LISNR instead offers Quest, a gamified loyalty platform.</p><p>By creating gamified experiences, Quest taps into a different mindset of the consumer, building a connection to merchants while increasing transaction size and volume. Quest is not just about dollars spent; it empowers retailers to incentivize any customer action (visits, specific item purchases, referrals) that they deem impactful. Consumers can interact with time-based criteria (quests) or lifetime progression (achievements) to track their loyalty and redeem rewards.</p><p>Quest’s data builds a positive feedback loop for consumer preferences. As consumers shop more frequently, their preferences become more defined allowing retailers to present more relevant offers. These offers in turn incentivize consumers to come back, spend more in-store, and look forward to their next visit.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
												
																					Quest allows consumers to earn and collect achievement badges modeled after video games
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
									 Conclusion <p>By establishing a channel from awareness to conversion, retailers can capitalize on the power of targeted marketing and attribution. Retailers no longer need to guess at their ROI vs cost per impression, LISNR leads to insights of cost per conversion. Add personalized loyalty into the mix and you begin to see the LISNR flywheel for retailers.</p>

 Evolution from 800-63-2 to 800-63-3  
<p>The NIST SP 800-63 guidelines are dynamic, constantly adapting to evolving technological advancements and threats. The latest iteration, NIST SP 800-63-3, represents a crucial evolution from its predecessor, 800-63-2, incorporating significant improvements to address emerging vulnerabilities and provide stronger security measures.</p> 
<p>A key update resides within NIST 800-63B, a core component of the 800-63-3 guidelines, which focuses intently on authentication methods. Notably, email one-time passwords (OTPs) have been explicitly placed in a limited scope. This decision directly acknowledges their inherent susceptibility to widespread phishing at the workplace, where email is easily compromised.</p> 
<p>Similarly, SMS-based authentication has been formally downgraded as a viable authenticator for high-assurance scenarios. While SMS was initially considered a significant step forward for two-factor authentication, we found through the years, mobile providers and even the SS7 network itself was compromised.</p> 
<p>These pivotal revisions in NIST 800-63-3 unequivocally signal a strategic shift towards prioritizing stronger, more phishing-resistant authentication protocols. NIST actively encourages organizations to adopt resilient authentication mechanisms that genuinely protect against unauthorized access and prevent identity fraud.</p> 
 Key Concepts and Processes of Identity Proofing and Authentication  
<p>The guidelines introduce a significant shift by retiring the concept of a "level of assurance (LOA)" as a single, all-encompassing ordinal that dictates implementation-specific requirements. Instead, NIST 800-63-3 emphasizes that agencies (and by extension, organizations) should select.</p> 
<p>IAL (Identity Assurance Level), AAL (Authenticator Assurance Level), and FAL (Federated Assurance Level) as distinct, independent options. This selection process is driven by appropriate business and privacy risk management considerations, alongside specific mission needs. While many systems might coincidentally have the same numerical level for each of IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a mandatory requirement, and agencies should avoid assuming they will always be identical within any given system.</p> 
<p>The distinct components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:</p> 
  
  IAL refers to the identity proofing process, which validates the real-world identity of the applicant.  
  AAL refers to the authentication process, which verifies the user's claimed identity during a transaction.  
  FAL refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated environment, specifically used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to a relying party (RP).  
  
<p>This explicit separation of categories provides organizations with greater flexibility in choosing identity solutions and significantly enhances the ability to embed privacy-enhancing techniques as fundamental elements of identity systems, regardless of the chosen assurance level.</p> 
<p>Beyond these foundational assurance concepts, the guidelines meticulously elaborate on the crucial roles played by various key actors within the sophisticated digital identity ecosystem:</p> 
  
  Credential Service Providers (CSPs): These entities bear the significant responsibility for issuing and meticulously managing authenticators (digital credentials) for users.Their role ensures the secure storage of the unique digital representation of the individual and its secure use for authentication. Their meticulous handling of these credentials is vital for the entire chain of trust.  
  Relying Parties (Verifiers): These are the diverse services, applications, or systems that judiciously consume the authenticated identity to grant appropriate access to specific resources or services. They inherently rely on the assertions provided by the CSPs to verify the user's identity before extending trust or access. The important parts of their role involve verifying identity, often by confirming the user's authentication complies with specified Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs).  
  
 The Digital Identity Model: NIST's Vision for Online Presence  
<p>NIST defines a sophisticated and nuanced concept of digital identity that extends far beyond the simplistic notion of a username and password. This comprehensive model fundamentally emphasizes the unique and verifiable nature of an individual's digital representation and its pivotal role in facilitating secure online transactions and interactions across diverse platforms.</p> 
<p>The Digital Identity Model, as conceptualized by NIST, illustrates a clear and sequential flow for establishing and utilizing a secure digital identity, moving from an applicant's initial request to their engagement in online transactions. This model involves several interconnected key stages:</p> 
  
  Applicant: This initial stage represents the individual requesting access or registration for a digital service. At this point, the applicant may submit personal data such as their name, email, or an ID photo to initiate the process.  
  Enrollment: Here, the identity is rigorously verified using various identity proofing methods. Once verification is successful, credentials or authenticators are issued to the individual for future use.  
  Digital Identity: Once the enrollment process is complete and verified, a unique digital representation of the individual is created. This digital identity is then stored securely and subsequently used for authentication purposes in various online contexts.  
  Online Transaction: In the final stage of the model, the user leverages their established digital identity to authenticate and gain access to a service. During this process, the system actively verifies the user's identity, ensuring compliance with predefined Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs) to secure the transaction.  
  
<p>This model provides a clear visual and conceptual framework for understanding the lifecycle of a digital identity within the NIST guidelines, emphasizing the progression from initial proofing to ongoing authentication.</p> 
 Key Processes in Digital Identity Management  
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 breaks down digital identity management into three key, interconnected processes:</p> 
  
  Identity Proofing: The foundational step of verifying an individual's identity, ensuring it exists and belongs to the claimant. This prevents fraudulent account creation and initial unauthorized access.  
  Digital Authentication: The ongoing process of verifying a user's claimed identity each time they attempt an online transaction or access a resource. It ensures the legitimate holder is performing the action.  
  Federated Identity Management: A mechanism for linking identities across different organizations, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple relying parties without repeated authentication.  
  
 Understanding NIST Assurance Levels (IALs, AALs, FALs)  
<p>NIST defines Identity Assurance Levels (IALs), indicating the certainty that a claimed identity corresponds to a real-world identity. These are part of NIST 800-63-3 and provide a tiered approach to evaluating identity proofing strength.</p> 
  
  IAL1 (Low Assurance): No requirement to link the individual to a real-world identity; information is self-asserted.  
  IAL2 (Medium Assurance): Uses digital documents as evidence to support the claimed identity's real-world existence and verifies the person's association.  
  IAL3 (High Assurance): Requires an authorized and trained representative to verify the individual in person, often with biometrics, for the highest certainty.  
  
<p>IALs primarily measure assurance at a single point in time, during enrollment or initial identity proofing, and do not cover ongoing authentication.</p> 
<p>Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs) quantify authentication mechanism strength during login:</p> 
  
  AAL1: Typically single-factor (e.g., username/password), generally discouraged for sensitive data.  
  AAL2: Requires at least two distinct authentication factors, designed to resist replay attacks, though SMS OTPs are now less secure.  
  AAL3: The highest level, requiring strong cryptographic device-based authentication (e.g., FIDO security key, device-bound passkeys), highly resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.  
  
<p></p> 
 Enrollment and Identity Proofing (SP 800-63-A)  
<p>NIST 800-63-A provides practical and prescriptive examples of proofing methods that can be judiciously utilized to meet these varying assurance levels. These methods are designed to collectively minimize the risk of fraudulent identity creation and unauthorized access:</p> 
  
  Document Verification: This involves examining official documents (e.g., passport, driver’s license) either in person or digitally, with technology capable of detecting forgeries or alterations.  
  Facial Recognition with Liveness Detection: This cutting-edge method uses facial biometrics to confirm the person matches the claimed identity. Crucially, liveness detection is integrated to detect and thwart spoofing attempts using photos, videos, or masks.  
  Live Video Verification: This adds a significant layer of human-centric security by facilitating a face-to-face verification session over a secure video conference. An authorized agent engages directly with the individual to confirm liveness and detect signs of coercion.  
  Chat Verification: For lower-risk scenarios or as a preliminary step, chat verification can be employed, often combining AI and human interaction.  
  Location Detection: Verifying the geographical location of the individual during the proofing process can be important, though it must strictly adhere to all privacy regulations.  
  Attestation: A critical component providing an auditable trail, attestation involves a responsible party formally confirming and documenting the results of the identity proofing process, retaining results but not sensitive PII.  
  
<p>The strategic integration of these diverse methods, as meticulously outlined in NIST 800-63-A, culminates in a comprehensive, multi-layered identity proofing ecosystem.</p> 
 Authentication and Lifecycle Management (SP 800-63-B)  
<p>NIST Special Publication 800-63-B delves into the critical area of Authentication and Lifecycle Management, placing significant emphasis on "verifier impersonation resistance," directly acknowledging the widespread and persistent threat of phishing attacks. This mandate means that authentication methods must be meticulously designed to prevent attackers from successfully impersonating legitimate relying parties (e.g., websites, applications) in order to trick unsuspecting users into revealing their credentials or authentication factors.</p> 
<p>The decisive move to deprecate email OTP and significantly downgrade SMS-based authentication in NIST 800-63B directly reflects the understanding that these methods, while once considered helpful, are no longer sufficient to provide adequate assurance against modern, targeted threats.</p> 
 Federation and Assertions (SP 800-63-C)  
<p>The core concept elaborated in 800-63-C is the precise definition of Federated Assurance Levels (FALs). FALs are designed to quantify the confidence that can be placed in the assertions or claims made by one identity provider (often acting as a Credential Service Provider or CSP) to a distinct relying party (or verifier) about a user's identity and their authentication event.</p> 
  
  FAL1 (Low Assurance): Corresponds to the lowest level of confidence in the assertion, often linked to an AAL1 authentication event.  
  FAL2 (Medium Assurance): Reflects a moderate level of confidence, typically corresponding to an AAL2 authentication event.  
  FAL3 (High Assurance): Denotes the highest level of confidence in the assertion, corresponding to an AAL3 authentication event.  
  
<p>These levels are crucial because they enable a relying party to understand and trust the level of rigor and security that was applied by the identity provider in establishing and authenticating that user's identity. This allows for informed risk decisions when granting access based on a federated assertion.</p> 
<p>The process of conveying authentication and attribute information in a federated environment typically involves several key elements:</p> 
  
  Assertions: Cryptographically signed digital statements made by a trusted identity provider about a user's identity or authentication event.  
  Protocols: Standardized technical protocols (e.g., SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) used to securely exchange these assertions.  
  Trust Frameworks: Established frameworks defining policies, procedures, and technical agreements between participating entities to ensure interoperability and security.  
  
<p>Federated identity management significantly improves user experience via single sign-on (SSO) and enhances security by centralizing identity management with trusted providers.</p> 
 Implementation Guidelines for Identity and Authentication Assurance Levels  
<p>Implementing NIST 800-63-3 involves selecting suitable assurance levels and addressing challenges. A common error is only verifying identity at hire; a robust strategy must cover the entire employee lifecycle.</p> 
<p>Critical scenarios requiring secure identity proofing and strong authentication include:</p> 
  
  Employee Onboarding: Ensuring new hires are legitimate before granting system access, preventing interview fraud.  
  Credential Resets: Protecting against social engineering that exploits reset processes, as seen in the MGM Resorts attack.  
  Changing Roles or Elevated Privileges: Re-verifying identity before granting new access levels.  
  Elevated Detected Risk: Prompting re-proofing when monitoring systems detect suspicious activity (e.g., unusual login locations).

<p>“I went to Geneva to understand what, if anything, people were saying regarding digital identity and standards in a governance-focused forum. My brain is now full.”</p>



<p>I’m an identity and standards geek. I adore the topic of identity and the standards development process; everything from the brilliant minds, the challenges, and the intense edge cases. (Well, some of the challenges. I could do without a few.)</p>



<p>But I also recognize that both the identity industry and the standards process have serious issues, especially when it comes to the diversity of representation and issues of governance. Too often, we hear from the same people in the same rooms, solving the same problems.</p>



<p>So, when I knew I’d be in Geneva for the first <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration Conference</a> (which, by the way, exceeded my expectations), I applied for accreditation to attend the <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20 High-Level Event</a>, hosted by the ITU. The WSIS+20 is, according to their website, “an existing multistakeholder United Nations (UN) process on digital governance and cooperation with a vision of fostering people-centered, inclusive, and development-oriented information and knowledge societies.” My goal was pretty simple: listen to people I don’t usually get to hear from. Try to understand why the worlds of digital identity, governance, and Internet policy remain so siloed, despite everyone’s insistence that this is all interconnected.</p>



<p>I’ve learned a lot. I’m not sure what to do with all of it yet, but I’m glad I came.</p>

<p></p>



 Defending Our Voice: Participation ≠ Power 



<p>Let’s start with the first session I attended: “<a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/Agenda/Session/309">Defending Our Voice: Global South Participation in Digital Governance</a>.” Kemly Camacho (Association for Progressive Communications) moderated the session, which included speakers from IT for Change, Derechos Digitales, the UN Human Rights Office, and the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.</p>



<p>They were primarily discussing governance, not technical standards, but a lot of what they said seemed relevant for the standards world, too. Right out of the gate, the first speaker, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandini-chami-03807669/">Nandini Chamim</a>, laid out a set of points I think everyone in identity and standards work should hear:</p>



 
 Presence ≠ Participation: Just being in the room doesn’t mean having influence. Real participation means being able to shape agendas and priorities. 



 Multistakeholder ≠ Public Policy: Equal status in dialogue doesn’t automatically create legitimate public policy. What matters is how different interests are mediated to reach consensus. 



 The Mundial 2014 process raised this issue: Legitimacy in Internet governance must be earned, not assumed through default institutional formats. 



 Trust deficit: Historical data shows ongoing public skepticism. Governance spaces are often dominated by powerful countries and corporations, sidelining the issues important to less-represented groups. 



 Technical ≠ Apolitical: Since WSIS, we’ve seen how technical standards often embed political values. They shape not only systems, but also societal norms. 



 Openness must be questioned: When we talk about openness, we should ask: Openness towards what (i.e., open to what kind of issues?), and for whom? 
 



<p>Even when civil society groups are invited, it’s often tokenistic; visa issues, language barriers, and lack of funding limit meaningful engagement. And when they do show up, there’s often no follow-up, no feedback loops, and no real seat at the agenda-setting table.</p>



 IAM Is a Multi-Tool. We’re Not the Whole Toolbox. 



<p>Another thing that became clear throughout the event was that many of the people here are tackling big problems, and digital identity isn’t exactly one of them.</p>



<p>This reminded me of a conversation I had with Andrew Hindle and Richard Bird at the bar during Identiverse 2025. (All the best conversations seem to happen at the bar.) We talked about how siloed the identity team is within most organizations, even though IAM touches every part of the business.</p>



<p>That conversation led me to understand that identity people often think in systems, but the rest of the organization thinks in functions. HR, finance, compliance, marketing—they’ve all got their own language and priorities. And understanding IAM isn’t in their job description.</p>



<p>WSIS+20 made me realize that the same kind of disconnect exists at the global level, too.</p>



<p>The people in these rooms work on global human rights, economic justice, equity, ethics, and environmental resilience. To them, identity is just one tool in a thousand-piece toolbox. Standards are just one governance process among many. Most of them have never heard of SAML, FIDO, or the W3C Digital Credential API, and don’t need to. They don’t use the terms CIAM, workforce identity, or even authentication and authorization. They have use cases that require things like identity verification, but it’s not on their radar.</p>



<p>What they do understand is that technology is not neutral. Technologists and policymakers must shape it around a platform of human rights. Where I’ve <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/27/governance-decides-if-decentralization-works/">previously written</a> that “the technology is ready, the governance is not,” what I saw here is that the governance work is happening, but it’s happening in a different room, with a very different vocabulary.</p>



 So what do we do about the gap? 



<p>It’s tempting to say we need to get technologists into policy rooms and policymakers into technical working groups. But I don’t think that’s the answer, at least not by itself. This isn’t a matter of “getting in the room.” It’s about figuring out how to share power, information, and influence across two very different systems.</p>



<p>The only halfway-satisfying idea I have right now is this: mandated consultation, in both directions.</p>



 
 Policy decisions should be reviewed by expert technical groups. 



 Technical standards should be reviewed by policymakers and civil society. 
 



<p>Even that solution frustrates me. It’ll slow processes down further in a time when everything else is speeding up. It may leave even more room for de facto standards to take root via market dominance. But I can’t think of another way to bridge the growing legitimacy gap between how we make standards and how people expect governance to work. Consultation also won’t be enough if there’s no way to track what feedback was given, what was included, and, critically, what was left out and why. That’s not just a process problem. That’s a legitimacy problem.</p>



<p>If you have other suggestions, I’m listening.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:04]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Defining the Governance Gap 



 



<p>[00:00:30]<br>So I went to Geneva for the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) meeting. It’s a multistakeholder United Nations process, organized by the ITU, that focuses on digital governance and cooperation.</p>



<p>My goal? To understand what, if anything, people were saying about digital identity and standards in a governance-focused forum.</p>



<p>And it was… really interesting. I’m very glad I went.</p>



<p>Now, if you know me, you know I’m an identity and standards geek. I love the process—well, most of it. The brilliant minds, the weird edge cases, the moments where it feels like we’re collectively inching the Internet forward? I live for that.</p>



<p>But I also recognize the industry’s flaws:</p>



 
 Representation gaps 



 Governance issues 



 Repetition of the same voices and perspectives 
 



<p>And that’s not how progress works.</p>



 



 Finding WSIS and Listening Beyond the Norm 



 



<p>When I found out I’d already be in Geneva for the Global Digital Collaboration Conference (which far exceeded expectations), I applied for accreditation to attend the WSIS+20 High-Level Event.</p>



<p>According to its official description, WSIS is about:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Fostering people-centered, inclusive, and development-oriented information and knowledge societies.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In real terms? It’s the room where governments, civil society, and international organizations gather to talk about the future of digital governance on a global scale.</p>



<p>My objective was simple:<br>Listen to people I don’t normally hear from.<br>And try to understand why identity, governance, and Internet policy feel like separate worlds, even though they’re clearly interconnected.</p>



 



 The Session That Set the Tone 



 



<p>[00:02:43]<br>The first session I attended was titled:<br>Defending Our Global South Participation in Digital Governance.</p>



<p>It was moderated by Kemli Camacho from the Association for Progressive Communications, with panelists from:</p>



 
 IT for Change 



 Derechos Digitales 



 UN Human Rights Office 



 Brazilian Internet Steering Committee 
 



<p>They weren’t there to talk about standards, but what they said resonated powerfully.</p>



<p>A speaker named Nadini Chowni offered some compelling truths:</p>



 
 Presence ≠ Participation<br>Just being in the room doesn’t mean influencing the agenda. Real participation means shaping the priorities—not just reacting to them. 



 Multistakeholder ≠ Public Policy<br>Equal footing in a discussion doesn’t guarantee fair policy outcomes. What really matters is how interests are mediated and resolved. 



 Legitimacy Must Be Earned<br>She referenced the Mundial 2014 process, which emphasized that governance legitimacy is earned—not assumed—just because a structure looks inclusive on paper. 



 There’s a Public Trust Deficit<br>Long-standing skepticism exists due to powerful countries and corporations dominating governance spaces, often sidelining less-represented voices. 
 



<p>And perhaps most importantly:<br>Being technical is not apolitical.<br>The design of standards reflects values. It shapes systems. It sets social norms.</p>



 



 Tokenism, Risk, and Real Costs 



 



<p>[00:04:39]<br>Even when civil society is invited, participation is often tokenistic:</p>



 
 Visa problems 



 Language barriers 



 No travel funding 



 No translation or agenda 



 No follow-up mechanism 
 



<p>As one speaker said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Participation is costly. And it’s risky.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sometimes, just showing up carries political risk. And even then, there’s no guarantee your voice will shape the outcome.</p>



<p>As a working group chair in a standards organization, this hit hard. I try to be inclusive—but I often rely on those who are willing to speak up.</p>



<p>Clearly, I need to do better.</p>



 



 Identity Isn’t the Toolbox—It’s Just a Tool 



 



<p>[00:06:01]<br>Here’s the realization:<br>Identity and access management (IAM) is like a multi-tool—it’s handy, flexible, and powerful.<br>But it’s not the whole toolbox.</p>



<p>At the WSIS event, most people weren’t even thinking about digital identity.</p>



<p>Instead, they were focused on:</p>



 
 Human rights 



 Economic justice 



 Environmental resilience 
 



<p>Digital identity was just one small piece of their broader challenges.</p>



<p>This reminded me of a conversation I had at Identiverse earlier this year—with Andrew Hindle and Richard Bird—about how siloed IAM projects tend to be inside organizations.</p>



<p>Even though identity touches everything (HR, finance, compliance, security), it often goes unacknowledged across domains.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



 
 IAM folks think in systems 



 Others think in functions 
 



<p>Different language. Different priorities. Different goals.</p>



<p>And at a global level, it’s the same. The WSIS crowd? They’ve never heard of SAML or FIDO. They’re not discussing consumer or workforce identity.</p>



<p>They’re talking about:</p>



 
 Data sovereignty 



 Rights 



 Accountability 
 



<p>They expect technologists to embed human rights into the systems they build.</p>



 



 Governance Is Happening… Somewhere Else 



 



<p>[00:07:42]<br>I used to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Technology is ready; governance is not.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, I’m not so sure. Governance is happening—just in other rooms, with very different vocabulary.</p>



<p>And that’s overwhelming.</p>



<p>We’ve got:</p>



 
 WSIS 



 IGF 



 Global Digital Collaboration 



 National frameworks 



 Regional strategies 
 



<p>Even experts struggle to keep up.<br>For civil society groups, trying to monitor all that—on tight budgets, in multiple languages—it’s nearly impossible.</p>



<p>That’s not just a risk. It’s already causing:</p>



 
 Fragmentation 



 Incompatibility 



 Conflicting outcomes 
 



<p>And no one wins.</p>



 



 The Gap Isn’t Just Presence—It’s Power 



 



<p>[00:08:45]<br>So how do we bridge that gap?</p>



<p>It’s tempting to say:<br>“Just bring technologists into policy rooms and policymakers into technical working groups.”</p>



<p>But that’s not enough.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because it’s not about presence. It’s about power—and how to share it across two very different systems.</p>



<p>One half-formed idea:<br>Create mandated consultations in both directions.</p>



 
 Policy decisions get reviewed by expert technical groups 



 Technical standards get reviewed by policymakers and civil society 
 



<p>That should be baseline practice.</p>



<p>But even that frustrates me—because it’s going to slow us down. And we’re already struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>And the slower we go, the more room there is for de facto standards—those not built on consensus, but on market dominance.</p>



<p>Still, I can’t see another way to address the legitimacy gap.</p>



<p>And consultation alone isn’t enough without accountability.</p>



 



 What Happens Next? 



 



<p>[00:09:53]<br>One of the speakers noted that the WSIS Elements Paper—the framework guiding these discussions—barely included strong human rights language.</p>



<p>It was, in their words, “legally timid.”</p>



<p>So we need more than just listening.</p>



<p>We need:</p>



 
 Traceability 



 Transparency 



 Accountability 
 



<p>We need to track:</p>



 
 What feedback was given 



 What was included 



 What was excluded—and why 
 



<p>This isn’t just a process gap.<br>It’s a legitimacy problem.</p>



<p>If you’ve been in one of these policy rooms, or tried to bring identity work into broader governance conversations, I would truly love to hear from you.</p>



<p>Because honestly? I don’t see how we get from two parallel worlds to one where we can truly collaborate.</p>



<p>But I’m listening.</p>



 



 Final Thoughts

            <p>Thales is proud to have partnered with the first edition of the International Physics Olympiad held in France. From the STEM for ALL prize giving to a visit of our Palaiseau laboratory, relive a week dedicated to excellence and diversity among tomorrow's young scientific talents.</p>
<p>First held in 1967, the International Physics Olympiad is the world’s most prestigious physics competition for young people under twenty. It brings together over a thousand participants from nearly 90 countries to celebrate physics and support the students who will shape the science of tomorrow.</p>
<p>At Thales, encouraging science, technology, and vocations in STEM fields is one of our priorities. That is why we are proud of having been a partner of the first edition of this competition held in France, which took place from July 18 to 24 in the Paris region.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony, Marko Erman, Chief Scientific Officer of Thales, awarded a grant as part of the STEM for ALL programme to five students who showed great motivation for STEM fields despite the social challenges they face.</p>
<blockquote><p>The International Physics Olympiad is a testament to the scientific excellence of young people from around the world. Through the STEM for ALL grants, we aim to encourage the commitment and diversity of these future talents by giving them the means to pursue their passion for science and to take on tomorrow’s challenges.<br>
Marko Erman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The five recipients are part of delegations from Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>As a sponsor, Thales also welcomed more than 60 students from 17 countries to the Thales Research &amp; Technology laboratory in Palaiseau. They were able to discover the Group’s latest innovations in physics: next-generation quantum sensors, superhydrophobic materials, and high-power lasers. They also had a special opportunity to interact with our scientific experts about their recent work and learn about the many possible career paths available to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is essential to spark curiosity and foster the desire to innovate among young generations. Supporting them and helping them discover the diversity of scientific and technological professions is an investment in our collective future.<br>
Amélie Ravier,&nbsp;Executive Director, Thales Solidarity<br>
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Money service businesses (MSBs) in the UK face growing regulatory pressure from the FCA. This article explains how automated AML screening, real-time sanctions checks, and audit-ready tools can help MSBs manage compliance risk, reduce false positives, and prepare for increased oversight.</p>
 
 Money service businesses (MSBs) in the UK—including remittance providers, currency exchanges, and payment platforms—operate in a high-risk environment. With financial crime threats rising and regulatory expectations tightening, these firms must now demonstrate proactive, real-time anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. 
<p>In 2025, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is sharpening its focus on MSBs. Failures to screen transactions, monitor for suspicious behaviour, or implement effective controls can result in serious penalties, deauthorisation, or reputational harm.</p>
 FCA Priorities for MSBs 
<p>The FCA expects all MSBs to implement a robust AML framework that includes:</p>
 
 Customer due diligence (CDD) for both individuals and business clients 
 Ongoing sanctions screening and politically exposed person (PEP) checks 
 Transaction monitoring and alert escalation 
 Clear audit trails for all risk-based decisions 
 Timely suspicious activity reporting (SARs) 
 
<p>Additionally, firms must ensure compliance with the UK Sanctions List maintained by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).</p>
 Key Challenges Facing UK MSBs 
<p>1. High Transaction Volume and Velocity<br>
Remittance firms and currency exchanges often process thousands of transactions per day, making manual screening impractical.</p>
<p>2. False Positives and Alert Fatigue<br>
Outdated screening systems may generate excessive alerts, slowing reviews and leading to oversight risks.</p>
<p>3. Staff Capacity and Consistency<br>
Small compliance teams may struggle to maintain consistent review standards across geographies or service lines.</p>
<p>4. Fragmented Data and Documentation<br>
Disconnected onboarding, transaction, and case management systems make it difficult to build an audit-ready record of compliance.</p>
 How iComply Helps UK MSBs Stay Compliant 
<p>iComply offers a scalable compliance platform tailored to the needs of fast-moving, high-volume money service providers.</p>
 1. Real-Time AML and Sanctions Screening 
 
 Integrate with UK and global watchlists (OFSI, UN, EU, etc.) 
 Screen natural persons and entities at onboarding and continuously 
 Flag PEPs, sanctioned individuals, and adverse media hits 
 
 2. Automated Risk Scoring and Alerts 
 
 Customize risk thresholds by geography, transaction size, or client type 
 Trigger alerts for review, escalation, or SAR filing 
 Reduce false positives using contextual data and identity matching 
 
 3. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Document findings, decisions, and next steps in a single dashboard 
 Assign team roles and track case resolution timelines 
 Export reports for internal audits or FCA inspections 
 
 4. Audit-Ready Logs and Compliance Reporting 
 
 Maintain immutable logs of all screening actions 
 Generate structured SARs and compliance reports on demand 
 Support full FCA audit traceability 
 
 5. Data Privacy and Localization Controls 
 
 Comply with UK GDPR and OFSI disclosure requirements 
 Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted and stored in the UK 
 
 Case Insight: Money Services Business in London 
<p>A multi-jurisdictional money services business integrated iComply to consolidate onboarding and screening across five countries. In less than three months:</p>
 
 Reduced false positives by 42% 
 Cut review time from 2 hours to 20 minutes per flagged case 
 Passed an FCA spot check with zero findings 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 FCA Enforcement Surge: More on-site inspections and thematic reviews of AML controls 
 Sanctions Expansion: Increased OFSI updates related to geopolitical instability 
 Tech Adoption Mandates: Growing regulatory expectation to adopt RegTech and eliminate manual-only workflows 
 
 Take Action 
<p>MSBs that fail to modernize AML compliance are at risk of enforcement actions, fines, and loss of authorisation. But those who invest in scalable, intelligent tools can turn compliance into a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Schedule a consultation with iComply to see how we help UK MSBs screen smarter, stay compliant, and scale with confidence.</p>

<p>The ground is shaking in the world of digital assets. What was once a subtle tremor of regulatory curiosity has become a full-blown tectonic shift. The era of ambiguity—the "Wild West" where crypto firms could thrive in the gray areas of financial law—is decisively over. Today, a new reality has set in, and the message from global regulators is crystal clear: get your compliance house in order, or prepare to be swept away.</p>



<p>This isn't a scare tactic. It's a strategic briefing. For any crypto company with ambitions to scale, innovate, and lead the next wave of finance, a robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework is no longer a burdensome cost center. It is the very foundation of your survival, your growth, and your legacy.</p>



<p>Let’s get specific.</p>



<p>On June 24, 2025, the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services pushed forward the GENIUS Act. This piece of legislation, working in tandem with the STABLE Act, is designed to pull stablecoin issuers directly under the purview of the Bank Secrecy Act. The implications are enormous. We're talking about mandatory, non-negotiable KYC, AML, and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) rules for&nbsp;any&nbsp;entity that facilitates digital asset transfers, custody, or issuance.</p>



<p>If you are a centralized exchange, a wallet provider, a DeFi protocol with an identifiable controlling party, or a stablecoin issuer, the directive is simple:&nbsp;Know Your Customer, or risk becoming collateral damage in a new, regulated world.</p>



<p>The Enforcement Dragnet is Closing In</p>



<p>If you think this is a distant, theoretical threat, you're not paying attention. The enforcement actions are already here, and they are escalating in both frequency and severity. Regulators are no longer giving passes for being "crypto-native." They are applying battle-tested financial principles, and the fines are staggering.</p>



 
 In Lithuania,&nbsp;Revolut&nbsp;was slapped with a €3.5 million fine in April 2025 for what regulators called "persistent shortcomings" in its AML prevention. It wasn't a failure of technology, but a failure of process and resourcing to keep pace with its explosive user growth. 



 The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) brought the hammer down on&nbsp;Barclays&nbsp;in July 2025 with a £42 million penalty. The reason? Failing to gather sufficient KYC information and conduct adequate monitoring of client accounts. While a traditional bank, the lesson for crypto is identical: onboarding is just the beginning of your duty, not the end. 



 That same month, the challenger bank&nbsp;Monzo&nbsp;took a £21 million hit. Its sin? A growth-at-all-costs mindset that led to opening accounts with implausible addresses and implementing laughably weak AML controls. For any crypto exchange that has prized frictionless onboarding above all else, the siren song of user acquisition drowned out the alarms of compliance, and Monzo's story should be a chilling cautionary tale. 



 And it's not just fines. Prosecutors in the Netherlands are pursuing criminal charges against&nbsp;Rabobank&nbsp;for years of systemic failures in vetting customer accounts for money laundering risk. In the U.S., FinCEN identified a staggering&nbsp;$1.4 billion&nbsp;in suspicious crypto transactions linked to fentanyl trafficking in 2024 alone. This isn't just about financial penalties; it's about the real-world impact of non-compliance. 
 



<p>These aren't isolated incidents. They are data points in a clear and menacing trend. Whether you're a neobank, a Wall Street titan, or a crypto exchange, the standards for AML are converging. The uncomfortable truth is that crypto's unique characteristics make it a prime target.</p>



<p>Illicit actors flock to crypto for a reason. It presents a perfect storm for money laundering:</p>



 
 Pseudonymity by Design:&nbsp;Making attribution a significant challenge without the right tools. 



 Global Accessibility:&nbsp;Minimal barriers to entry allow for near-instant, borderless value transfer. 



 Rapid Transaction Speeds:&nbsp;Layer 2s and sidechains enable funds to be moved and obfuscated in minutes. 



 Regulatory Arbitrage:&nbsp;A still-fragmented global landscape allows criminals to exploit loopholes between jurisdictions. 



 Technical Obfuscation:&nbsp;Complex cross-chain flows, privacy coins, and mixing services are designed to break the chain of custody. 
 



<p>For fast-scaling crypto startups, where the mantra is often "growth first," compliance can easily become an afterthought. This is a fatal strategic error, one that jeopardizes the very pillars of your business:</p>



 
 Banking Access:&nbsp;Payment providers and banking partners are de-risking aggressively, severing ties with crypto firms that have even a whiff of weak AML controls. 



 Licensing Jeopardy:&nbsp;Getting a license in key jurisdictions like the UK, Singapore, or Dubai is now impossible without demonstrating institutional-grade AML programs. 



 User Trust:&nbsp;The modern customer values security. A platform perceived as a haven for fraud and illicit activity will see its brand equity—and its user base—evaporate. 



 Exit Barriers:&nbsp;Thinking of an acquisition or a public offering? Your potential buyers or underwriters will conduct deep AML due to diligence. Weak compliance is the number one deal-killer. 
 



<p>AML isn't just a regulatory checkbox. It's your business continuity plan. It’s the bedrock on which a trustworthy financial ecosystem is built. It's what separates the enduring institutions from the firms destined for regulatory purgatory.</p>



<p>The Three-Pillar Framework: Your Blueprint for a Defensible Program</p>



<p>To build a compliance program that can withstand regulatory scrutiny and the complexities of digital assets, you need to anchor it in first principles. Technology will change, but the fundamentals of risk management are timeless. Every effective crypto compliance program today stands on three interconnected pillars:&nbsp;Identity Verification (KYC), AML/PEP Screening, and Wallet &amp; Transaction Monitoring.&nbsp;Like a tripod, if one leg is weak, the entire structure will collapse.</p>



<p>Pillar 1: Identity Verification (The "Who")</p>



<p>Know Your Customer is far more than a regulatory mandate; it's the bedrock of trust. In a world defined by digital anonymity, a robust identity verification process is how you signal to users, partners, and regulators that you are a serious, secure, and future-proof institution. "Modern KYC" is a world away from simply asking a user to upload a blurry photo of their passport. Leading firms have operationalized a multi-layered approach:</p>



 
 Advanced Document Authentication:&nbsp;This involves using AI-driven tools to not just read the text on an ID but to verify its authenticity by checking for holograms, microprinting, font consistency, and pixel-level manipulation that would be invisible to the human eye. 



 Biometric Liveness Checks:&nbsp;The fight against fraud has moved to video. Sophisticated liveness detection goes beyond a simple selfie, using active challenges (e.g., turning your head, reading a phrase) to defeat deepfakes and presentation attacks, where a fraudster holds a photo or video up to the camera. 



 Authoritative Database Verification:&nbsp;The information on an ID is cross-referenced in real-time against government, telecom, and credit bureau databases to ensure the person is real and the data is consistent. 



 Digital and Device Fingerprinting:&nbsp;Your compliance program should also look at digital signals. Is the user accessing your platform from a high-risk IP address? Are they using a device previously associated with fraud? This adds a crucial layer of context. 
 



<p>Crucially, this isn’t a one-and-done process. This is&nbsp;Customer Due Diligence (CDD). For higher-risk profiles—like Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) or users from high-risk jurisdictions—you must escalate to&nbsp;Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). This might involve requiring proof of wealth, source of funds documentation, or more stringent identity checks. A mature program automates these triggers, ensuring that KYC is a living, breathing part of your risk management lifecycle.</p>



<p>Pillar 2: AML &amp; PEP Screening (The "Should We?")</p>



<p>If KYC answers "who is this person?", screening answers the far more critical question: "should we be doing business with them?". This requires continuous, automated screening of your entire user base against a constellation of risk-defining datasets:</p>



 
 Global Sanctions Lists:&nbsp;This is non-negotiable. You must screen against all major lists, including OFAC, UN, EU, HMT, and others, with updates flowing into your system in real-time. A delay of even a few hours can mean processing a transaction for a newly sanctioned entity. 



 Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) Registries:&nbsp;PEPs aren't criminals, but their position makes them vulnerable to bribery and corruption, posing a higher money laundering risk. Identifying them is mandatory for applying necessary EDD. Imagine a government minister from a nation known for corruption attempting to deposit millions in crypto onto your platform—your system must flag this instantly. 



 Adverse Media:&nbsp;Your screening needs to be smarter than just lists. Modern systems use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scan global news sources, blogs, and forums for credible mentions of a user in connection with financial crime, terrorism, or other illicit activities. 
 



<p>A key challenge here is managing&nbsp;false positives. An effective system uses sophisticated fuzzy matching to catch near-matches and aliases without flooding your analysts with irrelevant alerts for people with common names. The goal is to surface true risk, not create noise.</p>



<p>Pillar 3: Wallet &amp; Transaction Monitoring (The "What Are They Doing?")</p>



<p>This is where crypto compliance diverges sharply from traditional finance and where most firms fall short. The blockchain doesn't lie, but it speaks a language that requires specialized translation. You must be able to connect an identified user to their on-chain behavior.</p>



<p>Modern wallet and transaction monitoring is no longer optional. Leading platforms like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and TRM Labs provide capabilities that are now considered standard:</p>



 
 Wallet Risk Scoring:&nbsp;Proactively screen wallet addresses&nbsp;before&nbsp;a transaction is processed. A wallet's score is determined by its history—has it interacted with darknet markets, mixers, sanctioned entities, or known scam addresses? A deposit from a high-risk wallet should trigger an immediate alert. 



 Source and Destination of Funds Analysis:&nbsp;Trace transactions backward and forward to understand the full context. Where did the money&nbsp;really&nbsp;come from, and where is it going? This helps unravel complex layering schemes. 



 Behavioral Heuristics:&nbsp;The best tools don't just look at addresses; they analyze patterns. They can detect classic money laundering techniques like&nbsp;smurfing&nbsp;(breaking large transactions into many small ones),&nbsp;peel chains&nbsp;(siphoning off small amounts from a wallet to a new address), and&nbsp;chain-hopping&nbsp;through cross-chain bridges to obfuscate the money trail. 



 Travel Rule Compliance:&nbsp;With FATF's Travel Rule now being enforced in many jurisdictions, your platform must have the technical capability to send, receive, and secure the required originator and beneficiary information for transactions above the legal threshold. 
 



<p>These three pillars are not independent silos. They are a feedback loop. A high-risk transaction should trigger a KYC re-verification. A new PEP hit should lower a user's transaction limits. A withdrawal to a sanctioned wallet should freeze an account. Without this interplay, you are flying blind.</p>



<p>From Silos to Synergy: Why an Integrated Stack is Non-Negotiable</p>



<p>Let’s be honest about how most crypto compliance stacks are built: they are bolted together. A point solution for KYC, a different API for AML screening, a third-party tool for basic wallet risk checks. The result is a Frankenstein's monster of disconnected systems, duplicated data, alert fatigue, and mounting technical debt.</p>



<p>This fragmented approach is not just inefficient; it's dangerous. Imagine a day in the life of an analyst at a firm with a fragmented stack:<br>They see a transaction alert in one system. They have to copy the user ID and paste it into the KYC portal in another tab. Then they copy the wallet address and paste it into a blockchain explorer in a third tab. They find a PEP match in a fourth system. They manually compile all this into a spreadsheet to decide whether to file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). This process is slow, prone to human error, and impossible to audit effectively.</p>



<p>Now, picture the same analyst at a firm with an&nbsp;integrated, all-in-one stack:<br>A single alert appears on their dashboard. It automatically shows the user's full KYC profile, their ID documents, the real-time PEP and sanctions screening results, and a visual graph of the on-chain transaction, with the risky counterparty wallet already flagged and scored. All the information needed for a decision is in one place. The investigation time drops from hours to minutes.</p>



<p>At the heart of this superior architecture is&nbsp;real-time, unified risk scoring. This score acts as the central nervous system of your compliance program. Every interaction—a document upload, a sanctions hit, a wallet anomaly—should instantly and dynamically update that customer’s risk score. This enables intelligent automation:</p>



 
 Low-risk users&nbsp;are onboarded in seconds with minimal friction. 



 Medium-risk users&nbsp;automatically face layered controls, like lower withdrawal limits or periodic reverification checks. 



 High-risk users&nbsp;are instantly flagged and routed to a senior analyst for enhanced due diligence or offboarding. 
 



<p>This isn’t just about making your analysts' lives easier. It’s about being audit-ready by design. When a regulator demands to see your records, you can produce a complete, time-stamped, and defensible history of every customer, alert, and decision with a few clicks.</p>



<p>The Strategic Questions Every Crypto Executive Must Ask</p>



<p>Technology is the enabler, but the ultimate responsibility lies in strategy. The most successful compliance leaders aren't just evaluating vendors; they are asking the tough, forward-looking questions that define their company's culture and future. Before you spend another dollar on tools, your executive team must have answers to these questions:</p>



 
 Are We Treating Compliance as a Business Enabler or a Cost Center?&nbsp;The answer to this question defines everything. If compliance is seen as a cost, it will always be under-resourced and reactive. When seen as an enabler, it becomes a competitive advantage that unlocks better banking relationships, smoother licensing, and greater investor confidence. 



 Is Our Risk Framework Actually Risk-Based?&nbsp;Regulators expect you to tailor controls to specific risks. A one-size-fits-all approach is explicitly non-compliant. 



 Are Our Systems Unified or Hopelessly Fragmented?&nbsp;The more your analysts have to switch between tabs, the more risk you are introducing. 



 Are We Genuinely Audit-Ready, Today?&nbsp;Audit-readiness isn't a project you start when you get a letter from a regulator. It's a state of being. 



 Do We Have the Right Mix of Talent?&nbsp;The best systems in the world are useless without skilled operators. You cannot outsource this entirely. 



 Are We Building for Where Regulation Is Going?&nbsp;The regulatory goalposts are constantly moving. Are you building a program that will be compliant in 2026, or one that was barely compliant in 2023? 
 



<p>What Comes Next: From Knowledge to Action</p>



<p>You’ve made it this far, which means you understand the gravity of the situation. KYC and AML are not regulatory chores; they are strategic imperatives. The crypto landscape is maturing, and with that maturity comes immense opportunity for those who are prepared.</p>



<p>Reading is not enough. It’s time to act. Here are two next steps to move your compliance journey forward:</p>



 
 Download the Buyer's Guide:&nbsp;<a href="https://kyc-chain.com/guide/kyc-chains-buyers-guide/">Building a Modern Crypto Compliance Framework: The Buyer's Guide</a>. This comprehensive playbook distills the key elements of choosing the right platform into a practical roadmap. 
 



 
 Review the ICO Compliance Guide:&nbsp;<a href="https://kyc-chain.com/guide/kyc-aml-compliance-guide-for-ico/">The KYC/AML Compliance Guide for ICOs</a>. Use this to rate your firm’s maturity, identify critical gaps, and start building your roadmap for board-level alignment. 
 



<p>Regulatory pressure will only increase. But so will the rewards for getting it right. As crypto continues its march into the mainstream, the market will be won by the most trusted, transparent, and compliant providers.</p>



<p>Let’s stop treating compliance as the brakes on innovation. When done right, it is the engine that powers sustainable, scalable, and credible growth. Let's build the firms that regulators respect, investors trust, and the next billion users rely on. This requires innovation in KYC systems to mitigate new and emerging risks for clients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello from the Metadium&nbsp;team.</p><p>Recently, the Cambodian government officially recognized Verywords for achieving a 680,000-ton reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, marking Korea’s first successful case of an “Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcome (ITMO).” This is more than a milestone in climate action — it demonstrates the real-world application of Metadium’s technology in a global climate cooperation initiative.</p><p>Why is this project significant?<br>Under the Paris Agreement, South Korea must reduce 291 million tons of carbon emissions by 2030, including 37.5 million tons through international reduction efforts.<br>Until now, no ITMO project had received formal approval, but Verywords broke new ground by earning recognition through the distribution of electric motorcycles in partnership with Cambodia.</p><p>What role did Metadium play in this project?<br>Metadium served as the technical backbone connecting climate action and data by implementing a system that uses Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and NFT technology to verify participation and emission reduction activities.</p>  Public sector officials and private citizens who received electric motorcycles were issued Metadium DIDs. These DIDs enabled them to be reliably identified as participants in the reduction effort, and their activity history could be securely tracked and verified.  The reduction data from each motorcycle was integrated with Metadium’s carbon-neutral eco platform and issued in the form of points, linking data with the participant’s history.  NFT technology was used to verify each participant’s activity records uniquely.  <p>Metadium’s contribution to a trusted data-driven ecosystem<br>For international reduction outcomes to be officially recognized, the key is to clearly and verifiably answer: Who reduced what, and how?<br>Metadium’s DID and NFT technologies enabled a secure and transparent connection between participants and their activity data, providing an infrastructure that made verification possible on the blockchain.This solidified the legitimacy and traceability necessary for international carbon credit transactions.</p><p>Beyond climate cooperation: Unlocking global ecosystem potential<br>The Verywords project goes beyond distributing electric motorcycles. It’s evolving into a sustainable ecosystem involving real-time driving data collection via IoT modules, a membership-based energy usage model, and a battery reuse system.<br>Within this structure, Metadium’s DID and NFT-based verification infrastructure demonstrated strong potential for expansion in Southeast Asia and other developing markets where climate technology is in&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Conclusion: Metadium as a foundation for the global ESG ecosystem<br>The Verywords project is a meaningful first step in proving that the international carbon reduction model can work in practice. Metadium played a core role by providing trust-based technology that connects participants and data.<br>Moving forward, Metadium will continue to contribute to the global ESG ecosystem by offering a scalable infrastructure rooted in DID and blockchain technology — supporting carbon reduction and sustainable development goals worldwide.</p><p>The Metadium&nbsp;Team</p> 캄보디아 온실가스 68만 톤 감축, 메타디움 기술&nbsp;기여 <p>안녕하세요, 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>최근 베리워즈가 캄보디아 정부로부터 68만 톤 규모의 온실가스 감축 실적을 공식 인정받으며, 한국의 첫 ‘국제 감축(ITMO)’ 성공 사례로 주목받고 있습니다. 이는 단순한 기후 사업의 성공을 넘어, 메타디움 기술이 실질적인 글로벌 기후 협력 사업에 적용된 중요한&nbsp;이정표입니다.</p><p>왜 이 프로젝트가&nbsp;중요한가?</p><p>한국은 파리기후협정에 따라 2030년까지 총 2.91억 톤의 탄소를 감축해야 하며, 그 중 3,750만 톤을 해외에서 ‘국제 감축’ 방식으로 달성해야&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>그동안 어떤 ITMO 사업도 정부 승인에 이르지 못했지만, 베리워즈는 캄보디아와 협력해 전기 오토바이 보급을 통해 공식 감축 실적을&nbsp;인정받았습니다.</p><p>이 프로젝트에서 메타디움은 어떤 역할을&nbsp;했나?</p><p>메타디움은 전기 오토바이 보급 대상자의 디지털 신원(DID) 등록과 NFT 기술을 기반으로 한 참여 증빙 시스템을 통해, 감축 활동과 데이터를 연결하는 인프라 역할을&nbsp;수행했습니다.</p><p>• 전기 오토바이를 수령한 공공기관 공무원과 민간 사용자에게 메타디움 DID가 발급되었으며, 각 참여자는 이 DID를 통해 감축 활동의 참여자로 식별되고, 그 활동 이력이 안전하게 추적·증명될 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.<br> • 각 오토바이의 감축 실적은 메타디움의 탄소중립 에코 플랫폼과 연동되어 포인트 형태로 발행되었으며, 참여자의 활동 이력과 연계되었습니다.<br> • NFT 기술은 각 참여자의 활동 내역을 고유하게 증명하는 수단으로&nbsp;사용되었습니다.</p><p>데이터 기반 생태계 신뢰성, 메타디움이 기여한&nbsp;부분</p><p>국제 감축 실적이 공식적으로 인정되기 위해서는, ‘누가’, ‘무엇을’, ‘어떻게 감축했는가’를 명확하게 기록하고 검증할 수 있어야&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>메타디움의 DID 및 NFT 기술은 감축 활동 주체의 신원과 활동 데이터를 안전하게 연결하며, 블록체인을 통해 그 과정을 투명하게 증명할 수 있는 기반 인프라로 기능했습니다. 이는 감축 실적의 국가 간 거래 시, 명확한 정당성과 추적 가능성을 동시에 확보할 수 있도록&nbsp;도왔습니다.</p><p>기후 협력을 넘어, 글로벌 생태계 확장을 위한&nbsp;가능성</p><p>베리워즈 프로젝트는 단순한 전기 오토바이 보급에 그치지 않고, IoT 모듈 기반의 실시간 데이터 수집, 멤버십형 에너지 사용 모델, 배터리 재활용 시스템 등 지속가능한 탄소 감축 생태계 구축으로 이어지고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>이러한 구조 안에서 메타디움은 DID 및 NFT 기반의 감축 증빙 인프라를 제공함으로써, 기후 기술을 필요로 하는 동남아 및 개발도상국 시장에서 높은 활용성과 확장성을&nbsp;입증했습니다.</p><p>결론: 메타디움, 글로벌 ESG 생태계의 신뢰&nbsp;기반</p><p>베리워즈 프로젝트는 ‘국제 감축’이라는 새로운 협력 모델이 실제로 작동할 수 있음을 보여준 의미 있는 첫걸음이며, 메타디움은 이 과정에서 참여 주체와 데이터를 연결하는 신뢰 기반 기술로 핵심 역할을&nbsp;수행했습니다.</p><p>앞으로도 메타디움은 DID와 블록체인 기술을 통해, 탄소 감축과 지속 가능한 개발 목표를 지원하는 글로벌 ESG 생태계의 핵심 인프라로 자리매김해&nbsp;나가겠습니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀</p>  Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a>  Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a>  Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a>  Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a>  Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/68-million-tons-of-greenhouse-gas-reduction-in-cambodia-powered-by-metadium-technology-1620119c1f52">68 Million Tons of Greenhouse Gas Reduction in Cambodia, Powered by Metadium Technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tips for Choosing the Best Sports Streaming Sites 



 Assess Content Coverage &amp; Broadcast Rights 



<p>This is paramount. Identify which specific leagues, teams, and tournaments you absolutely need to watch (e.g., Premier League, NFL, NBA, Champions League, Formula 1). Research which platforms hold the broadcasting rights for best sports streaming sites in your region. Don’t assume all services offer everything.</p>



 Prioritize Stream Quality &amp; Reliability 



<p>Look for services that consistently offer HD or 4K streaming for a crisp picture. Equally important is minimal buffering and lag, especially for live events where every second counts. Read reviews about best sports streaming sites stability during peak viewing times.</p>



 Evaluate Device Compatibility &amp; User Interface 



<p>Ensure the service works seamlessly on all your preferred devices (smart TV, phone, tablet, computer, gaming console). A clean, intuitive user interface is crucial for easily finding games, navigating schedules, and managing your account without frustration.</p>



 Compare Pricing &amp; Value 



<p>Assess the subscription cost against the channel lineup and includes features. Some services offer a broader range of content at a higher price, while others specialize and are more budget-friendly. Look out for bundles (e.g., ESPN+ with Hulu) that might offer better overall value for your entertainment needs.</p>



 Check for Key Features 



 
 Cloud DVR: Can you record live games to watch later? Is there a storage limit? 



 Simultaneous Streams: How many devices can you watch at once? (Important for households with multiple viewers). 



 Multi-View/Split Screen: Can you watch multiple games simultaneously? (Highly sought after for major sports days). 



 Exclusive Content: Does the platform offer original sports shows, documentaries, or behind-the-scenes access? 



 Ad Experience: How frequent and intrusive are the ads? Are there ad-free tiers available? 
 



 Utilize Free Trials 



<p>Many reputable streaming services offer free trials. This is the best way to test out the platform’s content, stream quality, user interface, and features before committing to a subscription.</p>



 Read Reviews &amp; Get Recommendations 



<p>Consult reliable tech and sports media reviews, and ask other sports fans for their experiences with different services. User feedback can highlight pros and cons that aren’t obvious from a features list.</p>



 Consider Bundles &amp; Add-ons 



<p>Sometimes, combining a base streaming service with a specific sports add-on (like the B/R Sports add-on on Max, or NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV) is the most cost-effective way to get all the content you want.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The realm of best sports streaming sites in 2025 offers an unparalleled array of options, making it easier than ever for fans to follow their passions. Whether you’re a die-hard football fanatic, a basketball enthusiast, or a lover of niche sports, the perfect platform awaits.</p>



<p>As you finalize your choice, remember that the “best” site is ultimately the one that aligns with your specific viewing habits, desired features like 4K quality and DVR, and the precise leagues you can’t miss. With the continuous evolution of features like multi-view options, lower latency, and seamless integrations, 2025 promises an even more immersive and flexible sports viewing experience. So, pick your best sports streaming sites, settle in, and get ready for a year filled with exhilarating live action!</p>

 Tips for Finding the Best New Movies on Stream 



 Utilize Dedicated Streaming Guides &amp; Aggregators 



<p>Websites and apps like JustWatch, Reelgood, and TVGuide are invaluable. They aggregate content from multiple streaming services, allow you to filter by platform, genre, release year, and even track your watchlist across different services.</p>



 Check Platform “New Release” Sections Regularly 



<p>Every major streaming service (Netflix, HBO Max, Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Apple TV+, etc.) has a “New &amp; Trending” or “Recently Added” section. Make these your first stop for fresh content.</p>



 Follow Reputable Entertainment News Sites &amp; Critics 



<p>Keep an eye on well-known movie review sites (Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDb), entertainment news outlets (Variety, Hollywood Reporter, TheWrap, Mashable), and film blogs/podcasts. They often highlight upcoming releases and critical darlings.</p>



 Dive into Genre-Specific Lists 



<p>If you’re in the mood for something specific, search for “best new horror movies streaming 2025” or “top sci-fi films on Netflix 2025.” Many sites curate lists by genre, which can lead you to hidden gems.</p>



 Leverage Platform Recommendation Engines 



<p>Your streaming service’s algorithm learns from your viewing history. While not perfect, paying attention to its “Recommended for You” or “Because You Watched…” sections can introduce you to new films aligned with your taste.</p>


 
 


 Watch Trailers and Previews 



<p>Before committing to a full movie, watch the trailer. Most platforms integrate trailers directly into their listings, giving you a quick glimpse of the plot, style, and cast to help you decide.</p>



 Engage with Online Communities &amp; Social Media 



<p>Join movie-focused Reddit communities, Facebook groups, or follow film critics and entertainment accounts on social media. These communities are often quick to share new discoveries, recommendations, and discussions.</p>



 Explore “Coming Soon” Sections 



<p>Look for sections dedicated to upcoming releases on your preferred platforms. This allows you to mark your calendar and get excited about films launching in the near future.</p>



 Consider Third-Party Review Sites 



<p>Before diving in, check out external reviews and ratings from both critics and general audiences on sites like IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes. While taste is subjective, this can give you a good idea of a film’s overall reception.</p>



 Don’t Forget About Theatrical-to-Stream Transitions 



<p>Many major films still have a theatrical release first, but quickly make their way to streaming platforms. Stay updated on these transitions to catch critically acclaimed movies shortly after their cinema run.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The cinematic landscape continues its rapid evolution in 2025, with streaming platforms firmly established as primary destinations for the year’s most anticipated films. From star-studded blockbusters making their way quickly from theaters to your living room, to innovative originals pushing creative boundaries, the selection of best new movies on stream offers something for every taste.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/1-hpps-role-in-the-ai-driven-crypto-future-from-wallets-to-agents-e61b0397238b">previous article</a>, we explored how HPP unlocks intelligent, agent-driven finance through AI-powered DeFi (DeFAI). In this second installment, we shift the focus to infrastructure — specifically, how HPP is building the coordination layer for a decentralized, SLM-powered AI&nbsp;economy.</p><blockquote>TL;DR:<br>HPP is building the blockchain infrastructure for the post-LLM era, where AI is powered by lightweight, modular Small Language Models (SLMs) instead of monolithic LLMs. Unlike LLMs, SLMs are efficient, fine-tunable, and privacy-preserving, making them ideal for enterprises such as banks and healthcare providers. HPP provides the coordination, payment, and verification layers necessary for these models and agents to collaborate in real-time. Through AI-native tools like Noösphere, developers and users can deploy agent-based services, conduct off-chain AI reasoning, and enable micro-payments between&nbsp;models.</blockquote><p>In the era of artificial intelligence, it’s easy to assume that bigger means better. Large Language Models (LLMs) have dazzled the public, but for enterprises, their size is often a liability rather than an asset. HPP is being built from the ground up to support a different future — one where AI is modular, composable, and deployed with real-world constraints in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>This is the future of SLMs (Small Language Models), and HPP is the infrastructure designed to support&nbsp;it.</p> Why SLMs Will Matter More Than&nbsp;LLMs <p>While LLMs dominate headlines, their use in enterprise and government environments is limited by fundamental issues. These include massive compute requirements, opaque data processing, and a lack of enterprise-level support and maintenance.</p><p>In sectors like finance, healthcare, and public infrastructure, where Aergo has already built strong credibility, such instability is a non-starter. These institutions prioritize predictability, data sovereignty, and ease of maintenance. LLMs typically fall short in all three&nbsp;areas.</p><p>SLMs, on the other hand, offer a practical path forward. They run efficiently on existing hardware, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, and keep sensitive data local without relying on public inference APIs. For enterprise-grade AI to scale effectively, it must be tailored to its specific environment. That’s what SLMs&nbsp;enable.</p> So Why Is HPP Launching Now? <p>HPP didn’t appear out of nowhere. It was created in response to a growing need. As enterprises began adopting specialized AI models, a critical bottleneck emerged — the lack of a secure and verifiable coordination layer between models, agents, and humans. Smart contracts alone couldn’t handle this&nbsp;need.</p><p>HPP is being launched to fill that gap. It is designed not only to process transactions but also to orchestrate distributed intelligence in a trusted and scalable&nbsp;manner.</p> What Makes HPP Different? <p>HPP (House Party Protocol) is Aergo’s next-generation evolution. It is a Layer 2 AI-native network designed to facilitate real-time, verifiable coordination among agents, models, and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Here’s how we are aligning with the rise of the SLM&nbsp;economy:</p>  SLM-Oriented Architecture: HPP’s infrastructure supports lightweight inference, agent execution, and off-chain verification. This is optimized for high-frequency, low-latency decision-making.  Agent-to-Agent Payments: With tokenized microtransactions, HPP enables autonomous systems to transact with each other. These include sensor-to-sensor, bot-to-bot, and model-to-model interactions.  Programmable Coordination Layer: HPP is not just a smart contract platform. It is a coordination layer that allows distributed teams of agents to operate, cooperate, and resolve logic through programmable protocols.  Off-Chain Intelligence with Noösphere: Developers can offload computation-heavy tasks to trusted off-chain environments, then bring back proofs or results on-chain for transparency and auditability.  Plus-and-Play AI Services: Users can subscribe to or deploy specialized SLMs into their wallets. At the same time, developers can compose multiple agents into dApps or workflows, enabling projects to offer AI-as-a-Service directly on top of&nbsp;HPP.   A Financial Layer for the Machine&nbsp;Economy <p>The agent economy demands a new kind of currency. SLMs and agents execute countless micro-transactions, often worth fractions of a cent, in real-time. Traditional finance cannot keep up with this scale or speed. Transaction fees, processing times, and centralized gatekeeping all become fatal bottlenecks.</p><p>HPP’s tokenomics are being designed with this future in&nbsp;mind:</p>  Frictionless, programmable payments  Support for microvalue and high-frequency transactions  Decentralized fee models for agent-native services   From Enterprise to Intelligence <p>Aergo has long served as a reliable enterprise-grade platform for governments, corporations, and infrastructure providers. With HPP, we are taking that experience and pointing it toward the next wave: AI-powered coordination.</p><p>This is not a pivot. It is an expansion. We are not abandoning what we have built. We are extending it into a new domain where intelligent systems can operate transparently, securely, and autonomously across decentralized networks.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>As LLMs give way to networks of SLMs, the question becomes: who is building the infrastructure for them to run, transact, and coordinate on-chain?</p><p>HPP is becoming the coordination fabric of the SLM economy. A world where models collaborate, agents negotiate, and decentralized intelligence becomes self-sustaining. In the next phase of the internet, not everything needs to be on-chain. But everything must be verifiable and interoperable. That’s what HPP is delivering.</p><p>A new infrastructure layer is emerging. In a world where AI models are no longer passive tools but active market participants, we need more than just smart contracts. We need coordination, autonomy, and verifiability at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>This is where HPP is&nbsp;heading.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/2-hpp-and-the-post-llm-future-building-the-infrastructure-for-the-next-chatgpt-5ad72255bbf5">[2] HPP and the Post-LLM Future: Building the Infrastructure for the next ChatGPT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why use Okta for authentication 

<p>Building an authentication system and handling credentials, sessions, and tokens is highly insecure and exposes your application to serious vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Okta provides a secure, scalable, and standards-based solution using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0. It also integrates seamlessly with OIDC client libraries for your favorite tech stack and allows you to fetch tokens.</p>

 Why use PKCE in OAuth 2.0 

<p>To further strengthen security, this project uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>. PKCE is a security extension to the Authorization Code flow. Developers initially designed PKCE for mobile apps, but experts now recommend it for all OAuth clients, including web apps. It helps prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks and makes it useful for every type of OAuth client, even confidential clients such as web apps that use client secrets. As OAuth 2.0 has steadily evolved, security best practices have also advanced. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html">RFC 9700: Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security</a> captures the consensus on the most effective and secure implementation strategies. Additionally, the upcoming OAuth 2.1 draft requires PKCE for all authorization code flows, reinforcing it as a baseline security standard.</p>

<p>With Okta, you can implement modern authentication features and focus on your application logic without worrying about authentication infrastructure.</p>

 A secure web app using Express, OAuth 2.0, and PKCE 

<p>Let’s build an expense dashboard where users log in with Okta and view spending data based on their role. Whether they work in Finance, Marketing, or HR, each team views only its own expenses. To keep things minimal in this demo project, we’ll define roles and users directly in the app.</p>

<p>You’ll also use OpenID Connect (OIDC) through the openid-client library for authentication. Then, you’ll map each user’s email from the ID token to a team. The dashboard applies principles of least privilege and displays expenses by team, so each user sees only their department’s spending.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   
    <p>Node.js installed (v22+ recommended)</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Integrator Free Plan org</a></p>
   
 

 Create your Express project and install dependencies 

<p>Create a new project folder named <code>express-project-okta</code>, and open a terminal window in the project folder.</p>

<p>Initialize a new Node.js project:</p>

   <code>npm init -y
</code>   

<p>Install the required packages:</p>

   <code>npm install express@5.1 passport@0.7 openid-client@6.6 express-session@1.18 ejs@3.1 express-ejs-layouts@2.5 dotenv
</code>   

<p>Now, install the development dependencies:</p>

   <code>npm install --save-dev nodemon
</code>   

<p>In the package.json file, update the scripts property with the following:</p>

   <code>  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  }
</code>   

<p>What do these dependencies do?</p>

<p>These installed packages become your Express project’s dependencies.</p>

 
   
    <p><code>express</code>: Handles routing and HTTP middleware for your web app</p>
   
   
    <p><code>passport</code>: Sets up and maintains server-side sessions</p>
   
   
    <p><code>openid-client</code>: Node.js OIDC library with PKCE support; handles the OAuth handshake and token exchange.</p>
   
   
    <p><code>express-session</code>: Manages user sessions on the server</p>
   
   
    <p><code>dotenv</code>: Loads environment variables from a <code>.env</code> file</p>
   
   
    <p><code>ejs</code>: Enables dynamic HTML rendering using embedded JavaScript templates</p>
   
   
    <p><code>express-ejs-layouts</code>: Adds layout support to EJS, helping manage common layout structures across views</p>
   
 

 Configure environment variables for OIDC authentication 

<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in the root directory with placeholders for your Okta configuration.</p>

   <code>OKTA_ISSUER=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
POST_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code>   

<p>In the next step, you’ll get these values from your Okta Admin Console.</p>

 Create the Okta OIDC web application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Web Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> 
       Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Web App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Client Secret: Click Show in the Client Credentials section to reveal 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

<p>You’ll need these values for your application configuration:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



 Build the Express app 

<p>Create an <code>index.js</code> file in your project root. It serves as the main entry point for your application. Use it to initialize the Express app, set up the routes, and configure <a href="https://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a> to manage user sessions by serializing and deserializing users on each request.</p>

   <code>import express from 'express';
import session from 'express-session';
import passport from 'passport'; 
import routes from './routes.js';
import expressLayouts from 'express-ejs-layouts';

const app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(expressLayouts); 
app.set('layout', 'layout');
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use(session({
  secret: "your-hardcoded-secret",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

passport.serializeUser(function (user, done) {
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function (obj, done) {
  done(null, obj);
});

app.use('/', routes);

app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {
  console.log('Server listening on http://localhost:3000');
});
</code>   

 Define team mapping and sample expenses 

<p>Create a <code>utils.js</code> file to serve as a data module for your project. This file includes a user-to-team mapping and has dummy expense data for each team, covering all teams configured for testing in your web app.</p>

<p>The application determines the user’s team context from the email claim in the ID token and filters the expense list accordingly, so the dashboard displays only that team’s data.</p>

<p>To customize the data, open <code>utils.js</code> and update the following objects:</p>

 
   
    <p><code>ALL_TEAMS_NAME</code> - an array listing all teams in your organization</p>
   
   
    <p><code>userTeamMap</code> - maps each user’s email (or “admin” for full access) to a specific team</p>
   
   
    <p><code>dummyExpenseData</code> - contains sample expense data for each team</p>
   
 

   <code>export const ALL_TEAMS_NAME = ["finance", "hr", "legal", "marketing", "dev advocacy"];

export const userTeamMap = {
  "hannah.smith@task-vantage.com": "admin",
  "grace.li@task-vantage.com": "legal",

export function getModifiedTeam(team) {
  if (!team?.trim()) return [];

  const toPascalCase = (str) =&gt;
    str
      .trim()
      .split(/\s+/)
      .map((word) =&gt; word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())
      .join(' ');

  const toKebabCase = (str) =&gt; str.trim().toLowerCase().split(' ').join('-');

  if (team === 'admin') {
    return ALL_TEAMS_NAME.map((element) =&gt; ({
      id: toKebabCase(element),
      label: toPascalCase(element),
    }));
  }

  return [
    {
      id: toKebabCase(team),
      label: toPascalCase(team),
    },
  ];
}
</code>   

<p>The file also defines <code>getModifiedTeam</code>, a helper that converts a team name into an array of objects. Each object has an id and a label. If the team is admin, the function returns an object for every entry in <code>ALL_TEAMS_NAME</code>; otherwise, it returns a single object for the specified team. Later in the project, the app calls this function to transform the user’s team information.</p>

 Create a file to handle authentication 

<p>Create an <code>auth.js</code> file for this step. This file uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/openid-client">openid-client</a> library to handle the OIDC flow: it logs users in, exchanges the authorization code for tokens, and logs them out. It also defines a middleware that guards protected routes.</p>

<p>In the auth.js file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import * as client from "openid-client";
import "dotenv/config";

import { getModifiedTeam, userTeamMap } from './utils.js';

async function getClientConfig() {
  return await client.discovery(new URL(process.env.OKTA_ISSUER), process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID, process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET);
}

export async function login(req, res) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const code_verifier = client.randomPKCECodeVerifier();
    const code_challenge = await client.calculatePKCECodeChallenge(code_verifier);
    const state = client.randomState();

    req.session.pkce = { code_verifier, state };
    req.session.save(); 

    const authUrl = client.buildAuthorizationUrl(openIdClientConfig, {
      scope: "openid profile email offline_access",
      state,
      code_challenge,
      code_challenge_method: "S256",
      redirect_uri: `${process.env.APP_BASE_URL}/authorization-code/callback`,
    });

    res.redirect(authUrl);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Something failed during the authorization request");
  }
}

function getCallbackUrlWithParams(req) {
  const host = req.headers["x-forwarded-host"] || req.headers.host || "localhost";
  const protocol = req.headers["x-forwarded-proto"] || req.protocol;
  const currentUrl = new URL(`${protocol}://${host}${req.originalUrl}`);
  return currentUrl;
}

export async function authCallback(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const { pkce } = req.session;

    if (!pkce || !pkce.code_verifier || !pkce.state) {
      throw new Error("Login session expired or invalid. Please try logging in again.");
    }

    const tokenSet = await client.authorizationCodeGrant(openIdClientConfig, getCallbackUrlWithParams(req), {
      pkceCodeVerifier: pkce.code_verifier,
      expectedState: pkce.state,
    });

    const { name, email } = tokenSet.claims();
    const teams = getModifiedTeam(userTeamMap[email]);

    const userProfile = {
      name,
      email,
      teams,
      idToken: tokenSet.id_token,
    };

    delete req.session.pkce;

    req.logIn(userProfile, (err) =&gt; {
      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }

      return res.redirect("/dashboard");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Authentication error:", error.message);
    return res.status(500).send(`Authentication failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

export async function logout(req, res) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const id_token_hint = req.user?.idToken;

    const logoutUrl = client.buildEndSessionUrl(openIdClientConfig, {
      id_token_hint,
      post_logout_redirect_uri: process.env.POST_LOGOUT_URL,
    });

    req.logout((err) =&gt; {
      if (err) return next(err);

      req.session.destroy((err) =&gt; {
        if (err) return next(err);
        res.redirect(logoutUrl);
      });
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Something went wrong during logout.');
  }
}

export function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
}
</code>   

<p>This file includes the following functions:</p>

 
   <code>getClientConfig</code> - Retrieves the authorization server’s metadata using the discovery endpoint. 
   <code>login</code> - This function starts the Authorization Code + PKCE flow. It generates the required values to enable PKCE: the code_verifier and code_challenge. These values, along with the <code>state</code> value protect the user sign in process from attack vectors. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">PKCE</a> protects against auth code interception attacks, and the state parameter protects against <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a>. The openid-client builds the user sign in URL with these values and redirects the user to Okta to complete the authentication challenge. 
   <code>getCallbackUrlWithParams</code> - Reconstructs the complete callback URL, including protocol, host, path, and query. 
   <code>authCallback</code> - This function runs when the user redirects back to the app after the authentication challenge succeeds. At this point, the redirect URL back into the application includes the auth code. The OIDC client verifies the auth code by checking that the state value matches the parameter in the first redirect. Once verified, the openid-client library uses the auth code for the token exchange by adding the code_verifier to the token request. The authorization server validates the auth code and the code_verifier value to ensure the request comes from the client making the original authentication request, mitigating attacks using stolen auth codes.
Once we get back valid tokens, we handle the app’s business logic, such as mapping the user to a team and storing the profile details and ID token in the session. If everything succeeds, it redirects the user to the dashboard. 
   <code>logout</code> - Logs the user out of the app and redirects to the post-logout URL. 
   <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> - Middleware that allows authenticated users to proceed and redirects others to the login page. 
 

 Set up routing in Express 

<p>Now things start to come together and feel like a real app. The <code>routes.js</code> file defines all the essential routes, from login and logout to viewing your profile, the expense dashboard, and individual team expense pages. The app handles each endpoint’s core logic and checks a user’s authentication status before granting access to protected pages.</p>

<p>It acts as our app’s traffic controller, directing users to the right pages and ensuring that only logged-in users can view sensitive information like the expense dashboard or group details. This structure keeps our app organized and secure and lays the foundation for a smooth user experience.</p>

   <code>import express from "express";
import "dotenv/config";

import { authCallback, ensureAuthenticated, login, logout } from "./auth.js";
import { dummyExpenseData } from './utils.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.render("home", { title: "Home", user: req.user });
});

router.get("/login", login);

router.get("/authorization-code/callback", authCallback);

router.get("/profile", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.render("profile", { title: "Profile", user: req.user });
});

router.get("/dashboard", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) =&gt; {
  const team = req.user?.teams || [];

  res.render("dashboard", {
    title: "Dashboard",
    user: req.user,
    team,
  });
});

router.get("/team/:id", ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) =&gt; {
  const teamId = req.params.id;
  const teamList = req.user?.teams || [];

  const team = teamList.find((team) =&gt; team.id === teamId);
  if (!team) {
    return res.status(404).send("Team not found");
  }

  const expenses = dummyExpenseData[teamId];
  const total = expenses.reduce((sum, exp) =&gt; sum + exp.amount, 0);

  res.render("expenses", {
    title: team.name,
    user: req.user,
    team,
    expenses,
    total,
  });
});

router.get("/logout", logout);

export default router;
</code>   

 Add EJS views in Express 

<p>Now it’s time to give the app a user interface. You’ll use EJS templates to build pages that respond dynamically to who’s logged in and what data they see. The app uses <code>ejs</code> templates to render the pages, plus <code>express-ejs-layouts</code> for common layout structures.</p>

<p>Create a folder named <code>views</code>, then add the following EJS files:</p>

<p>home.ejs</p>

   <code>&lt;% if (user) { %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome, &lt;%= user.name || 'User' %&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Log your expenses and manage your team's spending on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% if (user) { %&gt;
&lt;a href="/dashboard" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Go to Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;a href="/login" class="btn btn-success"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

</code>   

<p>profile.ejs</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Profile&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; font-size: 16px;"&gt;Name:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;%= user.name %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2 style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; font-size: 16px;"&gt;Email:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;%= user.email %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>layout.ejs</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

 Run the Express app with authentication 

<p>In your terminal, start the server:</p>

<p><code>npm start</code></p>

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>

<p>Click Login and authenticate with your Okta account. The app then displays your Expense Dashboard, Profile, and a Log out option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: When you’re signed in to the Developer Console as an admin, Okta keeps your org session active and automatically logs you into the app. To test other user accounts, use an incognito tab to test the login flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the features I used in this project to build a secure expense dashboard:</p>

 
   
    <p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity and authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0.</p>
   
   
    <p>Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is the most secure flow for server-side and browser-based web apps.</p>

            <p>With its aim of ‘digitising’ the North Atlantic via an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) barrier comprising networked ships, uncrewed vehicles (UVs) and AI-enabled acoustic sensors, Project CABOT is reshaping how undersea threats are detected and deterred.</p>
<p>On 16th July, representatives from thirty SMEs gathered at the National Museum of the Royal Navy to rally around Project CABOT’s problem statement.&nbsp;<br>
Hosted by Thales, the day was one of collaboration, curiosity and shared intent, with each organisation communicating how their current, evolving and future capabilities might contribute to the programme’s success. Collaborative workshops troubleshooted the sorts of challenges that might stall or scupper what the Royal Navy is trying to get done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the sun set over Portsmouth, so too did the energy in the room become increasingly invigorated and infectious. After all, CABOT presents an enticing, extraordinary opportunity for industry - one in which it’s not simply delivering solutions but, instead, solving problems and defining an approach with knowledge sharing, trust and accountability at the helm - with an ecosystem of partners working together to deliver.</p>
 Unpacking CABOT’s complexity 
<p>CABOT is not a standalone initiative. It’s grounded firmly within the broader strategic imperative for persistent, integrated and decisive ASW capability across the North Atlantic. The stakes are high: as undersea threats proliferate and adversaries grow more agile and emboldened, so too must the UK’s ability to detect, track, and respond with equal speed and accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the programme’s challenges range from sensor fusion and data latency to the orchestration of autonomous systems at scale, each buffeted by environmental factors (temperatures, salinity, currents and seabed topography) which will affect the ongoing effectiveness of the ASW barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power supply and sustainability remains a constraint for long-duration, real-world deployments, especially when many current autonomous platforms can only stay on task for a few days.</p>
<p>Then there are the more bureaucratic, institutional barriers to greater industry collaboration and SME engagement with programmes like CABOT. Where SMEs face time-intensive, costly compliance requirements and bidding processes that divert resources away from core business activities. There may also be difficulty connecting with - and differentiating themselves from - larger organisations, and limited access to funding (to name but a few).</p>
<p>But the mood in the room was far from daunted. Instead, optimism and urgency coexisted. Participants weren't there to admire the problem; they were there to dismantle it.</p>
 Strength in numbers: the enterprise approach to subsea defence 
<p>Agile, inventive and unburdened by bureaucracy, the SME ecosystem is both a critical enabler of CABOT and a catalyst for the future of ASW more widely. It’s one that Thales has been curating deliberately over time - connecting capabilities, nurturing relationships and creating the conditions for trust to flourish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A useful example is the collective effort of SMEs in supporting the Royal Navy’s Dreadnought submarines with Sonar 2076, one of the most advanced systems of its kind. Spearhead (rapid capability, development and deployment in ASW) and CUES&nbsp;(Complex Underwater Environmental Sensor)&nbsp;are also demonstrations of how bringing innovation to the front line relies on the ability to integrate and iterate quickly, backed by the flexibility and specialist knowledge that smaller suppliers bring.</p>
<p>The benefits are mutual. Where SMEs help larger, slower, bureaucracy-bound organisations stay sharp and responsive, these same organisations can bring scale, insight and access to elevate the efforts of SMEs and prospective partners. Decades of close customer engagement and minds full of institutional knowledge mean companies like Thales can ground the aspirations and innovations of SMEs in the current operational context, helping whole ecosystems understand not just what the problem is, but how it plays out on the front line.&nbsp;</p>
 From North Atlantic to global stage: CABOT’s strategic ripple 
<p>Project CABOT may be focused on a specific challenge in a specific theatre, but it’s reflective of a much broader strategic need: shoring up the UK’s defence and industrial resilience at sea, on land and in the skies - and creating and sustaining SQEP’s (Suitably Qualified and Experienced People) against the backdrop of emerging technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course there is a defence dividend that comes along with the SME ecosystem approach - investment in jobs and communities, localised prosperity and the associated economic benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where plans like Readiness 2030 (previously ReArm Europe) signal demand and intent to fortify the West’s competitive edge against rising geopolitical instability, Project CABOT serves as a testbed for how the UK and its partners can deliver capability at pace and with purpose, underscored by an enterprise approach with SME mission partners deeply embedded from the outset.</p>
<p>Because Thales knows as well as its current and potential partners: when it comes to making sure the UK and its allies are ready, resilient and perpetually prepared, it’ll be all hands on deck.<br>

 Identity Fraud: A $50 billion opportunity in disguise for insurance companies&nbsp; 



<p>Identity fraud isn’t slowing down. In fact, it’s accelerating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to recent projections, global identity fraud losses will pass $50 billion by 2025, driven by phishing, synthetic identities, and data breaches across digital ecosystems. For insurance providers, this growing crisis is not just a threat. It’s a massive opportunity to offer high-value, proactive solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter identity fraud solutions for insurance: bundled tools and services that go beyond claims and coverage to actively protect customers in their everyday digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What’s driving the surge in identity fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>As more of life moves online, and with generative AI and dark web data trading on the rise, identity theft has become faster, smarter, and far more widespread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key trends include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Synthetic identity fraud, where fake personas are created using real and fabricated data. 



 Phishing and account takeovers, primarily through mobile apps and SMS.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Credential stuffing, using leaked passwords to access personal accounts. 



 Digital impersonation, aided by AI-generated photos, voices, and documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Traditional insurance offerings aren’t built to handle these threats, but privacy and identity protection bundles are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 A new layer of protection: Digital identity bundles 



<p>Leading insurers are now bundling digital identity protection with their offerings, helping policyholders stay ahead of fraud and bounce back faster when it strikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundled identity fraud tools may include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Virtual cards for safer online purchases&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Masked phone numbers and emails to protect personal contact info 



 Dark web monitoring and breach alerts&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Credit and identity theft monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Wallet-based credentials for secure authentication and claims access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>By embedding these tools into policies, insurers add measurable value to customers’ lives while opening up entirely new lines of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why identity protection is a smart revenue play&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Here’s what makes identity fraud solutions so attractive for insurers:</p>



 
 Recurring revenue potential from subscription-based privacy tools&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Cross-sell and upsell opportunities during digital onboarding and renewals 



 Improved retention through proactive risk reduction and service stickiness&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Lower fraud-related claims through early detection and secure communication&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Differentiation in a market where most offerings feel commoditized&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Plus, identity protection is a need that transcends age and demographics. Whether you’re protecting a retiree from phishing or a young family from account takeover, the value is straightforward to communicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Leading with privacy builds trust&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Consumer surveys show growing demand for brands that prioritize privacy:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-report-2023.pdf">81% of consumers</a> say a company’s data practices influence their buying decisions&nbsp; 



 72% are more likely to stay loyal to brands that give them control over personal data&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Offering embedded identity protection doesn’t just reduce fraud, it sends a powerful signal. You’re not just selling policies. You’re safeguarding your customers’ digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Getting started: Partnering for success&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Insurers don’t need to build these tools in-house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with privacy and identity technology providers allows you to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Launch fast with white-labeled apps or SDKs&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Customize offerings for different policyholder segments&nbsp; 



 Integrate into existing claims, onboarding, and renewal flows&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>From virtual communications to secure claims access, everything can be built into the policy experience, no heavy development is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2025 and beyond, identity fraud solutions for insurance won’t just be nice to have, they’ll be expected. Consumers are looking for comprehensive protection, and insurers that deliver it will earn more than just premiums. They’ll earn long-term loyalty, new revenue, and a strong position in a digital-first world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to differentiate your insurance offering with identity fraud protection?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. commercial lenders are under new pressure to verify businesses and beneficial owners as part of strengthened AML obligations. This article outlines how KYB and UBO discovery tools can help lenders meet FinCEN’s rules, reduce fraud, and accelerate onboarding for business borrowers.</p>
 
 In the United States, commercial lenders—from regional banks to online small business platforms—face a new compliance reality in 2025. FinCEN’s implementation of the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and enhanced customer due diligence (CDD) rules are reshaping the expectations for how lenders verify the legitimacy of business borrowers. 
<p>The stakes are high: lenders must not only validate the businesses they serve but also uncover who really owns and controls them.</p>
 The Regulatory Shift 
<p>The CTA, fully in effect as of 2024, created a new federal Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) registry. But that doesn’t remove responsibility from lenders – it adds to it.</p>
<p>Under FinCEN’s rules, lenders must:</p>
 
 Identify and verify the legal entity (KYB) 
 Determine and validate all beneficial owners (UBO discovery) 
 Maintain auditable records of CDD 
 Monitor for changes in ownership or control over time 
 
<p>This is now true for traditional banks, fintech lenders, equipment leasing firms, and alternative credit providers.</p>
 Compliance Challenges for Lenders 
<p>1. Complex Ownership Structures<br>
Many borrowers – especially LLCs, holding companies, and startups—use layered or indirect structures that obscure ownership.</p>
<p>2. High Volume, Low Margin<br>
Lenders often manage thousands of applications a month, leaving little room for manual document collection and review.</p>
<p>3. Incomplete or Stale Data<br>
Borrowers may submit outdated records or omit key beneficial owners, exposing lenders to audit risk.</p>
<p>4. Fragmented Systems<br>
Loan origination platforms, KYC tools, and document management systems are often disconnected, creating data silos.</p>
 How iComply Supports Commercial Lending Compliance 
<p>iComply’s platform provides commercial lenders with a streamlined, audit-ready approach to KYB and UBO checks.</p>
 1. Business Verification (KYB) 
 
 Verify entity status using registration databases and public records 
 Match corporate information to legal documents 
 Confirm business address, phone, domain, and operations 
 
 2. Beneficial Ownership Discovery 
 
 Identify UBOs using automated data extraction and relationship mapping 
 Flag nominees, trustees, and shell structures 
 Apply configurable ownership thresholds for verification 
 
 3. Smart Document Collection 
 
 Request Articles of Incorporation, operating agreements, and shareholder data via guided client portals 
 Use risk-based triggers to escalate required documentation 
 
 4. Continuous Monitoring and Refresh 
 
 Track changes in ownership or control 
 Automate annual review cycles or risk-triggered updates 
 
 5. Full Audit Logs and Reporting 
 
 Log all verification steps, document uploads, and screening decisions 
 Export CDD reports for internal audits or regulatory reviews 
 
 Case Insight: Mid-Market Equipment Lender 
<p>A U.S. equipment financing firm used iComply to streamline UBO checks for SMB borrowers. In just 60 days, they:</p>
 
 Reduced average application processing time by 48% 
 Flagged and escalated 12 high-risk entities that previously passed manual reviews 
 Improved audit readiness with complete BO documentation trails 
 
 2025 Outlook for Commercial Lenders 
 
 FinCEN Enforcement Actions: Expect closer scrutiny of lenders’ KYB and BOI alignment 
 Integration Pressure: Regulators may push for integrated CDD systems across onboarding and underwriting 
 Emerging State-Level Rules: States like New York and California are considering BOI verification mandates beyond federal requirements 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Lenders that proactively modernize KYB and UBO workflows can reduce fraud, improve credit quality, and stay ahead of mounting regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Book a demo with iComply to see how we help commercial lenders accelerate onboarding while maintaining full KYB/UBO compliance in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<p>Q: When is the HPP Mainnet launching?<br> The launch is happening very soon. While we initially targeted Q4, development has moved ahead of schedule. The private mainnet is up and running with select builders. We’re not sharing an exact date to avoid setting unrealistic expectations, but all signs point to a Q3 public&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Q: Will HPP offer grants or early-stage builder incentives?<br> We’re not launching a traditional grants program. Instead, we’re supporting builders through milestone-based assistance. If a project aligns with HPP’s long-term vision (especially in AI and Web3), we’re open to providing structured support. The goal is to back teams that deliver, not just&nbsp;promise.</p><p>Q: Are there any big partnerships coming?<br> Yes, but “partnership” can mean many things. Rather than vague announcements, we encourage more specific questions — are you asking about integrations, infrastructure, exchanges, or something else? We’re engaged in multiple partnership conversations, but we prefer to discuss them in the right&nbsp;context.</p><p>Q: Are DevTools available for developers building on HPP?<br> Yes. You can already access early DevTools on HPP.io, including resources for agent deployment, off-chain reasoning, and microtransaction support. More SDKs and templates are being developed to make HPP more attractive to AI-native builders.</p><p>Q: How will gas fees compare to Polygon or Arbitrum?<br> We’ll provide more details closer to the public launch. Right now, we’re focused on minimizing friction for high-frequency, micro-value transactions between agents. Fee structure comparisons will become more concrete as the network&nbsp;matures.</p><p>Q: What’s happening with Aergo staking? Some users didn’t receive expected rewards.<br> Staking is active, and rewards are being distributed as outlined in the documentation. We encourage everyone to carefully review the staking terms. If expectations weren’t met, it’s often due to a misunderstanding of the reward structure. We’ll share the docs again for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Q: Should we be worried about AI taking jobs?<br> Yes, especially if people don’t adapt. AI will reduce the need for human labor in many sectors, including skilled ones. But those who embrace AI tools and integrate them into their work will remain valuable. The best way to stay ahead is to become the AI expert in your field and lead the change rather than resist&nbsp;it.</p><p>Q: How are you already adapting to AI at VaaSBlock and HPP?<br> We’ve moved away from traditional hiring plans. Instead, we operate on a “solutions-first” mindset. For any task or challenge, we ask if AI can solve it before assigning it to a person. When we do bring people in, it’s often for specialized, time-bound work. This has helped us remain lean and adaptable in a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>Q: Final thoughts from this session?<br> HPP is more than a new chain. It’s the infrastructure layer for intelligent, decentralized coordination. From agent-driven services to modular AI tools, we’re building a future where applications don’t just run, they think, reason, and transact in real time. The public mainnet is coming soon, and we can’t wait to see what the community builds&nbsp;next.</p><p>Stay connected:<br> → DevTools &amp; ecosystem: <a href="https://www.hpp.io/">HPP.io</a><br> → Community chat: <a href="https://t.me/aergoofficial">Telegram</a><br> → Real-time updates: <a href="https://x.com/aergo_io">@aergo_io</a></p><p>Let us know your questions for next week.

<p>We’d like to congratulate Alison Mangiero and the Crypto Council for Innovation on a powerful and forward-looking testimony before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee. The hearing, titled “<a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mangiero-Testimony.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,</a>” spotlighted critical issues surrounding digital asset policy, and we’re proud that SpruceID’s work in privacy-preserving digital identity was highlighted as part of the solution.</p><p>As Alison noted in her remarks, digital assets reshape how we transfer value, access financial services, and verify identity. A key challenge in this transformation is ensuring that digital identity systems are secure, interoperable, and resistant to evolving threats like deepfakes generated by AI. That’s where blockchain-based approaches can play a defining role.</p><blockquote>“Today, for less than $15, artificial intelligence can generate images of people and fake IDs that can fool current identity verification security solutions. But companies, like SpruceID, are working on applications of blockchain and cryptography that have security features that even AI cannot break.” - Alison Mangiero, Crypto Council for Innovation</blockquote> Why Identity Is Core to Crypto <p>At first glance, identity and crypto may seem like separate domains, but they are deeply connected. Blockchain-based systems, by design, enable trust without intermediaries. But to participate in real-world applications, such as opening a financial account, signing a contract, or receiving government benefits, users still need a secure way to prove who they are. Privacy-preserving digital identity provides that missing link.</p><p>Using cryptographic credentials that can be selectively disclosed, individuals can prove facts about themselves (like age or residency) without oversharing personal information. This aligns with the values of the crypto ecosystem, like decentralization, privacy, and user control, while also addressing urgent needs around fraud prevention, compliance, and equitable access.</p> Real-World Deployment at Scale <p>This work is already happening. The California Department of Motor Vehicles has issued over two million mobile driver’s licenses using SpruceID’s technology, enabling residents to prove their identity online with strong privacy protections and safeguards against synthetic fraud. California is also exploring additional ways to unlock new efficiencies in public service delivery.</p> Collaborating on National Standards <p>Beyond state-level innovation, SpruceID is working with the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> and the <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)</a> to demonstrate how digital credentials, when paired with regulatory clarity from agencies like FinCEN, can streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and improve compliance across the financial sector.</p><p>As digital identity becomes foundational to safe participation in the digital economy, collaboration across public and private sectors will be key.</p> Building the Next Generation of Public Infrastructure <p>SpruceID’s mention in this testimony is just one piece of a much larger effort. We’re especially grateful to the public servants and policymakers working to ensure that digital infrastructure in the U.S. is secure, privacy-preserving, and future-ready.</p> <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mangiero-Testimony.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Full Testimony</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

             Thales Alenia Space Italy to build the Multi-Purpose Habitation module for the Moon 
 
 The Multi-Purpose Habitation module is a key building block in the Artemis roadmap for establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon. It will allow astronauts to live on the lunar surface to conduct science experiments and test initial habitability. 
 By combining module design activities with future collaborations leveraging Italy’s technological and manufacturing capabilities, the company will deliver a secure, comfortable and multifunctional habitat module for astronauts, fully compatible with other systems and components. 
 As part of the Italian Space Agency’s program, this contract strengthens the pivotal roles of Thales Alenia Space Italy and Italy in advancing crewed and robotic space exploration on the Moon and beyond. 
 Lunar exploration will benefit from Thales Alenia Space Italy’s cutting-edge technology, expertise and long experience in space exploration, space transportation systems and orbital infrastructures, that could pave the way for future missions to Mars. 
 
<p>Rome, July 25, 2025 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to perform the preliminary design phase, including development of critical enabling technologies, of the pressurized Multi-Purpose Habitation (MPH) module for the lunar surface.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planned for launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in 2033, the MPH module will be the first ever dedicated habitation asset on the lunar surface as part of the Artemis Accords between NASA and ASI for bilateral Moon cooperation. The MPH module will safely host astronauts during their missions, support surface operations, enable scientific research experiments both with and without the presence of a human crew; and have the capability to move on the surface.</p>
<p>Designed for a minimum operational lifespan of 10 years, the MPH will serve as a permanent surface habitat, capable of operating synergistically with other elements of the Artemis architecture.</p>
 Part rover, part lunar shelter 
<p>Over the course of the two-year contract, Thales Alenia Space Italy will act as overall prime contractor, working alongside Altec (a public-private company owned by Thales Alenia Space and ASI) and other Italian industrial entities, for the MPH preliminary design phase. The initial development will focus on enabling technologies aimed at facing the harsh environmental conditions on the lunar surface, including extreme thermal variations, pervasive lunar dust, high radiation levels, micrometeoroid impacts, and the effects of reduced lunar gravity. In collaboration with the Industrial consortium members and space agencies, the company will lead the development of the MPH module to advance scientific discovery on the Moon, enable sustainable lunar exploration and drive the knowledge and technologies needed to support human missions to Mars.</p>
<blockquote><p>Teodoro Valente, President of the Italian Space Agency, emphasized: "MPH represents yet another scientific challenge for Italy and ASI, which are planning to bring a comfortable and safe human settlement to the lunar surface, thanks to the expertise and high, competitive technological standards that Thales Alenia Space Italy has acquired internationally in the field of space habitability. The future lunar module, the result of the historic relationship between NASA and ASI, is part of a long-term investment vision that Italy has implemented, enabling us to play an increasingly leading role in the new space race and, moreover, to be a fundamental part of the Moon to Mars Strategy of NASA's Artemis program. Today's signature confirms the Italian Government's significant and ongoing commitment to supporting the development of the Space Economy and supporting Italy's globally recognized excellence. Furthermore, it is important that this act comes just days after Parliament's approval of the country's first "Space Law".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We are deeply honored that ASI has entrusted Thales Alenia Space with this contract to develop the MPH, giving us, as a leading European company, the opportunity to drive scientific and technological progress in building the first Italian human outpost on the lunar surface. This milestone will further strengthen and advance human space exploration on the Moon and beyond,” said Giampiero Di Paolo, Deputy CEO and Executive Vice President, Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space.</p>

  MicroCarb: Europe’s first mission to monitor and map atmospheric carbon dioxide successfully launched
tas

Thu, 07/24/2025 - 18:59


             
 A joint collaboration between France and the UK to map, on a global scale, the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide; the main greenhouse gas caused by human activity. 
 MicroCarb will show how space-based science can improve our understanding of the vital carbon cycle and contribute to informed climate policy decisions to help protect our planet. 
 Thales Alenia Space was responsible for the assembly, integration and testing of the satellite platform as well as launch preparations. 
 
<p>Cannes, July 26, 2025 – The scientific mission MicroCarb, led by the French space Agency CNES, was successfully launched from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>MicroCarb © CNES</p>
<p>MicroCarb is a joint mission between the UK Space Agency and French Space Agency, Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), serving as the prime contractor. The mission is co-financed by these two agencies, as well as by the European Commission and the French government within the framework of the Investments for the Future Program (PIA), managed by the National Research Agency (ANR). The satellite is designed to precisely map atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), capturing detailed data on emissions from human activities as well as absorption by natural sinks such as oceans and forests.</p>
<p>The satellite is built on the CNES Myriade platform. Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), completed the assembly, integration, and testing of the satellite platform at RAL Space in Harwell, UK, and was responsible for launch preparations. Airbus Defence and Space provided the instrument payload, the infrared spectrometer.</p>
<p>MicroCarb will operate in low Earth orbit, at an altitude of 650 km, and serves as a precursor to the European Union’s Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) mission – a constellation of three satellites, with payloads supplied by Thales Alenia Space, which will deliver precise measurements for human-induced atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane. MicroCarb complements the CO2M mission by providing early observations and valuable data, enhancing our capability for CO₂ and methane monitoring to inform climate policy makers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, a special city-scanning mode will enable the mapping of CO₂ distribution within urban areas, which are responsible for the majority of global emissions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Thorburn, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK, commented, “I am immensely proud of the contribution our teams in the UK and France have made to MicroCarb - Europe’s pioneering satellite for mapping carbon dioxide on a global scale. Huge thanks to CNES and to the UK Space Agency for the trust they have placed in us, enabling Thales Alenia Space to play a key role in advancing Europe’s leadership in climate monitoring and environmental science, and helping to protect our planet.”<br>

            <p>In July 2025, two key events reinforced Europe’s accelerating commitment to rearmament and strategic collaboration: the UK–France Defence Summit in London and the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome. These diplomatic and industrial milestones underscore the importance of trusted partnerships, UK-built industrial capabilities, and advanced technology in deterring aggression and safeguarding shared national security.</p>
 UK–France Defence Summit: Renewing the Tech Partnership 
<p>The UK–France Defence Summit, held during President Macron’s state visit, marked a renewed commitment to co-developing future technologies across AI, electromagnetic defence systems, and critical infrastructure resilience — all central to NATO's focus on scalable, interoperable readiness.</p>
<p>Thales is proud to support this agenda. UK Government announcements recognised our £40 million investment in cortAIx UK as a pivotal enabler of mission-critical AI for mission-critical AI across sense to effect. This was showcased as part of the UK–France Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>cortAIx UK is Thales’ AI accelerator — part of a global network — focused on developing explainable, secure, and human-in-the-loop AI. Areas of work include sensor fusion, threat detection, autonomy, and AI-enhanced command decisions. The programme supports cross-border R&amp;D, including collaboration with UK SMEs and academic partners, and reflects a shared industrial ambition to maintain NATO’s technological edge.</p>
<p>This initiative directly supports Europe’s broader rearmament strategy — accelerating innovation and transitioning trusted AI from research to operational deployment. This investment includes the creation of 200 highly skilled AI and data specialist roles in the UK.</p>
 Supporting Ukraine: Industrial Investment &amp; Air Defence Readiness 
<p>At the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome, the UK Government announced a major air-defence contract with Thales to supply more than 5,000 missiles, valued at up to £283 million. The package supports frontline Ukrainian forces and sustains advanced manufacturing in the UK, including skilled jobs in Belfast.</p>
<p>This programme exemplifies Thales' role in enabling the UK’s contribution to Rearm Europe — delivering UK-built, export-ready capability that supports allied deterrence and enhances operational tempo in high-threat environments.</p>
<p>As European nations reconstitute their munitions stockpiles and bolster resilience, the UK–Ukraine air defence partnership reflects a wider strategic shift: regenerating defence capacity at speed and scale through trusted industrial alliances.</p>
 Thales at the Forefront: Mission-Critical AI &amp; Trusted Systems 
<p>cortAIx UK is scaling rapidly, with:</p>
 
 200 AI and data science specialists recruited by end of 2025, aligned with the UK Government’s AI Opportunities Action Plan. 
 Integration into Thales’ global cortAIx network of 600+ experts and 100+ AI-enabled systems. 
 Strategic partnerships with SMEs and universities — including UK partners in industry and academia — to industrialise and deploy trusted AI. 
 
<p>Key operational use cases currently focus on:</p>
 
 Maritime mine countermeasures 
 Electro-optical and radar data classification and fusion 
 Automated threat detection 
 
<p>Our approach remains human-centred: prioritising explainability, cybersecurity, frugality, and trust. This makes our systems not just innovative but operationally effective, ethical, and scalable across NATO forces.</p>
 The Strategic Value of These Partnerships 
<p>Together, these announcements highlight:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A shared Franco-British ambition to co-develop next-generation defence technology<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thales’ ability to deliver UK-built industrial capability that supports frontline readiness and European deterrence<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A UK-led commitment to Rearm Europe, grounded in AI-enhanced decision-making, trusted communications, and intelligent air defence<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exportable systems that sustain jobs, deepen alliances, and reinforce resilience across the NATO enterprise</p>
 Leadership Perspectives Ahead of DSEI: Strengthening Europe’s Defence Readiness 
<p>Speaking ahead of DSEI 2025, Phil Siviter, CEO of Thales in the UK, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rearmament today is not about simply replenishing stockpiles — it’s about regenerating our industrial and technological edge in partnership with our allies. At Thales, we’re proud to help the UK play a leading role — by scaling UK-built manufacturing, accelerating trusted AI, and building systems that deliver operational advantage from the factory floor to the frontline.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris Shaw, COO of Thales in the UK, added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether it’s supporting Ukraine with critical systems, powering NATO’s multi-domain C2, or shaping tomorrow’s AI-enabled battlespace, we are showing what a trusted UK-based partner can do. At DSEI, we will demonstrate how we deliver not just products, but capability, speed, and strategic impact.</p>

<p>A preview of what’s next, and a few important changes along the&nbsp;way</p><p>Ocean Nodes have come a long way since their launch in August 2024. In less than a year, we’ve seen over 1.71 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries, powered by you, our community. Together, we’ve stress tested the stack, reported bugs, experimented, and helped push the infrastructure forward. This collective effort has laid a strong foundation. Now, it’s time to build on&nbsp;it.</p><p>As we look ahead, it’s time to enter Phase 2, a new chapter that shifts the focus toward GPU-powered compute, performance-based incentives, and a more production-grade environment.</p><p>Here’s what’s changing, and how we’re preparing for what’s&nbsp;next.</p> Phase 1 rewards wrap July&nbsp;31 <p>The Ocean Nodes community has surpassed every expectation. Your contribution has proven that decentralized compute can scale globally. That effort, and your uptime, hasn’t gone unnoticed, as we currently stand at 12.45M ROSE rewards distributed. To make space for the transition into Phase 2, we’ll be ending the current rewards system as of July&nbsp;31.</p><p>Here’s why: the next stage will introduce major infrastructure updates, which require testing and refinement, with bugs and instability expected in the early stages. To keep things fair for everyone and the focus on progress towards the next stage, rewards in their current form will be paused during this time. Read&nbsp;on.</p> ONBs wrap at ONB — Perks&nbsp;ahead <p>We’re also capping Ocean Node Badges (ONBs) at ONB1. The reason is simple: initial participation was beyond projections, with over 1.71M total nodes, and we want to ensure the system remains clear and manageable going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>If you’ve earned ONB1, you’ll receive exclusive benefits in Phase 2. This is our way of recognizing the early builders who helped shape and strengthen the Ocean Nodes&nbsp;network.</p><p>The perks tied to ONB1 will be announced when Phase 2 launches. We’re making sure they’re meaningful, as per&nbsp;usual.</p> Phase 2 begins in September — with adjusted competitive rewards&nbsp;system <p>Ocean Nodes Phase 2 is set to launch in September, with a key focus on GPU-powered compute environments. This will allow for more advanced workloads and real-world AI use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>With this shift, the rewards model will be adjusted. The aim is to better reflect the value that GPU-based nodes bring to the network and to support more demanding jobs such as model training and multi-stage compute workflows.</p><p>More information about the reward structure will be shared at the time of&nbsp;launch.</p> What to expect in Phase&nbsp;2 <p>Phase 2 is all about making Ocean Nodes more powerful, usable, and aligned with real-world compute needs. Here’s a sneak peek at what’s&nbsp;coming:</p>  GPU Support — training, fine-tuning, and heavy workloads  Paid Compute Jobs — flexible pricing based on&nbsp;usage  Upgraded Monitoring System — with benchmark jobs, node history, and detailed performance metrics  Comprehensive dashboard — clearer dashboards and logs so you can see how your node is&nbsp;doing  Node Configurability — choose which features to expose or&nbsp;disable   What’s next <p>August is all about preparing for Phase 2. We’ll be testing the new system, making improvements, and finalizing how the updated rewards system will work. This will be your chance to try out what’s&nbsp;coming.</p><p>We’ll be running benchmark compute jobs on selected GPU-enabled nodes to measure performance. These benchmarks are short, simple jobs, designed to give us insight into how different setups perform. They also help us shape a reward system that’s fair, reliable, and ready for&nbsp;scale.</p> Thanks for Building With&nbsp;Us <p>As we enter this next chapter, we want to acknowledge the effort and energy this community has invested in Ocean Nodes. Phase 1 showed us what’s possible. Phase 2 is about scaling that possibility into a reliable, compute-focused network that serves real-world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>You’ve helped bring Ocean Nodes this far, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>Keep an eye on our Discord, Twitter, and blog for updates and sneak peeks as we gear up for September.</p><p>Thanks for being here. Let’s keep building!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-nodes-update-transitioning-into-phase-2-166604982c2b">Ocean Nodes Update: Transitioning into Phase 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Organic sales growth between +6% and +7%5 (vs. +5 and +6% previously) 
 Adjusted EBIT margin: 12.2% to 12.4% 
 
 
 
<p>Thales’ Board of Directors (Euronext Paris: HO) met on July 22, 2025 to review the financial statements for the first half of 20256.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The first half of 2025 confirms Thales’ strong momentum since the beginning of the year, with a significant increase in our financial indicators.<br>​<br>​Sales are up sharply, driven by the strength of our Defence and Avionics businesses, which are benefiting from continued increases in production capacity. This sustained performance enables us to raise our annual target for sales organic growth. Order intake continues to record solid momentum, in a favorable context for the vast majority of our businesses. They will once again exceed sales in 2025, offering exceptional visibility for the coming years. Adjusted EBIT margin has also improved significantly, demonstrating the relevance of the Group's strategy based on disruptive innovation, operational excellence and a relationship of trust with our customers.<br>​<br>​We are also continuing to invest in research and in expanding our industrial capacities, in order to meet the major challenges of a rapidly changing world.<br>​<br>​This solid first half is above all the result of the commitment and professionalism of Thales's 83,000 employees, to whom I extend my warmest thanks. Thanks to them, we are entering the second half of the year with an upwardly revised sales growth target.”<br>​<br>​Patrice Caine, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</p></blockquote>
 Key figures 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Order intake in the first half of 2025 amounted to €10,352 million, down -4% compared with the first half of 2024 (-4% also at constant scope and exchange rates). This slight decrease is explained by a high comparison basis, with the signing of three contracts with a unit value of more than €500 million in the first half of 2024 compared to only one in the first half of 2025. The sales momentum remains nonetheless very positive and the consolidated order book at June 30, 2025, totaled €50 billion, showing an increase of 7% compared to the first half of 2024. In this regard, the Group expects in the second half of this year the booking of the Air Defence contract signed with the United Kingdom for an amount of £1.16 billion, effective in July 2025. </p>
<p>Sales totaled €10,265 million, up 8.1% in total change and at constant scope and exchange rates compared with the first half of 2024. The increase in sales benefited notably from a solid performance of Avionics and Defence.</p>
<p>The Group reports for the first half of 2025 an Adjusted EBIT of €1,248 million, compared with €1,096 million in the first half of 2024, up 13.9% (+12.7% on an organic basis). The Adjusted EBIT margin reached 12.2% of sales, a significant increase compared to the first half of 2024 (11.5% of sales).</p>
<p>At €877 million, the Adjusted net income, Group share is up by 1% compared to last year. It incorporates a temporary additional contribution to the corporate tax in France amounting to €60 million. Excluding this exceptional impact, the Adjusted net income, Group share is up by 8%.</p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations, Group share amounted to €664 million compared to €625 million in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>Free operating cash flow was positive and amounted to €499 million, compared with -€85 million in the first half of 2024. This strong increase was driven by a significant improvement in the change in working capital requirement compared to June 30, 2024, thanks notably to a continued satisfactory payment profile from Group’s customers as well as ongoing actions taken in the context of stocks optimization.</p>
<p>Net debt reached €3 427 million at June 30, 2025 compared to €3 044 million at December 31, 2024.</p>
 Order intake 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Order intake in H1 2025 amounted to €10,352 million, down -4% compared to H1 2024 (-4% also at constant scope and exchange rates). The Group continued to benefit from excellent sales momentum across all its activities and recorded a contract with unit value in excess of €1 billion in the second quarter related to the supply of 26 Rafale Marine to India. The book-to-bill ratio is 1.01 (1.13 in the first half of 2024).</p>
<p>Thales booked 10 large orders with a unit amount exceeding €100 million in the first half of 2025, for a total amount of €2,874 million: </p>
 
 5 large orders booked in Q1 2025:<br>
 
 Contract signed with Space Norway, a Norwegian satellite operator, for the supply of the THOR 8 telecommunications satellite; 
 Order by SKY Perfect JSAT to Thales Alenia Space of JSAT-32, a geostationary telecommunications satellite; 
 Signing of a contract between Thales and the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop Argonaut, a future autonomous and versatile lunar lander designed to deliver cargo and scientific instruments to the Moon; 
 Order from the Dutch Ministry of Defence for the modernization and support of vehicle tactical simulators; 
 Order from the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) for the development, production, and maintenance of vetronics equipment for various Army vehicles as part of the SCORPION programme. 
 
 
 5 large orders booked in Q2 2025:<br>
 
 Contract related to the supply of 26 Rafale Marine to India to equip the Indian Navy;  
 As part of the SDMM (Strategic Domestic Munition Manufacturing) contract signed in 2020 for the supply of ammunition to the Australian armed forces, entry into force of years 6 to 8. The continuation of the SDMM contract concerns the design, the development, manufacture and maintenance of a variety of ammunition; 
 Contract for the delivery to Ukraine of 70 mm ammunition and the transfer of the final assembly line of certain components of this ammunition from Belgium to Ukraine; 
 Order for the production and supply of AWWS (Above-Water Warfare System) combat systems intended for frigates equipment in Europe;  
 Order by Sweden of compact multi-mission medium range Ground Master 200 radars. 
 
 
 
<p>At €7,479 million, order intake of a unit amount below €100 million showed an increase of 4% compared to the first half of 2024. Orders with a unit value of less than €10 million are up 5%.</p>
<p>Geographically9, order intake in mature markets amounted to €7,031 million, down compared to the first half of 2024 (-4% in total change and -5% on an organic basis). This decline is mainly explained by a high comparison base in the first half of 2024, which included the contract related to the order of two F126 frigates by the German Navy. <br>​Order intake in emerging markets amounted to €3,321 million, down -3% in total and organic change. The registration of the order by the Indian Navy for 26 Rafale Marine in the first half of 2025 does not fully compensate the two contracts with a unit value exceeding €500 million recorded in the first half of 2024 in those markets. ​ </p>
<p>Order intake in the Aerospace segment stood at €2,658 million compared to €2,688 million in the first half of 2024 (-3% at constant scope and exchange rates). The Avionics market enjoys sustained sales momentum in its various segments. Order intake in the Space activity, which had benefited from a favorable phasing in the first quarter with 3 orders worth more than €100 million each, was slightly down over the semester.</p>
<p>With an amount of €5,751 million (compared to €6,120 million in the first half of 2024, i.e., -6% at constant scope and exchange rates), order intake in the Defence segment continued to benefit from strong commercial momentum, while the basis for comparison with 2024 is high. Six orders with a unit amount exceeding €100 million were booked in the first half of 2025, including an order exceeding €1 billion from India for 26 Rafale Marine. The Group confirms its objective of a book-to-bill ratio above 1 in 2025 for the Defence segment, notably with the expected booking of new important contracts in the second half of the year, including the Air Defence contract with the United Kingdom for an amount of £1.16 billion, effective in July 2025. ​ The order book stood at €38.9 billion (compared to €36.5 billion in the first half of 2024), representing approximately 3.4 years of sales. </p>
<p>At €1,897 million, order intake in the Cyber &amp; Digital sector is aligned with sales, as most of the activities in this segment operate on short cycles. The order book is therefore not significant.</p>
 Sales 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Sales for the first half of 2025 stood at €10,265 million, compared to €9,493 million in the first half of 2024, up 8.1% both in total and organic changes.</p>
<p>From a geographical standpoint10, sales recorded solid growth in emerging markets, with organic growth of +10.7%. Sales in mature markets grew organically by +7.4%, driven notably by Europe (+8.9%).</p>
<p>In the Aerospace segment, sales amounted to €2,759 million, up 6.8% compared with the first half of 2024 (+5.8% at constant scope and exchange rates). This solid growth reflects the continued strong momentum in the Avionics market, driven by aftermarket activities and the military domain. Space sales remained affected by last two years’ low demand in telecommunications satellites; OEN (Observation, Exploration, Navigation) showed good performance.</p>
<p>Sales in the Defence segment totaled €5,581 million, up 13.0% compared to the first half of 2024 (+12.7% at constant scope and exchange rates). After a very strong first quarter (+15.0% at constant scope and exchange rates), the segment continued to record double-digit growth in the majority of its activities in the second quarter.</p>
<p>At €1,862 million, sales in the Cyber &amp; Digital segment decreased by -3.7% compared to the first half of 2024 (-1.9% at constant scope and exchange rates). This evolution reflects the following trends:</p>
 
 Cyber businesses recorded a decrease in the first half of 2025 (-3.5% at constant scope and exchange rates):<br>
 
 The Cyber Products business, slightly down in the second quarter after a first quarter of growth, remained affected as expected by disturbances related to the merger of Thales and Imperva’s sales forces. This now completed merger is the final step of Imperva’s integration and paves the way to the deployment of its product offering to its full potential. A progressive ramp-up in sales trajectory is expected in the second half of the year; 
 The Cyber Services business was affected by soft market demand during the first half of the year. With this offer, which represents approximately 20% of the Cyber activity (as per 2024 sales), the Group continues to refocus its strategy on segments offering profitable growth. This process, which involves streamlining and standardizing operations, aims at improving operating margin and can occasionally weigh on volumes. 
 
 
 Digital businesses were stable in the first half of 2025 (-0.8% at constant scope and exchange rates):<br>
 
 Identity and Biometrics solutions were down over half-year. The activity, which had experienced a decline in sales in 2020 due to COVID, is affected in 2025 by an unfavorable comparison effect related to the significant catch-up that occurred post-pandemic and until 2024. The segment thus returns to a more usual run rate in 2025; 
 Secure Connectivity solutions experienced robust and profitable growth, driven by digital solutions (including eSIMs as well as on-demand connectivity platforms); 
 Within the Payment Services business, digital banking solutions stood out particularly this semester and recorded a solid performance. 
 
 
 
 Results 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>The Group posted an Adjusted EBIT11 of €1,248 million for the first half of 2025, at 12.2% of sales, compared to €1,096 million (11.5% of sales) in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>The Aerospace segment recorded an Adjusted EBIT of €252 million (9.1% of sales), compared with €167 million (6.5% of sales) in the first half of 2024. The Adjusted EBIT margin recorded a strong increase, driven by the solid performance of the Avionics activities that posted a robust double-digit margin. It also benefited from the significant Adjusted EBIT improvement in Space, which is expected to be positive in 2025 before restructuring costs. </p>
<p>Adjusted EBIT for the Defence segment amounted to €720 million, compared with €639 million in the first half of 2024 (+13.5% at constant scope and exchange rates). At 12.9%, the margin in this sector is stable compared to last year (12.9% in the first half of 2024).</p>
<p>The Cyber &amp; Digital segment recorded an Adjusted EBIT of €265 million in the first half of 2025 compared to €272 million in the first half of 2024. The margin was up slightly and amounted to 14.2% of sales (against 14.1% in the first half of 2024). This evolution reflects the Group’s ability to preserve its commercial margins thanks to a strict discipline in terms of pricing policy. </p>
<p>Excluding Naval Group, unallocated EBIT amounted to -€24 million compared to -€26 million in the first half of 2024. </p>
<p>At €35 million in the first half of 2025, Naval Group’s contribution to Adjusted EBIT is lower compared to the first half of 2024. This change is mainly explained by the temporary additional contribution to corporate tax in France, whose impact on Naval Group’s share amounts to €5 million this semester and is expected to reach €8 million for the full year.</p>
<p>Cost of net financial debt amounts to -€56 million compared to -€87 million in the first half of 2024. This improvement is mainly explained by a significantly lower net debt than at June 30, 2024. Other adjusted financial income11 amounted to -€30 million over the first 6 months of 2025, compared with €32 million in the first half of 2024. This evolution reflects the non-recurrence in the first half of 2025 of exceptional items recorded during the first half of 2024, notably the distribution of dividends from non-consolidated affiliates as well as foreign exchange gains. The adjusted financial expense on pensions and other long-term employee benefits12 was stable at -€26 million compared to -€28 million in the first half of 2024.</p>
<p>Adjusted net income, Group Share12 thus amounted to €877 million, compared with €866 million in the first half of 2024, after an adjusted income tax charge12 of -€277 million compared with -€193 million in the first half of 2024. This change is mainly explained by the recording in the first half of 2025 of the additional temporary contribution to corporate tax in France, which reduced Adjusted net income by €60 million. The effective tax rate as of June 30, 2025 stood at 26.7% and at 21.0% excluding the additional contribution to corporate tax in France (compared to 20.4% as of June 30, 2024).</p>
<p>Adjusted net income, Group share, per share12 amounted to €4.27, up 1% compared with the first half of 2024 (€4.21).</p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations, Group share amounted to €664 million, an increase of 6% compared to June 30, 2024 (€625 million). </p>
 Financial position as of June 30, 2025 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Free operating cash flow was positive at €499 million, compared to -€85 million in the first half of 2024. This strong increase was mainly driven by the improvement in the change in working capital requirements.</p>
<p>Over 2025 half-year, the net balance of acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and affiliates of -€64 million mainly consisted of the final price adjustment related to the sale to Hitachi Rail of the Transport activity on May 31, 2024. The Group did not finalize any significant acquisition or disposal over the period. </p>
<p>As of June 30, 2025, the net debt amounted to €3,427 million, compared with €3,044 million as of December 31, 2024. This change mainly takes into account the net balance of disposals (acquisitions) of subsidiaries and affiliates for a negative net amount of -€64 million, dividends payments for -€586 million (-€534 million in the first half of 2024) and new lease liabilities for -€118 million (-€95 million in the first half of 2024).</p>
<p>Shareholders’ equity, Group share amounted to €7,138 million, compared with €7,515 million as of December 31, 2024. This evolution reflects the positive contribution of net income from continuing operations, Group share (+€664 million) less the dividend paid (-€586 million).</p>
 Outlook 
<p>The robust sales performance in the first half, driven by the strength of the Avionics and Defence businesses, allows the Group to raise its annual organic sales growth target.<br>​The commercial momentum in the second half is also well oriented as Thales continues to benefit from favorable prospects in the vast majority of its markets in the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p>Thales confirms its expectation of a solid increase in Adjusted EBIT margin, mainly driven by the margin progression in the Aerospace segment and continued high margin in Defence.</p>
<p>The Group still anticipates a contained direct impact of tariffs based on the information available as of July 23, 2025. Thus, the 2025 guidance assumes reciprocal tariffs of 10% from Europe and 25% from Mexico, and exclude any retaliatory measures that might be taken by Europe in this context.</p>
<p>Assuming no new disruption in the macroeconomic and geopolitical contexts, and assuming the aforementioned assumptions regarding tariffs, Thales upgrades its sales organic growth target for 2025 and confirms its other targets:</p>
 
 An unchanged book-to-bill ratio above 1; 
 An expected organic sales growth between +6% and +7%, versus to +5 to +6% previously, corresponding to a sales range of €21.8 to €22.0 billion13; 
 An Adjusted EBIT margin between 12.2% and 12.4%. 
 
<p>***</p>
<p>This press release contains certain forward-looking statements. Although Thales believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, as described in the Company's Universal Registration Document, which has been filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF).</p>

				  Traditional meets decentralized finance in our next-generation, 3-factor authentication, digital identity solution. Powered by Verifiable Credentials, authenticated biometrics, and real-time database validation, this innovation provides the assurance needed for safe international asset transactions and &nbsp;establishes seamless and secure cross-border asset flows.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth and Jake West</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Today, Indicio and Black Mountain Investment Group (“BMIG”) announced a strategic partnership to revolutionize KYC and identity verification processes for the financial and legal industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership combines Indicio’s market-leading decentralized identity and authenticated biometric technology with Black Mountain’s expertise in business solutions to create a much-needed bridge between traditional and decentralized finance that delivers scalable, fraud-resistant technologies for institutions operating in increasingly global and regulated markets.</p>
<p>Global regulatory changes are accelerating growth in the cross-border asset ecosystem and fueling the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi). Indicio and Black Mountain have developed proprietary technology that allows for a new, decentralized approach to verify investor, institution, and asset identities. This KYC is critical to scaling transactions in secure, fraud-resistant, and compliant ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio developed the most powerful decentralized digital identity solution in the marketplace by incorporating authenticated biometrics in Verifiable Credentials trust-anchored to a blockchain with real encryption. This significantly increases the level of identity assurance for remote onboarding, KYC, and digital transactions- which can now be performed more rapidly and reliably than ever before by investors and institutions through the use of this technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Indicio has developed an architectural approach to digital identity that meets the rapidly evolving needs of conventional and decentralized finance around KYC, account access, and digital asset management,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “We’re really excited to work with Black Mountain Investment Group to advance secure, seamless, decentralized trust for global financial transactions.”</p>
<p>“Trusted digital identity verification is a serious catalyst for advancing the digital transformation of and unlocking liquidity in global finance,” said Elijah Levine, CEO of BMIG. “It’s all too often that you work with the biggest and best banks and exchanges and they still operate on outdated and cumbersome KYC verification standards that are also often restricted to US-based financial transactions. When we saw the work that Indicio has been doing with biometric authentication and tamper-proof digital credentials in travel, not only did we want to invest immediately in their main business, but we also recognized that their tech is shockingly translatable to the finance industry.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We see a path towards rapid scale and believe that this technology should be implemented immediately across the biggest and best institutions in global finance for their own internal protection and liability purposes, outside of the efficiencies and liquidity that will be immediately unlocked. This partnership is centered around delivering innovative solutions that integrate the very latest technology into the rapidly expanding market of secure, privacy-preserving global asset transfers.”</p>
<p>About Indicio</p>
<p>Indicio is a global leader in Verifiable Credentials, decentralized identity, and digital trust infrastructure. From powering national identity pilots to enabling seamless international travel, Indicio helps governments and businesses build data and identity systems that are secure, privacy-preserving, and interoperable across borders and industries.</p>
<p>About Black Mountain Investment Group</p>
<p>Black Mountain Investment Group (“BMIG”) is a technology-driven back-office platform and entrepreneurial ecosystem designed to power the next generation of funds and businesses. BMIG provides operational support, strategic insight, and scalable infrastructure, empowering organizations to navigate growth and innovation at the intersection of traditional and decentralized finance.</p>

<p>“Much like ‘the cloud’ (really just someone else’s computer) or ‘the superhighway’ (I never have figured that one out), the metaphor of a ‘wallet’ has become a convenient shorthand for a tangle of technical, policy, and usability decisions.” </p>



<p>But as we keep building out digital identity ecosystems, complete with verifiable credentials, identity wallets, and cross-jurisdictional trust models, I want to ask:</p>



<p>Is the metaphor still helping us? Or is it time to kill the wallet?</p>

 Why metaphors matter 



<p>Basically, a digital wallet is a secure container for <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">digital credentials</a>. But metaphors are powerful: They shape user expectations, influence system design, and carry emotional and cultural baggage.</p>



<p>Say “wallet,” and people conjure different things:</p>



 
 A tap-to-pay credit card or mobile payment app 



 A driver’s license or ID holder 



 A catch-all pouch for everything from boarding passes to coffee shop punch cards to loyalty cards 
 



<p>This matters because the assumptions baked into that metaphor directly affect how systems are designed and how people trust (or don’t) them.</p>



 One word, too many meanings 



<p>Consider Google Wallet. It assumes it can store just about anything, provided protocols and formats are supported. Apple Wallet is similarly broad in scope but imposes a more curated, policy-heavy experience; credentials often go through approval workflows, and Apple maintains tight control over what gets displayed.</p>



<p>Then you have purpose-built wallets like the SIROS Foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/wwWallet">wwWallet</a>, which explicitly aim for neutrality and open standards. In that case, “wallet” is just the delivery mechanism: Credentials come from many issuers, and the wallet doesn’t try to second-guess the user’s intent.</p>



<p>So far, so good. But many users still assume they’ll only need one wallet. After all, they only carry one physical one, right?</p>



<p>Well… not exactly.</p>



 Surprise: you’re already carrying multiple wallets 



<p>A growing number of users already interact with multiple wallet-like experiences; they just don’t recognize them as such.</p>



<p>Take a gym app with a scannable membership barcode. That’s not a digital wallet; it’s just displaying an unprotected credential. But a university app that stores a student ID, enables cryptographic access to campus systems, or lets students securely share transcripts? That’s starting to behave like a wallet. These apps issue, hold, and present credentials, but often without using open standards, secure storage mechanisms, or user-centric consent flows. In practice, they’re wallet-adjacent without meeting the formal definitions found in standards like ISO/IEC 18013-5 or NIST guidance.</p>



<p>This distinction matters when issuers or verifiers only trust credentials handled within their own apps. If every organization builds its own closed-loop container, users end up juggling multiple apps that can’t talk to each other. That may be good for organizational control, but it’s bad for user experience, portability, and interoperability.</p>



<p>To make sense of this ambiguity, researchers Lukkiena, de Reuver, and Bharosa offer a <a href="https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/DGO2025/article/view/1039/1073">taxonomy of digital wallets</a> that identifies 10 core characteristics across three levels: wallet architecture, functional capabilities, and governance model. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341070789057605633/">Henk Marsman</a>, for pointing me to this article!) For example, wallets can be custodial or self-sovereign, anchored to a specific platform or OS-agnostic, and focused on narrow single-issuer use cases or broader cross-domain ecosystems. Their conclusion? There’s no universal definition of “wallet,” and that’s a problem when different actors use the same word but mean fundamentally different things. When it takes this much effort to explain what we mean by “wallet,” maybe it’s time to admit the metaphor is no longer fit for purpose.</p>



 Who controls permission and consent? 



<p>The wallet metaphor also glosses over deeper architectural questions like who’s in charge of permission and consent.</p>



<p>When you hand someone your physical wallet, no pop-up asks if you’re sure. You’ve already decided what to share. Digital systems, though, are expected to do better. They support selective disclosure (I hope), enforce access policies, and (ideally) prompt you when data is about to be shared.</p>



<p>But when the wallet is mediated by a browser or embedded in a platform you don’t control, who’s responsible for enforcing that consent? The wallet? The issuer? The verifier? The browser? Even people deeply involved don’t agree on the answers here.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem">NIST blog on digital wallets</a> offers a definition, and that definition sets the stage for various assumptions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A digital wallet is a native application on your mobile device—though in the future, may also be stored in the cloud—that holds and secures your VDCs… Depending on the entity issuing the VDC, users may need to download a wallet application supported by the credential issuer before a VDC can be issued to their phone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is useful, but it also normalizes a model where wallets are tied to issuers, not users. If every credential needs its own issuer-approved container, we’re not talking about wallets anymore. We’re talking about app-specific credential lockers. That’s a very different interaction model and one that may undermine user control.</p>



 When regulation and design don’t talk to each other 



<p>In Europe, things get even murkier. The EU’s data protection frameworks (GDPR, eIDAS 2.0) layer in consent requirements that assume a clear user interface and intentional disclosure. A 2023 study published in the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology, however, highlighted just how far the actual UX has drifted from those principles.</p>



<p>In “<a href="https://hal.science/hal-04913768/">Two Worlds Apart! Closing the Gap Between Regulating EU Consent and User Studies</a>,” researchers Bielova, Santos, and Gray examined real consent flows and found a minefield of “dark patterns” and manipulation. Decline buttons are hidden or misleading, options are presented in confusing hierarchies, and “Accept All” is given visual prominence over granular choices.</p>



<p>If we’re now building digital wallets that insert themselves into this consent process, we have to ask: are we replicating these same patterns? Are we genuinely improving user control or just rebranding old manipulations?</p>



 Designing for privacy: lessons from Kantara 



<p>The Kantara Initiative’s <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/overview">Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials (PEMC) Implementers Report</a> offers a different and possibly more practical perspective. It doesn’t try to define “wallet” from a metaphorical standpoint. Instead, it focuses on capabilities that put the user back in charge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The wallet SHALL be designed to facilitate user understanding and control over what data is being shared and for what purpose. User consent SHALL be explicit, contextual, and revocable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a higher bar than most current systems hit.</p>



<p>The report also stresses the importance of:</p>



 
 Purpose limitation: credentials should only be used for clearly defined, disclosed functions. 



 Transparency and auditability: users should be able to review where and how credentials have been used. 



 User-managed permissions: ideally, from a central UI that lets users adjust sharing policies without reissuing credentials. 
 



<p>These aren’t just checkboxes for compliance. They’re structural features that define trust. If your “wallet” can’t support these requirements, maybe it shouldn’t call itself one.</p>



 So… do we kill the wallet? 



<p>Maybe. Or maybe we reframe it.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has done a lot of work. It helped early adopters wrap their heads around verifiable credentials. It gave vendors a way to pitch new apps without diving into crypto protocols.</p>



<p>But now, it’s showing its limitations.</p>



 
 It implies singularity, when reality demands multiplicity. 



 It collapses trust boundaries, hiding the difference between issuer-owned and user-controlled containers. 



 It blurs accountability, especially when it comes to consent and user agency. 



 And it distracts regulators, who often assume the metaphor aligns with actual practice. 
 



<p>If we’re serious about building systems that scale, interoperate, and respect users, we may need to put the metaphor on pause. Maybe even kill it.</p>



<p>Or at least, give it a long-overdue retirement party.</p>



 Bonus question: Got a better metaphor? 



<p>I’m genuinely curious: What should we call these things? If “wallet” is too narrow, too payment-focused, or just too confusing, what’s the alternative?</p>



<p>Inbox? Locker? Credential safe? Something new entirely? Or is the ambiguity still worthwhile for a reason I’m missing?</p>



<p>Drop me a note. I promise not to brand it.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>00:00:04<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>00:00:26<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Why Do We Call It a Wallet? 



<p>00:00:30<br>So, have you ever stopped to wonder: why do we call it a wallet?</p>



<p>In digital identity, the term wallet has become so common that we don’t even think twice about it—much like the cloud (air quotes intended), which, as we know, is really just someone else’s computer.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has served as convenient shorthand. It wraps up a lot of complex technical, policy, and usability decisions into a single image that feels familiar.</p>



<p>But is it still serving us well? Or is it time to—dare we say—kill the wallet?</p>



<p>And yes, if you’re now hearing Elmer Fudd singing “Kill da Wabbit,” you’re not alone. It’s stuck in my head too.</p>



 



 Why Metaphors Matter 



<p>00:01:15<br>Metaphors help make the abstract more tangible. In digital identity, a wallet conjures up something:</p>



 
 Personal 



 Portable 



 Secure 



 That holds important things we don’t want to lose 
 



<p>In theory, a digital wallet does exactly that—a secure container for digital credentials.</p>



<p>00:01:34<br>However, there’s a catch.</p>



<p>Metaphors don’t just explain things—they shape them. They guide system design and influence both user and architect expectations.</p>



<p>And when a metaphor starts to mislead or restrict what’s possible, it’s time to reconsider it.</p>



 



 What Are We Really Talking About? 



<p>00:01:54<br>When we say wallet, what are we actually describing?</p>



<p>Sometimes, we mean a secure application that stores and presents digital credentials. But other times, we’re referring to:</p>



 
 A whole service ecosystem 



 Trust registries 



 Credential exchanges 



 Key management systems 
 



<p>00:02:18<br>This ambiguity creates confusion.</p>



<p>If you imagine a wallet as an app that lives only on your phone, you might not expect it to:</p>



 
 Sync across devices 



 Backup to the cloud 



 Integrate with browsers 
 



<p>So, the metaphor starts to limit understanding rather than enhance it.</p>



 



 Physical Wallets vs. Digital Identity 



<p>00:02:45<br>Think about your real wallet. You might carry:</p>



 
 Credit cards 



 A driver’s license 



 A photo of your dog 



 Maybe some cash (if you’re feeling nostalgic) 
 



<p>But your work ID might live on a badge you scan at the door.<br>Your passport is likely in a drawer.<br>Your vaccine certificate might be in an email or government portal.</p>



<p>00:03:06<br>Each credential lives in a different place and serves a different function. Yet digital credentials are expected to behave as a single type—all handled the same way.</p>



<p>That’s a problem.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor reinforces the idea that if you control something, you must physically possess it. But that’s not how real life—or digital systems—work.</p>



 



 Delegation and Flexibility 



<p>00:03:32<br>We delegate trust and control all the time.</p>



 
 Browsers remember our passwords 



 Apps access our photos 



 Others pick up prescriptions or check in for us 
 



<p>00:03:44<br>Digital identity must support this same flexibility—not just theoretically, but by design.</p>



<p>If the wallet metaphor implies identity is always something you carry and only you carry, it fails to reflect:</p>



 
 Delegation 



 Guardianship 



 Enterprise-managed credentials 
 



<p>Sometimes, you don’t need to carry the credential—you just need to control access to it.</p>



 



 Trust, Adoption, and Governance 



<p>00:04:12<br>Another problem: the wallet metaphor implies that once you have your credentials, you’re done.</p>



<p>But really, that’s just the beginning.</p>



<p>For a credential to matter:</p>



 
 It must be accepted 



 It must be verifiable 



 It must be trusted 
 



<p>00:04:30<br>This brings us to:</p>



 
 Trust registries 



 Governance frameworks 



 Interoperability standards 
 



<p>None of these live inside the wallet. Yet without them, the wallet is just a lonely app with nowhere to go.</p>



 



 Who Are We Building For? 



<p>00:04:50<br>Are we building for everyday users—or for people like us?</p>



<p>The danger in sticking too closely to the wallet metaphor is that we end up designing for:</p>



 
 Tech-savvy users 



 Privacy-conscious individuals 



 People willing to manage keys and credentials 
 



<p>00:05:08<br>But most users aren’t in that space. They just want things to work.</p>



<p>They want identity to be seamless—not a side project.<br>And they certainly don’t want to be blamed for losing access when their private key is wiped in a phone reset—or dropped in a beer.</p>



 



 Rethinking Security and Usability 



<p>00:05:32<br>We need to stop designing for the metaphor. People aren’t all ready to manage their own cryptographic infrastructure—and that’s okay.</p>



<p>Security isn’t one-size-fits-all. Usability isn’t either.</p>



<p>There are cases where:</p>



 
 Cloud-based key management offers better recovery options 



 Delegation to trusted devices boosts usability 



 Giving users a choice increases adoption 
 



<p>We shouldn’t cling to the idea that the most secure option is always the only secure option.</p>



 



 Do We Kill the Wallet? 



<p>00:06:08<br>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has brought us this far. It’s familiar, useful, and still works in many settings.</p>



<p>But we should be:</p>



 
 More careful in how we use it 



 Clearer about what we mean 



 Open to other metaphors—or better yet, clearer explanations 
 



<p>00:06:30<br>Maybe it’s time for:</p>



 
 Identity lockers 



 Digital toolboxes 



 Credential dashboards 
 



<p>Or maybe it’s time to explain what these systems actually do—without relying on metaphor at all.</p>



 



 Language Matters 



<p>00:06:48<br>The user brings their own context. That’s who we’re building for.</p>



<p>So:</p>



 
 In specs: our language must be crystal clear 



 For users: our explanations must be accurate and inclusive 
 



<p>We may need a whole basket of metaphors, not just one.</p>

  Canadian legal professionals face growing KYC obligations. This guide explains how law firms can implement privacy-first CIP workflows that meet FINTRAC and provincial regulations with confidence.

<p>As FINTRAC and provincial law societies tighten client identification rules, Canadian law firms must adopt smarter KYC practices. This article explores how legal professionals can implement modern CIP workflows using privacy-first identity verification that aligns with both AML obligations and solicitor-client privilege.</p>
 
 Legal professionals in Canada face a growing tension: How can they meet expanding anti-money laundering (AML) and client identification obligations without compromising client confidentiality or introducing unnecessary administrative burden? 
<p>This challenge has come into sharp focus as FINTRAC increases its oversight of designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs), and as law societies across Canada revise their regulatory frameworks to align with national AML strategies. The result? Law firms are now squarely in the sights of regulators—and must update their Client Identification Procedures (CIP) accordingly.</p>
 What’s Changing for Legal KYC in Canada 
<p>Since 2022, Canadian legal regulators have progressively strengthened requirements for:</p>
 
 Verifying client identity using independent, reliable documents or information 
 Recording beneficial ownership and third-party relationships 
 Monitoring ongoing client relationships and source of funds 
 Reporting suspicious transactions under FINTRAC guidelines 
 
<p>For firms engaged in real estate, corporate structuring, or trust administration, the burden is even greater. These services have been linked to elevated money laundering risk in recent typologies published by both FINTRAC and the Cullen Commission.</p>
 Why Traditional KYC Doesn’t Work for Law Firms 
<p>Many legal practices still rely on paper-based intake forms, manual document review, or ad hoc third-party services. These approaches often fall short because they:</p>
 
 Lack defensible audit trails for regulators 
 Introduce delay and friction for clients 
 Risk privacy breaches when data is shared with cloud vendors or external processors 
 Fail to flag beneficial ownership complexity or risk indicators in real time 
 
 The iComply Advantage: Legal-Grade KYC with Built-In Privacy 
<p>iComply helps Canadian law firms modernize KYC and CIP with a secure, configurable platform that respects both privacy and compliance.</p>
 1. On-Device Identity Verification 
 
 Clients upload documents and biometrics directly through a white-labeled portal 
 Verification occurs on-device using edge computing—PII is encrypted before transmission 
 Reduces reliance on international cloud vendors or external processors 
 
 2. Real-Time Beneficial Ownership Discovery 
 
 Automatically map directors, shareholders, and UBOs of legal entities 
 Screen individuals and entities against sanctions and PEP lists 
 Apply firm-specific thresholds for EDD or review 
 
 3. Custom CIP Workflows 
 
 Configure intake flows based on practice area (e.g., real estate vs litigation) 
 Trigger additional reviews based on client type, geography, or structure 
 Maintain full audit logs for internal review and law society compliance 
 
 4. Privacy by Design 
 
 Full data residency in Canada 
 Compliance with PIPEDA, provincial privacy laws, and solicitor-client privilege 
 Consent management and data retention controls 
 
 Case Insight: Boutique Law Firm in Ontario 
<p>A three-partner corporate law firm adopted iComply to streamline CIP for incorporations and real estate closings. The firm:</p>
 
 Reduced KYC admin time by 70% 
 Enhanced its ability to detect complex beneficial ownership structures 
 Passed a Law Society of Ontario audit with commendation for data handling and audit readiness 
 
 What to Watch in 2025 
 
 Law Society Reviews: Expect more frequent spot audits and policy compliance reviews 
 Digital Identity Integration: Provinces like BC and Ontario are hoping to expand digital ID adoption 
 Cross-Border Practice Implications: U.S. and EU data protection rules may affect multi-jurisdictional practices 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Law firms that delay compliance modernization face increasing audit risk and reputational exposure. But those that lead with privacy-first, intelligent KYC can turn compliance into a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Connect with iComply to see how we support Canadian law firms with audit-ready KYC tools that respect both client trust and evolving regulatory demands.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Single-Page Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   In the Grant type section, ensure that both Authorization Code and Refresh Token are selected 
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:5173/login/callback</code> 
       Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:5173</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Single-Page App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.  You may also need to configure trusted origins for <code>http://localhost:5173</code> in Security &gt; API &gt; Trusted Origins.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



 Create the React app 

<p>We’ll use a Vite template to scaffold the project. The example app for this tutorial is a todo application called “Lister”. To create a React app named “Lister”, run the following command in your terminal to scaffold the project:</p>

   <code>  npm create vite@5.4 lister
</code>   
<p>Select React and TypeScript as the variant.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions after running the command to navigate into your app directory and installing dependencies.</p>

<p>We have extra dependencies to add. Run the following commands in your terminal.</p>

<p>Install React Router by running</p>

   <code>npm install react-router-dom@5.3.4
</code>   

<p>Install React Router types by running</p>

   <code>npm install --save-dev @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3
</code>   

<p>To use Okta authentication with our React app, let’s install the Okta SDKs by running</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-react@6.9.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@7.8.1
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>I wrote this post using Vite 5.4, React 18.3, Okta React 6.9, and Okta AuthJS SDK 7.8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this, you now have the base React project set up.</p>

 Secure routes in your React app with React Router 

<p>Open the project in your IDE. Let’s navigate to <code>App.tsx</code> and paste in the following code:</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Route, Switch, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './pages/Home.tsx';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
});

function App() {
   const history = useHistory();
   const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth,  originalUri: string) =&gt; {
       history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
   };

   return (
     &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Switch&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/" exact component={Home}/&gt;
        &lt;/Switch&gt;
     &lt;/Security&gt;
   );
}

export default App

</code>   

<p>We set up the Okta authentication SDK packages in the <code>App</code> Component. Pay attention to the <code>OktaAuth</code> config:</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
});
</code>   

<p>If you encounter any issues with the login, a good place to start debugging is from here. We’ll use environment variables to define our OIDC configuration in the app for convenience. In the root of your Lister project, create an <code>.env</code> file and edit it to look like so:</p>

   <code>VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientID}
</code>   

<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your Okta domain for example, <code>dev-123.okta.com</code> or <code>trial-123.okta.com</code>. Note the variable doesn’t include the HTTP protocol. Replace {yourOktaClientID} with the Okta client ID from the Okta application you created.</p>

<p>Before moving forward, let’s set up React Router in our project root. Navigate to <code>src/main.tsx</code> and replace the existing code with the following code snippet:</p>

   <code>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
 &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;App/&gt;
 &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;,
)
</code>   

<p>In the <code>App.tsx</code> earlier, we imported <code>Home</code> from <code>./pages/Home.tsx</code> and used it in our routing. Let’s create the <code>Home</code> component. In the <code>src</code> folder, create a <code>pages</code> folder, and in that, create a <code>Home.tsx</code> file.</p>

   <code>const Home = () =&gt; {
 return (&lt;h2&gt;You are home&lt;/h2&gt;);
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>This is a minimal home component that represents our home page.</p>

 Authenticate using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>Next, we want to add the ability to sign in and out with our Okta without social login as a starting point. We’ll add the social login connection later.</p>

<p>To do that, we’ll create the <code>SignIn</code> component and a generic <code>Layout</code> component to control user access based on their authentication. Navigate to your <code>src</code> folder, then create a <code>components</code> folder to hold child components.</p>

<p>In the newly created <code>components</code> folder, create the <code>Layout.tsx</code>, <code>Layout.css</code>, and <code>SignIn.tsx</code> files.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Layout.tsx</code> file and add the following code:</p>

   <code>import './Layout.css';
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import SignIn from "./SignIn.tsx";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import logo from '../assets/react.svg';

const Layout = ({children}) =&gt; {
 const { authState, oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const signout = async () =&gt; await oktaAuth.signOut();

 return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (&lt;&gt;
  &lt;div className="navbar"&gt;
   &lt;Link to="/"&gt;&lt;img src={logo} className="logo" /&gt;&lt;/Link&gt;
   &lt;div className="right"&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/profile"&gt;Profile&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={signout} className="no-outline"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div className="layout"&gt;
   {...children}
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/&gt;) : &lt;SignIn/&gt;;
}
export default Layout;
</code>   
<p>This component imports the <code>useOktaAuth</code> from the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> package. This React hook helps us the user’s authenticated state and gives them access to the child components of the <code>Layout</code> component. The hook also lets us sign in or out our users.</p>

<p>At the top of the file, we import <code>Layout.css</code>. Open <code>Layout.css</code> so fill in the CSS we need:</p>

   <code>.layout {
 max-width: 1280px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 padding: 2rem;
 text-align: center;
}

.layout.sign-in {
 margin-top: 35vh;
}

.logo {
 height: 32px;
 will-change: filter;
 transition: filter 300ms;
}

.navbar {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: space-between;
}
</code>   

<p>These minor stylings help the <code>Layout.tsx</code> navbar look proper. Let’s not forget the <code>SignIn</code> component used in the <code>Layout</code> component.</p>

<p>Paste the following code into <code>SignIn.tsx</code>:</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import logo from '../assets/react.svg';

const SignIn = () =&gt; {
 const { oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const signin = async () =&gt; await oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();

 return (
  &lt;div className="sign-in layout"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt; &lt;img src={logo} className="logo" alt="Logo"/&gt; Lister&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;button className="outlined" onClick={signin}&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 );
}

export default SignIn;
</code>   

<p>Here, we use the same <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to sign in our user. Lastly, we update <code>src/App.tsx</code> to use our new <code>Layout</code> component. We wrap the Layout component around the routes that require authentication. Your code now looks like this:</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Route, Switch, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './pages/Home.tsx';
import Profile from './pages/Profile.tsx';
import Layout from "./components/Layout.tsx";


const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email'],
}) ;

function App() {
   const history = useHistory();
   const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth,  originalUri: string) =&gt; {
       history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
   };

   return (
     &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
             &lt;Switch&gt;
                 &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
                 &lt;Layout&gt;
                     &lt;Route path="/" exact component={Home}/&gt;
                     &lt;Route path="/profile" component={Profile}/&gt;
                 &lt;/Layout&gt;
             &lt;/Switch&gt;
     &lt;/Security&gt;
   );
}

export default App
</code>   

<p>Be careful not to wrap the callback route in the <code>Layout</code> component, or else you’ll experience some weirdness during logins. If you look at the code above, you see we added a route for a profile component. Let’s create that component!</p>

<p>Navigate to <code>src/pages</code> and create the <code>Profile.tsx</code> and <code>Profile.css</code> files. In your <code>Profile.tsx</code> file, paste these in:</p>

   <code>import './Profile.css';
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { IDToken, UserClaims } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

const Profile= () =&gt; {
 const { authState, oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState&lt;UserClaims | null&gt;(null);

 useEffect(() =&gt; {
  if(!authState || !authState.isAuthenticated) setUserInfo(null);
  else setUserInfo((authState.idToken as IDToken).claims);
 }, [authState, oktaAuth]);

 return (userInfo) ? (
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div className="profile"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My User Profile (ID Token Claims)&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     Below is the information from your ID token which was obtained during the &amp;nbsp;
     &lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-auth-code-pkce"&gt;PKCE Flow&lt;/a&gt;
     {' '}
     and is now stored in local storage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
     This route is protected with the
     {' '}
     &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;SecureRoute&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
     {' '}
     component, which will ensure that this page cannot be accessed until you have
     authenticated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
     &lt;thead&gt;
     &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Claim&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;/tr&gt;
     &lt;/thead&gt;
     &lt;tbody&gt;
     {Object.entries(userInfo).map((claimEntry) =&gt; {
      const claimName = claimEntry[0];
      const claimValue = claimEntry[1];
      const claimId = `claim-${claimName}`;
      return (
       &lt;tr key={claimName}&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{claimName}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td id={claimId}&gt;{claimValue.toString()}&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;
      );
     })}
     &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 ) : (&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Fetching user profile...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;)
};

export default Profile;
</code>   

<p>And in your <code>Profile.css</code> file, add the following styles:</p>

   <code>td, th {
 text-align: left;
 padding: 1px 10px
}

td:first-child, th:first-child {
 border-right: 1px solid #dcdcdc;
}

table {
 max-width: 600px;
}

.profile {
 margin: auto;
}

.profile h1, p {
 text-align: left;
 width: fit-content;
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Profile</code> component shows you the information in the <code>useOktaAuth</code>. When building your profile page, you will probably use only a handful of that information.</p>

<p>Lastly, paste this helper CSS code into the <code>index.css</code> file in your folder root; it’s just minor styling tweaks to improve your app’s appearance.</p>

   <code>#root {
 font-family: Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
 line-height: 1.5;
 font-weight: 400;
 font-synthesis: none;
 text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
 -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
 -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

a, button {
 font-weight: 500;
 color: #213547;
 text-decoration: inherit;
}
a:hover, button:hover {
 color: #535bf2;
}

h1 {
 font-size: 3.2em;
 line-height: 1.1;
}

button {
 border-radius: 8px;
 border: 1px solid transparent;
 padding: 0.6em 1.2em;
 font-size: 1em;
 font-weight: 500;
 font-family: inherit;
 background-color: #1a1a1a;
 cursor: pointer;
 transition: border-color 0.25s;
}
button:hover {
 border-color: #646cff;
}
button:focus,
button:focus-visible {
 outline: 4px auto -webkit-focus-ring-color;
}
button.outlined {
 border: 1px solid;
}
button.no-outline {
 border: none;
}
button.no-outline:focus, button.no-outline:focus-visible, button.no-outline:hover, button.no-outline:active  {
 border: none;
 outline: none;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
 :root {
   color: #213547;
   background-color: #ffffff;
 }
 a:hover {
   color: #747bff;
 }
 button {
   background-color: #f9f9f9;
 }
}

</code>   

<p>Run <code>npm run dev</code> in the console. The command serves your app at <code>http://localhost:5173</code> and you should be able to sign in with your Okta account.</p>

<p>With these, all we need to do now is integrate Social Login and then make this app a PWA, both of which are straightforward!</p>

 Federated identity using Social Login 

<p>Social login is an authentication method that allows users to sign into an application using their existing credentials from platforms like Google, Facebook, or Apple. It simplifies the login process, reduces password fatigue, and enhances security by leveraging trusted identity providers. In our case, we are choosing Google as our social login provider.</p>

 Configure Google as an Identity Provider in Okta 

<p>First, we’d need to sign up for Google Workspace and create a Google project. After that, we configure Google as an Identity Provider (IDP). Follow the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/social-login/google/main/">instructions to set up Google for Social Login from Okta Developer documentation</a>.</p>

<p>When you define the OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud, use the following configuration:</p>
 
   Add <code>http://localhost:5173</code> to your authorized JavaScript Origins - this is the test server for our React application. 
   Add <code>/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code> to the Authorized redirect urls session. Replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your actual Okta domain. 
 

<p>When adding the required scopes in Google Cloud, include the <code>./auth/userinfo.email</code>, <code>./auth/userinfo.profile</code>, and the <code>openid</code> scopes.</p>

<p>After setting up Google Cloud, you’ll configure Okta. Use the following values:</p>
 
   Enable automatic account linking to make it easier for users with an Okta account to sign in with Google. 
   Add <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/configure-routing-rules.htm?">routing rules</a> to allow all logins to use Google Social Login. For this tutorial, we’re keeping the routing conditions permissive; however, you should be a lot more stringent on a production application. You can check the routing page to configure routing to fit your use case better. 
 

 Test authenticating with Google Social Login 

<p>If you run <code>npm run dev</code> and click the sign-in button, you should see the “Sign In With Google” button and your usual Okta sign-in / sign-up screen!</p>

 Set up your React app as a PWA 

<p>Lastly, let’s make our app a PWA so we can use it offline. First, we need to add a new dependency. Open the command terminal to the project’s root and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install vite-plugin-pwa@1.0.1
</code>   

<p>Next, we update our vite.config.ts in your project root to include PWA configuration and add manifest icons:</p>

   <code>import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { VitePWA } from "vite-plugin-pwa";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
const manifestIcons = [
 {
   src: 'pwa-192.png',
   sizes: '192x192',
   type: 'image/png',
 },
 {
   src: 'pwa-512.png',
   sizes: '512x512',
   type: 'image/png',
 }
]
export default defineConfig({
 plugins: [
   react(),
   VitePWA({
     registerType: 'autoUpdate',
     devOptions: {
       enabled: true
     },
     manifest: {
       name: 'Lister',
       short_name: 'lister',
       icons: manifestIcons,
     }
   })
 ],
})
</code>   

<p>You can get cute favicons from an <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">icon generator</a> and replace the <code>manifestIcons</code> source images with those. You can also look at the <a href="https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/">Vite PWA documentation</a> to better understand each option’s meaning and how to use it.</p>

<p>With these changes, end your current npm script and run <code>npm run dev</code> again; everything should be peachy. Now we have an app with Social Login capabilities.</p>

<p>Since this application is a todo list application, let’s add the todo list feature. Since our app is a PWA, our users should be able to use the application even when offline. To make the data accessible offline, we can store it locally on the client using browser storage and then sync the data with our servers using service workers (let us know if you want to see a tutorial using service workers).</p>

 Build a secure todo list React PWA 

<p>Since we will persist the todo list data, creating a model is a good idea. This model serves as a layer of abstraction over the DB calls. In this section, we’ll save the data to local storage; in the future, we may want to switch to another technology. A model helps us make this change in the implementation without changing code when consuming the model. Now let’s create the model: navigate to the <code>src</code> folder and create a folder named <code>models</code>. In that folder, create a <code>Task.model.ts</code>. We’ll call each item in the todo list a task.
The task model file should look like this:</p>

   <code>export interface Task {
 name: string;
 description: string;
 done: boolean;
}

const key = 'lister-tasks';

export default {
 addTask: (task: Task) =&gt; {
  const currentTasksJSON = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!currentTasksJSON) {
   localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify([task]));
   return;
  }
  const currentTasks = JSON.parse(currentTasksJSON);
  currentTasks.push(task);
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(currentTasks));
 },

 all: (): Task[] =&gt; {
  const currentTasksJSON = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!currentTasksJSON) return [];
  return JSON.parse(currentTasksJSON);
 },

 save: (tasks: Task[]) =&gt; localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(tasks)),
}
</code>   

<p>The model is a small wrapper over <code>LocalStorage</code>. The first part of the model defines the Task interface – all we need for a task is its name, description, and done state. The key variable is the <code>localStorage</code> item name; I chose to use <code>lister-tasks</code> for mine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, don’t store sensitive user data (e.g., passwords) on the client side but on a secure server!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up, we update the home page at <code>src/pages/Home.tsx</code> to look like this:</p>

   <code>import './Home.css';
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import TaskModel, { Task } from "../models/Task.model.ts";

const EMPTY_TASK: Task = { name: "", description: "", done: false } as const;
const Home = () =&gt; {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState&lt;Task[]&gt;(TaskModel.all().reverse());
  const [addMode, setAddMode] = useState(false);
  const [form, setForm] = useState&lt;Task&gt;(EMPTY_TASK);
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState&lt;boolean[]&gt;(new Array(tasks.length).fill(false));
  useEffect(() =&gt; TaskModel.save(tasks), [tasks]);

  const toggleTask = (id: number) =&gt; {
    const _tasks = [...tasks];
    _tasks[id].done = !_tasks[id].done;
    setTasks(_tasks);
  }
  
  const addNewTask = (e: Event) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    setExpanded(new Array(tasks.length + 1).fill(false));
    setTasks([...tasks, form]);
    setForm(EMPTY_TASK);
    setAddMode(!addMode);
  }


  const toggleExpansion = (id: number) =&gt; {
    const _expanded = [...expanded];
    _expanded[id] = !_expanded[id];
    setExpanded(_expanded);
  }


  return (&lt;&gt;
    &lt;h2 className="tab-heading"&gt;
    &lt;button className={`no-outline ${!addMode &amp;&amp; 'active'}`}
        onClick={() =&gt; setAddMode(false)}&gt;Task List
    &lt;/button&gt;


    &lt;button className={`no-outline ${addMode &amp;&amp; 'active'}`} onClick={() =&gt; setAddMode(true)}&gt;New
      Task +
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    {addMode &amp;&amp; &lt;form className="tab" action="#" onSubmit={addNewTask}&gt;
    &lt;div className="form-fields"&gt;
      &lt;div className="form-group"&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Task name"
          onChange={(e) =&gt; setForm({...form, name: e.target.value})} required/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="form-group full"&gt;

  &lt;/&gt;);

export default Home;

</code>   

<p>The first three lines of the code are the necessary imports. Next, we create a default empty task. The rest of the component is a basic CRUD page, with the required state for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. I used a <code>useEffect</code> hook to save the tasks to local storage whenever they change. If you look at the component, a <code>Home.css</code> import is at the top. Let’s create that file in the same directory and paste these into the content:</p>

   <code>.form-fields {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: space-between;
 flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.form-group{

.form-fields .form-group{

</code>   

<p>The above are helper styles. I used a tabular design for the todo list component so CRUD can be on the same page without using modal popups. Once all the files are in place, you’ll see the Todo List home page when you log in with Okta.</p>

<p>Once you have all the required manifest icons in your project, when you serve the app, you’ll see a prompt in the browser to install it on your machine! If you don’t want to create icons, use <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-pwa-example">the ones in the sample repo</a>.</p>

 Authenticate with Social Login from a React PWA 

<p>Great job making it this far! Along the way, we’ve explored how social login works with Okta and Google and how to set up a basic PWA using React, Vite, and the Vite PWA plugin. As a bonus, we now have a handy little todo list app to help keep our day on track!</p>

<p>Of course, a production-ready application would involve more advanced service worker configurations and a proper database setup, but our current implementation is adequate for an introduction.
Now it’s your turn to have fun: open the app in your browser, try signing in with Okta or Google, and test the install prompt to see how smoothly it runs as a standalone app. Happy coding!</p>

 Tips for Safe and Optimal Streaming 



 Use Trusted Sites 



<p>When exploring Top 10 Movie Sites for Free, it’s crucial to stick to legal platforms to safeguard yourself from malware, viruses, and potential legal issues. Reputable free streaming sites acquire content through legitimate licensing, ensuring a safer viewing experience compared to illicit alternatives that often host malicious ads or even direct malware downloads. Always prioritize your digital security by verifying a site’s credibility before streaming.</p>



 Enable VPN 



<p>To enhance your privacy and bypass geo-restrictions on certain movie sites for free, it’s highly recommended to enable a VPN like NordVPN or ExpressVPN. A Virtual Private Network encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making your online activity more private. This not only adds a layer of security against data monitoring but can also allow you to access content that might otherwise be unavailable in your region due to licensing agreements.</p>


 
 


 Check Internet Speed 



<p>For a smooth and uninterrupted experience while you stream your favorite films, ensure you have a stable internet connection. Streaming movies, especially in higher resolutions, requires sufficient bandwidth to avoid constant buffering and pixelation. Before settling in for a film, a quick check of your internet speed can prevent frustration and guarantee that your movie night is enjoyable and seamless.</p>



 Ad Blockers 



<p>While ad blockers can significantly improve your experience on movie sites for free by removing intrusive advertisements, be aware that some platforms may not work with ad blockers enabled. Many free streaming services rely on ads for revenue, and they might detect and block users who have ad blockers active, preventing content from loading. Use them cautiously and be prepared to disable them for specific sites if you encounter playback issues.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Remember to prioritize your safety by sticking to trusted sites, considering a VPN for enhanced privacy, and ensuring a stable internet connection for optimal streaming. While some sites rely on ads, the trade-off is often worthwhile for the vast library of content at your fingertips. Embrace the world of free streaming and elevate your entertainment experience today!</p>

<p>“I’m excited to join Ubisecure at a pivotal moment of growth,” said Edwards. “Managing the opportunities presented in the RegTech market by Digital Identity, both Individual and Organisational, is essential in today’s landscape of expanding regulation, national identity initiatives, and ever rising fraud, especially in cross border transactions.

<p>Ubisecure’s suite of RegTech solutions helps enterprises and financial institutions solve key compliance, fraud and operational challenges by adopting a technology first approach to meet global regulations, reduce risk and deliver simplified governance.</p>
<p>The appointment follows a twelve-month period of positive momentum for Ubisecure, particularly within the LEI space including under its RapidLEI brand, and the onboarding of new major global banks as&nbsp;<a title="GLEIF Validation Agents" href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">GLEIF Validation Agents</a>&nbsp;– further strengthening its role in the global identity and RegTech ecosystem.</p>

<p>Digital ID is already transforming how we move through the world. From faster airport check-ins to personalized hotel experiences, identity is becoming portable, private, and verifiable.</p><p>To explore what’s real, what’s next, and what identity organizations should be doing today, we hosted a live conversation with two people at the forefront of this shift. Annet Steenbergen, an advisor to the EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium, shared insights from the large-scale pilots testing the EUDI Wallet across Europe. And Nick Price, CEO of Netsys and Co-Chair of the Decentralized Identity Foundation’s Travel &amp; Hospitality Working Group, brought a global perspective from his real-world implementations of decentralized identity technologies.</p><p>Moderated by our CEO Nick Lambert, the session dug into how digital ID is being used right now, what’s still in development, and why the travel industry needs to start preparing for what’s coming.</p><p>Here are the key takeaways from that conversation.</p>

<p>Q: What can we expect once the HPP Mainnet goes live, especially with partners like Eigenlayer and Arbitrum?<br>The Mainnet is launching very soon. Boost will likely be the first project to go live on it. The vision is for HPP to become the preferred chain for AI-native projects — fast, scalable, and developer-friendly. Our partnerships with Eigenlayer, Arbitrum, and others are focused on ensuring high throughput and robust infrastructure.</p><p>Q: Is RWA something HPP is actively targeting?<br>Absolutely yes. As long as projects are legally compliant, HPP is open to supporting RWA use cases. We’re not putting artificial limits on what can be built — RWA is welcome if it fits within the framework.</p><p>Q: How will HPP impact enterprise chains and existing apps?<br>HPP is a public Layer 2 chain, which differs from Aergo’s earlier enterprise deployments. We’re building dev tools and working on integrations to make it easy for dApps to adopt HPP. The goal is to bring real usage into the ecosystem, not just testnet&nbsp;demos.</p><p>Q: How does HPP see the relationship between AI and blockchain?<br>We’re the infrastructure layer, not the app itself. Think of us like Microsoft Word — we’re not the author, but we empower the builder. We want HPP to be the default chain AI developers turn to when they need trust, traceability, and composability.</p><p>Q: Are you collaborating with top AI players or building your own stack?<br>Ideally both. We’re open to working with leading AI teams and also building internal tools and research capacity. At the end of the day, we want HPP to be on the shortlist when someone serious is looking to deploy AI on-chain.</p><p>Q: Could HPP be used as a Plan B during a global black swan financial event?<br>No, that’s not part of the discussion. We’re not in talks with banks or central authorities for that sort of thing, and we doubt most crypto projects are. It’s not what we’re focused on building.</p><p>Q: What do you think about the rise of “growth companions” (virtual AI friends)?<br>Technically? Not scary — they’re just better chatbots with memory. Socially? It’s more complex. There are risks (e.g. loneliness, mental health, even tragedy), but also huge potential for positive impact, especially in mental health and human connection. History shows that society tends to fear new tech at first — like it did with organ transplants — but those fears can give way to lasting&nbsp;good.</p><p>Q: Is there a direct collaboration between Blocko and Upleat on the Aergo mainnet?<br>Blocko built Aergo, but their stablecoin work with Upleat is separate from the public HPP Mainnet. They often fork Aergo tech for custom enterprise deployments, and we don’t expect this to run on our public chain. Also, we stay out of those talks to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><p>Q: How does Aergo see itself contributing to or differentiating from the broader AI x crypto movement, especially with the rise of ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) initiatives?<br>While we respect and support the ambition behind ASI, Aergo(HPP) is focused on a different layer of the stack. Rather than aiming to build superintelligence, we are designing the infrastructure layer that can be put into use in real life based on verifiable, decentralized coordination between AI agents, users, and protocols. Our focus is on practical, scalable systems that unlock near-term value. In short, we’re not just theorizing about AI’s role in the future. We’re shipping the infrastructure to support verifiable and economically active AI&nbsp;systems.</p> Final Wrap-Up   The HPP Mainnet is nearly here. It will launch as a public mainnet once preparations are complete.

 Insurance brand differentiation through PaaS&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a new way to stand out in the insurance industry, and it’s not about offering lower premiums or faster claims. It’s about privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer expectations are shifting, and Privacy as a Service (PaaS) is emerging as a powerful differentiator for insurers seeking to lead in trust, security, and digital experience. This is your opportunity to move beyond compliance and build tangible brand equity through privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 The Rise of Privacy for the Everyday Consumer&nbsp; 



<p>In today’s hyper-digital world, privacy has gone from a background concern to a front-page priority. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/#:~:text=In%20an%20era%20where%20every,May%2015%2D21%2C%202023.&amp;text=Americans%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20Republicans%20%E2%80%93%20have%20grown,and%20the%20government%20(79%25).">Pew Research</a>, 67% of Americans say they understand little to nothing about what companies do with their data, up from 59% in previous years. Most also feel they have little or no control over how businesses or government agencies use their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Privacy as a Service (PaaS) becomes a critical advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PaaS offers insurers a strategic way to embed privacy tools into their offerings from encrypted messaging and masked contact details to user-controlled data sharing and real-time breach monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What privacy as a service looks like&nbsp; 



<p>Privacy as a Service isn’t theoretical. It’s a growing suite of tools insurers can implement today, either through white-labeled apps or integration with their existing digital platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Private communication channels (e.g., encrypted messaging)&nbsp;<br> 



 Virtual cards for secure payments or online purchases&nbsp;<br> 



 Digital wallets that store only necessary credentials&nbsp;<br> 



 User-controlled identity and data-sharing preferences&nbsp;<br> 



 Real-time alerts and monitoring for data breaches, leaks, or misuse&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Together, these tools help protect against fraud, phishing, impersonation, and unauthorized data sharing, all while building policyholder confidence.&nbsp;</p>



 What specific PaaS solutions are available?&nbsp; 



<p>Several technology providers now offer turnkey or customizable privacy-as-a-service toolkits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/digital-identity-protection/">Anonyome Labs provides</a> secure communication tools (like virtual phone numbers and masked emails), identity protection, digital wallets, and breach monitoring.&nbsp;<br> 



 Jumio and Okta offer identity verification and access management solutions that support consumer-controlled credentialing.&nbsp;<br> 



 <a href="https://thetechpencil.com/how-googles-2025-tracking-policy-impacts-iphones-and-apple-s-ecosystem-38c168a1b5d7">Apple’s Private Relay</a> and others are shifting expectations for how personal data should be handled in digital experiences, further reinforcing the importance of privacy-centric offerings.&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Insurers can choose to license these features or integrate them into native apps for a seamless user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 How to effectively communicate the value of privacy tools 



<p>Implementing PaaS is only half the equation. Insurers must clearly articulate why it matters to customers. Here’s how:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Lead with control: Emphasize how customers can manage what they share and with whom they share it.&nbsp; 



 Show real-world benefits: Frame privacy tools as ways to reduce fraud, protect families, and save money, not just as technical features. 



 Promote peace of mind: Position your brand as one that safeguards people, not just policies.&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p>Messaging should appear across onboarding flows, app experiences, marketing campaigns, and customer support channels.&nbsp;</p>



 Differentiation in a crowded market&nbsp; 



<p>With so many insurance products becoming commoditized, Privacy as a Service provides a new lever for differentiation. It aligns with what modern consumers care about: safety, autonomy, and digital integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a space where brand loyalty is tied to values and experience, offering built-in privacy sends a powerful message you don’t just insure people. You protect them holistically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to offer privacy as a Service?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs helps insurers integrate turnkey privacy solutions into their digital experiences. <a href="https://anonyome.com/contact/#contact-form">Request a demo</a> to discover how you can leverage privacy as your next competitive advantage.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<blockquote>TL;DR: The House Party Protocol (HPP) Private Mainnet is officially live. This environment allows HPP to validate its infrastructure, onboard foundational projects, and test cross-chain, smart contract, and agent-based operations. The Public Mainnet is scheduled for Q3 2025, along with full token activation, agent deployment, developer tools, and ecosystem integration.</blockquote><p>We’re excited to announce the official launch of the House Party Protocol (HPP) Private Mainnet, a significant milestone that marks the culmination of focused research, protocol development, and ecosystem readiness. More importantly, it represents the final preparatory phase before opening the network to the broader&nbsp;public.</p> Why Launch a Private&nbsp;Mainnet? <p>The Private Mainnet provides a controlled environment for finalizing and validating the core infrastructure before it is fully accessible to the public. While technically identical to the upcoming public mainnet, this phase allows us to fine-tune key systems, ensure operational stability, and onboard essential modules.</p><p>Key developments during this stage&nbsp;include:</p>  Deployment of cross-chain bridges, oracles, and subgraphs  Initial issuance of the HPP token and setup of on-chain governance mechanisms  Onboarding of foundational projects, including AQT (RWA tokenization), Booost (proof-of-humanity), and W3DB/VaasBlock (on-chain reputation)   What We’re&nbsp;Testing <p>During the private mainnet phase, we are rigorously testing the protocol’s core capabilities under real-world conditions. This includes evaluating distributed node coordination and overall network performance, conducting smart contract audits, and assessing system observability at the protocol level. These tests ensure HPP can support intelligent, autonomous operations at&nbsp;scale.</p> What’s Next: Public Mainnet Launch in Q3&nbsp;2025 <p>Once the Private Mainnet is successfully stabilized, HPP will move into its next chapter with the public release of its Layer 2 mainnet in Q3 2025. This launch will activate the full HPP token economy and invite broader user and developer participation.</p><p>At the public launch, the HPP ecosystem will&nbsp;support:</p>  Native staking, protocol governance, and fee mechanisms using the HPP&nbsp;token  Deployment of autonomous agents for DeFi, AI coordination, and RWA operations  Developer onboarding through SDKs, APIs, and documentation portals  Cross-platform and cross-chain composability between CEXs, DEXs, and L2 protocols  <p>The HPP Private Mainnet is not just a technical milestone. It’s a clear signal that the network is nearing readiness for public adoption. We’re building the foundation for an intelligent, agent-based blockchain future.</p><p>We’re just getting started. In the coming weeks, we’ll be sharing more in-depth content, including public roadmap details, developer documentation, and additional resources.

<p>AUSTRAC is increasing scrutiny on insurers and intermediaries under Australia’s AML/CTF regime. This article explores how insurers can automate AML screening and identity verification for policyholders, brokers, and third parties – while maintaining compliance with reporting, privacy, and onboarding standards.</p>
 
 Australia’s insurance sector is under growing regulatory pressure as AUSTRAC expands its supervision beyond banks and casinos. General insurers, life insurance providers, and MGAs are now expected to demonstrate robust anti-money laundering (AML) programs, effective customer due diligence (CDD), and clear audit trails. 
<p>The result? AML is no longer a back-office function. It’s now a front-line compliance priority.</p>
 The AUSTRAC Focus in 2025 
<p>Recent enforcement actions and guidance updates from AUSTRAC make it clear that insurers must:</p>
 
 Identify and verify policyholders and beneficiaries 
 Screen for politically exposed persons (PEPs) and sanctions 
 Assess risk based on product type and transaction behaviour 
 Monitor intermediaries such as brokers, agents, and referrers 
 Report suspicious matters and threshold transactions 
 
<p>Unlike banks, insurers face unique challenges: low-frequency transactions, indirect relationships via brokers, and legacy systems with fragmented data. This makes real-time AML controls more difficult—yet increasingly essential.</p>
 Key Compliance Challenges for Insurers 
<p>1. Broker-Mediated Risk<br>
Many insurers onboard customers indirectly through brokers. If AML checks are delayed or inconsistent, exposure increases.</p>
<p>2. Complex Beneficiary Structures<br>
Life insurance policies, trusts, or group schemes often involve multiple named or contingent beneficiaries, requiring deeper CDD.</p>
<p>3. Manual Onboarding and Monitoring<br>
Legacy systems often rely on PDFs, emails, or offline checks—creating gaps in screening and reporting.</p>
<p>4. AU-Specific Privacy and Data Handling Laws<br>
AML systems must comply with the Australian Privacy Act and localization rules for sensitive personal data.</p>
 How iComply Helps Australian Insurers 
<p>iComply delivers a flexible, modular platform for AML compliance that supports insurance-specific use cases, including:</p>
 1. AML Screening for Policyholders and Brokers 
 
 Screen natural persons and legal entities against global PEP and sanctions lists 
 Automate ongoing monitoring with configurable refresh intervals 
 Risk-score customers and brokers based on transaction type and geography 
 
 2. Identity Verification at Onboarding 
 
 Use edge computing to validate ID documents and biometrics locally 
 Ensure fast onboarding without storing sensitive data offshore 
 Maintain full audit trails for AUSTRAC inspection readiness 
 
 3. Modular Flows for Multi-Party Policies 
 
 Onboard and verify multiple parties (e.g., policyholder, beneficiary, advisor) within a single case file 
 Apply risk-based logic to determine verification depth per party 
 
 4. Broker Portal and Delegated Compliance 
 
 Offer white-labeled portals for broker-assisted onboarding 
 Maintain insurer control over compliance policies and screening standards 
 
 5. Data Residency and Privacy Controls 
 
 All personal data processed and stored in compliance with Australian data protection law 
 Configurable consent capture, encryption, and retention policies 
 
 Case Insight: Life Insurer in NSW 
<p>A leading life insurance provider implemented iComply’s AML and identity verification modules for broker-led onboarding. Within 90 days:</p>
 
 Reduced manual reviews by 67% 
 Flagged 2 high-risk brokers for enhanced due diligence 
 Streamlined onboarding from 4 days to under 1 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 More Targeted AUSTRAC Reviews of non-bank financial services providers 
 Integration with Digital Identity Frameworks as Australia expands verified ID initiatives 
 Increased Focus on Intermediary Oversight including brokers, aggregators, and marketing affiliates 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Insurers can no longer afford to treat AML as a check-the-box task. AUSTRAC expects proactive, risk-based controls – especially when brokers and beneficiaries complicate the onboarding chain.</p>

<p>In this two-part series, we explore the foundational pillars shaping the future of the House Party Protocol (HPP): AI for Blockchain and Blockchain for&nbsp;AI.</p><p>As artificial intelligence and decentralized infrastructure continue to converge, HPP is emerging as a protocol purpose-built for this new paradigm. From transforming crypto wallets into intelligent, autonomous agents to powering the infrastructure for Small Language Models (SLMs), HPP is redefining how users interact with both AI and blockchain systems.</p><p>This series will examine two key dimensions:</p>  How HPP unlocks intelligent, agent-driven finance through AI-powered DeFi&nbsp;(DeFAI)  How it provides the coordination, verification, and transaction layer for the emerging SLM-powered AI&nbsp;economy  <blockquote>TL;DR: Crypto wallets are evolving from static storage tools into intelligent, AI-powered agents. Fueled by NFTs and SBTs, these wallets now carry identity, access, and behavioral history. With HPP’s AI-native infrastructure, specifically ArenAI and Noösphere, wallets can think, learn, and act autonomously. They’ll interact with CEXs and DEXs, execute DeFi strategies, and manage assets like personal financial agents.</blockquote><p>There was a time when NFTs were all about digital art, and crypto wallets were simply tools for storing tokens, signing transactions, and tracking balances. But today, those humble utilities are transforming into something much more profound.</p><p>In the age of AI, your wallet is no longer just a container — it’s becoming a character. A digital entity with identity, ownership, and access privileges that AI can understand and interact&nbsp;with.</p> The Silent Comeback of&nbsp;NFTs <p>Recently, major financial institutions in Korea, including Woori Bank and Naver Financial, have launched NFT wallet services. This is happening after the initial NFT hype has largely faded. So why&nbsp;now?</p><p>The answer lies in what NFTs and their lesser-known counterpart, SBTs (Soulbound Tokens), are becoming:<br> Foundations of digital identity in the AI-driven Web3&nbsp;economy.</p>  NFTs are no longer just digital collectibles. They’re evolving into carriers of personal history, access rights, and even AI-compatible metadata.  SBTs offer non-transferable identity markers — certifications, experience logs, and trust credentials that form your on-chain reputation.  <p>With these, your wallet becomes you, not just your holdings, but your behavior, access permissions, and digital presence.</p> ArenAI and Noösphere: Giving Intelligence to the&nbsp;Wallet <p>Now that your wallet has an identity, the next frontier is intelligence. This is where HPP’s AI-native infrastructure comes in, led by two key components: ArenAI and Noösphere.</p>  ArenAI turns your wallet into an autonomous agent. It can interpret context, make decisions, and execute transactions on your behalf — think automated staking, DeFi strategies, or even negotiation with other&nbsp;agents.  Noösphere enables off-chain computation, such as AI inference or data processing, to be performed in trusted environments, then verified and reflected on-chain.  <p>Together, they enable a new paradigm: wallets that think, learn, and act. Not just signing transactions, but proactively managing your digital financial life.</p> AI Wallets: The Gateway/Portal to Real&nbsp;DeFAI <p>The true impact lies in what these intelligent wallets unlock:<br> A seamless, AI-powered interface into the world of decentralized finance.</p><p>Your wallet&nbsp;will:</p>  Interact with both CEXs and DEXs via AI agents that move liquidity, execute trades, or hedge risk across platforms.  Access crypto products — such as staking, yield farming, and lending — as if browsing a bank app, with ArenAI suggesting strategies based on real-time market conditions.  <p>This is the true beginning of DeFAI, Decentralized Finance powered by&nbsp;AI.</p> A Wallet That Becomes&nbsp;You <p>NFTs and SBTs give your wallet a personality. ArenAI and Noösphere give it a mind. Together, they form the foundation for the next internet: an agent-driven economy where AI not only supports but participates in markets, governance, and ownership.</p><p>In this new paradigm, your wallet&nbsp;will:</p>  Learn your&nbsp;behavior  Manage your&nbsp;assets  Interact with other&nbsp;agents  Execute trades and participate in economies  <p>It won’t just hold tokens. It will become your digital&nbsp;twin.</p><p>A new infrastructure layer is emerging. In a world where AI models are no longer passive tools but active market participants, we need more than just smart contracts. We need coordination, autonomy, and verifiability at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>This is where HPP is&nbsp;heading.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/1-hpps-role-in-the-ai-driven-crypto-future-from-wallets-to-agents-e61b0397238b">[1] HPP’s Role in the AI-Driven Crypto Future: From Wallets to Agents</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Traditional identity providers allow you to configure access across your organization in a variety of ways, including passwords, multi- factor authentication, or logging in with a google account. Proven Auth adds a fourth option in the form of tamper-proof Verifiable Credentials for a faster, more secure login experience.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-auth/">Proven Auth</a> is a version of <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> designed to enable single sign-on (SSO) using <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable Credentials.</a> Proven Auth is more than just a way to enable passwordless authentication, it is a system for orchestrating access to applications and resources and managing the lifecycle of a user so that they have access to what they need — and only what they need — when they need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, Proven Auth can be used to issue employees with Verifiable Credentials for access to applications and documents or even to the areas they need access to based on their role within a company. A sales team member would have access to sales resources that an engineer would not. Or when an employee changes teams, their access can be immediately updated in the system’s governance file. If they leave the company, their credentials can easily be revoked, so no more collecting key cards or changing passwords.</p>
 Why login with Verifiable Credentials? 
<p>Verifiable Credentials offer benefits that traditional login systems simply cannot compete with.&nbsp;</p>
 
 They remove the need for logins and passwords and multi-factor authentication. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, any system that relies on usernames and shared secrets (passwords, security questions, etc) is vulnerable to data breaches and impersonation attempts. 
 They can be verified without phoning home or checking in with a third party. Credentials are verified through cryptography. You can be certain who issued the credential and that the information in the credential hasn’t been tampered with. This means that personal data doesn’t need to be stored in a centralized database to confirm who you are, and you can prove your identity instantly to the system without needing to check in with the issuing party or a third party identity provider. 
 They stop account takeovers and impersonation attacks. Each Verifiable Credential is bound to its owner and stored locally in a digital wallet app on their mobile device. Access to the wallet and device are through biometrics and code. The credential can’t be shared for someone else to use, it can’t be faked, and it can’t be stolen.&nbsp; 
 Easily implement least-privilege access. Verifiable Credentials simplify applying zero-trust approaches to security. With Proven Auth, you configure governance files to orchestrate who has access to what. It’s authentication plus access management. 
 
 How do I integrate Proven Auth into my existing identity provider’s systems?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Once you have Proven, our team at Indicio has created a collection of APIs that will allow you to access the option for Verifiable Credentials the same way that you can access any other option when logging into your systems, such as an existing user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have integrated Proven Auth into your systems you will see the option to issue credentials to users, who will be able to hold them in a digital identity wallet, and share them back to your system for verification.</p>
<p>A full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwE33TP0rec&amp;t=102s">demonstration of integrating Proven Auth</a> and what the new user experience will look like can be found on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IndicioID">Indicio YouTube Channel.</a></p>
 How do I get started? 
<p>Getting started is as easy as <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reaching out to the team at Indicio</a> to discuss your current systems.</p>
<p>Our team has years of experience creating solutions all around the globe, and will make sure that your team can not only integrate Verifiable Credentials quickly, but is set up to get the most use out of this powerful technology.

<p>We often talk about digital identity as if it’s a universal construct, something that can be standardized, serialized, and slotted into global frameworks. But identity is as cultural as it is technical. And when we ignore that, we risk building trust frameworks that work beautifully on paper and fail spectacularly in practice.</p>



 Identity isn’t one thing 



<p>Digital identity systems often bundle together multiple assumptions: that identity is persistent, singular, owned by the individual, and useful primarily for authorization or reputation. But those assumptions aren’t global truths—they’re artefacts of particular social and cultural histories.</p>



<p>(I had fun researching this post; I wanted to make sure that my anecdotal experience was backed up by people who did proper research. I could do this kind of thing ALL DAY. But I digress…)</p>



<p>In a comparative study of users in Central/Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551519879702">Katalin Feher</a> found striking differences in how people conceive of and manage their digital selves. For many Southeast Asian users, their “digital identity” is framed in terms of accounts, i.e., external tools for managing reputation. It’s something outside themselves, instrumental and pragmatic. For Central and Eastern European users, the self–account divide is blurrier; the digital footprint is seen as a real extension of personal identity, warranting careful curation and self-expression. (This paper is not freely available; I purchased a copy.)</p>



<p>Neither is wrong. Each leads to different expectations about how identity systems should behave and who should control them.</p>



 System design reflects cultural norms 



<p>This isn’t just about user attitudes. Cultural values shape system design too. Western identity architectures often assume:</p>



 
 Ownership and individualism – the user holds and controls their identity; 



 Transparency and audit – data trails should be visible and attributable; 



 Consent as the primary safeguard – once informed, the user is responsible. 
 



<p>These align well with societies that prioritize personal autonomy. But in more collectivist or hierarchical cultures, trust may flow through institutions or communities rather than individuals. Reputation may be managed through social harmony, not audit logs. And consent may be implicit, situated, or shaped by expectations of familial or societal duty.</p>



<p>Trying to implement a one-size-fits-all identity system on top of that diversity? That’s how you end up with systems people don’t trust, don’t use, or work around.</p>



<p>One of the biggest hurdles to designing identity standards that reflect cultural diversity is that the standards development community itself isn’t particularly diverse. Let’s look at the IETF as an example, since they publish easily accessible demographic information. According to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-community-survey-2023/">2023 IETF community survey</a>, nearly 80% of participants came from North America or Europe, and 85% identified as men. Most respondents spoke fluent English—the only language used for meetings, mailing lists, and documents. That streamlines coordination but inevitably filters out who can easily participate. When standards bodies fail to include regional, linguistic, and gender diversity, they naturally produce results that reflect the norms and assumptions of those already at the table.</p>



 When assumptions don’t translate: cultural mismatch in identity systems 



<p>We’ve seen identity systems built around one cultural model fall short when deployed in another. Sometimes, the mismatch causes friction; other times, it leads to outright rejection.</p>



<p>Take digital wallets built around the idea of individual ownership. In many Western contexts, this makes perfect sense: Users expect to control their credentials on personal devices. But in parts of Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, phones are often shared among family members or even communities. Identity systems that assume one person per device can break down quickly in these environments, creating exclusion where access was the goal.</p>



<p>Or consider face recognition. In the U.S. and Europe, it has sparked privacy concerns, but it still sees widespread deployment. In parts of the world where historical surveillance or ethnic targeting is fresh in public memory, even a technically secure facial recognition tool can feel untrustworthy. The issue isn’t the technology, it’s the cultural resonance of how people use the technology.</p>



<p>Then there’s the matter of naming. Systems that require a first and last name in Latin script are common, but not universally applicable. Cultures with patronymics, single names, or character-based scripts often find their identities shoehorned into forms they didn’t design and can’t fully control.</p>



<p>These aren’t just edge cases. They’re warning signs. When we treat digital identity as a neutral infrastructure, we miss the social and cultural weight it carries. And that weight can’t be standardized away.</p>



 We need regionally adaptable trust frameworks 



<p>If we want digital identity to serve people globally, we need frameworks that can flex to local norms while maintaining interoperability. That doesn’t mean abandoning global standards; it means decoupling the mechanism from the assumption set.</p>



<p>A few ideas worth exploring:</p>



 
 Modular trust anchors – Let different regions define who or what counts as a trustworthy issuer. 



 Flexible disclosure models – Don’t assume every system must default to maximum transparency. 



 Interoperable semantics, adaptable governance – Let credential formats be standardized, but leave room for local rules around their issuance and use. 
 



<p>The Levin &amp; Mamlok paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/info12020068">Culture and Society in the Digital Age</a>,” warns of a creeping homogenization of experience as digital systems encode particular ways of being into their logic. If we’re not careful, we’ll reproduce the same flattening in digital identity where diversity becomes a bug, not a feature.</p>



 Identity is local. Interop is global. 



<p>We’re building the infrastructure of digital personhood. That’s no small task. But if we want that infrastructure to support real people, not just tidy models, we have to let it speak in more than one voice.</p>



<p>That means more than just designing flexible architectures. It means actively bringing more voices into the rooms where those architectures are shaped. If cultural norms differ (and they do), then we need people who live those differences to help define what trustworthy, usable, and empowering identity systems look like. Otherwise, we risk exporting assumptions, not standards.</p>



<p>Trust doesn’t scale unless it can adapt. And adaptation doesn’t happen without inclusion.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to The Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Digital Identity, Really? 



 



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hi there, and welcome back to The Digital Identity Digest. In today’s episode, I want to ask you a simple but profound question:</p>



<p>[00:00:35]<br>What comes to mind when you hear the term digital identity?<br>Do you think of:</p>



 
 Biometrics? 



 Login credentials? 



 A string of JSON? 



 Your social media handle? 
 



<p>[00:00:46]<br>The answer likely depends on several factors:</p>



 
 Where you’re from 



 How old you are 



 How tech-savvy you feel 
 



<p>[00:00:52]<br>Cultural context plays a big role here.</p>



<p>[00:00:57]<br>We often talk about digital identity like it’s universal—something we can standardize, serialize, and fit into tidy global frameworks.</p>



<p>[00:01:08]<br>But identity is as cultural as it is technical. Ignoring that can lead to trust frameworks that look great on paper but fail in practice—especially when so-called edge cases were never edge at all.</p>



 



 Unpacking Assumptions About Identity 



 



<p>[00:01:23]<br>Let’s start with a key reminder: identity isn’t one thing.</p>



<p>[00:01:26]<br>Most digital identity systems are based on a set of unspoken assumptions:</p>



 
 Identity is persistent 



 It’s singular 



 It’s controlled by the individual 



 It exists mainly for authorization or reputation 
 



<p>[00:01:42]<br>But none of these are universal truths—they are cultural artifacts. They reflect the norms of specific regions, especially the US and Europe, where many of these systems originated.</p>



<p>[00:01:54]<br>I’ve seen these cultural assumptions in standards work and tech deployments. But I wanted to back that up with research—not just anecdotes.</p>



 



 Meet the Research: Catalyn Fair 



 



<p>[00:02:07]<br>Enter Catalyn Fair (and fingers crossed I’m pronouncing that correctly).</p>



<p>[00:02:12]<br>Fair conducted a comparative study of digital identity and online self-management, focusing on Central and Eastern Europe vs. Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>[00:02:23]<br>The study included:</p>



 
 60 in-depth interviews 



 Equal focus on students and business leaders 



 Solid, qualitative insights 
 



<p>[00:02:33]<br>What she found wasn’t subtle.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>In Southeast Asia, digital identity is often seen as external—a tool for:</p>



 
 Managing reputation 



 Accessing services 
 



<p>It’s instrumental, not personal.</p>



<p>[00:02:49]<br>But in Central and Eastern Europe, identity is seen as deeply connected to the self.<br>Your digital presence isn’t just metadata—it’s:</p>



 
 An extension of who you are 



 Something you curate and express 



 Part of your personal narrative 
 



<p>[00:03:05]<br>Neither model is better. But each one shapes user expectations—and design choices.</p>



 



 Design Reflects Culture, Too 



 



<p>[00:03:17]<br>Cultural values don’t just affect users—they show up in system architecture.</p>



<p>[00:03:23]<br>Western identity models often assume:</p>



 
 The individual owns and controls their identity 



 Transparency is inherently good 



 Informed consent makes systems trustworthy 
 



<p>[00:03:43]<br>These assumptions work well in societies that value personal autonomy and individual accountability.</p>



<p>[00:03:54]<br>But in collectivist or hierarchical cultures, trust flows differently:</p>



 
 Through institutions or family 



 Reputation relies on social harmony 



 Consent may be implicit or relational 
 



<p>[00:04:16]<br>So when a single identity model is deployed globally, friction is inevitable.</p>



 



 Who’s in the Room? 



 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Let’s talk about the people building these systems.</p>



<p>[00:04:35]<br>One challenge is that standards development communities lack diversity.</p>



<p>[00:04:46]<br>Take the IETF—the Internet Engineering Task Force:</p>



 
 In 2023, ~80% of participants were from North America or Europe 



 85% identified as male 



 Most were fluent in English (the sole language used in IETF spaces) 
 



<p>[00:05:17]<br>This streamlines communication—but filters out valuable perspectives.</p>



<p>[00:05:29]<br>So even well-meaning people design standards based on their own assumptions.</p>



<p>[00:05:34]<br>We’ve seen how badly that can go.</p>



 



 Real-World Design Conflicts 



 



<p>[00:05:45]<br>Let’s take a closer look at where systems break.</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>Digital wallets in the West:</p>



 
 Built around individual control 



 One person, one device 
 



<p>[00:06:00]<br>But in parts of Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa:</p>



 
 Phones are shared across families and communities 



 Exclusive smartphone access isn’t guaranteed 
 



<p>[00:06:09]<br>If your system assumes one phone per person—it fails immediately.</p>



<p>[00:06:23]<br>Facial recognition sparks privacy debates in the US and Europe.<br>But in regions with a history of surveillance or ethnic targeting, it’s actively distrusted, regardless of technical safeguards.</p>



<p>[00:06:55]<br>Then there’s the perennial issue of naming.</p>



<p>[00:06:59]<br>Many systems require:</p>



 
 First and last names 



 In Latin characters 
 



<p>[00:07:08]<br>But that’s not globally applicable. Consider:</p>



 
 Cultures with single names 



 Languages using non-Latin scripts 



 Regions where names reflect lineage or patronymics 
 



<p>[00:07:17]<br>Forcing conformity erases identity and damages trust.</p>



 



 Designing for Cultural Flexibility 



 



<p>[00:07:50]<br>So—what do we do about all this?</p>



<p>[00:07:51]<br>We need regionally adaptable trust frameworks—systems that flex to local norms while preserving interoperability.</p>



<p>[00:07:59]<br>That doesn’t mean abandoning global standards.<br>It means designing with flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:08:11]<br>What might that look like?</p>



 
 Modular trust anchors<br>Let regions define trusted issuers—whether they’re governments, nonprofits, or private entities. 



 Flexible disclosure<br>Enable minimal, selective proof. Don’t force full data dumps for basic verification. 



 Standardized semantics + localized governance<br>Agree on technical formats, but allow cultural variation in credential rules, issuers, and legal weight. 
 



<p>[00:08:58]<br>These aren’t just ideas—they’re already being explored in:</p>



 
 Decentralized identity 



 Verifiable credentials 



 Wallet interoperability 
 



<p>But they need cultural awareness to succeed.</p>



 



 Digital Identity as Cultural Infrastructure 



 



<p>[00:09:12]<br>A great paper by Levin and Mamlock—Culture and Society in the Digital Age—makes an important point:</p>



<p>[00:09:27]<br>Digital systems don’t just provide tools.<br>They encode worldviews.</p>



<p>[00:09:34]<br>Without care, we end up with flattened experiences—forcing everyone into one digital model.</p>



<p>[00:09:43]<br>If diversity becomes a bug to work around, instead of a feature, we’re building the wrong world.</p>



<p>[00:09:53]<br>We are designing the infrastructure of digital personhood.</p>



<p>[00:09:58]<br>If that’s going to support real people—not just tidy models—we need systems that speak in more than one voice.</p>



<p>[00:10:06]<br>And that means more than just flexible tech.</p>



<p>We need:</p>



 
 Broader participation 



 Cultural representation 



 Inclusion at the table 
 



<p>[00:10:24]<br>Otherwise, we’re not building local systems—we’re exporting our assumptions.</p>



<p>[00:10:30]<br>And without cultural adaptation, trust doesn’t scale.</p>



<p>[00:10:39]<br>Something to think about.</p>

<p></p><p>Minor Releases – Holochain 0.5.4 &amp; 0.4.4:&nbsp; We found a bug where the code that ensures zome-call atomicity failed, i.e. if the zome call returned an error a commit might still be added to your chain.&nbsp; This bug has been fixed and is being released in Holochain 0.5.4 and back-ported to Holochain 0.4.4 release. &nbsp; The 0.5.4 release also includes<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/2e8c8a4b53de87b3a43a8c5d92ec644be5bffed0/crates/holochain/src/docs.rs?ref=blog.holochain.org#L22"> additional debug-logging output</a> that should help us better understand some of the circumstances where WebRTC connections are spontaneously dropped.</p><p>HTTP Gateway Update (0.2.0):&nbsp; HTTP Gateway that provides a way to bridge from the web2 world into Holochain has been updated for compatibility with Holochain 0.5. We have updated and released it (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/hc-http-gw?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://github.com/holochain/hc-http-gw</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>Developer Focus: Our focus is now directly visible on the Roadmap (<a href="http://holochain.org/roadmap?ref=blog.holochain.org">holochain.org/roadmap</a>), for details see the blog post (<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/introducing-the-new-holochain-roadmap/">https://blog.holochain.org/introducing-the-new-holochain-roadmap/</a>). You will see there that focus has shifted to Holochain 0.6, highlights of which include:</p>  Conductor State refactors address problems in inconsistent cell state  Ability for coordinator zome updates  Extending memproof gating to the network level.  <p>New Dev Hires: Our two new team members are onboarding quickly and will both focus on fleshing out our Wind Tunnel performance testing framework, adding new scenarios, and reporting.</p> Dev Office Hours: July 9th recap <p>We were excited to have an inquiry in our Office Hours about use of our Kitsune2 p2p data-synchronization layer in a stand-alone project.&nbsp; This library is ready to be used in other projects, and so despite the fact that we haven’t yet created really good dev documentation for it we were able to provide pointers to the showcase app (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/tree/main/crates/kitsune2_showcase?ref=blog.holochain.org">https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/tree/main/crates/kitsune2_showcase</a>) that demonstrates its stand-alone use.&nbsp; We are looking forward to seeing how that goes, and if anyone else is interested in this, please keep us in the loop. </p>

 🪄Innovation and New Technology Developments 



 



<p>Italy Modernizes Civil Services and Digital Wallet with National Integration and Offline Access</p>



<p>Italy is advancing its digital identity infrastructure with significant updates to its national digital services. Over 700 municipalities have joined the centralized National Archive of Civil Status (ANSC), replacing paper-based record-keeping with a unified digital platform for civil documents. Synchronization with the National Registry of the Resident Population ensures data accuracy and streamlines administrative workflows. Concurrently, Italy’s “IO” app now supports offline access to its digital wallet, allowing users to retrieve essential documents like driving licenses and health cards without an internet connection. With nearly 90 million digital identities issued and robust growth in digital document adoption, Italy is ahead of its National Recovery and Resilience Plan targets. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/italy-gets-offline-digital-wallet-access-as-country-advances-digitalization?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EhejpP-DJoIdVyFYvvhEYiEQmuuoHZ_inGkXjP6sExOWjy_d6qBqBlDxxMAiUQOh__a6m">(Source)</a></p>

<p>South Africa Launches Upgraded Identity Verification System With Faster, More Reliable Access to NPR</p>



<p>South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs has launched an upgraded identity verification platform that allows both government and private sector entities to verify identities against the National Population Register (NPR). Previously plagued by high failure rates due to underinvestment, the new system now handles over 180,000 daily transactions with minimal error and sub-second response times. The justice sector and several private users have already transitioned, benefiting from improved reliability and efficiency. While some users were unprepared for the switch despite prior consultations, the Department is offering a grace period until October to optimize usage and reduce costs, crediting back overpayments based on off-peak verification adjustments. <a href="https://techafricanews.com/2025/07/07/south-africa-modernises-identity-verification-tackles-system-failures-with-new-platform/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9AcPmS6M7PouHHT7-YBBPeS9LeulsWJ5XjCam_W1Tjye7ZIC51VltsRjatJxvGMZtzc_jS">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Germany Urges Apple and Google to Remove DeepSeek Over GDPR Violations and Data Transfers to China</p>



<p>Germany’s data protection authority has requested Apple and Google to block the Chinese chatbot app DeepSeek from their app stores, citing unlawful data transfers to China and violations of GDPR. The Berlin Data Protection Commissioner argued that DeepSeek fails to provide adequate safeguards for user data, especially given Chinese authorities’ extensive access rights. The app had already been banned in Italy earlier this year for similar concerns, and investigations are ongoing in several other EU countries. Despite a recent privacy policy update, DeepSeek remains under scrutiny for opaque data retention practices and lack of user protections equivalent to those in the EU. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/deepseek-faces-ban-in-germany-as-privacy-watchdog-reports-the-app-to-google-and-apple-as-illegal-content?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Nq70wR3hz92SgvzeicgX3SVZTGLAxw_U41RLc7VtNk7iKfCO3oWZ00cj5vsDHUykMTpQ4">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Stanford Paper Critiques Age Assurance Laws as Suppressive and Fragmented Regulatory Measures</p>



<p>In a new paper from Stanford Law School, legal scholar Eric Goldman critiques online age assurance laws, arguing they amount to “segregate-and-suppress” legislation that undermines privacy, innovation, and free expression. Goldman challenges the fragmented regulatory landscape and the terminology underpinning age assurance technologies, claiming such laws expose users to surveillance and economic harms. However, critics note that his argument downplays the risks of unrestricted access to harmful content and seems aligned with the stance of industry groups like NetChoice. The paper ultimately favors parental oversight and digital literacy over legal mandates, though it has been criticized for overlooking the practical and ethical concerns driving age assurance efforts. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/respected-legal-authority-frames-age-assurance-legislation-as-segregation-suppression?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87Rsozl63vNzLLjQA7ctkZbywkY0hR9qCl-OlvF4cgTwV1bySN4mO4sDRnETAyaMoke1vL">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Healthline Faces Record CCPA Settlement Over Misuse of Sensitive Health Data and Consent Failures</p>



<p>Healthline Media has agreed to a $1.55 million settlement with the California Attorney General for alleged violations of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Unfair Competition Law—the largest CCPA-related settlement to date. The investigation found that Healthline continued to share user data with advertisers for targeted ads even after users opted out, particularly revealing sensitive health-related information based on visited pages. Additional violations included inadequate contract terms with ad partners and non-functional cookie consent tools. As part of the settlement, Healthline must implement corrective measures, including fixing opt-out mechanisms, halting the sharing of health-related article titles, and maintaining a robust CCPA compliance program. The settlement awaits court approval. <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/california-ag-healthline-ccpa-settlement/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9AcPmS6M7PouHHT7-YBBPeS9LeulsWJ5XjCam_W1Tjye7ZIC51VltsRjatJxvGMZtzc_jS">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Spain Arrests Five in $542 Million Crypto Fraud Tied to Global Investment Scam</p>



<p>Five individuals have been arrested in Spain for allegedly orchestrating a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded over 5,000 victims—100 of them from Switzerland—out of approximately $542 million. Coordinated by the Spanish Guardia Civil with support from Europol and law enforcement in the US, France, and Estonia, the operation involved arrests in the Canary Islands and Madrid. The suspects are believed to have used a global network to collect and move funds through various financial channels, including crypto transfers. Authorities also linked the group to a complex banking and corporate structure based in Hong Kong. The case is one of Spain’s largest crypto fraud investigations and follows recent international crackdowns on similar scams. <a href="https://fintechnews.ch/fintechspain/spain-crypto-investment-fraud-europol-arrests/77123/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Chile Cracks Down on Tren de Aragua’s $13.5 Million Crypto-Fueled Laundering Network</p>



<p>Chilean authorities have dismantled a major money laundering operation linked to the Venezuelan criminal group Tren de Aragua, which allegedly funneled over $13.5 million through bank accounts and cryptocurrency to multiple countries, including the U.S., Venezuela, Colombia, and Spain. The crackdown, which resulted in 52 arrests, uncovered that the laundered funds stemmed from crimes such as human trafficking, extortion, drug trafficking, and homicides. Experts note that Tren de Aragua has adopted crypto-based laundering tactics from Mexican cartels to obscure financial trails. The organization has previously been designated a Transnational Criminal Organization by the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC for its expansive illicit operations across the Americas. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chile-cracks-down-on-tren-de-araguas-crypto-money-laundering-scheme/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Meta Challenges EU Fine Over “Pay or Consent” Model in Ongoing Data Privacy Dispute</p>



<p>Meta plans to appeal a €200 million fine issued by the European Union for allegedly violating the Digital Markets Act through its “pay or consent” model, which offers users a choice between paying for ad-free access or consenting to data tracking. The European Commission found this approach failed to provide an equivalent alternative without personalized data use, deeming it non-compliant with EU rules. Meta contests the ruling, citing prior legal precedent supporting subscription-based models. The case marks another chapter in Meta’s ongoing conflict with European regulators over data privacy, following earlier fines and legal disputes concerning ad targeting and transatlantic data transfers. <a href="https://dmarketforces.com/meta-to-appeal-e200m-eu-fine-over-data-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>

 4 Arrested in £440M M&amp;S Cyber Attacks; Are They Members of Scattered Spider?  
<p>On July 10, 2025, the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) announced a major breakthrough in its investigation into a series of devastating cyber attacks, arresting four individuals from their homes in the West Midlands and London. The suspects face a litany of serious charges, including Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, money laundering, and, notably, "participating in the activities of an organized crime group."</p> 
<p>While the NCA confirmed the suspects' involvement in an organized syndicate, they did not officially name the group. This has led to widespread speculation, and the cybersecurity community is asking one major question: are they members of Scattered Spider? While an official confirmation is pending, it's widely believed that the group is responsible. The tactics used in the £440 million retail heist, specifically the reliance on advanced social engineering ploys, are a known signature of the Scattered Spider hacker group.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s Take: Whether or not these four individuals are confirmed members, the profile of this attack and the suspects themselves paint a vivid picture of the threat that groups like Scattered Spider represent. The suspects are incredibly young, ranging from just 17 to 20 years old, which aligns perfectly with the known demographics of this new generation of digital native cybercriminals.</p> 
 How Young, Native-Speaking Groups Outmaneuver Traditional Defenses  
<p>For years, enterprise security has been architected to defend against a specific type of threat: sophisticated, often foreign, nation-state actors. The defense playbook was designed to spot technical vulnerabilities and hunt for clues of foreign intrusion, like language errors in phishing emails or unusual geopolitical motives. But today, the most dangerous threat isn't a foreign government; it's a teenager in a Western country who sounds exactly like one of your employees on the phone.</p> 
<p>The attackers in groups like Scattered Spider are shockingly young, often between 16 and 22 years old. They are true digital natives who have grown up in a world of social media, online gaming, and instant communication. This gives them more than just technical skill; it provides them with an intuitive grasp of online psychology and a mastery of social manipulation that older, more traditional hacking groups often lack. They don't operate in rigid hierarchies but as fluid, decentralized collectives, working together like a gig-economy startup for cybercrime.</p> 
<p>Their single most effective weapon is the English language. Unlike many foreign adversaries, these young attackers are native speakers. When they call an IT help desk to impersonate an employee, there are no accents, stilted phrases, or cultural missteps to raise alarm bells. They can build rapport, express urgency, and navigate corporate jargon flawlessly, weaponizing trust to turn your most helpful employees into unwitting accomplices. Their process is a masterclass in psychological manipulation:</p> 
  
  Reconnaissance: They scour social media like LinkedIn to find a target employee, gathering personal details like their role, colleagues, and even recent projects.  
  Impersonation: Armed with this information, they call the IT help desk, often during a busy shift change. They create a sense of urgency – "I'm locked out and have a huge presentation in five minutes!" – to pressure the agent.  
  Exploitation: They skillfully answer security questions using the data they’ve collected and trick the well-meaning agent into resetting credentials or even enrolling a new MFA device.  
  
<p>This operational model is fundamentally different from that of a nation-state. These groups are not driven by ideology; they are financially motivated, seeking maximum profit with calculated efficiency. This agile and opportunistic structure makes them incredibly difficult to track. They will focus on one industry, refine their social engineering tactics for that sector's specific culture, extract as much money as possible, and then move on to the next target. The security playbooks written for yesterday's threats are simply not equipped to handle this new breed of adversary.</p> 
 How to Stop Scattered Spider: Defeating the Gen-Z Hacker with Identity Assurance  
<p>Fighting a new breed of predator requires a new class of defense. Probabilistic security has failed. The only way to stop a Scattered Spider attack is to move to a deterministic model of security; one that provides absolute certainty about a user's identity.</p> 
<p>HYPR dismantles the Scattered Spider playbook piece by piece:</p> 
  
  Eliminate the Attack Vector with Phishing-Resistant MFA: The primary weapon of Scattered Spider is credential phishing. HYPR Authenticate replaces passwords with FIDO-certified, passkey-based authentication. Authentication is bound to the true domain of the service, making it impossible for AiTM tools like Evilginx to function. If a user is lured to a fake site, the authentication will simply fail. There is no credential to steal and no session cookie to hijack. The attack is stopped before it begins.<br><br>  
  Secure the Help Desk with Deterministic Identity Verification: The help desk is Scattered Spider's favorite entry point. HYPR Affirm slams that door shut. To perform a sensitive action like a credential reset, the user must prove who they are, not just what they know. Affirm uses a multi-layered, configurable workflow that can include verifying a government-issued ID, a biometric selfie match, and other deterministic factors. A scammer on the phone cannot fake their way through a live facial recognition scan. We help you verify the person, not the account.  
  
<p>Scattered Spider thrives on uncertainty, manipulation, and the fundamental flaws of legacy identity security. HYPR provides certainty.</p> 
<p>Don't wait to become Scattered Spider's next headline. It's time to move beyond security that hopes it's right to a system that knows.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>We’ve just released a <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/?ref=blog.holochain.org">new roadmap</a> for Holochain that we redesigned to improve visibility into both the development status and the workflow of the Holochain team. It shows a summary of release history, status of in-progress work, and planning of upcoming work including releases actively being planned and those that are just incubating. These summaries are linked to our actual Github project management tooling to calculate our work velocity and expected completion of work in progress as well as planning estimation.</p> Context <p>Showing the evolution and progress of an open-source project in an easily digestible way is both a critical and a non-trivial task.While we have been operating transparently for quite some time using Github Projects to manage and prioritize our work, the available summarizing and visibility tooling GitHub provides for roadmaps and burn-down don’t provide the necessary accessibility to developers and non-developers alike to stay informed on what’s currently being worked on, and what is yet to come. And we too have struggled with how best to create visibility into projected completion times, as this is<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/?ref=blog.holochain.org"> notoriously difficult to do</a>.</p><p>Our new, dynamic roadmap addresses these challenges by making our completion estimates visible the same way we see them internally - based on real data of our historical velocity, and compared with the team’s complexity estimation on future and in-progress work. <br><br>Take a look at how the new timeline in this video walk-through, or read on for more info on how it works.</p> What we show  Released <p>The Released column provides a list of actually released software. For the most part this shows Holochain releases, but it also includes notable releases of other stand-alone projects (like the HTTP Gateway). More current releases link to actual issues completed in our Github Projects tool.</p> In Progress <p>The “In Progress” column provides visibility into the releases we are currently actively working on. For each release you can see the percentage completion of story points, the current velocity and estimated time to completion. The story point completion is also broken down by epic for more detailed project data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Up Next <p>The “Up Next” column provides visibility into our team planning and estimation process. As well as coding and delivering on current releases, we are also looking ahead to what comes next, and getting a handle on how much complexity is involved and what to put into future releases. So in this column what you see is the progress on the issues and time to complete for a release.</p> Our Process <p>To really make sense of this roadmap, it helps to understand our team process. Like many software teams, we use a simple modified Kanban-based agile workflow for low-level task management, and releases and epics for higher-level prioritization.</p>  Work items enter our flow as bugs and feature requests, either from Holochain team members or stakeholders adding them as GitHub issues, on one of our repositories. As the team breaks down larger items of work, they may add more issues across various repositories.  All of these end up in the project backlog where we prioritize them and slot them into a release and an epic, which collects larger chunks of work.  From there the items are set to "Ready for refinement" which is the crucial step of the team assessing the complexity of an issue, and possibly breaking it into smaller issues that are all estimated. There is much written about story point estimating in agile process, which you can google for if you want to understand this more deeply. Suffice it to say that it's best not to estimate "time/effort" but rather to estimate complexity. Looking back on completed issues reveals the time it takes for the team to complete items of that level of complexity.  When items have been estimated, they are marked "Ready" and team members can start the work according to priority.  Our releases are currently numbered in the pre-release <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a> numbering style of 0.X.Y. X is considered a major release where we allow ourselves to break APIs, which for developers means they may have to recompile their hApps, and/or actually make updates because the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/?ref=blog.holochain.org">HDK</a> is changed, and also will have to update the conductor version their runtime is using, because networking formats may have changed. The Y value is a minor and for those, no DNA updates are required; simply updating the Holochain version in a runtime will either add new non-breaking features, or have fixed bugs.  <p>Thus, our new roadmap helps make our internal process more accessible and visible. We show what releases we have completed, which we are working on, and are planning and incubating going forward.</p><p>Please note that this map is fluid. We move epics from one release to another as we evaluate them, and sometimes simply because we realize it makes more sense to get a release out sooner. Usually, what's In-Progress is fairly well planned out, and the scope should remain fairly stable. What's marked as Planning not so much, and what's marked Incubating even less so.</p><p>We've made it so that Releases and Epics are links on the site so you can navigate directly to our Github project for those who want to delve in deeper.</p> The GitHub Project <p>To look under the hood at what's on in GitHub here are some things to note:</p>  If you go to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/22?ref=blog.holochain.org">release view</a> you will see all of the releases also on the website, plus a few more that we are holding even more loosely on that gradient of certainty, so we don't show them on the website.  Releases on GitHub are prefixed with a "*" for those in planning, and an "_" for those being incubated.  You may notice that data is not pulled live from GitHub, but it is updated reasonably often. This is currently a manual process that will eventually be automated.  <p>This roadmap provides transparency into both our timelines and development processes, giving real-time insight into how we work, what we're building, and when. This helps community members make better-informed decisions when building on Holochain. We'll continue refining this roadmap based on your feedback - so we look forward to hearing what you think.!</p>

			 Héctor Castro Mateos is QA Lead at Tokeny, he joined the company in 2022. 
 Reflecting on the 3-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company for three years, as a QA engineer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>Since I joined the company three years ago, I’ve always felt empowered to take ownership of the QA process and shape it in a way that truly fits our team and product. That level of trust and autonomy has been key to my growth. On top of that, everyone here is genuinely supportive and collaborative, which makes it much easier to take on challenges and keep improving.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>A lot has definitely changed over these three years. As the company has grown, the tech team has constantly refined its processes, always aiming to improve step by step so we can deliver the best possible product.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “We’ve managed to keep that “family feeling” despite team changes, and I think that’s something really valuable to preserve.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “We’ve managed to keep that “family feeling” despite team changes, and I think that’s something really valuable to preserve.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>The QA team has grown since I joined, and with that, so have my responsibilities. I started as the only QA, and now we’re a team of four. That shift has pushed me to grow into a leadership role, learning how to manage a team, balance priorities, and make sure everyone feels both productive and motivated. It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.</p>

		 
	 
                            
	 
		 
			 “It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.” 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 “It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.” 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 Company Values in Practice 
 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you enjoyed working with a very committed team, that creates a sense of belonging to a community. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team used this commitment, and how it was received? 
<p>There was a release where many things got delayed and we had blockers just a few days before the deadline. Instead of panicking, the team stayed fully engaged and focused. We split the work, adapted priorities, and everyone went the extra mile to make sure things were properly tested. It really showed how committed the team is, not just to doing their own tasks, but to making sure the company delivers quality on time.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 
<p>I’d tell myself to be more confident from the beginning and to trust the team. You don’t need to have all the answers on your own, the best outcomes come when you collaborate and rely on others. We’re all here to help each other grow.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>The industry is evolving really fast, so it’s hard to predict exactly what things will look like in five years. Personally, I see myself continuing to grow professionally, leading a bigger QA team, and contributing to even more advanced testing strategies to keep ensuring the quality and reliability of our product.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “I’m confident Tokeny will be at the forefront of that change” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “I’m confident Tokeny will be at the forefront of that change” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 Finally, as we’ve gotten to know you over the years, you’ve often shared your love for nutrition and a wide range of sports. Do any learnings or skills from these passions translate into your work at Tokeny? 
<p>Absolutely. I think anyone who approaches sports with passion and commitment develops a mindset built on patience, resilience, and the drive to keep going until the goal is achieved. That mentality naturally carries over into work, where consistency and perseverance are key.</p>

<p>Part of Bluesky’s mission to create a more open and decentralized social web is
helping users feel safe and in control of their experience. We always try to
balance safety with privacy, and free expression with civility.</p>
<p>To achieve our mission, we also work with governments around the world. In the
UK, the Online Safety Act requires that online platforms take specific steps to
reduce the risk of children seeing harmful content. Since certain parts of that
act come into effect later this month, we’re making some changes for people in
the UK.</p>
<p>We’ll use Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US">Kids Web
Services</a> (KWS) to give our UK
community choices about how to verify their age. If you’re in the UK, you can
choose between
<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/kids-web-services/pv-service/verification-methods">methods</a>
like credit card verification and face scans. (See
<a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/faq">here</a> to
learn more about how KWS safeguards user information.) For people who are under
18 or don’t want to go through this process, we’ll make adult-appropriate
content inaccessible, and we’ll disable features like direct messaging.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK, you’ll see a notification on our platform when this update
takes effect, and a way to report unwanted content:</p>

  
  Users in the UK will see notices of age requirements, and
  instructions for completing age verification.


  
  Users can report content through flows like the one pictured.

<p>In addition to these updates, we’ll continue to look at how we’re doing to
shield children from unwanted content, and how we can improve.</p>

 Universities can’t afford to treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. Here’s how to close the gaps before the next breach.&nbsp; 
<p>On June 24, 2025, Columbia University joined the growing list of higher education institutions compromised by sophisticated cybercriminals. The attack, which <a href="https://therecord.media/hacker-political-agenda-columbia-cyberattack">exposed 1.6 gigabytes of sensitive data from 2.5 million student applications</a>, wasn’t the work of a random opportunist, it was a politically motivated hacktivist who exploited systemic weaknesses in the university’s identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>This breach represents more than an isolated incident. It’s a stark warning about the reality facing higher education: attacks targeting universities have <a href="https://www.cloudrangecyber.com/news/higher-education-faces-rising-cyber-attacks-in-2024">surged nearly 70%</a> since 2023, with institutions now facing an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/10/cyber-signals-issue-8-education-under-siege-how-cybercriminals-target-our-schools/">average of over 2,500 cyberattack attempts each week</a>. For university CISOs and IT leaders reading about yet another campus breach, this one demands immediate attention, because the vulnerabilities that enabled Columbia’s compromise exist across virtually every campus in America.</p>
 Why Higher Education Has Become a Prime Target 
<p>Universities present an irresistible combination of valuable data and defensive weaknesses that make them ideal targets for both cybercriminals and nation-state actors. Unlike heavily regulated industries like finance or healthcare, higher education operates with unique vulnerabilities that attackers systematically exploit:</p>
 Open by Design, Vulnerable by Default 
<p>The collaborative nature of academic environments creates massive attack surfaces. Universities must balance open access for research and learning with security requirements—a tension that often resolves in favor of accessibility rather than protection. Multiple campuses, diverse user populations, and thousands of personal devices create countless entry points that traditional perimeter defenses can’t adequately secure.</p>
 Legacy Identity Systems Built for Trust, Not Security 
<p>Most universities still rely on authentication systems designed decades ago for smaller, more trusted communities. Password-based access controls and basic multi-factor authentication leave institutions vulnerable to the same social engineering and credential theft tactics that have compromised organizations across every sector.</p>
 Resource Constraints in a High-Risk Environment 
<p>Shrinking budgets force difficult choices between academic priorities and cybersecurity investments. IT teams often operate with skeleton staff while managing complex, distributed infrastructure that spans multiple generations of technology. This combination of limited resources and broad attack surfaces creates the perfect storm for successful cyberattacks.</p>
 The Columbia Attack: A Preview of What’s Coming 
<p>The details emerging from Columbia’s investigation reveal attack patterns that should concern every higher education leader. While the full forensic analysis remains ongoing, early reports suggest the attackers exploited weak identity verification processes to gain initial access, then moved laterally through systems containing sensitive student data.</p>
<p>This follows a predictable pattern: compromise user credentials through phishing or social engineering, bypass traditional MFA through known techniques, then abuse legitimate access to extract maximum value before detection.</p>
<p>The financial impact extends far beyond immediate incident response costs. Universities face regulatory fines, legal liability, remediation expenses, and the long-term reputational damage that affects enrollment and donor relationships.</p>
 Third-Party Risks Universities Often Overlook 
<p>Higher education institutions rely heavily on external vendors for everything from student information systems to dining services. Each vendor relationship introduces potential vulnerabilities, particularly when those providers have privileged access to campus systems or sensitive data.</p>
<p>The challenge isn’t just direct vendor access—it’s the inherited trust relationships that come with those partnerships. When a student information system provider gets compromised, attackers often inherit that vendor’s access to multiple university clients. This supply chain risk multiplies across the dozens of technology providers most universities depend on for daily operations.</p>
 Identity-First Defense for Higher Education 
<p>Traditional cybersecurity approaches fail in university environments because they focus on protecting systems rather than verifying identities. When attackers can convince legitimate users or help desk staff to grant access, network security becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>The most effective defense requires securing the identity layer itself. Here’s how identity-first security addresses the specific vulnerabilities that made Columbia’s breach possible:</p>
 Verified Identity Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: University help desks process hundreds of password reset requests daily from students, faculty, and staff across multiple time zones. Traditional verification relies on security questions or basic information that attackers can easily research or socially engineer.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity platforms that require users to prove their actual identity through biometric verification tied to government-issued identification. When someone requests account access, the system can definitively verify whether the person is who they claim to be—regardless of what information they provide over the phone.</p>
 Phishing-Resistant, Passwordless Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: University users are prime targets for phishing attacks, with students and faculty often sharing credentials across multiple personal and academic platforms. Traditional MFA can be bypassed through push notification fatigue or social engineering.</p>
<p>The Defense: Eliminating passwords entirely and using FIDO2-compliant biometric authentication that cannot be phished, intercepted, or socially engineered. There are no codes to read over the phone and no push notifications to accidentally accept.</p>
 Risk-Based Access Controls 
<p>The Challenge: University environments require flexible access from multiple locations and devices, making traditional location-based or device-based controls impractical.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity-bound access controls that verify the person requesting access, regardless of their device or location. Even if attackers compromise approved devices or spoof trusted networks, they cannot authenticate without the legitimate user’s verified biometric identity.</p>
 Implementation Considerations for Universities 
<p>Regulatory Compliance Universities handle FERPA-protected student records, research data subject to various federal requirements, and often health information covered by HIPAA. Identity platforms that meet federal standards like FedRAMP High Authorization and NIST 800-63-3 demonstrate they can handle the complex compliance requirements universities face.</p>
<p>Operational Continuity Identity-based attacks can disrupt everything from class registration to research operations. The cost of operational disruption often exceeds the direct costs of incident response and can affect the institution’s academic mission for months or years.</p>
<p>Integration Requirements Modern identity platforms must integrate with existing campus systems—from learning management platforms to research computing resources—without disrupting daily academic operations.</p>
 The Time to Act is Now 
<p>Columbia’s breach isn’t an isolated incident—it’s a preview of what’s coming for every university that hasn’t modernized their identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Rather than detecting breaches after they’ve compromised sensitive data, identity-first security prevents them from succeeding by securing the identity layer that attackers target first. The question isn’t whether your institution will face an identity-based attack—it’s whether you’ll be ready when it comes.</p>

<p>On this episode we spoke with Teresa Wu, Vice President of Smart Credentials and Access at IDEMIA. IDEMIA has been involved with many U.S. states for their mobile IDs, including New York, Arizona, Iowa, Delaware and more. Very few people on earth have more experience than Teresa working with governments to issue digital credentials.</p><p>We asked her what would encourage more states to launch mobile IDs and drive end-user adoption. Her response was: more relying party use cases. So, we spent most of our conversation exploring questions like:</p>  Should relying parties wait to adopt until standards mature and more people have digital IDs?  How can relying parties get started now?  How much should the industry channel its energy towards innovation vs. standardization?  How will the wallet landscape evolve? Will operating system wallets dominate, or will there be lots of wallets?  <p>We closed out by covering the lessons Teresa has learned through all this experience for public servants. I think this conversation will be relevant to anybody interested in digital IDs, either on the issuance or acceptance side.</p><p>You can find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresawu/">Teresa</a> on Linkedin and learn more about <a href="https://www.idemia.com/">IDEMIA</a> on their website.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

   There’s been renewed attention lately on mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and the ISO/IEC specification that defines them. One of the more surprising aspects of the specification is that it allows the entity verifying a credential to contact the issuer directly in real time, a capability known as "phone home."

<p>“There’s been renewed attention lately on mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC specification</a> that defines them.

<p>That real-time lookup can serve legitimate needs, like revocation checks. But it also opens the door to targeted location tracking and behavioral profiling, especially if it’s implemented without transparency or user controls.</p>

<p>I’m less concerned here with how we got to this point—though it’s worth <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/24/digital-identity-open-standards/">reflecting</a> on the impact of paywalled standards and quiet design compromises—and more concerned with how we talk about it now. Too often, we respond to surveillance risks or fraud threats with hardline positions that don’t allow room for healthy disagreement or practical tradeoffs.</p>



 Imaginary Perspectives 



<p>To unpack the complexity, I’ve imagined three personas who reflect common but well-reasoned positions in the debate over real-time credential verification. Each has a valid point. As a friend wisely said, “A world without any surveillance and uncontrolled fraud is bad, no matter what some think. A world without any fraud because there is complete overhead control is also bad. We need to focus on finding an acceptable compromise.” These personas were not modeled on any particular individuals, so if you do see yourself here, think of yourself as an archetype, not a target.&nbsp;</p>



 Dr. Rhea Jamison, Privacy Researcher 



<p>“Surveillance should never be the default. If it must happen, make it visible, optional, and rare.”</p>



<p>Rhea has spent two decades advising civil liberties groups and participating in privacy-focused standards work. She sees invisible surveillance capabilities not as a theoretical risk, but as a historical pattern. When surveillance infrastructure is built into technical architecture, it tends to get used, often without meaningful consent or transparency.</p>



<p>Her concern with “phone home” verification models is twofold:</p>



 
 They enable real-time, fine-grained tracking of when and where a credential is used, turning the verifier-issuer relationship into a persistent surveillance channel. 



 The user may never know this is happening. As demonstrated in recent analysis of ISO/IEC 18013-5, an issuer can silently switch a credential from device-only to server-retrieval mode during a routine update. 
 



<p>She draws a sharp distinction between linkability, where transactions can be correlated later, and active surveillance, where every verification pings the issuer and generates a time-stamped log.</p>



<p>Rhea does not consider herself an absolutist. She acknowledges that in rare cases, real-time checks may be warranted. But only if:</p>



 
 The user is clearly informed that network contact will occur; 



 There is a viable offline alternative; 



 All server retrieval events are auditable by the user. 
 



<p>“Surveillance infrastructure rarely stays dormant. If we build systems that can track people invisibly, we have to assume someone, somewhere, eventually will.”</p>



 Marcus Lee, VP of Fraud Risk 



<p>“You can’t prevent fraud with stale data. Some level of real-time validation is necessary.”</p>



<p>Marcus runs enterprise fraud strategy at a multinational financial services firm. His team handles fraud mitigation across banking, healthcare, and payment systems. For Marcus, the risk isn’t theoretical: fraudsters already exploit credentialing gaps to create synthetic identities, steal controlled substances, and bypass onboarding checks.</p>



<p>He makes three key arguments for phone-home capability:</p>



 
 Regulatory compliance: Banks must meet <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aml.asp">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) standards that often require verifying the current status of a credential at the time of use. 



 High-risk scenarios: From dispensing opioids at a pharmacy to controlling access to critical infrastructure, static credential models can’t flag suspended, stolen, or recently revoked identities in time to prevent harm. 



 Operational integrity: Real-time revocation and risk signals are critical for dynamic threat environments, such as when a compromised credential is detected and must be disabled immediately. 
 



<p>Marcus doesn’t ignore the privacy conversation. He believes enterprises must:</p>



 
 Minimize data retention 



 Disclose verification policies 



 Use contractually bounded systems 
 



<p>But banning real-time issuer contact outright? That, to him, is a risk too far.</p>



<p>“Fraud isn’t solved with good intentions. If we strip out risk signals in the name of privacy, we’ll end up rebuilding surveillance tools elsewhere with less transparency and with fewer guardrails.”</p>



 Priya Banerjee, Identity Standards Architect 



<p>“Both concerns are valid. Let’s design systems that make phone-home capabilities visible, limited, and accountable.”</p>



<p>Priya has helped draft standards at several of the more open standards organizations. She sees herself as a translator between idealism and operational need. She agrees with Rhea that invisible surveillance is unacceptable, but also agrees with Marcus that some environments can’t function responsibly without up-to-date credential data. (Priya is kind of my hero.)</p>



<p>Her view is that technical architecture should support both offline-first and risk-aware models, with strict boundaries. She proposes:</p>



 
 Device-based verification as the default 



 Explicit and visible consent if server retrieval is needed 



 Mandatory signaling by the verifier so users know which mode is active 



 Logged retrieval history that users can inspect (or challenge) 
 



<p>She also raises a quiet but critical point: when standards prohibit real-world use cases outright, implementers will often fork the spec or build their own tooling, often without the privacy protections the standard might have enforced.</p>



<p>“Designing for flexibility doesn’t mean compromising values. It means making systems that work in the real world, while ensuring the user stays informed, in control, and protected.”</p>



 Comparison Table 



ConcernRhea (Privacy Advocate)Marcus (Fraud Prevention)Priya (Balanced Architect)Default verification modeDevice-onlyContext-dependentDevice-first, fallback allowedReal-time server retrievalStrongly opposed; privacy riskRequired in high-risk sectorsPermitted with consent and loggingConsent modelMust be explicit and revocableNot always practicalRequired and user-visibleRevocation handlingLocal proofs, time-limited credsReal-time checks essentialHybrid: periodic updates + fallbackTransparency mechanismsMandatory user logsControlled via policyTechnically enforced signalingAcceptable tradeoffsVery few; privacy is paramountSome surveillance justifiedBoundaries + adaptability



 Conclusion 



<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all answer here. And that’s the point. These aren’t just technical choices; they’re governance decisions that shape what our systems can and can’t do. They are risk management decisions; no one size will fit all. The phone-home debate should be about recognizing that the needs of privacy, security, and accountability are not mutually exclusive, but they are in tension.</p>



<p>We build better infrastructure when we acknowledge those tensions rather than ignore them. That means creating room for high-risk use cases to function responsibly without turning every ID scan into a tracking event. It means embedding consent and transparency into the architecture, not just assuming policy will save us later.</p>



<p>These debates are worth having and revisiting as technology, regulation, and use cases evolve. Let’s keep listening, keep adjusting, and keep building systems that are worthy of the trust we expect users to place in them.</p>

 Transcript 



 Introduction 



<p>00:00:00 Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>00:00:26 Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Episode Overview 



<p>00:00:29 Hi there and welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. In today’s episode, we’re diving into a topic that’s been grabbing attention, especially among those of us who spend our time thinking about infrastructure standards and users’ rights.</p>



<p>00:00:44 Initially, this episode almost began as a rage blog—a cathartic response sparked by a lively signal chat. Although I wasn’t the one raging, that conversation inspired the post you’re about to experience.</p>



 



 Understanding Phone Home and MDLs 



<p>00:01:00 The discussion centers on the Phone Home feature built into the specification for mobile driver’s licenses (MDLs). On the surface, MDLs are more than just a digital version of your government-issued ID—they’re designed to be stored on your phone, offering convenience, enhanced security, and reduced risks of forgery.</p>



<p>00:01:09 Yet, as with every innovation, the devil is in the details. The ISO specification includes a Phone Home functionality that allows systems verifying your ID—whether by a bartender, a TSA agent, or a pharmacist—to contact the issuer in real time to check its status.</p>



 Key Points: 



 
 Real-Time Verification: Ensures immediate feedback on license status. 



 Privacy Concerns: Opens the door to tracking when, where, and how often your ID is presented. 



 Implementation Flexibility: Depending on the issuer, this capability can be toggled silently. 
 



 



 Privacy vs. Practicality: The Debate 



<p>00:02:05 At first glance, real-time verification may seem entirely reasonable. After all, if an ID is revoked, expired, or flagged, shouldn’t the system know instantly?</p>



<p>00:02:16 However, there are notable catches:</p>



 
 Surveillance Risks: The same capability enables individual tracking. 



 Silent Activation: This feature can be turned on without the user’s knowledge. 
 



<p>These trade-offs highlight that implementation matters—a theme that will continue throughout our discussion.</p>



 



 Persona Spotlight: Dr. Rhea Jamieson 



<p>00:03:19 Let’s introduce our first fictitious persona, inspired by real-world conversations. Meet Dr. Rhea Jamieson, a dedicated privacy researcher with decades of experience collaborating with civil liberties groups and contributing to privacy-focused standards.</p>



<p>00:03:33 Dr. Jamieson’s core concerns include:</p>



 
 Default Avoidance of Surveillance: She argues that surveillance should never be the standard. 



 Visibility and Consent: Any real-time verification must be visible, optional, and auditable. 



 Risk of Inadvertent Activation: Once surveillance is technologically enabled, the pressure to use it grows. 
 



<p>00:04:12 In her view, cryptographic proofs and time-limited credentials should be leveraged to build systems that inherently avoid default surveillance—even if there are rare situations (such as border crossings) that might justify such features.</p>



 



 Persona Spotlight: Marcus Lee 



<p>00:05:11 Shifting to a different perspective, meet Marcus Lee, the imaginary Vice President of Fraud Strategy for a global financial institution. His world revolves around combating synthetic identity fraud, money laundering, and managing relentless regulatory audits.</p>



<p>00:05:37 Marcus believes:</p>



 
 Stale Data Is Risky: Static credentials, which can’t be updated or revoked in real time, are a liability. 



 Necessity of Real-Time Risk Signals: Fraud prevention demands immediate validation. 



 Controlled Usage: While he doesn’t advocate for Phone Home as the default, he insists on its availability where risks and liabilities are pronounced. 
 



<p>00:06:02 To him, privacy policies, audits, and enterprise-wide safeguards can accommodate real-time verification without sacrificing necessary safeguards.</p>



 



 Persona Spotlight: Priya – Bridging Both Worlds 



<p>00:06:43 Finally, let’s meet Priya, an imaginary standards architect who encapsulates the balancing act between privacy and practicality. With extensive experience across multiple standards development processes, Priya strives to bridge philosophy with real-world deployment.</p>



<p>00:06:50 Her approach is all about designing systems that are:</p>



 
 Visible: Phone Home capabilities should be transparent and clearly communicated. 



 Limited: Device-based verification should be the default, with strict limits on server retrieval. 



 Accountable: Every network retrieval must be logged for user review. 
 



<p>00:07:23 Priya’s vision emphasizes that designing for informed use with visible, enforceable boundaries allows for a dual benefit—supporting both privacy-first applications and high-risk scenarios.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>00:08:06 The episode delivers a crucial message: designing flexible digital identity systems does not have to mean compromising core values. Consider these essential points:</p>



 
 Surveillance vs. Fraud Prevention: One perspective argues to design out surveillance, while another insists on embedding risk signals to prevent fraud. 



 Balanced Implementation: A middle ground is not only possible but necessary—standards can support both privacy and security with transparency and accountability. 



 Informed Consent: Ultimately, users should be kept informed, in control, and protected at every step. 
 



 



 Final Thoughts &amp; Call to Action 



<p>00:09:03 In conclusion, these perspectives are not mutually exclusive. As we build, standardize, and deploy digital credentials, let’s:</p>



 
 Stay Engaged: Keep the conversation open rather than viewing it as a zero-sum game. 



 Listen to Diverse Viewpoints: Every perspective—privacy, fraud prevention, and balanced standards—adds value. 
 



<p>00:09:22 Let’s build systems that truly reflect the trust we’re asking people to bestow upon us.</p>

<p>Not that I’m a lawyer! But I’m giving a short speech on AI regulation at the 2025 Asian Law Schools Association (ALSA) <a href="https://www.alsa2025.com/">Law and Technology Conference</a> in Sydney, on July 11.</p>
 Abstract 
<p>The phenomenon of deep fakes, where Generative AI creates realistic still and moving images mimicking real individuals, is deeply troubling for actors, authors and public figures. Some people have tried to assert intellectual property rights over their likenesses, but these approaches have proved problematic. Legal reform in this area would be complicated and time consuming.</p>
<p>Here I propose a simpler way to legally protect appearances, by applying established technology-neutral data privacy law to facial images and voice recordings.</p>
<p>Note carefully that this is not to say that faces and voices are necessarily “private”; instead, the point is to appeal to data protection principles which simply operate to restrain the flow of certain types of information, namely personal information (PI).</p>
<p>My argument in brief goes as follows:</p>
 
 Facial images and voice recordings constitute personal information under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A03712">Australian legal definition</a>, namely any “information … about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable”.Indeed, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/social-media-and-online-privacy/photos-and-videos">advised that photos and videos are treated as personal information</a> if the identity of individuals “is clear or could reasonably be worked out”. 
 Under technology neutral privacy law, privacy principles apply to personal information whether it is collected directly or indirectly. The OAIC has developed <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-guidance-for-organisations-and-government-agencies/more-guidance/guide-to-data-analytics-and-the-australian-privacy-principles">specific guidelines for “collection by creation”</a>, with a broad interpretation of collection to cover “gathering, acquiring or obtaining personal information from any source and by any means”, including “when information … generated from other information”. 
 So, if a Generative AI model creates a visual and/or acoustic likeness of a real-life individual Alice, then we can regard the model as having collected personal information about Alice. The use and disclosure of the generated likeness would be subject to legislated privacy principles. Consideration would usually have to be given to Alice’s consent for likenesses of her to be produced and disseminated. 
 
<p>I conclude that technology-neutral data privacy laws — such as Australia’s Privacy Act (1988), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (2016) and the American Privacy Rights Act (Updated House Draft, 23rd May 2024) — contain powerful and proven legal mechanisms that could help limit certain adverse effects of generative AI that are otherwise proving difficult to contain.</p>

 From wax seals to biometrics, we explore the past, present and future of identity verification. 



<p>Verifying your identity used to be simple: you just had to sign your name and if you couldn’t write, mark an ‘X’. A simple and far from rigorous process – certainly one that wouldn’t pass today’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> rules or fly in today’s strictly controlled and regulated environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that we’ve come a long way since signatures and wax seals, but the purpose of identity verification has remained consistent throughout history: to distinguish between individuals, establish trust, and allocate rights or responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re obsessed with everything identity, and as one of the Heads of Product at IDnow, I’m particularly fascinated with the different ways in which we consciously and subconsciously identify ourselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, did you know that modern security cameras are now able to identify someone based on how they move? Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant don’t just listen to words — they analyze the frequency and rhythm of a voice to decide if it’s really the user and whether to provide the user profile’s private data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, fun fact: due to its unique shape, texture, and vein pattern, the human tongue could, theoretically, be used <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5210096/">for personal identification</a>. In fact, as a biometric identifier, a tongue can be as accurate as a fingerprint or iris. The main barriers to adoption include hygiene concerns, user discomfort, and technical challenges in consistent imaging. However, it’s perhaps only a matter of time until Apple devises a way to scan my tongue as I speak into my iPhone…&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has also been research into the viability of using brain reactions to stimuli (e.g. flashing lights or sounds) as biometric identifiers as brain signal patterns are nearly impossible to fake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’re also fascinated with the future of digital identity verification. But before we look ahead, let us first investigate the history of identity verification.</p>

 8 milestones in the history of identity verification. 



  Pre 3000 BC: It can be assumed that as people in small tribes and communities tended to all know each other, no formal documentation was ever needed. Recognition was based on appearance, voice, posture, or habits. Tattoos, scars, or tribal markings were, however, used to signify group identity or status.&nbsp;  



  3000BC to 300AD: Alongside the birth of larger civilizations like Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Rome came written records. Population registries (some found on stone tablets), often tied to occupation, parentage, or land ownership, date back to 3000BC.&nbsp;<br><br>Ancient Rome used written census rolls to verify citizens for taxation and military service purposes. Local scribes with local knowledge would often be used as the first level of identity verification.&nbsp;It was also during this period when individuals started to use engraved rings or stamps to validate their identity or to press into wax seals to authenticate documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  300 to 1500: References to letters permitting travel through Persian territories, (which many consider to be the first passport) were found from the 5th century. By the 15th century, official documents called “safe conducts” were used by the British Empire to allow subjects to travel abroad safely. Passports soon followed providing official identification for travel purposes.&nbsp;  



  1500 to 1800: In the early modern period, signatures started to become used as the legal mark of a personal identity, especially in the agreement of contracts.&nbsp;  



  1800 to 1900: By the industrial age, identity records were centralized and state-backed with various governments forming civil registries. Photos began appearing on official documents and fingerprints were being used to identify individuals. The first documented use of <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/vucetich.html">fingerprint analysis occurred in 1892 in Argentina</a> to prove a murder case.&nbsp;  



  1900 to 1990: Birth certificates and Social Security Numbers started to become standard across most nations whilst driving licenses and passports became the most common identity documents. Other countries introduced national identity cards. Even, as I recently discovered whilst sorting through items at my mother’s house, my grandmother. Of course, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">UK has always had a very different approach to identity verification</a>.<br><br>By the late 20th century, we started to see a shift from recognition to authentication. Biometrics, including fingerprints, facial features, and retina scans were introduced to gain access to high-security environments. The first retina scan was used in 1984 to enter secure US government facilities.  



 Jonathan’s grandmother’s National Registration Identity Card was first issued in May 1943 and last ‘authenticated’ in 1948. 



 



  1990 to 2013: The digital age was the period when identity became portable. Usernames and passwords became the norm to access online services, and email and social media accounts became informal identity layers. This was also when digital signatures and encryption were first used in official documents.<br><br>In 2013 we saw the introduction of the iPhone Touch ID, which brought biometrics into mainstream consumer technology. (Face ID would follow in 2017.)&nbsp;Unfortunately, fraudsters were not far behind and shortly after the introduction of these innovative methods of identity verification came an increase in fraudsters using creative ways to hack digital services.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2014, IDnow was founded in Munich, Germany and launched its flagship product, VideoIdent. Our expert-led video identity verification service was considered revolutionary at the time as it enabled organizations to offer the same legal equivalency as an in-person identity verification and had just been allowed by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (<a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Homepage/homepage_node.html">BaFin</a>).&nbsp;  



  2014 to 2024: During this decade, a variety of identity verification and digital signature solutions were added to the IDnow portfolio, including the AI-supported, fully automated AutoIdent identity verification solution.&nbsp;<br><br>In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity verification&nbsp;technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German provider identity Trust Management AG, establishing us as one of the largest European players in the identity industry.&nbsp;It was during this decade that industries at large adopted automated identity verification. From scanning passports at airports to unlocking phones and accessing apps, the public now uses sophisticated AI and biometrics to validate their identities daily. They use smart watches to track biometric signals, and have become used to increased security measures, such as multi-factor authentication.  



 What’s coming next? 2025 – 2035.&nbsp; 



<p>Here are just a few trends that we’re likely to see soon in the identity space. Many organizations will start to focus on integrating self-sovereign identity into their platforms, where the individual owns their own data and identity is delivered through decentralized systems, such as blockchain. Here, data is shared only on a need-to-know basis. A great user experience if you want to prove your age without sharing your date of birth, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regulation will continue to evolve around access to data stored on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC (Near-Field Communication)</a> chips, which are often embedded in ID cards and documents. In the past, access to this data tended to be restricted to government agencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also an industry-wide drive toward improving customer experience, especially with regards to reducing authentication time. This will likely become easier and more widespread as individual governments and industries start to issue digital identity credentials that can be stored in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also seeing the growth of cross-border &amp; global interoperability through emerging global standards like W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO 18013-5 for mobile IDs. Projects including eIDAS 2.0 in the EU aim to make digital identities and digital wallets usable across multiple countries, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation</a> will set out what methods of identity verification will become compliant in the near future.</p>



 The future of identity verification.&nbsp; 



<p>As the market evolves at lightning speed, the businesses of tomorrow will need more than basic verification, they’ll need trust solutions that are continuous, intelligent, and built to scale. To succeed in the future, businesses will need to stay ahead of regulatory changes, outsmart new fraud threats, and deliver standout customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/evolution-identity-identity-trust-ecosystem/">mission is simple</a>: we’re not just another service provider.

<p>At Bluesky, we're constantly working to help you personalize your experience. We know that staying connected means different things to different people, and sometimes, you just need to cut through the noise. That's why we're excited to introduce three updates to notifications:</p>
 
 Activity Notifications: Opt-in to receive push notifications from specific accounts. 
 Enhanced Notification Settings: Controls to fine tune which notifications you receive. 
 Repost Notifications: Receive notifications when someone likes or reposts posts you’ve reposted. 
 
<br>
 Activity Notifications: Never Miss a Post Again! 

  
  Tap the bell to receive push notifications from a specific account.

<p>Staying connected with the accounts that matter most to you just got easier with Activity Notifications, which let you receive push and in-app notifications directly from specific accounts. Never miss a breaking update, a new thought, or a live moment from the accounts you follow closely.</p>
<p>It's simple to enable these new notifications:</p>
 
 Navigate to a profile: Visit the profile of an account you love. 
 Look for the bell icon: If they have this feature enabled, you'll see a small bell icon next to the 'Follow' button. 
 Tap the bell: Press it, and you'll be able to enable notifications specifically for their new posts, and optionally, even their replies. 
 
<p>You can easily opt in to manage the list of people you're receiving "Activity Notifications" from at any time by going to Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Activity Notifications.</p>
 
  <p>For posters: if you want to keep things more mellow, you have the option to disable this feature entirely, or enable it only for people you follow, by going to Settings &gt; Privacy and Security &gt; Allow others to get notified of your posts.</p>
 
<br>
 Enhanced Notification Settings: Take Charge of Your Notifications 

  
  Press the settings icon in the top right of your notifications to fine-tune what you receive.

<p>We’re rolling out new controls over the notifications you receive. Head over to Settings &gt; Notifications to fine-tune your preferences. You can now choose to receive notifications from:</p>
 
 Everyone: Stay in the loop with all interactions. 
 People you follow: Filter out the noise and focus on your close connections. 
 No One: For when you need a moment of peace and quiet. 
 
<p>Here are the notification types you can now customize:</p>
 
 Replies: Control who can notify you when they reply to your posts. 
 Mentions: Decide when you're pinged for a mention. 
 Quotes: Manage notifications for posts that quote yours. 
 Likes: Get notified when someone likes your posts. 
 Reposts: See when your posts are reposted. 
 New followers: Keep track of your growing audience. 
 Likes of your reposts: Get feedback on the content you curate. 
 Reposts of your reposts: See how far your shared content travels. 
 Everything else: This covers general notifications, like when someone joins via one of your Starter Packs, or verification notifications. We've kept this category flexible so we can add more helpful updates in the future. 
 
<p>You can also enable and disable whether you receive push notifications for each of these categories, giving you even more granular control.</p>
 
  <p>A Note on Priority Notifications: Our previous "priority notifications" feature has been replaced by these new, comprehensive settings. If you previously had priority notifications enabled, your settings have been seamlessly migrated to these new options. Changing your reply, mention, and quote notifications to "people you follow only" will have the same effect as priority notifications did previously.</p>
 
<br>
 Get Notified About Your Reposts! 

  
  You'll now receive notifications for likes and reposts of your reposts.

<p>Finally, we’re introducing a new improvement for those who love to curate and share posts: you can now receive notifications when someone likes or reposts content you've reposted. Of course, you can adjust these notifications in your settings, choosing to receive them from everyone, just people you follow, or turning them off entirely.</p>
<p>We believe these updates will empower you to shape your Bluesky experience to be exactly what you want. Dive into your settings and explore the new controls you have!</p>

<p>Have you ever stopped to think about how systems like banking apps, eKYC platforms, or even e-learning portals know whether the person verifying their identity is real — and not just a photo or a deepfake? In a digital world where identity fraud is growing smarter every day, verifying a face isn’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>Enter the liveness detection SDK, the invisible but powerful tool that ensures the face on screen belongs to a real, physically present human being.</p>
<p>In this blog, we’ll walk you through what a liveness detection SDK is, how it works, why it’s a must-have in 2025, and how <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> offers one of the most secure, developer-friendly solutions available today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Liveness Detection SDK? 
<p>A liveness detection SDK is a set of developer tools that allows businesses and developers to integrate anti-spoofing capabilities into their apps, websites, and digital workflows. It works in tandem with a <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a> to verify not just the identity of a user but also their presence.</p>
<p>While facial recognition determines who the person is, liveness detection ensures they are real, not a printed image, video replay, deepfake, or 3D mask.</p>
<p>Liveness detection SDKs are particularly valuable in:</p>
 
 Digital onboarding and eKYC 
 Secure login and access control 
 Financial transaction approvals 
 Telemedicine patient identity checks 
 Online exam proctoring 
 
<p>Recognito build SDKs that use advanced AI, computer vision, and biometric algorithms to carry out liveness detection in real-time with ultra-high accuracy.</p>
<p></p>
 How Does a Liveness Detection SDK Work? 
<p>Let’s break this down into an easy-to-follow process that mirrors real-world use cases:</p>
 Step 1: Face Detection 
<p>The system identifies a human face in front of the camera using machine learning-based face detection.</p>
 Step 2: Visual Capture 
<p>The SDK captures a short video or a burst of frames to analyze facial dynamics.</p>
 Step 3: AI-Based Analysis 
<p>The AI model checks for key indicators like depth, blinking, subtle facial movements, skin texture, or even blood flow patterns.</p>
 Step 4: Spoof Detection 
<p>Based on the data collected, the system determines whether the image is real (live) or fake (spoofed).</p>
 Step 5: Verification Result 
<p>If the user passes the liveness detection for face recognition, the identity verification continues instantly and securely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process takes just a few seconds, with no manual intervention required. It ensures that digital platforms can operate 24/7 with a high degree of trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passive vs. Active Liveness Detection 
<p>A strong face liveness detection SDK usually includes both passive and active detection methods:</p>



Type
Description
Ideal Use Case


Passive Liveness Detection
No user interaction required. Relies on analyzing facial features, textures, and natural movements.
Seamless onboarding, user-friendly apps


Active Liveness Detection
Requires users to carry out specific facial gestures like eye blinking, head rotation, or smiling.
High-security environments like digital banking, border control



<p>Recognito’s liveness detection SDK supports both passive and active modes, giving organizations the flexibility to balance user experience with the level of security needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Is a Liveness Detection SDK Essential in 2025? 
<p>As fraud evolves, so must our defenses. Here’s why integrating a liveness detection SDK is no longer optional:</p>
  1. Prevent Identity Spoofing 
<p>Modern spoofing attacks use high-resolution printed photos, digital screen replays, or even AI-generated deepfakes. A liveness detection SDK stops them in their tracks by requiring real-time, live biometric data.</p>
  2. Real-Time Identity Verification 
<p>Whether onboarding a customer or authenticating a returning user, decisions are made in under 2 seconds without human review.</p>
  3. Seamless UX 
<p>No OTPs, no passwords, no frustrating forms. Users verify their identity through natural interactions or no interaction at all in the case of passive detection.</p>
  4. Regulatory Compliance 
<p>Industries like fintech, healthcare, and telecommunications are governed by strict KYC, AML, and GDPR rules. <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">Facial liveness detection</a> helps meet those standards while minimizing user friction.</p>
  5. Easy Developer Integration 
<p>Recognito’s liveness detection SDK comes with detailed API documentation, mobile and web libraries, and support for Android, iOS, and desktop platforms.</p>
  6. Cost Reduction 
<p>Automated identity checks reduce the need for human intervention, speed up onboarding, and lower overall costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Use Cases for Liveness Detection SDK Across Industries 
<p>Liveness detection SDKs are used globally across a wide range of sectors. Here are a few industry-specific examples:</p>
  Banking &amp; Fintech 
 
 Enable passwordless logins 
 Prevent fraud during mobile banking transactions 
 Speed up digital KYC onboarding 
 
  E-commerce &amp; Marketplaces 
 
 Verify seller and buyer identities 
 Stop impersonation and account takeovers

<p>Guyana’s $35.4M e-ID Rollout Delayed Over Integration Hurdles but Set to Launch Within a Year</p>



<p>Guyana’s US$35.4 million electronic ID card system has been delayed for over two years due to a technical issue integrating the e-ID platform with the existing passport database, according to Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo. The German firm Veridos Identity Solutions is responsible for the integration, which has proven to be the most complex part of the project. The government now expects the chip-based e-ID cards to be rolled out within the next 12 months. Once launched, the cards will be integrated with the country’s Smart Country surveillance system and will be mandatory for foreigners, enabling real-time tracking and biometric identification. The Digital Identity Card Bill of 2023 mandates that applicants provide a range of personal and biometric data, and the card will be essential for banking and employment eligibility. <a href="https://demerarawaves.com/2025/06/26/us35-million-electronic-id-card-system-delayed-because-of-integration-glitch/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8SHFnwJjzhnYGW2sOOUUUcTtaFlgoiLxs-hD0jHr76oqP7anFbfqWTXN2CXBVdExRkUeEv#google_vignette">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Georgia Judge Blocks Social Media Age Verification Law Over Free Speech Concerns</p>



<p>A federal judge has blocked Georgia’s law requiring age verification for social media users, citing violations of free speech and constitutional protections. The law, which was set to take effect this week, mandated that platforms verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for those under 16. Judge Amy Totenberg issued a preliminary injunction, agreeing with trade group <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/netchoice/">NetChoice</a> that the law restricts minors’ rights, hinders anonymous speech, and limits access to information. Georgia plans to appeal the decision, while this case adds to a growing list of similar laws halted in at least eight other states due to constitutional concerns. <a href="https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/post/judge-blocks-ga-s-social-media-age-verification-law-citing-free-speech-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7CvMQcohlWHUPghc6K8ZUUEpWivJPE2j8ylQXlQFRFUR-Z9YEeW39clrHg2gQHmEOA4by">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Cloudflare Shifts to Default AI Bot Blocking with Pay Per Crawl Model</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cloudflare/">Cloudflare</a> has shifted its policy on AI web crawling, now blocking AI bots by default unless explicitly permitted by website owners. This move ends the previous opt-out model and introduces a “Pay Per Crawl” system, allowing publishers to set pricing terms for AI data access. The change follows widespread adoption of the opt-out option by over a million Cloudflare customers and aims to give content creators more control in the face of increasing generative AI activity. Experts suggest the policy could significantly disrupt GenAI business models reliant on free web data, particularly amid growing legal scrutiny and competition. <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cloudflare-blocks-ai-web-scraping/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTqUEgQzAQKWBdxhIZ9tfHVjMEfgu_8wGzXpYxXkyLtsVcXJ4U2-Q08qVNPhSpZrAKseY">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Qantas Data Breach Exposes Personal Information of Up to 6 Million Customers via Third-Party Platform</p>



<p>A cybersecurity breach affecting Qantas has potentially exposed the personal data of up to 6 million customers, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers. The breach targeted a third-party platform used by a Qantas contact center, though Qantas systems themselves were not compromised. The airline has notified relevant Australian authorities and continues to investigate the extent of the breach, which is suspected to involve the hacking group Scattered Spider. Financial data and login credentials were not accessed, and frequent flyer accounts remain secure. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/02/qantas-data-breach-sees-up-to-6m-customer-records-at-risk/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTqUEgQzAQKWBdxhIZ9tfHVjMEfgu_8wGzXpYxXkyLtsVcXJ4U2-Q08qVNPhSpZrAKseY">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>South Dakota Enacts Broad Age Verification Law for Adult Sites Following Supreme Court Backing of Texas Measure</p>



<p>Following a recent Supreme Court decision upholding Texas’ age verification law for pornographic websites, South Dakota is implementing a similar law requiring all sites that regularly host adult content to deploy age verification or estimation technology. Unlike Texas’ law, which applies only if a third of a site’s content is adult in nature, South Dakota’s legislation imposes no such threshold. Supporters, including Attorney General Marty Jackley, cite the Supreme Court’s decision as validation, while critics, such as the ACLU and Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent, warn the measures could infringe on adults’ First Amendment rights by overly restricting access to protected speech. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/south-dakota-to-push-ahead-with-age-verification-law-following-scotus-opinion?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CTqUEgQzAQKWBdxhIZ9tfHVjMEfgu_8wGzXpYxXkyLtsVcXJ4U2-Q08qVNPhSpZrAKseY">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>FinCEN Grants Banks Flexibility to Collect TINs from Third Parties under CIP Rule</p>



<p>FinCEN has issued an order allowing banks to collect Tax Identification Number (TIN) information from third-party sources instead of directly from customers, offering greater flexibility in meeting compliance requirements under the Customer Identification Program (CIP) Rule. The move, made in coordination with key banking regulators, reflects changes in how customers interact with financial institutions and incorporates public feedback from a 2024 request for information. While optional, the order requires banks to maintain risk-based procedures to verify customer identities effectively. The exemption aims to reduce administrative burden without increasing financial crime risks. <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-permits-banks-use-alternative-collection-method-obtaining-tin-information?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_2lAgNt-WocAz4mcJtwbIxV41JWoSSW2coOH-GjQDsnTeBLOE1PVs91PRz0SZNIjimSsW">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>German Regulators Push Apple and Google to Delist DeepSeek Over GDPR Breach Concerns</p>



<p>Germany’s data protection authorities have formally urged Apple and Google to consider removing the Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek from their app stores over alleged violations of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The request follows similar actions by regulators in Italy and Ireland and centers on concerns that DeepSeek inadequately protects European user data transferred to China. The German complaint cites GDPR Article 44, which restricts cross-border data transfers without sufficient safeguards. If upheld, the enforcement could lead to broader EU restrictions, with app store delistings significantly limiting DeepSeek’s presence in the region. <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/germany-urges-apple-google-to-block-chinese-ai-app-deepseek/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_2lAgNt-WocAz4mcJtwbIxV41JWoSSW2coOH-GjQDsnTeBLOE1PVs91PRz0SZNIjimSsW">(Source)</a></p>

<p>London, July 3, 2025  – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announces its strategic partnership with <a href="https://keyless.io/">Keyless</a>, a leader and pioneer in privacy-preserving biometric authentication, signifying a significant step in the future of digital identity security.</p>



<p>This collaboration integrates IDnow’s robust range of identity verification and digital signature solutions with Keyless’ biometric multi-factor authentication technology. Organizations can now enroll customers with IDnow and authenticate them with Keyless, introducing the concept of Continuous Trust. When a high-risk action occurs – like changing personal details or recovering an account – the biometric Keyless captures for authentication is matched against the biometric IDnow captured during signup.</p>



<p>In an era where digital interactions are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated threats, such as deepfakes and AI-driven fraud, the need for seamless and secure digital identity has never been more critical. IDnow’s commitment to embedding trust at every stage of the digital experience aligns seamlessly with Keyless’ innovative approach to biometric authentication, which ensures user privacy by eliminating the need to store biometric data.</p>



<blockquote><p>Trust is no longer a one-time checkpoint but a continuous process. Our partnership with Keyless enhances our ability to fight emerging fraud typologies amid a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, ensuring that digital identities remain secure and trustworthy throughout their lifecycle.</p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Keyless delivers multi-factor authentication in under 300 milliseconds by checking both the user’s face and their device was the one used during enrollment. It combines this with a unique cryptographic approach that transforms all biometric data into a non-PII format, guaranteeing user privacy. By layering privacy-first authentication from Keyless with IDnow’s flexible verification capabilities, organizations gain a future-ready solution that evolves with new threats, user behaviors, and regulatory demands.</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the biggest questions we get is whether users need to enroll twice – with the IDV and with Keyless. Until recently, the answer was yes. But what’s pivotal about the partnership with IDnow is that we can silently enroll users into Keyless during the IDnow verification flow. It’s a game changer for reducing friction.</p>Fabian Eberle, COO and Co-founder of Keyless</blockquote>



<p>This partnership is particularly significant for industries where security and compliance are paramount, such as banking, fintech, and healthcare. By integrating technologies, IDnow and Keyless offer a scalable, intelligent trust framework that not only meets current regulatory standards but is also adaptable to future challenges.</p>

<p>A number of recent high-profile hacks and breaches have one key thing in common: the IT helpdesk. Although many new and technologically advanced threats have arisen in recent years to challenge cybersecurity professionals, numerous cybercriminals are still operating from a tried and true playbook that leans on social engineering, phishing, and the exploitation of a known vulnerability that exists in almost every organization: the human desire to help.</p>

<p>Read on for a deep dive into this threat vector and the best practices organizations should adopt to avoid being the next name in the news.</p>

 Holochain 0.5.3 ready for use <p>Building on the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-148-major-performance-improvements-with-0-5/">big speed and reliability improvements</a> in past Holochain 0.5.x releases, Holochain 0.5.3 is ready for general development. We’ve taken feedback on user experience and made further improvements to startup time and gossip reliability.</p><p>The big changes in Holochain 0.5.3 are:</p>  Agents more quickly declare and share their ‘storage arc’, the region of the DHT they claim to be holding. This makes other nodes recognise them as an authority so they can start sending new data directly to them.  Nodes detect and remember offline peers now. If any peer is unresponsive, the node makes a note of this in their peer metadata and doesn’t try requesting data from them or gossiping until they receive a new agent info record about them (which online peers will publish every twenty minutes).  All DHT requests are now sent to three random peers in parallel, and the quickest peer to respond with data wins. (Note that this isn’t necessarily the most in-sync peer, although this has always been true of DHT gets. This is helpful for nodes that don’t hold any DHT data for the address being requested, such as mobile nodes, and for any DHT query with a GetStrategy::Network.) Previously one peer at a time was contacted, and if that peer was unresponsive or didn’t hold the data, the request would time out in 60 seconds and return no data.  <p>You don’t need to do anything special to update your project to Holochain 0.5.3. HDK 0.5.2 and HDI 0.66.2 are compatible with Holochain 0.5.3, so most projects could simply choose to update Holochain but continue using the same zome dependencies. But if you do want to update your zomes to use HDK 0.5.3 and HDI 0.6.3, you’ll need to also add one explicit dependency; read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org#rust">upgrade guide</a> for instructions.</p> CI tooling changes <p>If you’re a regular contributor to Holochain repositories, we’ve introduced new org-wide policies and processes, enforced by CI workflows. All commit messages must be in the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Conventional Commits</a> format, e.g., feat: Add new admin API endpoint ListFoos or fix!: Change serialization for delete_foo(). A new bot, <a href="https://docs.cocogitto.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">cocogitto</a>, will enforce these rules on a PR by posting error comments and blocking merge for any commit that doesn’t comply.</p><p>Conventional Commits will be used in two ways:</p>  The commit messages will be used to decide how to bump version numbers (see the Conventional Commits website for details).  The changelog will now be automatically generated from commit messages.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/release-integration?tab=readme-ov-file&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">release automation readme</a> for details on how commits and merges work now. I found <a href="https://github.com/holochain/release-integration/blob/main/pre-1.0-cliff.toml?ref=blog.holochain.org#L63-L75">this section of this config file</a> especially helpful in understanding how commit messages are parsed into changelog items.</p> Office Hours 25 June: mobile WASM support <p>During our last Office Hours call, the topic of WebAssembly runtimes came up — specifically <a href="https://wasmer.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wasmer</a>’s support for mobile operating systems. We have supported various approaches in the past, including precompiled binaries for iOS (now removed) and an interpreted WebAssembly back-end. Some topics discussed include:</p>  Maintaining the interpreted back-end (<a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/introducing-wasmer-v5?ref=blog.holochain.org">WAMR</a>)  The challenge of pre-compiling WebAssembly bytecode to machine code and including in a package, which results in large package sizes  Supporting Google’s V8 as a WebAssembly back-end, which is currently supported by Wasmer, but only for 64-bit ARM devices  <p>This topic is super important, as most people’s phones are their primary computing devices, and we also happen to have a <a href="https://volla.online/?ref=blog.holochain.org">partner who makes mobile phones</a>. Discussions are ongoing, and we need your input too. If you develop mobile applications, please share your needs in the<a href="https://discord.gg/fQZmruhzTH?ref=blog.holochain.org"> #mobile-holochain channel</a> in the DEV.HC Discord. </p>

<p>Poker has gone from a casual card game to a full-blown entertainment genre. From solo Twitch grinds to live-streamed cash games with six-figure pots, poker has found a new identity online that appeals to strategy lovers, gaming fans, and viewers hungry for drama. And business is booming.</p>



<p>Millions now tune in not just to watch the hands unfold, but to follow personalities, break down big bluffs, and interact with players in real time. A recent <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-the-rise-of-poker-streams-big-wins-big-risks/id1676846015?i=1000705000717">episode of the Digital Social Hour podcast</a> laid out just how far poker streaming has come, featuring high-stakes moments, huge communities, and the growing role of poker as entertainment, not just a game of skill. Some streams even boast prize pools worth millions, with other popular streamers taking home up to $300,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That surge in popularity is encouraging rapid innovation. Poker content has evolved beyond plain hand reviews or tournament replays. Now, it’s personality-driven, visually dynamic, and constantly adapting to new formats. At the crossroads of this evolution are VTubers: virtual streamers who blend performance art, gaming culture, and digital creativity. With their rising popularity across YouTube, Kick, and even Web3 platforms, it’s only a matter of time before they get dealt into the poker game.</p>



 Poker in America: A Legal Patchwork Paving New Roads 



<p>To understand why poker streaming is such fertile ground for VTubers, it helps to look at the current poker environment in the U.S.—a legal maze that requires agility, creativity, and sometimes, a bit of boldness.</p>



<p>At the federal level, online poker is still technically prohibited. However, enforcement varies wildly, and many players rely on offshore platforms. To illustrate, let’s look at how <a href="https://www.americascardroom.eu/usa-poker/new-york/">online poker in New York</a> has played out. Since online poker has yet to be legalized, locals play on sites such as the internationally-recognized Americas Cardroom, which operates in a legal gray area by being based outside U.S. jurisdiction. These platforms process real-money games and offer the kind of liquidity that’s nearly impossible to match in state-run markets. This includes 24/7 access to massive tourneys, like their flagship Venom series, where prizes can exceed $10 million. Such reliance on trusted offshore sites is also the norm for most American online poker players, since only nine states currently legalize this sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the live scene presents its own brand of innovation. For example, <a href="https://dallasexpress.com/city/court-reinstates-dallas-poker-houses-permit/">poker rooms in Texas</a>, despite having some of the country’s strictest anti-gambling laws, have become hotspots thanks to a clever workaround. Instead of charging rake, poker rooms in cities like Dallas operate on membership fees, effectively creating private clubs. A recent court ruling upheld these arrangements, reinforcing the model and giving local poker a second wind.</p>



<p>This patchwork system of legality creates an ideal environment for content creation. Poker players are adapting fast, and streamers are even faster. Whether they’re beaming in from New York using an offshore platform or live-casting hands from a Dallas club, content creators have found ways to showcase the game without breaking the rules. Add VTubers into that mix, and you have a model that allows full creative freedom, even in restrictive jurisdictions.</p>



 Streaming Teams and the Rise of Poker Personalities 



<p>The content game in poker has matured dramatically in the last five years. What was once niche is now mainstream. And poker platforms know it.</p>



<p>For instance, Americas Cardroom launched its online team in 2024, including popular streamers. Originally <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/acr-poker-introduces-inaugural-acr-team-online-302213088.html">called ACR Team Online</a>, they now go by the Stormers, with members regularly sharing content on platforms like Twitch. This isn’t just a marketing push—it’s a recognition that the future of poker involves creators just as much as it involves players. These team members aren’t necessarily all crushers at the table. They’re storytellers, entertainers, and community builders. Their primary edge is connection.</p>



<p>In this world of brandable personalities, VTubers fit perfectly. The poker industry has long leaned into identity and style. Look at how Phil Hellmuth built a legacy on emotional outbursts, or how Daniel Negreanu used charisma and table talk to cultivate his fan base. VTubers take that same idea and push it into the future, allowing for characters that are larger-than-life, aesthetically unique, and made for modern internet consumption.</p>



<p>A fox-masked analyst who breaks down bluffs like a samurai? A gothic vampire who runs high-stakes satellites under the cover of darkness? With VTubing, there are no limits. The avatar becomes the brand, and in today’s competitive streaming ecosystem, standing out is the name of the game.</p>



 Why VTubers Make Sense for Poker 



<p>Let’s break it down.</p>



<p>1. Privacy with performance: Not every poker streamer wants to show their face, especially if they’re moonlighting, shy on camera, or just want to keep their real identity separate from their poker content. VTubers solve this beautifully. They can be expressive, animated, and memorable without ever going on camera.</p>



<p>2. Elevated engagement: The average poker stream is static—just a headshot and a screen share of cards. VTubers, by contrast, can react with motion, facial expressions, sound effects, and dynamic backgrounds. This keeps viewers more engaged during long sessions and slow hands. Dead air becomes prime entertainment real estate.</p>



<p>3. Cross-community appeal: VTubing originated in anime and gaming circles, but it’s growing fast across other verticals like education, commentary, and now, potentially poker. The online poker audience overlaps heavily with crypto, gaming, and fandoms that are already receptive to digital avatars. VTuber poker streamers wouldn’t be outsiders—they’d be pioneers.</p>



<p>4. Monetization beyond the table: Most poker streamers monetize via donations, affiliate codes, and maybe the occasional merch drop. VTubers, on the other hand, can monetize their characters directly through plushies, art, sound packs, stickers, and even meet-and-greets in virtual spaces. For poker content creators trying to grow beyond ad revenue, this opens a world of opportunities.</p>



<p>5. Narrative potential: Poker is filled with arcs—downswings, upswings, lucky runs, and soul-crushing bubbles. VTubers, with their highly customizable personas, can turn these moments into compelling content. Themed overlays, emotional reactions, fantasy backstories—they can build a poker universe that feels more like a show than a stream.</p>



<p>As explained in this <a href="https://unionavatars.com/vtuber-avatars-a-gateway-to-creative-expression/">article Vtuber Avatars: A Gateway to Creative Expression</a> about how these avatars can enhance content creativity and connection,&nbsp;VTubers are opening up new dimensions of identity and audience connection. If that’s true for gaming, there’s every reason to believe it applies to poker, too.</p>



 All-In on the Avatar Future? 



<p>The writing’s on the felt: poker is changing. And the next big chapter might be animated. VTubers bring a potent blend of creativity, anonymity, and audience magnetism to a game that thrives on expression and personality. They could lower the barrier for new streamers, provide fresh content styles, and attract new fans who might never have clicked on a traditional poker stream. Best of all, they add a layer of storytelling that can make every bluff, hero call, and bad beat feel like part of a larger narrative.</p>



<p>As iGaming continues to grow, expect poker platforms to embrace more experimental content and VTubers to step up to the table. Whether a full-time streamer launches an avatar to refresh their brand or a new player enters the scene fully digital from day one, the movement is already underway.</p>



<p>The avatar era isn’t just coming. It’s shuffling up and getting ready to deal.</p>

   Resilience is on my list of the top ten buzzwords of the year. Whether we’re looking at geopolitical turmoil, AI disruption, or yet another IdP outage, it’s clear that the infrastructure we’ve relied on for decades is straining under new (and not-so-new) pressures.

<p>“We’ve all heard the calls for more resilient digital identity systems.“</p>



<p>Heck, I covered that in the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/27/governance-decides-if-decentralization-works/">blog posts</a> I did a few weeks ago on centralization vs. decentralization. Resilience is on my list of the top ten buzzwords of the year. Whether we’re looking at geopolitical turmoil, AI disruption, or yet another IdP outage, it’s clear that the infrastructure we’ve relied on for decades is straining under new (and not-so-new) pressures.</p>



<p>The catch to this demand, however, is that resilience is expensive. And in standards development, it’s often treated like it’s free.</p>



<p>Identity professionals usually talk about resilience as a technical or operational problem, how to recover when something fails. In my early days as a sys admin, disaster recovery and business continuity were my jam, so I get it. But from a standards and governance perspective, I keep coming back to a different question:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of resilience are current standards actually enabling? And where are we still pretending flexibility comes without cost?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>oooooh, hard question!</p>

 Resilience is the wrong word if you can’t afford to change 



<p>Most modern identity standards build in some notion of flexibility. You’ll find language about “pluggable” trust frameworks, revocable credentials, and multi-source identity assertions. It all sounds great, on e-paper.</p>



<p>But in practice, very few implementers can afford to build and maintain all the branches that the standards suggest. Most systems implement the bare minimum required to pass a test suite (please tell me there is a test suite) or ship a product. The more complex the flexibility, the less likely it will be used or maintained.</p>



<p>This tension came up repeatedly in my recent blog series on centralization and decentralization. It’s not that one model is better than the other; it’s that resilience requires the ability to shift between these architectures. Shifting means you need a governance structure that can manage both states, not just technical plumbing that supports a theoretical toggle.</p>



<p>Governance is expensive, as is testing rarely used failover paths. Yet we talk about flexibility as if it’s a universal good. It’s not. It’s a luxury, and we need to be honest about that.</p>



 Most standards assume stable trust anchors 



<p>I want to be clear: assuming stability isn’t inherently bad. The Internet only works because we assume certain things, like DNS will resolve, certificates will validate, and revocation servers will be online. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">Turtles all the way down</a>,” as the saying goes. If you don’t trust anything at all, then you cannot actually use the Internet.</p>



<p>But most identity standards still assume that key pieces of the trust chain are always available and operating neutrally. Whether it’s SAML federation metadata, OpenID Connect trust frameworks, or verifiable credential issuers and resolvers, there’s usually no plan B.</p>



<p>When systems fail due to policy shifts, infrastructure outages, or organizational collapse, the standard itself rarely provides fallback guidance. At best, you’ll get some <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14">MAY</a> clauses. More often, it’s left to implementers to figure out what to do when their trust anchor disappears.</p>



<p>Some specs (notably in the decentralized identity world) are starting to grapple with this. But many others still reflect a stable-world mindset. That’s a mismatch for the world we’re actually living in.</p>



 Delegation, AI agents, and identity sharing are afterthoughts 



<p>What makes me sad is that we, the people working in tech, knew these problems were coming, and we kicked the can anyway.</p>



<p>Delegation has been a known issue in identity for years. We’ve seen efforts like User-Managed Access (UMA) define how to handle “on-behalf-of” scenarios, layered roles, and AI agent use cases. But they’ve remained niche, partly because the implementation complexity is real, and partly because the incentives haven’t been there.</p>



<p>Now we’re scrambling to retrofit standards that were never designed to handle autonomous agents, shared credentials, or multi-party authorization flows. And we’re trying to do it without breaking existing infrastructure that assumed a much simpler world.</p>



<p>If we want identity infrastructure that can survive the next decade, we have to stop treating delegation and agentic identity as edge cases. They’re central to how identity will work going forward, and they’re crucial to any conversation about long-term resilience.</p>



 There’s no such thing as neutral infrastructure 



<p>Let’s talk about government-issued credentials.</p>



<p>They’re often framed as the gold standard for trust, and for many high-assurance use cases (finance, travel, health), they are. But they’re also highly contextual. They encode the priorities, capabilities, and politics of the issuer. Not everyone trusts their government. Not every government trusts other governments. And, not every global corporation can figure out how to deal with all the government requirements, especially when governments contradict each other.</p>



<p>A system that assumes government credentials are always the best option risks becoming brittle. What happens when a user doesn’t have access to those credentials? Or when the trust in a government changes?</p>



 The DC API 



<p>This question is playing out in real time in the standards world. A <a href="https://github.com/w3c-fedid/digital-credentials/issues/246">recent discussion</a> about the <a href="https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credentials API</a> in the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a> points out that not all wallets are created equal, and neither are the governance models behind them.</p>



<p>A government-issued wallet may want to authorize verifiers through its own mechanism, asserting tight control over how its credentials are used. A browser acting as an intermediary might conflict with that, unless a protocol allows the wallet to enforce its preferences. But for other, non-government wallets, such as those used in enterprise, education, or social scenarios, the browser might be the only line of defense, especially where verification risk is low and wallet quality varies.</p>



<p>This is where the fiction of neutrality breaks down. When browsers or OS platforms decide how wallets should behave, who gets trusted, and what protocols are supported, they stop being passive conduits and start shaping the structure of the ecosystem. And that has consequences for which identity models can thrive. (To be fair, I’m not sure they have a choice, given how they are held liable for when things break down, but it’s still a matter of consequences.)</p>



<p>Resilience, then, isn’t just about supporting many wallets. It’s about enabling multiple trust frameworks to coexist, even when their needs are in tension.</p>



<p>That means standards shouldn’t default to one “gold standard” credential or wallet model. They should support a plurality of issuers, governance structures, and levels of assurance, because no single model is durable enough to anchor every identity system, everywhere, forever. No one is going to “win” the wallet wars.</p>



 If resilience is the goal, we need better defaults 



<p>We often measure the success of a standard by how widely it’s adopted. And that makes sense; if no one uses it, it doesn’t matter how flexible or forward-looking it is.</p>



<p>But in a world where trust assumptions are increasingly unstable, we also need to ask:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Can this standard still function when the environment shifts? Can it support multiple deployment models? Multiple trust anchors? Conflicting governance approaches?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Adoption is essential, but it’s not enough. Standards that can’t adapt get ripped out when the world changes, assuming we pay the technical debt. That might not happen in year one. But over time, brittle assumptions break, and infrastructure that once seemed “standard” adds to the debt that’s breaking our industry.</p>



<p>If resilience is the goal, we need better defaults:</p>



 
 Defaults that don’t assume the trust anchor is always online. 



 Defaults that let delegation and AI participation evolve without rewriting the spec. 



 Defaults that recognize different types of wallets, verifiers, and issuers will operate under different rules, but they still need to work together. 
 



<p>And maybe we also need more standards participants with risk assessment experience (please and thank you), so we can start designing for volatility from the beginning, not just retrofitting it later.</p>



 Wrapping up 



<p>I’m not arguing that we need to abandon federation or centralized identity, or that VCs are the answer to everything. I’m arguing that we need to stop building identity infrastructure that assumes everything will go right.</p>



<p>Resilience isn’t about architectural preference. It’s about designing for a world where the map keeps changing. If we want our standards to hold up under pressure, we need to stop pretending that flexibility is free and start deciding where we’re willing to invest.</p>



<p>Because trust might be turtles all the way down, but someone still has to check on the turtles.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>(00:00) Let’s talk about one of the most common words in tech media today: resilience.</p>



<p>(00:37) In 2025, it’s everywhere. But when it comes to digital identity systems, what does resilience actually mean—and perhaps more critically, who pays for it?</p>



<p>(00:51) Many assume resilience just means flexibility. But building flexible systems isn’t cheap. Flexibility costs money, and lots of it.</p>



 



 Flexibility on Paper vs. Resilience in Practice 



<p>(01:13) Most modern identity standards suggest adaptability. For example:</p>



 
 Pluggable trust frameworks 



 Support for multiple issuers 



 Credential revocation paths 



 Selective disclosure mechanisms 
 



<p>(01:41) These sound like flexible, future-ready systems. But in practice, most implementers don’t have the budget, time, or political will to build beyond what’s required today.</p>



<p>(02:10) When deadlines loom or audits approach, resilience features—fallback flows, delegation models—often get cut. They’re seen as luxuries, not priorities.</p>



<p>(02:27) The result? When a major provider goes offline, everyone scrambles to fix what should have been planned for.</p>



 



 Resilience Requires Planning for Change 



<p>(02:46) In earlier blog posts on centralization and decentralization, I made the case that resilience isn’t just about choosing one architecture. It’s about adapting between models as conditions shift.</p>



<p>(03:08) But those shifts require governance, testing, and long-term maintenance—and few standards talk about that part.</p>



 



 What Happens When Trust Anchors Fail? 



<p>(03:18) Most identity standards assume certain things are stable: DNS, certificate authorities, federation metadata, DID resolvers.</p>



<p>(03:45) And most of the time, that’s a fair assumption. But not always. Trust anchors wobble—frameworks get deprecated, registries go dark, support drops.</p>



<p>(03:56) What happens to the systems that depend on them?</p>



<p>(04:06) Often, nothing is specified. The standard assumes uptime, not failure. Resilience needs to plan for volatility, not just stability.</p>



 



 Real-World Examples of Fragility 



<p>(04:24) Consider some common standards:</p>



 
 OpenID Connect Federation: Trust chains fail if any node is unreachable 



 SAML: Metadata URLs are assumed always available 



 Verifiable Credentials: Depend on persistent, resolvable identifiers 
 



<p>(04:59) These aren’t bad standards. They’re doing critical work. But they often lack mechanisms for handling breakage—when, not if, it happens.</p>



 



 Delegation Is a Core Identity Requirement, Still Underserved 



<p>(05:06) Delegation is a cornerstone of identity. We’ve known this for years.</p>



<p>(05:11) Parents act for children. Executives delegate to assistants. Spouses share insurance logins. Healthcare proxies access private records.</p>



<p>(05:30) And now, we’re adding AI agents to the mix—bots booking appointments, filling forms, accessing systems.</p>



<p>(05:46) Most identity systems don’t handle this. There’s no consistent model for “on behalf of,” no standardized scoping, and no way to validate consent.</p>



<p>(06:06) UMA (User Managed Access) aimed to solve some of this. But it remains niche—important, yes, but far from mainstream.</p>



<p>(06:21) Now we’re stuck retrofitting delegation into systems that weren’t designed for multi-actor flows or digital intermediaries.</p>



 



 Wallet Diversity: Who Governs the Gate? 



<p>(06:45) One of the most timely conversations today is about wallet governance.</p>



<p>(06:55) In the W3C’s Federated Identity Working Group, Issue #246 asks: how should different wallets—government, enterprise, personal—be treated by browsers and platforms?</p>



<p>(07:16) Should a government wallet control its credential usage? Should browsers enforce a uniform model? It’s complicated.</p>



<p>(07:29) Government wallets have strong policies. Social wallets may offer more flexibility—but with lower assurance.</p>



<p>(07:43) So who decides?</p>



<p>(07:49) When browsers mediate everything, they start shaping governance—intentionally or not. That creates platform lock-in and infrastructure fragility.</p>



<p>(08:01) If your wallet only works on Platform A, but not Platform B, we’re undermining interoperability—and resilience.</p>



 



 Supporting Governance Pluralism 



<p>(08:18) True resilience means supporting pluralism—multiple governance models, even conflicting ones.</p>



<p>(08:28) Standards can’t just hope it all works out. They need to explicitly support this diversity, or risk failure as soon as conditions shift.</p>



 



 Measuring Adoption vs. Measuring Adaptability 



<p>(08:37) In most standards work, success is measured by adoption.</p>



<p>(09:12) But adoption isn’t the same as resilience. A brittle standard can be widely used—and still collapse when a key component fails or use cases evolve.</p>



<p>(09:20) Conversely, a highly adaptable standard that sees no uptake contributes nothing.</p>



<p>(09:28) We need to measure both adoption and adaptability if we want identity systems that can survive real-world conditions.</p>



 



 Toward Risk-Aware Standards 



<p>(09:43) So how do we move forward?</p>



<p>(09:46) One answer: bring more people into standards work who understand risk. Not just technical threats, but governance risk, market volatility, and long-term trust dynamics.</p>



<p>(10:04) Resilient standards aren’t paranoid—they’re durable.</p>



 



 The Real Cost of Resilience 



<p>(10:18) Digital identity resilience requires:</p>



 
 Flexibility, but not as an afterthought 



 Fallback paths and pluralist design, not idealized assumptions 



 A willingness to acknowledge the cost of preparation—and invest in it 



 A design approach that accepts the world won’t always cooperate 
 



<p>(10:28) We don’t have to throw out everything we’ve built. But we do have to ask what breaks when things shift—and what we’re willing to invest to prevent that.</p>

			 Real Estate Tokenization Takes Off in Dubai 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Dubai’s real estate market is breaking records.</p>
<p>According to data shared by Property Finder, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dubai-real-estate-sales-tokenization-boom-may-2025?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--fzXbKNxCOHLOkWjOmXDCEVaSvnXQJAYXIyz8uGR59YgJSWLnuTm9-H-itkhyYeMvs9bRq">Dubai recorded AED 66.8 billion (~$18.2 billion)</a> in real estate sales across 18,700 transactions in May 2025. That’s a 44% year-on-year surge, driven by both local and international investor demand.</p>

		 
	 
     Source: Cointelegraph     
	 
		 
			<p>Yet for global asset managers, accessing this market remains complex.</p>
 The barriers global asset managers still face 
<p>While Dubai’s real estate market is booming, it remains difficult for global asset managers to access directly.</p>
 
 Legal complexity. Buying real estate in Dubai often requires setting up a local entity or relying on nominee arrangements. These structures are time-consuming, costly, and raise concerns about transparency and control. 
 Operational inefficiencies. Servicing investors, tracking ownership, handling subscriptions and redemptions, distributing yields, and maintaining compliance, is still highly manual in most setups. This creates friction, especially for cross-border investors onboarding and ongoing fund administration. 
 Limited exit options. Even when fractional shares are available, liquidity is often locked. Without proper secondary market infrastructure, redemption or transfer opportunities are rare, making the asset less attractive for both managers and investors. 
 
 How tokenization is changing the game 
<p>These barriers are now being removed.</p>
<p>Through tokenization and a local, reputational licensed fund administrator like Apex Group, asset managers can offer Dubai real estate exposure in a fully regulated and digital-native format.</p>
<p>Our solutions, which have now been integrated into the Apex Group’s services, allow asset managers to experience a one-stop shop experience and use the permissioned token standard&nbsp;ERC-3643 to enforce investor eligibility, transfer rules, and compliance logic right into their tokens.</p>
 Unlock what wasn’t possible before 
 
 &nbsp;Multi-platform distribution: List real estate tokens across multiple compliant distribution platforms 
 Improved liquidity: Enable peer-to-peer secondary market transfers under control 
 24/7 Access: Offer 24/7 subscription and redemption for open-ended real estate funds 
 Real-time tracking: Track all activity in real time for full auditability 
 
<p>For asset managers, this means faster launches, broader investor reach, and the ability to offer modern real estate products that meet today’s expectations for accessibility and liquidity.</p>
 Market demands are real 
<p>On May 1, MultiBank Group, MAG, and Mavryk announced a $3 billion deal to tokenize MAG’s luxury real estate to democratize access to high-end real estate and enable global investors to participate with full legal certainty. Then, on June 11, Dubai saw its second tokenized apartment sell out in 1 minute and 58 seconds, with 149 investors from 35 countries and over 10,700 waitlisted.</p>
<p>Tokenized real estate has found its product-market fit.</p>
 Why it’s working now: Clear rules from VARA 
<p>On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its Rulebook to formally regulate tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) under the new Asset-Referenced Virtual Assets (ARVA) classification.</p>
<p>The regulatory clarity is in place. The infrastructure is proven. The demand is there. The future? Real estate tokens will increasingly plug into broader digital finance ecosystems, including lending, automated market making, and 24/7 liquidity via compliant DeFi.</p>
<p>Dubai is showing the way, and we’re ready to help you lead.</p>

 The Threat is Real and It’s Here Now 
<p>On Friday, June 28, 2025, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fbicyber_alertthe-fbi-has-recently-observed-the-cybercriminal-activity-7344513662025428992--jMe">the FBI issued an urgent cybersecurity alert</a>: the notorious Scattered Spider hacking collective has expanded its targeting to include the airline industry. This isn’t a theoretical future threat, it’s happening right now. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/28/business/cyberattacks-airlines-fbi-criminal-group">Hawaiian Airlines confirmed a cyberattack on Thursday</a>, and Canada’s WestJet has been dealing with an ongoing breach since June 13. Both incidents bear the hallmarks of Scattered Spider operations.</p>
<p>For airline executives reading about yet another cybersecurity threat, this one demands immediate attention. Scattered Spider isn’t your typical cybercriminal group. They weaponize something every organization has in unlimited supply: helpful employees and IT systems that assume someone calling with the right story must be legitimate. While security teams spend millions hardening networks and patching systems, these attackers simply pick up the phone and ask nicely for the keys to the kingdom—and they get them.</p>
 Understanding the Enemy: Why Scattered Spider is Different 
<p>Scattered Spider (also known as UNC3944, Octo Tempest, and several other aliases) represents a new breed of cybercriminal. This loosely organized collective of primarily English-speaking hackers has perfected the art of social engineering at enterprise scale.</p>
<p>Their recent victims <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_Spider">read like a Fortune 500 directory</a>: MGM Resorts, Caesars Entertainment, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-the-marks-spencer-breach-tells-us-about-the-next-era-of-identity-attacks/">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, Twilio, and now multiple airlines. What makes them particularly dangerous is their systematic approach to identity-based attacks:</p>
<p>Social Engineering Excellence: They research their targets extensively, often impersonating specific employees or contractors when calling IT help desks. They know company terminology, recent projects, and organizational structure well enough to convince even experienced support staff that they’re legitimate employees.</p>
<p>MFA Bypass Mastery: While many organizations believe multi-factor authentication protects them, Scattered Spider <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-320a">has developed multiple techniques</a> to circumvent these controls:</p>
 
 MFA fatigue attacks that bombard users with push notifications until they accept one 
 Convincing help desk staff to add attacker-controlled MFA devices to legitimate accounts 
 SIM swapping to intercept SMS-based authentication codes 
 Phone-based social engineering to extract one-time passcodes directly from users 
 
<p>Legitimate Tool Abuse: After gaining initial access, they use approved remote access tools and live-off-the-land techniques, making their activities difficult to distinguish from legitimate IT operations.</p>
 Why Airlines Are Perfect Targets 
<p>The aviation industry presents an irresistible combination of vulnerabilities that make it ideal for Scattered Spider attacks:</p>
<p>Call Center Dependencies: Scattered Spider specifically targets airline call centers, exploiting the high-volume, time-pressured environment where help desk staff process hundreds of authentication requests daily.</p>
<p>Complex Identity Management: Distributed teams across multiple time zones and locations create numerous potential entry points and make identity verification challenging across all touchpoints.</p>
<p>High-Stakes Environment: Thin operational margins and zero tolerance for downtime create pressure to restore access quickly—exactly the environment where security shortcuts occur during incident response.</p>
<p>High-Value Data: Extensive PII, travel patterns, cargo manifests, and operational data provide valuable monetization opportunities for attackers.</p>
 The FBI’s Warning: Attack Vectors Airlines Must Address 
<p>The recent FBI alert specifically highlights the tactics Scattered Spider uses against aviation targets:</p>
<p>Help Desk Infiltration: Attackers call IT support claiming to be employees who’ve lost access to their accounts. They use publicly available information about the company and specific employees to build credibility.</p>
<p>Third-Party Vendor Targeting: The FBI warns that “anyone in the airline ecosystem, including trusted vendors and contractors, could be at risk.” Scattered Spider often attacks less-defended suppliers to gain access to primary targets.</p>
<p>MFA Device Registration Abuse: Once they convince help desk staff of their legitimacy, attackers request that new MFA devices be added to accounts they claim to own.</p>
 An Identity-First Defense Strategy 
<p>Traditional cybersecurity approaches fail against Scattered Spider because they focus on protecting systems rather than verifying identities. When attackers can convince legitimate users or help desk staff to grant access, perimeter defenses become irrelevant.</p>
<p>The most effective defense requires securing the identity layer itself. Here’s how identity-first security addresses each of the attack vectors the FBI warns about:</p>
 Verifiable Identity Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: Scattered Spider succeeds because authentication systems verify what users know (passwords) or have (phones, tokens) rather than who they are.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity platforms that require users to prove their actual identity through biometric verification tied to government-issued identification. When someone calls the help desk claiming to be an employee, the system can definitively verify whether the caller is actually that person.</p>
 Phishing-Resistant, Passwordless Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: Traditional MFA can be bypassed through push notification fatigue, SIM swapping, or social engineering.</p>
<p>The Defense: Eliminating passwords entirely and using FIDO2-compliant biometric authentication that cannot be phished, fatigue-attacked, or socially engineered. There are no push notifications to accidentally accept and no codes to read over the phone.</p>
 Identity-Bound Access Controls 
<p>The Challenge: Current systems often grant access based on device compliance or network location, which can be spoofed or compromised.</p>
<p>The Defense: Tie every access request to a verified biometric identity. Even if attackers gain access to approved devices or networks, they cannot authenticate without the legitimate user’s biometric signature.</p>
 Centralized Identity Governance 
<p>The Challenge: Organizations lose visibility into identity-related activities across multiple systems and lack consistent identity policies.</p>
<p>The Defense: Centralized visibility into all identity-based access events with detailed audit trails and risk scoring. Security teams can immediately identify unusual authentication patterns or unauthorized access attempts.</p>
 Real-World Implementation Scenarios 
<p>For airline security teams wondering how this translates into practical protection, consider these scenarios:</p>
<p>Scenario 1: Help Desk Social Engineering A Scattered Spider attacker calls the IT help desk claiming to be a pilot who’s lost access to crew scheduling while on layover. The caller knows recent route changes, mentions specific flights, and provides the pilot’s employee ID. With traditional systems, overwhelmed help desk staff often approve password resets and MFA device additions during off-hours when supervisors aren’t available, especially when the caller sounds stressed about missing a flight assignment.</p>
<p>With identity-first security: Any account changes require biometric verification that cannot be provided remotely by an impersonator, regardless of how convincing their story.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: Contractor Account Compromise Attackers target a ground services contractor to gain access to airline systems through the supplier relationship. Traditional vendor management often relies on basic password policies and standard MFA across multiple client systems.</p>
<p>With identity-first security: All contractor access requires the same level of identity verification as employee access. Even if contractors’ traditional credentials are compromised, attackers cannot authenticate without their verified biometric identity.</p>
<p>Scenario 3: After-Hours Emergency Access An attacker claims to be a maintenance supervisor who needs urgent access to aircraft diagnostic systems for a grounded plane. They call during the night shift when fewer security personnel are available and pressure help desk staff with operational urgency.</p>
<p>With identity-first security: Emergency access protocols still require biometric verification, preventing attackers from exploiting time pressure and reduced oversight during off-peak hours.</p>
 Implementation Considerations for Airlines 
<p>Regulatory Compliance: Airlines operate in highly regulated environments requiring <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">certifications</a> like FedRAMP High Authorization, NIST 800-63-3, ISO 27001, SOC II Type 2, and ISO/IEC 30107-1 and 30107-3. Identity platforms meeting these standards demonstrate they can handle the stringent regulatory requirements airlines face across multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Operational Continuity: Identity-based attacks can ground flights and disrupt operations for days or weeks. The MGM attack cost that organization $100 million in operational disruption. Preventing such incidents protects both revenue and reputation.</p>
<p>Customer Trust: High-profile breaches erode passenger confidence. Airlines that can demonstrate advanced security measures for protecting personal data gain competitive advantage in an increasingly security-conscious market.</p>
<p>Security Architecture: Centralizing identity verification can streamline overall security architecture while improving protection levels, reducing the complexity of managing multiple authentication systems across diverse airline operations.</p>
 The Time to Act is Now 
<p>Scattered Spider’s expansion to airlines isn’t a future threat, it’s happening right now. With the FBI issuing urgent warnings and multiple carriers breached in the last month, every organization in the aviation ecosystem faces immediate risk.</p>
<p>Rather than detecting attacks after they’ve begun, identity-first security prevents them from succeeding in the first place by securing the identity layer that Scattered Spider targets. The question isn’t whether your organization will face an identity-based attack—it’s whether you’ll be ready when it comes.</p>

 So, you’ve decided to integrate digital signatures into your tech stack, but don’t know where to start. Here we help you understand the difference between an SES, AES and QES, and the importance of a QTSP. 



 



<p>There are many reasons why forward-thinking organizations are choosing to integrate digital signature solutions into their tech stack, but perhaps the most obvious is that digital signatures just work – incredibly well, for businesses and users, across most industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, usage is <a href="https://forms.app/en/blog/25-eye-opening-e-signature-statistics-for-2025">increasing by the day</a> and will almost certainly continue to climb as per the collective driving forces – and adoption pushes – from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more information on the business and customer benefits of digital signatures in your industry, read <a href="https://www.idnow.io/?p=345006&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=345067">‘Here’s why 95% of businesses are using digital signatures to optimize operations?’</a></p>



 Not all signatures are created equally. 



<p>Although the purpose of a digital signature is relatively straightforward (linking a signer to a document), there are different types with different levels of security and legal assurance. Businesses tend to offer one of either Simple Electronic Signatures (SES), Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) or Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) depending on the particular use case required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But which solution is right for you and your customers? Here we explain everything you need to know about making the most out of digital signatures in 2025.</p>



 Digital certificates vs digital signatures. What’s the difference? 



<p>The relationship between a digital certificate and a digital signature is fundamental to how trust and authenticity are established in digital transactions. According to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS</a>, a digital signature is defined as “data in electronic form that is attached or logically associated with other data in electronic form, and which is used by the signatory to sign.” A digital signature performs three core functions:</p>



  Authenticity: Confirming the identity of the signer.&nbsp;  



  Integrity: Ensuring the document has not been changed after signing.&nbsp;  



  Non-repudiation: Preventing the signer from denying they have signed the document.  



<p>A digital certificate is an electronic document that links a person’s or entity’s identity with a cryptographic key pair made up of a public key and a private key.&nbsp;It is issued by a trusted entity, such as a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-trust-services/">Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP).</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>When someone signs a document digitally, they use their private key to create the signature, and the recipient uses the sender’s public key to verify it. As only the signer has access to their private key, it is almost impossible for someone else to forge the signature or for the signer to claim they did not sign.&nbsp;The digital certificate provides the assurance that the public key belongs to the sender.</p>



 
   
     
                     Expert guide to digital signatures. 
                     As the world shifts from physical to online, digital signatures will be essential in ensuring trust and authenticity in transactions. Check out this handy guide to discover the history of signatures and how digital signatures can be used to unlock valuable business opportunities.

 Navigating the different types of digital signatures. 



<p>IDnow offers a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">comprehensive suite of digital signature solutions</a> to satisfy whatever the regulatory requirement or industry use case. Our solutions adhere to security and encryption standards, including Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to a) ensure the signer’s identity and b) enable trust in the signature. They also leverage hashing algorithms to prevent the signed document from being altered without detection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lower levels of digital signature solutions (SES) are easier and faster to use, while higher levels (AES + QES) involve more steps but provide stronger guarantees.</p>



 Simple Electronic Signature (SES). 



<p>IDnow’s SES solution is the simplest and quickest form of digital signature we offer. It can be represented by a textual name at the end of an e-mail, a scanned signature, a ticked checkbox, or a click on an “I agree” button. Although legally valid, SES solutions cannot track document changes, or verify the identity of signers, only the ownership and authorization of the sending domain or email address. As such, this signature is best suited for no- to low-risk transactions or informal agreements such as terms &amp; conditions or internal protocols.</p>



 Advanced Electronic Signature (AES). 



<p>IDnow’s AES solution provides a higher level of security and authentication than SES. As AES links the signature to both the signer and the data in a way that alterations are detectable, it is suitable for medium to high liability risk transactions that require strong identity verification without the full regulatory weight of QES, such as permanent employment contracts, insurance applications, NDAs, powers of attorney, or privacy statements.</p>



 Qualified Electronic Signature (QES). 



<p>IDnow’s QES represents the highest security standard and is the legal equivalent of a handwritten signature across the EU under eIDAS regulation. Created using a qualified digital certificate from a Qualified Trust Service Provider, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/idnow-trust-services-ab-europes-newest-qtsp/">IDnow Trust Services AB</a>, a QES provides maximum legal certainty for high-stake transactions. It is non-repudiable and equivalent to a handwritten signature on paper. QES is commonly used where the law specifically requires the highest level of assurance, such as life insurance or government contracts.</p>

 5 considerations to help you select the right digital signature solution. 



  Regulatory requirements? What level of signature does your industry regulation require for your specific transaction type?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  What is the transaction value? Higher-value transactions generally warrant stronger signature types (AES or QES).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Risk profile? Consider the potential for fraud or dispute in the specific transaction context. While QES comes with an inherent scheme of storing proofs of a transaction, AES and SES require companies to record an audit trail of their own.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  User experience priorities? What experience do your customers expect? Speed, security or a balance of the two?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Budgets and deadlines? Although neither is likely to be the deciding factor as to why organizations would choose one solution over the other, SES and AES can typically be implemented quicker than QES solutions, while SES are considerably cheaper to implement.

<p>Have you ever thought about how digital systems know you’re a real person and not just a photo or deepfake? In a world where passwords are getting replaced by faces, ensuring the “liveness” of that face has become mission-critical.</p>
<p>Enter the face liveness detection SDK, the invisible gatekeeper protecting online platforms from identity spoofing and fraud.</p>
<p>Whether you’re in banking, e-commerce, healthcare, or edtech, real-time identity verification is essential. And that’s exactly where Recognito steps in with its cutting-edge facial liveness detection solutions.</p>
<p>Let’s uncover what this technology is, how it works, and why your business should care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Face Liveness Detection SDK? 
<p>A <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a> is a software development kit that lets developers embed anti-spoofing features into their apps, platforms, or websites. Powered by AI and computer vision, it analyzes facial cues to confirm if the person is physically present, eliminating the risk of spoofing with photos, videos, or deepfakes.</p>
<p>This SDK works alongside or as a part of a facial recognition SDK to strengthen biometric authentication by confirming liveness during identity checks.</p>
<p>Key technologies it uses:</p>
 
 AI-based face movement tracking 
 Skin texture and blood flow analysis 
 Micro-expression detection 
 Real-time motion monitoring 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Face Liveness Detection Work? 
<p>Let’s break down the process step by step, no jargon, just clarity. </p>
 Step 1: Face Capture 
<p>The system uses a front camera to capture live visuals of the user in real time.</p>
 Step 2: AI Feature Analysis 
<p>It examines fine details like skin patterns, facial depth, light behavior, and subtle movements to verify authenticity</p>
 Step 3: Liveness Detection 
<p>The face liveness detection SDK determines if the subject is real or spoofed using advanced algorithms.</p>
 Step 4: Decision Output 
<p>Based on the detection score, the SDK either approves or denies identity verification,&nbsp; all within seconds.</p>
<p></p>
 Types of Liveness Detection 
<p>Advanced SDKs like Recognito’s include two main forms of liveness detection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Passive Liveness Detection 
 
 No user interaction needed. 
 Identifies minute indicators of liveliness, such as skin texture and natural movement. 
 Completely seamless and invisible to the user. 
 Ideal for frictionless onboarding. 
 
  Active Liveness Detection 
 
 Prompts the user to perform an action (blink, turn head, smile). 
 Helps detect presentation attacks. 
 Great for high-security scenarios like digital banking and eKYC. 
 
<p>Recognito offers both passive and active liveness checks, providing enhanced security and adaptable integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Use a Face Liveness Detection SDK in 2025? 
<p>The stakes are high,&nbsp; identity fraud is getting smarter. Your defenses should be smarter too.</p>
 1.  Prevent Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Prevents attackers from tricking the system using images, recordings, or 3D replicas.</p>
 2.  Real-Time ID Verification 
<p>Get instant confirmation of user identity, no manual checks required.</p>
 3.  Seamless Integration 
<p>Our SDK supports Android, iOS, and web with robust APIs and developer documentation.</p>

<p>A Scattered Spider attack exploited systemic service desk flaws and weak privileged access controls. Here’s how to shut the door for good.</p>
<p>When news broke that Marks &amp; Spencer was compromised in a ransomware campaign tied to Scattered Spider, many assumed it was a case of internal failure. But the truth is more complex, and more concerning for retail CISOs everywhere.</p>
<p>M&amp;S, like many retailers, relied on a third-party IT provider to manage service desk operations. According to multiple forensic reports, Scattered Spider deliberately targeted this provider due to systemic weaknesses in their service desk processes, then leveraged privileged access to pivot into client environments — including M&amp;S.</p>
<p>In short: the attackers didn’t hack the retailer. They walked through a door left open by the service provider.</p>
<p>The breach went undetected for months after the initial February compromise, culminating in DragonForce ransomware encrypting VMware ESXi hosts on April 24th. The aftermath has been devastating: more than $400 million in lost profit and more than $1 billion wiped from M&amp;S’s stock market value.</p>
 The Supply Chain Identity Problem Is Getting Worse 
<p>This isn’t an isolated incident. By early May, luxury department store Harrods and fashion retailer Dior had been targeted in cyberattacks, while Danish food giant Arla Foods was hit mid-May. The M&amp;S, Co-op, and Harrods attacks have been linked to similar tactics, suggesting a coordinated campaign against UK retailers.</p>
<p>What makes these attacks so dangerous isn’t sophisticated malware or zero-day exploits. It’s the abuse of legitimate access and trust relationships. Scattered Spider is believed to be a decentralized network composed largely of native English-speaking young people who coordinate in real-time over Discord, Telegram, and underground forums, using social engineering rather than technical hacking.</p>
<p>The M&amp;S breach follows a predictable pattern: compromise a service provider with weak identity controls, inherit their privileged access to client environments, then move laterally to deploy ransomware. What’s particularly troubling is how the attackers used SIM swapping to bypass traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA), then tricked IT help desks to gain deeper access.</p>
<p>Once inside, they exploited M&amp;S’s Microsoft Active Directory to gain broad system access — a classic case of authentication bypass leading to total compromise.</p>
 Why This Matters for Retail CISOs 
<p>Retail environments are sprawling, fast-moving, and heavily reliant on third-party IT providers. Unlike organizations in financial services or healthcare, retailers often lack the security hardening that comes with heavy regulation.</p>
<p>This breach is a textbook case of supply chain identity compromise — where attackers bypass perimeter defenses by exploiting trust and privilege in the authentication chain. Traditional MFA, VPNs, and endpoint security can’t stop an attacker who already has legitimate vendor access.</p>
<p>The financial impact extends far beyond immediate losses. According to a recent survey, more than <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/100466-more-than-60-of-consumers-would-avoid-a-retailer-post-breach">60% of consumers</a> would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident, while IBM estimates the average cost of a data breach is now <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-07-30-ibm-report-escalating-data-breach-disruption-pushes-costs-to-new-highs">$4.88 million per incident.</a></p>
 How Modern Identity-Based Authentication Stops These Attacks 
<p>As the M&amp;S breach demonstrates, authentication built around credentials, devices, or even basic biometrics isn’t enough. Attackers can steal credentials, compromise devices, and even register fraudulent biometrics if they have administrative access.</p>
<p>The solution requires identity-based authentication that verifies the human behind every login, not just what they possess or know. Here’s how 1Kosmos addresses the three critical vulnerabilities exposed in the M&amp;S breach:</p>
<p>1. Identity-First Authentication — Not Just Credentials</p>
<p>Traditional MFA relies on “something you know, something you have, something you are.” But Scattered Spider has proven they can compromise all three. Anyone with administrative access or successful SIM swap can register things like user biometrics to any device—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures altogether.</p>
<p>1Kosmos takes a different approach. Our platform uses machine-verified identity proofing tied to government-issued credentials, combined with live biometric verification that detects presentation attacks including deepfakes. The private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device serves as the possession factor, while a live facial scan provides the inherence element — with 99.9% accuracy in confirming the authorized user’s identity.</p>
<p>2. Verified Privileged Access Controls</p>
<p>In the M&amp;S breach, TCS allegedly handed over privileged access without proper verification processes. With 1Kosmos, privileged access cannot be granted without a re-authenticated, identity-verified session, regardless of the requesting party’s VPN connection or claimed authority.</p>
<p>Our solution integrates with existing privileged access management systems to ensure every high-risk action requires fresh identity verification — not just inherited trust from a service provider.</p>
<p>3. Zero Trust Extended to Vendors</p>
<p>The traditional model of trusting third-party service desks is fundamentally broken. 1Kosmos enforces continuous identity assurance and step-up authentication based on risk, device, location, and behavior — even for trusted service providers.</p>
<p>This approach would have prevented the M&amp;S breach by requiring fresh identity verification for any privileged actions, regardless of TCS’s existing access agreements.</p>
 The Bottom Line: Retailers Can’t Afford to Outsource Trust 
<p>The M&amp;S breach isn’t just a cautionary tale — it’s a preview of what’s coming for every retailer that hasn’t modernized their identity infrastructure. Google was warning there are signs Scattered Spider may be moving on from UK retailers and pivoting to direct cyber-attacks against retail sector targets in the US.</p>
<p>As these attacks demonstrate, your security is only as strong as your weakest vendor’s identity controls. Traditional authentication methods that rely on credentials, devices, or basic biometrics simply can’t defend against social engineering attacks that compromise the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides the only NIST, FIDO2, and FedRAMP High certified platform that combines indisputable digital identity proofing with advanced biometrics and passwordless authentication. Our solution ensures that every access request, whether from employees, contractors, or vendors, is verified against a live human identity, not just inherited trust relationships.</p>
<p>The next supply chain attack is already being planned, and they’re counting on inherited trust to get them in.</p>

<p>Social media is cool for connecting and sharing content, but it’s a high-risk place for being tracked and scammed.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers">FTC</a> calls social media “a golden goose for scammers”, and rails against the platforms’ collection and monetization of users’ personal data which “endanger people’s privacy, threaten their freedoms, and expose them to a host of harms, from identity theft to stalking.” </p>



<p>Social Media Day this June 30 is a good time to rethink how you manage your social media safety and privacy—and let <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a> keep you safe on social media even if there’s a data breach.</p>



 What are the privacy and safety risks on social media? 



<p>Social media presents two massive safety risks: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/#:~:text=A%20data%20breach%20is%20a,without%20permission%20or%20is%20lost.">data breaches</a> from malicious actors, and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers">data surveillance</a> from the platforms themselves. From both, you face significant harm to your personal safety, money, and reputation.</p>



 Data breaches of social media platforms 



<p>Data breaches happen when data troves like those kept by the social media giants are actively stolen and used maliciously for crimes such as identity theft, credit card fraud, phishing schemes, and other unauthorized access to accounts. This is in addition to the social media scams that are already rife: Globally, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">30.5%</a> of all <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_au/what-is/phishing/social-media-phishing.html">phishing attacks</a> were via social media in 2024, and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers">one-quarter</a> of all people who reported losing money to fraud since 2021 said it started on social media.</p>



<p>In the first half of 2024, the number of data breach victims surpassed <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">1 billion—a 490 per cent increase</a> from the same time in 2023.</p>



<p>Some of the largest data breaches of all time have been via social media and exposed billions of user records, including:</p>



 
 The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/23/massive-26-billion-record-leak-dropbox-linkedin-twitterx-all-named/">“mother of all data breaches”</a>—the 2024 discovery of a 12-terabyte database containing 26 billion leaked data records from users of Chinese messaging giant Tencent; social media platform Weibo; platforms and services such as Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram; and various U.S. and other government organizations<br> 



 The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html">2013–2106 breaches of Yahoo</a> which exposed highly sensitive personal information from over 3 billion user accounts and still holds the record for the most people affected by breach of a social media platform<br> 



 The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/986005820/after-data-breach-exposes-530-million-facebook-says-it-will-not-notify-users">April 2021 discovery of an earlier attack on Facebook</a> which was one of its largest (Facebook has had data breaches since 2012), which leaked the names, phone numbers, account names, and passwords of over 530 million people<br> 



 The high-profile<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election"> Facebook/Cambridge Analytica attack</a>, which saw British consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica,&nbsp;harvest and sell data&nbsp;from 50–90 million user accounts on Facebook<br> 



 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2021/06/29/details-on-700-million-linkedin-users-for-sale-on-notorious-hacking-forum/">LinkedIn’s April 2021 breach</a> of about 700 million users’ identities or around 93% of the total user base at the time<br> 



 The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-selling-data-of-538-million-weibo-users/">March 2020 data breach</a> of one of China’s largest social media platforms, Sina Weibo, in which 538 million user account details were stolen and sold on the dark web<br> 



 The data breach of early social media platform <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/internet-security/myspace-accounts-hacked/">MySpace</a>, with 360 million compromised accounts.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 Data surveillance on social media 



<p>But data breaches are only part of the social media risk story. In 2024 the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance">FTC</a> found that all the major social media and video streaming companies “harvest an enormous amount of Americans’ personal data and monetize it to the tune of billions of dollars a year.” This isn’t news, but it’s another credible confirmation of the global <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/#:~:text=High%20profile%2C%20significant%2C%20and%20regular,do%20so%20if%20they%20can.">data privacy crisis</a>.</p>

<p>The FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance">found</a>:</p>



 
 Companies collect and indefinitely keep <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">troves of data</a>, including information from <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>, and about both users and non-users of their platforms.<br> 



 Many companies share the data, which raises “serious concerns regarding the adequacy of the companies’ data handling controls and oversight”.<br> 



 Some companies “deployed privacy-invasive tracking technologies, such as pixels” to serve ads to users based on preferences and interests.<br> 



 Users and non-users had little or no way to opt out of how their data was used by these automated systems.<br> 



 Companies that “amass significant amounts of user data may be able to achieve market dominance, which may lead to harmful practices with companies prioritizing acquiring data at the expense of user privacy.”&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>But it’s not only social media platforms tracking and selling our data or “<a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>”: <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">many companies</a> engage in <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism/">surveillance capitalism</a>, even <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/your-bank-is-selling-your-personal-data/">banks</a>. What’s more, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> grease the wheels of this <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a> by harvesting, manipulating and even misrepresenting consumer data and sell it to brands to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">hyper-personalize ads</a> and content.</p>



<p>Of course, these massive data stores are rife with privacy invasions and safety risks including unintentional data exposure, third-party access and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/datamining.asp">data mining</a>, identity theft and social engineering scams, and data breaches, as we’ve covered.Statistics show <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">most people in the world</a> have now had their personal data stolen and it’s getting worse.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/6-common-social-media-privacy-issues">deep dive</a> from TechTarget on all the personal information that social media platforms and third-party apps collect about you and what they can do with it, plus how criminals can easily access all that information, is well worth a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/6-common-social-media-privacy-issues">read</a>. To stop yourself from falling victim to scams and to limit data surveillance of your life via social media, you really need a way to avoid giving your personal information to the platforms in the first place—and that’s where <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> can help.</p>



 Use MySudo to lock down your privacy and safety on social media 



<p>You can use MySudo all-in-one privacy app for social media in two ways:</p>



 
 Create an alternative digital identity called a Sudo just for your social media.<br> 



 Update your existing social media accounts with your Sudo credentials instead of your personal information.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 Create an alternative digital identity just for your social media 



<p>MySudo is built around <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, secure and customizable digital identities or “personas”, which come with their own alternative contact details like <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone</a>, and secure communications capabilities like <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/did-you-know-mysudo-has-loads-of-advanced-messaging-features/">end-to-end encrypted messaging</a> and calling, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual payment cards</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browsing</a>.</p>



<p>With MySudo, you can create a unique Sudo email address and phone number solely for signing up to and logging in to your social media accounts and never have to expose your personal email and phone number to the platforms.</p>



<p>You could even go one step further and create a separate Sudo digital identity for your work social media accounts and another Sudo for your personal social media accounts, separating the two for privacy and perhaps professional reputation purposes—whatever suits your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">real-life privacy needs</a>.</p>



<p>When you do this you harness the power of <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy-2/">compartmentalization</a>, a military-style data protection strategy which <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">MySudo makes easy</a>. Platforms will still track you and criminals will still try to scam you, but they’ll only have access to your Sudo information, not your personal information which you probably use for your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">banking and medical information</a>, for example, and definitely don’t want to risk with your doom scrolling. &nbsp;</p>



 Update your existing social media accounts with your Sudo credentials instead of your personal information 



<p>MySudo is a great <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">second chance at digital privacy</a>. Once you have created a dedicated social media Sudo, you could go in and switch out your personal email and phone number for the new Sudo login details. Remember, if your socials are breached, your personal life is safe. The scammers can’t steal your personal information or invade your personal life, and the platforms can’t link your personal email and phone number to your other online activity to build and monetize your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">social graph</a>.</p>



 Get started with MySudo for social media 



<p>If you’re ready to put MySudo to work for your social media safety (and for your other online and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/6-ways-to-do-life-without-using-your-personal-details/">real-life activity</a>), start by <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">downloading MySudo for iOS or Android</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-desktop/">MySudo desktop</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-browser-extension/">browser extension</a> for convenience, and then create a dedicated “social media Sudo”. Your Sudo will come with:</p>



 
 1 email address – for social media sign-ups and logins, end-to-end encrypted emails between app users, and standard email with everyone else<br> 



 1 phone number (optional)* – for social media sign-ups and logins, end-to-end encrypted messaging and video, voice and group calls between app users, and standard connections with everyone else; customizable and mutable<br> 



 1 handle – for end-to-end encrypted messages and video, voice and group calls between app users<br> 



 1 private browser – for using social media without ads and tracking<br> 



 1 virtual card (optional)* – for protecting your personal information and your money when you pay online; like a proxy for your credit or debit card or bank account.<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Once your have your social media Sudo, you can:</p>



 
 Use the Sudo email to sign up and log in to social media platforms. Almost every social media platform requires at least an email address to set up an account and log in. By using your Sudo email instead of your personal one, the platform – and scammers – don’t have your personal email; they only have your social media Sudo email.<br> 



 Use the Sudo phone number for verification.Most platforms require a phone number for two-factor authentication and account recovery. By using your Sudo phone number instead of your personal one, the platforms and scammers don’t have your personal phone number, only your Sudo phone number. They can only scam your Sudo phone number and because you know it’s your Sudo number and not your personal one, you limit any damage to only that Sudo.<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>If you want to go further, you might even think about:</p>



 
 Always accessing your social media accounts through the Sudo private browser. Your Sudo private browser stops ads and tracking by default<br> 



 Taking your sensitive conversations out of the platforms and into MySudo, where all <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/did-you-know-mysudo-has-loads-of-advanced-messaging-features/">messaging</a> with other MySudo users is <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>. All calls and emails with other MySudo users are end-to-end encrypted, too.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 Use MySudo, but follow these social media safety tips too 



<p>MySudo will take you a long way to social media safety, but it’s important you follow some basic safety tips, like these from the FTC:</p>



 
 Limit who can see your posts and information on social media. All platforms collect information about you from your activities on social media, but visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-protect-your-privacy-apps">your privacy settings</a>&nbsp;to set some restrictions.<br> 



 If you get a message from a friend about an opportunity or an urgent need for money, call them. Their account may have been hacked—especially if they ask you to pay by cryptocurrency, gift card, or wire transfer. That’s how scammers ask you to pay.<br> 



 If someone appears on your social media and rushes you to start a friendship or romance, slow down. Read about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams">romance scams</a>. And never send money to someone you haven’t met in person.<br> 



 Before you buy,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0020-shopping-online">check out the company</a>. Search online for its name plus “scam” or “complaint.”<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>To learn more about how to spot, avoid, and report scams—and how to recover money if you’ve paid a scammer—visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/scams">ftc.gov/scams</a>. If you spot a scam, report it to the FTC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reportfraud.ftc.gov/">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>. </p>



<p>Here are some more tips:</p>



 
 Don’t post sensitive personal information, such as your home address or phone number. Sharing things like the names of your family, pet and school can give scammers the hints they need to guess your passwords or the answers to your account security questions.<br> 



 Be mindful of your location settings and avoid sharing excessive details about your whereabouts.&nbsp;<br> 



 Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication on all your social media accounts.<br> 



 Use private internet connections.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">MySudo VPN</a> shields your location and IP address.<br> 



 Be wary of requests from strangers and don’t click on suspicious links.&nbsp;<br> 



 Be wary of third-party apps that request access to your social media account. And avoid social login&nbsp;(see more on that below).<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>If you discover your personal information was exposed in a data breach, quickly change your passwords, add a fraud alert to your credit reports, and place a freeze on your credit reports. More helpful advice is available at the non-profit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a>.</p>
