 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us in a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And we are going to hear more about eIDAS 2.0 that is being evolving a lot getting ready and ready. So, for that we have a special guest who is Viky Manaila. She is an international expert in the field of electronic signatures, digital identity and digital transformation processes, who has successfully promoted the electronic business globally. She has been technical expert to the European Commission for instituting Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS) on electronic identity assurance and the design and roll-out of European cross-nation e-procurement platforms and operations.</p>
<p>Viky is a member of different high level working groups set up by the European Commission, the ETSI, and the US government aimed at aligning policy and operations around trust identity, digital signatures, and cross-recognition. She’s also president of Cloud Signature Consortium. Hello, Viky.</p>
<p>Viky Manaila: Hello, Oscar. Hello, everyone. And welcome to Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in Europe this time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. We’re talking about what is happening in Europe. Yeah, fantastic. Nice hearing you. Nice meeting you, Viky. So, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Viky: Thank you for inviting me to your show.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure. So, Viky, let’s talk about digital identity. So, let’s start by hearing a bit more about yourself in your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Viky: Well, my journey into digital services and identity space started back in 2002 when I was preparing my master’s thesis in electronic signatures and cryptography. That time I came across the famous cartoon of New Yorker drawn by Peter Steiner with the two dogs in front of the computer, the old one telling to the smallest one, “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” So, that cartoon impressed me very much. And we are now almost 30 years after trying to solve the dog on the internet problem. So, this is in a nutshell.</p>
<p>So, I continuously worked to improve the way we are conducting digital transactions, the way we are signing digitally, we are exchanging information and now proofing who we are on the internet with the trustworthy way, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, cartoons are amazing, right?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, that one I hope we can solve it soon once the eIDAS 2.0 will go into force.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And hopefully someone makes a cartoon for that, that also becomes a legend. So please tell us what is eIDAS 2.0 and why it was created?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, eIDAS 2.0 is the proposal, it’s a proposal to amend the eIDAS, the Regulation number 910 from 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. With eIDAS, the European Union lay down the foundations and a common legal framework across all member states for citizens, companies, public administrations to carry out transactions online with legal value.</p>
<p>eIDAS regulation has two parts: one, related to electronic identification and electronic identity. And one related to trust services such as electronic signature, timestamp, electronic seal, preservation of electronic signatures, certificates for website authentication. Now, as part of the legislative process of a regulation, after several years is coming and assessment to see how and what delivered, what needs to be changed or improved. Is it appropriate to modify its scope and specific provisions taking into consideration the technological development, the market evolution, the citizens expectations.</p>
<p>So, during 2020, during the pandemic, an extensive impact assessment has been carried out by a group of experts, which I was part of, analysing every detail of eIDAS including costs and benefits expected for relevant group of stakeholders affect this such as public authorities, trust service providers, conformity assessment bodies, electronic identity providers, supervisory bodies, the entire eIDAS ecosystem. Based on the evidence collected during this assessment, we drew conclusions and provided options for the legislative integration, integration, and a substantial input for the introduction of the EU framework for digital identity, the EU Digital Identity wallet concept.</p>
<p>So, the aim of eIDAS 2.0 is to achieve the targets set in Europe’s path to digital decade. Eighty percent of EU citizens being able to use a digital ID by 2030, so in less than 10 years, to be able to prove who they are cross-border, to be able to give the explicit consent for sharing pieces of their personal information, to know exactly with whom they’ve shared personal information and for what purpose. A technology where we can control ourselves, what data and how data is used, in a nutshell about eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And it’s definitely very ambitious goal, absolutely attainable, and we need it for sure.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, we need to solve the dog on the internet problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, from the experience of eIDAS, the first version eIDAS, so what are the lessons that have been learned from that experience, the good and the bad, if you can say?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes. So, I will start with concrete facts. Since the entering into force of eIDAS, we have only 14 European member states having in place a notified electronic ID schemes covering 59% of citizens. From this fourteen notified eID schemes only seven are mobile. Very few public services are available cross-border even for those citizens with an electronic identification mean. So, six years after the adoption of eIDAS, 41% of citizens are left without the possibility to use any trusted and secure eID across borders.</p>
<p>There are several pain points or problems identified during the impact assessment. Number one, an increased demand by public and private services for trusted identification and exchange of attributes. The current electronic ID framework is limited to the public sector services. There are no rules or conditions to allow the private sector services to get access to the national eID systems. In particular, the complexity and diversity of such systems, insufficient availability in all member states, the lack of flexibility to support a variety of use cases are significant in limiting the expanding of eID means. There is a huge market demand for credentials digitally proving attributes, such as professional qualifications, residency, medical certificate, and those are not covered by the current eIDAS.</p>
<p>The second problem identified is related to the current user expectations for seamless and trusted solutions to identify and share attributes across borders, and those expectations are not met. We are all expecting today a seamless online journey. Single sign-on solutions, mobile applications, covering all use cases for identification from electronic banking or e-health secure identification to anonymous log-on to an online platform or website. The ability to identify digitally will become an important factor of social inclusion and the provision of digital identity a strategic asset. Some member states moved already into this direction adopting new technological solution. But if this is not regulated at EU level, will further increase the disparity between national systems.</p>
<p>Alternative digital identification solutions by private providers and I can mention here the cases from Nordic countries where the banks are providing electronic identity solutions, those are not recognised by government outside of Nordic countries, for instance. However, they only address some private use cases not requiring high level of security. Other more secure solutions offered by private providers lack the common frameworks or standards as regards, for example, the level of assurance that they provide. So, they cannot scale up and be recognised across borders for access to public services or private services which require a certain level of trust.</p>
<p>The third problem identified is related to data control and security concerns that are not sufficiently addressed by available digital identity solutions. The security risks involved in providing personal data online or information system for authentication purposes are significant as more citizens conduct transactions online on a very frequent basis. However, neither public nor private offers fully respond to this demand. Existing electronic identities under eIDAS are not sufficiently widely usable for identification in the private sector to represent a viable alternative and has also inherent limitations to discretional data disclosure for the user.</p>
<p>So, despite offering high level of security, they show limitations as regards the principle of data minimisation. For example, eIDAS does not support so called zero knowledge claims. In addition, identification provided by large online platforms, often does not allow for the effective protection of personnel data. We have noticed that more and more platforms are allowing us to identify with our Google account or with our Facebook account or other providers account. But those platforms does not guarantee us the protection of personal data. And this has been evidenced by major data breaches and enforcement actions over the last period of time.</p>
<p>So, the general shift towards a more comprehensive identity ecosystem that integrates attributes and credentials, some of them carrying sensitive data, such as in the health sector, makes it necessary to develop an electronic identity ecosystem that is able to effectively protect personal data and offer full user control. And the last and the fourth major problem identified is related to unequal conditions for the provision of trust services.</p>
<p>Also, the evaluation of the eIDAS regulation concludes that the regulatory framework has successfully established legal certainty on liability, burden of proof, legal effect and international aspects of trust services. It also shows that there is room for improvement regarding a harmonised application of supervisory procedures and especially for processes for identity proofing that are the very basis for several other digital services, in particular, when these processes are carried out remotely.</p>
<p>There is also need for improvement concerning the efficiency of a particular trust service, the provision of Qualified Website Authentication Certificates, so called QWACs. What is happening despite the introduction of the certificates by the eIDAS regulation, web browsers refused to include them in their root stores and to display them clearly, which makes these certificates unusable for traders and consumers. For websites run by intermediaries or trading companies only, QWACs can guarantee the identity of the entity behind the website with a high level of assurance.</p>
<p>So, I’m a consumer, I want to buy something online, I go on a website that is claiming to sell clothes made in Italy or Italian brands. But if I look careful on that website, I can notice that is not an Italian website. It’s hosted in China. It’s a Chinese website. So, what is happening when I buy something, and I want to return because the quality is not the one expected or the one shown in the picture? We know a lot of problems related to this aspect. So, you cannot send back your purchase, you cannot get back your money. So, the lack of recognition of QWACs by web browsers may also conflict with the protection of fundamental rights of consumers that are enshrined in the treaty of the functioning of the European Union and with the EU consumer protection legislation. So, these are the most important problems issues identified related to the eIDAS regulation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, I think that were so exhausted explanation of those several problems. Of course, it feels like they are, how to say, incomplete solutions, right? So, there are some solutions, but they don’t completely fulfil, yeah, what they were meant to do. So, what do you think are the drivers of these problems?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, first of all, the member states are not obliged by the current eIDAS regulation to notify or to provide an electronic identity scheme or electronic identity mechanism. It is voluntary, and the process of notification is long and complex. Not all member states that have notified national electronic identities open those systems to the private sector for domestic reasons or for lack of incentives.</p>
<p>Private providers of digital identity attributes are not subject to a harmonised regulatory framework, ensuring trust and security across border. Then we have diverse and ineffective conditions for private online service providers that cannot rely on trusted and secure eID cross borders. Then the set of identity data provided by eIDAS is too limited and rigid. And last but not least inconsistent interpretation, divergent application and lack of acceptance of the eIDAS regulation in relation to QWACs certificate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So, every country does things quite different.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, quite different and not that the same beat and not at the same rate. And then we have discrepancy. And even if we have those electronic identification means we cannot use them cross-borders. For instance, I have the Italian SPID which is the notified electronic identification mean, but I cannot use it to open bank account in my country of origin, Romania, for instance, because it’s not possible yet to check cross-border this information.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. What solutions could be done I guess some of those are being now cooked on in eIDAS, right? So, what are the solutions to these issues?</p>
<p>Viky: I just wanted to mention that not all in eIDAS is bad that how the listeners or the audience could interpret the part related to trust services provisioning delivered exceptionally, so the regulation became recognised and globally approach to trust services provisioning and supervision. The term of qualified as the highest assurance level for a service has been adopted widely, and many countries transposed this definition into national legislation.</p>
<p>So, you will find the term of qualified electronic signature, which is essentially an European term introduced by eIDAS regulation, also outside the European Union, or trust service supervision, or trust service provisioning in other countries as well. So, the supervision and accreditation, the standards for trust services provisioning are a benchmark now.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s great to hear that, yeah. That inspire other…</p>
<p>Viky: Yes. I am very proud of that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. And inspire all the legislation…</p>
<p>Viky: Because we manage – yes, we manage to deliver a very good model. Coming back to your question, what is introducing new eIDAS 2.0, what are the new services? There are several new trust services such as electronic archiving, or distributed ledgers, or electronic attestation of attributes, which I would like to just talk a bit on.</p>
<p>What means electronic attestation of attributes? We are familiar with verifiable credentials term from self-sovereign identity space. So, the electronic attestation of attributes such as proof of age, for instance, for accessing age-restricted social media platforms, professional qualifications, I’m a lawyer, I’m a student, I’m a doctor, I’m… I don’t know professional digital space, digital driving licenses, vaccination certificates. We have seen the recent use case where we should came up with solutions in a very short time, with the possibility to check this information across border.</p>
<p>So, in this new ecosystem, identity data and attributes would, whenever required, be securely linked to the legal electronic identity of the user, making the data trustworthy and legally enforceable across border. These new service, electronic attestation of attributes, could be used to enable EU-wide authentication to access a variety of online services in the financial sector offer today at national level only. But in the future, we will have the possibility to use cross-border, and also would allow for the identification and authentication of IoT devices.</p>
<p>The aim with the new services introduced by eIDAS 2.0 is to achieve a shift from the reliance on national digital identity solutions only, to the provision of electronic attestation of attributes valid at European level. Providers of electronic attestation of attributes should benefit as a consequence of the eIDAS 2.0 from a clear and uniform set of rules. And public administrations should be able to rely on electronic documents in a given format, no matter what is the country that issued those documents.</p>
<p>So, these are the new services, of course, followed by the validation of electronic archiving, validation of electronic attestation of attributes. And last but not least, the most famous electronic digital identity wallet. But I think we need a month to discuss on only this aspect related to the wallet. It’s a very debated topic in the making.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that will be a debate interview, a marathon debate interview.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, exactly a marathon, we should organise a marathon for EUDI wallet, everything you wanted to know and never asked before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Maybe we can do it.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes. We’d be happy to participate.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, I know that the lack of these trust services was one of the reasons why the first eIDAS was, yeah, it was difficult to implement in different countries because each country, which service should we build, right? So that’s great that eIDAS 2.0 already has a framework for that. Could you now share some concrete examples, if possible, from different countries about these trust services?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, sure. I will take the most common, most known and used trust service, which is the provisioning of digital certificates for electronic signature. What I would like to mention, we arrived at eIDAS regulation after the European directive on electronic signature from 1999, where we had disparate solutions, each country transposed into their own legislation differently, the terms and the conditions for electronic signatures, they were not available with the same legal effect cross-border. So eIDAS regulation fixed this problem.</p>
<p>We have a common market, we have a common approach for the provisioning of digital certificates, for electronic signature accepted in all European countries with the same legal effect. And we have all flavours and forms of electronic signature, simple electronic signature, advanced qualified electronic signature, issued on secure cryptographic devices, or cloud-based with the cryptographic keys stored on a secure HSM.</p>
<p>I would like to mention for anyone interested in adopting a solution that allow users to sign from whatever device, be that mobile or desktop, the standardisation effort of Cloud Signature Consortium, which delivered common technical specification for cloud-based digital signatures adopted widely, not only in EU. So, Cloud Signature Consortium, as I mentioned, at the beginning, is a non-profit association with 68 members from 41 countries. Those members implemented the specifications from CSC into their solution, providing signature services with global interoperability not only within the EU boundaries. So, we have an open market for uniform adoption of solutions with legal effect. Everyone should have access to secure digital signature, which must be a commodity now, across a full range of cloud applications on mobile devices and the web.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, sounds definitely, definitely good.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, indeed, indeed it’s a success story as well. And I’m very happy to be part of this brilliant team of experts working together in bringing standards on the market. And of course, we will continue with new services related to digital transformation services.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what is the current status now we are in, we’re talking now in November, I think this is going to be – probably slightly later but yeah, November 2022, we are talking November 2022, what is the current status of eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, we should look at eIDAS 2.0 as a highway with multiple lanes. We have legislative, we have standardisation, and we have implementation lane. The eIDAS 2.0 proposal has a complex process of approval, and a very challenging timeline. Currently, the file is close to the end of revision period, by the policymakers, I mean, the Council of the European Union and the EU Parliament. Each of them will come with an amended version and is expected that in 2023, the first quarter or latest, the second quarter, will enter into a trialogue with the European Commission for the final form of the proposal. So, end of second quarter 2023, we should have the final draft of eIDAS 2.0 regulation.</p>
<p>In addition to that, there is the toolbox expert group under the European Commission guidance and in close cooperation with representatives from each member states, are working on a technical architecture and reference framework, common standards and technical specifications, common guidelines and best practices for the EUDI wallet and corresponding EU cases.</p>
<p>The core actors for the toolbox group are different DG units from the European Commission, DG CONNECT, DG IT, DG MOVE, DG HOME, DG SANTE and ENISA European institution covering the security and the cybersecurity aspects. Also, the private sectors community and relevant standardisation bodies have been invited by the toolbox expert group to provide support based on their relevant expertise.</p>
<p>A first draft of their architecture reference framework was published this year in February, and by mid-November, so in a couple of – in two weeks, for instance, is expected the second version. So, everybody stay tuned, we should see the enhanced architecture reference framework publicly available. But as the timeline for the implementation is really tight, once eIDAS 2.0 will enter into force, the European Commission has already launched two separate funding calls. One for the reference, EUDI wallet development and implementation. And one for large scale projects, proposing major use cases with cross-border transactions and significant number of users to be on-boarded.</p>
<p>So, you can notice the great support of everyone in the European Union of what I personally consider the most ambitious project since the invention of the internet. eIDAS 2.0 will be a success and the benchmark for digital identity as is for trust services already.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. It’s very ambitious and – and you said, so when the citizens will be starting using, probably by 2024?</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, probably by 2024. Because the large-scale project, for instance, should start working on the implementation early next year, with two years deadline. So, by the end of 2024, we should have the first citizens on-boarded in this large-scale project. For instance, being able to show their driving license online through EUDI wallet, or to have the capability to open a bank account using their electronic identity from the wallet, or to have a very seamless digital travel experience from buying flight tickets, to the check-in, to the border control authorities, up to on-boarded on the plane.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. It sounds like a dream but that’s something that is coming already. It’s really coming. That’s good.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, it sounds like a dream but will become reality. I’m very confident.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. That’s the good thing. And I’m sure this is going to expand outside Europe in a way once this reached the success.</p>
<p>Viky: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, we’ll expand, and we’ll have an impact outside Europe as well, because we are moving, we are moving in other countries so we can use our electronic identities to verify and to prove who we are in other countries as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Viky, final question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Viky: eIDAS 2.0 main capital. eIDAS 2.0 is a game changer for such multifaceted concept as digital identity that will restore the trust and confidence of citizens in online interaction without forfeiting our fundamental rights and our privacy. It’s a very ambitious mission. It’s a very challenging mission. And the effort should be collaborative for its success. Policymakers, standardisation bodies, public administrators, public administrations, private sector providers, we should all work together to design and to regulate our smart devices to be tools of digital freedom, not of digital surveillance.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. Thanks a lot, Viky, for super interesting conversation. And I can of course, commend you, all the work you and many of your colleagues across the members of the European Union have been working during this last year. It’s a fantastic job. So please let us know how people would like to get in touch with you. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Viky: Well, they can reach me out through my LinkedIn profile where I’m quite active, Viky Manaila. Or, my Twitter profile, the same Viky Manaila. And of course, by email that I suppose you will post it on the transcription notes on the episode.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Viky, for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Viky: Thank you. Thank you and goodbye, everyone.</p>

<p>It can be jarring for people accustomed to conferences, but the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a>—a biannual event at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California—is an “unconference.” This means that the agenda is created live each day by the attendees who are present at the opening of each day; this gives you, if you’re there, the opportunity to set a topic for discussion. Attendees can and do pop in and out of discussions depending on how interested they are in what’s being discussed.</p>
<p>As with all conferences, un or not, the action is in the hallways and around the demonstrations, where conversations happen and take flight. And attendees this year will have the opportunity to talk to Indicio as attending staff demonstrate its new <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a>.</p>
<p>The Governance Editor is an easy way to create and implement the governance rules for issuing and verifying digital credentials in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. Indicio has been working with the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/trust-establishment">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> to write a specification for decentralized governance that is<a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-ecosystem-governance-better-more-effective-and-more-robust-than-trust-registries/"> machine-readable</a>.</p>
<p>This means that both the trust lists of trusted issuers of credentials and the rules for how the information in the credentials should be verified are written to a governance file. This file is then cached in the agent software for each issuer, holder, and verifier in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem, which means maximal speed for verification, minimal delay in updating approved issuers and changes to rules through file propagation, and, critically, the possibility of offline verification.</p>
<p>Decentralized Ecosystem Governance makes it easy to scale a Trusted Digital Ecosystem and use verifiable credentials interoperably across ecosystems and jurisdictions while observing hierarchical rules.</p>
<p>As often, it’s easier to understand the concept by seeing it in action, so if you can’t join us between Nov 15-17 in Mountain View, you can watch a video of the demonstration: <a href="https://youtu.be/8DUf7U4aKj4">https://youtu.be/8DUf7U4aKj4</a></p>
<p>We also made a webpage with more information about the demo and with lots of links that will help you implement DEGov: <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor">https://indicio.tech/governance-editor</a></p>

  With 2022 proving to be a tough year for the crypto industry due to back-to-back blows (TerraUSD crash, FTX collapse, crypto hacks, etc.), the regulatory pressure is only going to intensify from here, be it from the FATF, G20, the European Union, Financial Stability Board, or&nbsp;more.  For instance, the FATF reiterated ahead of the “No Money for Terror” meeting, which is scheduled to take place next week, that countries should enforce the Travel Rule at the earliest.  However, there are several issues that VASPs may face while complying with the Travel Rule, namely VASP discovery &amp; data security, which Shyft Veriscope successfully solves across all jurisdictions.  <p>With the crypto market gaining mainstream attention in the 2017 bull market, as observed in terms of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/730876/cryptocurrency-maket-value/">sharp growth in the crypto market cap</a>, policymakers, regulators, and other national and international authorities started being increasingly concerned about the potential use of virtual assets to illicitly move funds across the ecosystem. However, they adopted a wait &amp; watch approach towards the virtual assets industry.</p><p>Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering watchdog, was one such international body. Cryptocurrencies entered the FATF’s consciousness back in 2014 amid increasing concerns that malicious actors are abusing this emerging asset class for illicit activities, such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, terrorist fundraising, sanctions evasion, states being able to enrich nuclear weapons, and so&nbsp;forth.</p><blockquote>As such, the global anti-money laundering watchdog published guidelines on cryptocurrencies in 2019, directing countries to register virtual asset service providers and requiring such firms to monitor crypto transactions and report any suspicious activity to authorities.</blockquote><p>Yet, to date, only a few countries have enforced the FATF Travel Rule. However, with India assuming the G20 presidency, crypto regulations, including the FATF Travel Rule, will continue to be a hotly debated topic globally, <a href="https://news.abplive.com/business/crypto/2022-g20-summit-india-presidency-objective-plan-agenda-cryptocurrency-regulation-cbfc-digital-rupee-rbi-1563295">as reiterated multiple times</a> by the country’s finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Indian Prime minister Narendra Modi, too, has demanded several times for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-seeks-decision-on-crypto-rule-at-g20/articleshow/95496890.cms?from=mdr">global cooperation on crypto regulations</a>, noting that it’s not enough for one country to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p><p>On top of this, 2022 hasn’t been too kind to the crypto market shaken by the TerraUSD crash, Celsius, or FTX collapse, to mention a few. The decade-or-so-long ecosystem has experienced unprecedented setbacks this year. Moreover, crypto hacks in 2022, which amount to <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cryptocurrency/crypto-hackers-steal-3-billion-in-2022-set-to-be-biggest-year-for-digital-asset-heists-9347301.html">$3 billion</a> so far, have surpassed the numbers from previous years by a considerably large&nbsp;margin.</p><p>All these instances have added to the resolve of authorities, compelling them to adopt crypto regulations at the earliest. Travel Rule is now widely recognised as a disruptor to illicit finance from using cryptocurrency.</p><p>The FATF, too, reiterated ahead of the “No Money for Terror” meeting, which is scheduled to take place next week, that countries must enforce the Travel Rule at the earliest. All countries are being urged to comply with the Travel Rule as a matter of international priority, and to that point, Travel Rule compliance will be mandatory for all VASPS, no matter the location.</p><blockquote>However, there is a critical issue that VASPs face whilst attempting to comply with the Travel Rule: no way to automatically discover and verify the counterparty VASP to an entity level which would automatically provide information on the entity’s location, regulated status, Travel Rule reporting threshold, supported Travel Rule protocols, and contact&nbsp;details.</blockquote><p>The combination of Shyft Discover and Shyft Veriscope Share solves this issue without friction for end-users, in real time, securely, and while maintaining the decentralized nature of&nbsp;crypto.</p> Shyft Discover: Auto-detection of the counterparty VASP <p>When complying with the Travel Rule, originator VASPs should accurately verify who owns the beneficiary wallet address, which is crucial as user data is sensitive information. It’s a critical step as otherwise, user personal information may be sent to the incorrect counterparty VASP, causing a breach of data privacy obligations.</p><p>This is where Shyft Discover excels, as it enables VASPs to auto-detect counterparty VASPs just by using the crypto wallet address, without requiring users to input additional information themselves and without the VASP having to publicly publish its own wallet addresses.</p><p>A further step of automated address proofing ensures that the VASP actually controls the wallet address they claim to. Once verified, a payload of information about the VASP is shared, including the regulated status, travel rule threshold, and travel rule protocols supported.</p><p>Shyft Discover automates VASP discovery and enables originator VASPs to reliably identify counterparty VASPs at a legal entity/jurisdiction level. Moreover, it further empowers VASPs with the ability to choose which counterparties they are prepared to share data with and which ones to exclude, depending on the VASP’s own risk-based approach.</p><p>Shyft Discover is essentially providing a decentralized, verified phone book for VASPs on a global basis. The information on a VASP is owned by the VASP but becomes available to counterparties on-demand in real-time. As the only solution to provide this, and as a public utility, this forms the first layer of critical infrastructure in solving the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>However, once VASP discovery &amp; proofing is successfully completed through Shyft Discover, it’s time for Shyft’s Veriscope Share, the second part of the critical Travel Rule compliance infrastructure framework, to resolve the user data sharing&nbsp;problem.</p> Veriscope Share: Enabling VASPs to Share Critical User Data Securely&nbsp;P2P <p>Under the Travel Rule, VASPs must share critical user data along with the crypto transaction with their counterparty VASPs. However, just as there is no globally-agreed framework to solve the VASP discovery problem while complying with the Travel Rule, there is also no framework to standardize the mechanism for secure data transfers between&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>Although some Travel Rule Solutions exist in the market that can help solve the sharing, VASPs should be aware that the user data they share with their counterparty VASPs may be passing through the Travel Rule solution’s own servers. And there are significant risks in this approach, particularly in relation to unauthorized access, monitoring, and liability.</p><blockquote>This is where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> Share proves to be a true game-changer. In contrast to a majority of Travel Rule Solutions that are available, Veriscope Share enables VASPs to exchange user data in a fully secured manner without storing it on third-party servers. Transfers are peer-to-peer, VASP to VASP, with no intermediary steps.</blockquote><p>When using Veriscope Share, VASPs mitigate risks of rogue employees of a Travel Rule Solution accessing their user data for dubious purposes and also removes the potential for wide-scale data breaches.</p><p>Veriscope Share complies with all major data privacy laws, such as GDPR, while ensuring 100% VASP-to-VASP data transfers.</p><p>Overall, Shyft has reinvented Travel Rule compliance by considering all angles of the requirements, from AML to data privacy, and building privacy, security, AML, and compliance from the&nbsp;outset.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Identity Server 2022.2 is released today, including SSO 9.1 and CustomerID 6.1&nbsp; 
<p>During the shorter release cycle we have continued core structural updates for SSO and added in more Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) capabilities. For all the details, please head over to review our <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20222/pages/8963424357/Identity+Server+2022.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Features&nbsp; 
<p>Risk-Based Authentication (RBA): Continuing our development of risk-based authentication, we have extended the ability to require MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) to directory mapped users. These are external organisations, such as your partners or a company you are acquiring, whose users (external directory users) need access to any of your integrated applications. The applications can be integrated with either OIDC (OpenID Connect) &nbsp;or SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) &nbsp;and the external user management of these external directory users can be left in the hands of your partner company, while the user credentials will be mapped into your SSO Ubilogin Directory. Now these external users will be able to utilise SMS OTP, SMTP OTP or most importantly TOTP (i.e. with Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator) to easily and strongly assure their identity during the login session. Users can elect to use SMS or SMTP, their credentials will be queried via the integrated IdP or they can elect to use TOTP (Time-based One Time Password), where a secret key pair is generated by SSO and given to the user in the form of a QR code that you generate and they scan with their smartphone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a Zero Trust principle, you will be able to require all classes of users internal (found in Ubilogin Directory), external (found in your partners directory, but mapped into Ubilogin Directory) or unregistered (located in an integrated external IDP) to be multi-factor authenticated during each login session. From this starting zero trust point, we will continue our risk-based authentication development over the next several release cycles. We are excited to expand our Identity Platform into this dynamic security space and believe we will deliver many useful enhancements to the platform. Ask your Sales Team/Account Manager for more information on upcoming development plans.&nbsp;</p>
 Improved Security&nbsp; 
<p>Ongoing security is key – as we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security.  During this release cycle we’ve updated the third-party libraries used for logging throughout our SSO application. We have fully removed Log4j and replaced it with SLF4j and Logback. Logback replaces the Log4j libraries that SSO has utilised since the beginning of our service offering. While SLF4j is a logging facade – which is an API driven framework that permits us to update and modify the underlying logging application without making service impacting changes. Restated – we can update and improve our codebase without making any future alterations to the log files you utilise from Identity Platform. One caveat of course, where there is additional features created (like risk-based authentication features) your log files will contain additional information, but will remain in the same format and location. You can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20222/pages/8963424357/Identity+Server+2022.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.&nbsp;</p>
 Looking Forward&nbsp; 
<p>Continuing into the autumn and winter, we will be continuing our risk-based authentication development – with a focus on account suspension when abuse is being detected by an upstream security device within your environment. The abuse could be protection from brute force password cracking, or phishing attempts or could be more benign like time-of-day access violations (or limits) or limiting the maximum number of times a single user account can log onto a service simultaneously. Naturally we will continue the improvements on security, starting with updating Wildfly – the underlying web server used for CustomerID. There will also be additional improvements throughout the platform. If you have any questions over the features and security improvements offered in this release or over our upcoming development items please feel free to engage with us via the Operations team or your account team – we are always happy for your input to help shape our future developments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard of KYC (Know Your Customer), or experienced it first hand when you signed up for an account at a financial institution. It’s the process in which a bank, for instance, verifies that you are who you say you are — typically by asking for identifying documents and other relevant personal information.</p><p>KYC is a subset of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) obligations that many firms must deal with. Originally, these regulations were designed for financial institutions but over time, the scope has expanded to other industries as well such as healthcare, fintech, and even the nonprofit world.</p><p>International standards are set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) but local rules can vary by jurisdiction.</p><p>The purpose of KYC (and AML and CFT) is straightforward. It’s about keeping real customers safe and keeping the bad guys out of the system. These are good&nbsp;things!</p><p>In practice, however, traditional approaches to KYC create a host of&nbsp;issues:</p>  They’re exclusive. People who don’t have access to traditional identifying documentation will have trouble accessing basic financial services. Migrant workers, for instance, might not even have a home address. According to the World Bank, 1.7 billion people still lack access to a bank&nbsp;account.  They’re expensive. KYC and compliance represents a huge barrier of entry for new companies who not only need to implement systems for identity verification but must also now manage all of that user data in a private and secure way. Which leads us to the next&nbsp;point.  They create honeypots for hackers. It’s no secret that data breaches have risen astronomically over the last ten years as more and more industries have gone digital. Each time you are asked to verify your identity, your personal data and information is now stored in yet another server somewhere, which becomes a target for criminals. Many of these companies don’t specialize in data security.  They’re ineffective. This is the saddest part. Despite the best intentions, KYC is often ineffective at catching or deterring the bad guys. This is inherent to how the system operates today. Data is siloed because institutions hold data in their own proprietary system, and these systems don’t talk to each other. A criminal could try to infiltrate one institution with a synthetic identity. If that doesn’t work out, they still have all the other ones to try. Those other institutions would be none the&nbsp;wiser.  <p>These are major issues! The cold hard truth is that we won’t be able to even begin addressing them without fundamentally rethinking how our identity systems work from the ground&nbsp;up.</p><p>But if you’re reading this blog post, you likely already know that new approaches already exist. These approaches were designed from the ground up with the digital world in mind — versus the legacy and often paper-based systems that they will ultimately replace.</p><p>By leveraging portable and reusable digital identities, financial institutions and other organizations can cover more people around the world, reduce their costs, and create a more seamless and convenient onboarding experience for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>These solutions were designed with privacy and security in mind. And because the user owns their data and no longer has to redundantly share it each time they want to sign up for a new service, there’s less targets for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Reusable identities also drastically reduce the barriers to entry for new companies. Which means that companies can focus on what they do best: building great products and services.</p><p>Best of all? They’ll be much more effective at keeping the bad guys&nbsp;out.</p><p>That’s the point, anyway, isn’t&nbsp;it?</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about GlobaliD, <a href="https://www.global.id/">visit our website</a>, <a href="https://www.global.id/demo/">contact our sales team</a> or follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc/">LinkedIn</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a>.</p><p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-id-wallets-68fa77e6d0d7">Part 3:</a> Why the ID Wallet is the first step toward achieving a new vision for digital&nbsp;identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-every-company-is-an-identity-company-a851beed999d">Part 4:</a> Why every company is an identity&nbsp;company  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-bring-your-own-identity-5b9927008190">Part 5:</a> What is Bring Your Own Identity?  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-reusable-identity-9dc6a1860e8">Part 6:</a> Reusable&nbsp;Identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-device-based-identity-c6096a5b0890">Part 7:</a> Device-based identity  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-selective-sharing-d0a0ab7ad1d6">Part 8:</a> Selective sharing  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-non-custodial-wallets-2376db1e1791">Part 9:</a> Non-custodial wallets   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-know-your-customer-989722b55891">GlobaliD 101: Know your customer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), 28th Plenary meeting, 11 October&nbsp;2022</p><p>I had the great honor of being invited to speak last month at the 28th Plenary meeting of the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business. My focus was to describe the top three challenges preventing digitization within global trade, and how modern technologies are stacking up to overcome&nbsp;them.</p><p>This blog post is adapted directly from my presentation at the UN, capturing the hopeful message that emerging technical standards constitute a promising solution on the horizon. My slides are available <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/Nis%20Jespersen%20-%20Solving%20International%20Trade%20ChallengeswithEmerging%20Web%20Technologies.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>By means of introduction, the following challenges have obstructed trade and supply chain digitization on a global&nbsp;scale:</p>  Mutual understanding and common semantics  Global identification of trade&nbsp;parties  Establishing and maintaining trust at the&nbsp;distance  <p>The corresponding solution is a technology stack based on cryptography and international W3C web standardization:</p>  JSON Linked&nbsp;Data  Decentralized Identifiers  Verifiable Credentials  <p>These three technologies individually address the particular challenges listed. And as we shall see, in combination they shape an exciting path towards global trade digitization.</p>Preparing to address the&nbsp;UN. Establishing a Common Interpretation of&nbsp;Data <p>The heterogeneous environment of international trade makes it particularly difficult to ensure that the meaning of data is understood. When I say “x”, might it be understood as “歪”, or perhaps&nbsp;“ζ”?</p><p>UN/CEFACT’s Buy-Ship-Pay model is the undisputed global semantic dictionary for terms in trade, broadly adopted and recognized by WCO, WTO, EU and essentially all other relevant organizations.</p><p>However, due to methodology and the way which UN/CEFACT has traditionally been published, making use of the BSP terminology has still entailed certain challenges:</p>  Out-of-bounds vocabulary agreement; the sender must somehow tell the receiver “I am encoding data with UN/CEFACT, so you should interpret it accordingly”.  Human interpretation, mapping source data into UN/CEFACT terms, making decisions such as “Shipping Container means Transport Equipment”.  Another human’s interpretation, mapping UN/CEFACT terms to a target model, for example “Transport Equipment means ตู้คอนเทนเนอร์”.  Breaking legacy API agreements; if a vendor’s API uses shippingContainer, then changing it to transportEquipment is a breaking change, adversely affecting all dependent customers.  Resolving a term URI to its documentation.<p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-tech-school-101-linked-data-enables-integration-across-systems-b751ba4eed6">JSON Linked Data</a> is a standard for overlaying normal API JSON with semantic meaning in a non-breaking manner. This is done by literally adding a context to the data message. The context defines the types and identifiers of the data by use of web URIs. For example, a “consignment” attribute would be defined as <a href="https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/Consignment">https://vocabulary.uncefact.org/Consignment</a>. Such URIs are easily interpretable by computers; and humans too, as it resolves directly to the appropriate documentation of the&nbsp;term.</p><p>JSON-LD enables the data sender to be explicit about the meaning of data such that no further interpretation is needed downstream. Interpret once, understand everywhere.</p><p>Further, JSON-LD is in fact an implementation of a first-order logic data model known as RDF. This allows computers to automatically consume data without the need of human interpretation. JSON-LD data is directly machine readable, <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678">building knowledge graphs</a> which enables <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">advanced data analysis</a>.</p><p><a href="https://v.jsld.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">Here</a> you can see an example of a JSON-LD file and its expanded machine knowledge interpretation.</p> Identification of Global Trade&nbsp;Parties <p>Digital identity today is largely based on the concept of identity federation. Federation was a step up from the 1st generation online identity which required establishing identity for every single online service. However, while large commercial Identity Providers dominate the personal identity space, the realm of global trade poses a number of specific challenges which has prevented federation-based adoption on a global scale. It is certainly not for lack of a golden business opportunity — the potential of establishing The Identity Provider for Global Trade is a mighty pot of honey. If a federation-based solution was possible, it would exist&nbsp;already.</p>Common Identity Providers.<p>Commercial organization identifier registries do exist, but are not used for federated authentication. The same is true for other identifiable things; GS1 and BIC are noteworthy successful identifier registries. But again these offer identifiers, not authentication.</p><p>State-governed Identity Providers do exist, also for businesses. But these are almost entirely recognized within that country, international federation is basically non-existent.</p><p>Also, the federation approach logically does not scale well: everyone recognizing everyone else’s Identity Providers is an exponentially complex&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Even assuming all of these problems could be overcome, Identity Provider model would be unattractive:</p>  The 3rd party Identity Provider gains trade secret insights. Such insights are the main business model of today’s Identity Providers. While already questionable for personal usage, it is definitely unacceptable for businesses.  An identity provider for global trade would effectively be granting a monopoly to a vendor; monopolies tend to not benefit&nbsp;users.  Centralization entails a single point of failure. The honey pot is equally tempting for malicious exploitation — a classic argument for decentralization.  <p>Decentralized Identifiers are based on a model where the controller of an identity keeps a private key which is used for authentication, assertions and other use cases where proving identity control is required.</p><p>All DIDs resolve to a DID Document, which include the corresponding public key. This way, anyone can verify that an entity claiming to control a given identifier indeed holds its private key. This removes the need to map between multiple identity provider representations; each DID is essentially its own Identity Provider.</p><p>This is an example of a DID: did:web:transmute.industries. You can try resolving this DID and explore its corresponding DID Document&nbsp;<a href="https://lucid.did.cards/identifiers/did:web:transmute.industries">here</a>.</p> Establishing Trusted Relationships Establishing trust remains an analogue endeavor.<p>Global trade spans cultures, political environments and jurisdictions almost by definition. This makes it hard to establish and maintain trusted business relationships. Trust today in large part rides on costly and fragile personal relationships.</p><p>Even assuming a trusted relationship, how can you be sure that a set of claims are in fact representing the business partner’s intention? The traditional way is based on signed paper documents, backed by law. The intuitive digital equivalent is PDFs with scanned signatures as a means to “digitization”. But while a digital picture can be transmitted over the internet, it does not enable automation; and data security is also brittle and based on human judgment.</p><p>Commercial platforms typically approach this challenge by signing into a walled-off contractual environment which. This has several shortcomings:</p>  It is limited to a particular business&nbsp;process.  Disincentive for cross-platform interoperability, passing the problem to&nbsp;users.  Trust is lost when data leaves the platform.  <p>A Verifiable Credential essentially ties a data message to an issuer with a cryptographic signature. At any later point in time, it can be verified that this cryptographic linkage is unbroken. As simple as that sounds, it is an incredibly powerful way to enable&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Structured data can be transmitted from a trusted party, and the receiver can be confident that the data is untampered and corresponds to the issuer’s intent. The Verifiable Credential may change hands many times over, just like physical and digital documents always have been passed around. At any point throughout the supply chain, its content can be verified.</p><p>Further, if a trusted organization has issued a Verifiable Credential about an unknown organization, that becomes a trust enabler. For example, it can be challenging to trust ethical manufacturing from a supplier manufacturing on a different continent. Trust can be bootstrapped by a locally present certificate issuer. This way, cryptographic chains linking back to relevant and trusted organizations can form entire supply chain trust&nbsp;graphs.</p><p>You can try verifying a Verifiable Credential <a href="https://api.did.actor/v/eJztV91y2jgUfhWP9zYm_sEGfFUKCaUbCNQhbdLZ2RHyAdTYkiPJEOj0YfYZ-gh9sT0yJCFtmmm7e7WbOyR9_nTOd84npI_2Cyq4hhttx-_thdaFig8PV6tVbRXUhJwf-q7XPKQSUuCakUwdLj374B4YsLSCaUkokCnLmF4byB8HNkvt2C4lj8uSpXEI9XDmhaFDW_WWU3fd0CENCB0_4ixsTiMStggS63UBJpJzkGzGyDSDzt3euNwReQ6S4qDPl4LR_VXckpMcv95DWTuY1QGpkZASDUiTgqKSFZoJjvCuoGWOJJYEKmTK-NwiFibEFaEGYk1BrwA4zirIMpAW4SkOpuUaJLIxpUrCKXQNeWz7ru87ru_4wZnnxWEYu-7lDoXw-ONdjqdyTjjbkCqMW8FS1OoK1vEmGlxplmyuj1tX16t00jy_Sl_-fhNGRxebd7NizoejSbu34QWjQ_Z2xu277AfkhlltClJYA7jBlLn4JuXjUrEvn7m1tmZkKhFDq2EKFqk-VF8-Zyw132WCbgPcC3yUIcpEPAexP98D0RGVgqiEMoAMv9VlWskS1qKmHwTNZiNyozByGxU7n98CHM-tBV7QCBrNpufWXb9pfzqwSZpKUOrB9kJpkrV3C7iL0hJA307EdnsJnKXE6hCZCWV5rmvfEZ1gPqZJEfYKJP_yVwobk_eASHKPegPzrVDDEpbCOgFhBC6qjTuiCjfw_X3ejii5loa2El3YnzB4yAnLcIrxmXgBNyQvMqhx0IZrITgMy3xqesIO0Rie33AaTS8wWd8bLimnH4Dq_fx3PW0yL4TUp7Oj7c6PFKjkmO823kly0ntpuLETtKkQJrgX9DsTUynpgqi9RvaqRjaO33b-U-373H7_mfbbnmxP1PrJsvyIZrtm6QHHg55aA6GFVJaYWe3cTBgtvpbV862v4F35qLBd0FIw_YicA0YXbE7YN2rWsTV8J_Qaj0o6SdqoJ-rCNOQqWbCiADyr39_ndyZJCieMQx8RlTGlSMuHth3tpnA1J7yc4Z9LKZ8t9T-x1MNqTYaJlQQoiWvRhRQ5K3OHM3oFmYUBMZ7h_vgLcCxFlqka8q-AzRcPOmqM1w6sBlZkCeckK3dHPtO7hLKpwu-W1Qr6Jwoxvds2rrKz4xBLLoVSb3-M_Jar6YeVVF9thtzZzgRnAoUdSfM_9cADOJEUQLd3sV2bF1tYiPLvBp1SSuB0a76uCfrZa89e-zWv9UiGbUs4B5JBarWTs4HVdqIwsDaMU4dJvOGTLBNrhwpUPt35Ti1QlZ8x3p3P_Kj5mDceGs93f815fhhE_7716vXvWw9R2jD-ZKBBEHnfCbSiG5G1eXR1yx-PshU9cUCYY0DM7rnso9QPQ6-VsDkaCt1vXrJ2dbU2Vb59qHl4xW2ceX4ctGKveqgtq6fndvMB6IX4J8-y337hHVclMiolGsbkQZQyj9e7YA7sDyvjU1i_Xkx7lJ2y18eXR2_Oxklf9fO-P-z0o8v8WFF_guPhmrwbs9NMsYsPF24_81q12nVRd_TFa6fudU5I0ihfndKX_uRmfqx6yneSTdppnOvuG_8VgFyQxSmo8nownozb0Z-Xw-n572MGvfnJxj8O6sUon3aT62XaHWMR_gb5v3BZ">here</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Cultural, language and other contextual obstacles can be overcome by overlaying common data messages with Linked Data.

The DID+VC — also referred to as “SSI” or “Web 5” — is gaining tremendous traction, including adoption by nation states as a means to digitization.</p><p>With such significant challenges overcome — meaning, identification and trust — the LD+DID+VC stack looks very promising as the “Killer App” for Global&nbsp;Trade.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

   ForgeRock's new cloud-native governance is purpose-built to help solve security and compliance challenges for large enterprises at scale. 

 Delivering the Future of Workforce Governance 

<p>Today we <a href="https://investors.forgerock.com/press-releases/detail/359/forgerock-introduces-new-cloud-native-governance-solution">announced</a> the newest offering in our cloud lineup, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">ForgeRock Identity Governance</a>. This new solution is a significant advancement in our vision to empower enterprises with self-driving identity where humans remain in control with the aid of AI and machine learning. The aim is to give your organization the ability to stay ahead of the volume and velocity of access changes your IT teams face every day.</p>

<p>The accelerated growth of the hybrid workforce, employee job changes, and increasing adoption of cloud-based applications and services have evolved to a point where today's governance solutions simply can't keep up. But ForgeRock’s new cloud-native identity governance is purpose-built for global enterprise scale.</p>

<p>ForgeRock Identity Governance is part of a comprehensive workforce solution that combines cloud, governance, access management, and powerful machine learning into a converged security and compliance solution. The new offering will combine three primary components: Access Certifications to accelerate manager access decision-making with AI-informed recommendations; Access Requests to provide users with a 24/7 self-service portal and to automate application access; and Segregation of Duties to ensure regulatory compliance when and where you need it.</p>

 Full-Suite Governance Meets Extreme Scale 

<p>A lot of claims are made about scale, but our solution delivers real results. A global financial services organization with 100K+ workforce identities and 3,500+ applications, was able to process 230 million entitlement assignments in less than an hour using ForgeRock Identity Governance.</p>

<p>Performance like this is made possible by our unique cloud architecture that provides fully isolated compute, network, and storage resources in a modern, multi-tenant cloud environment. This means you get the horsepower to process millions of permissions per minute without worrying about a noisy cloud neighbor obstructing your workload.</p>

 Together at Last: Governance + Identity and Access Management 

<p>Today's large enterprises are seeking converged identity solutions as they recognize the business value of consolidating critical pieces of the identity perimeter. According to Gartner, by 2025, 70% of new access management, governance, administration and privileged access deployments will be converged identity and access management platforms<a>1</a>.</p>

<p>To achieve the full benefits of identity-driven security and compliance, you need the ability to manage the identity lifecycle, secure runtime access to resources (authentication and authorization), and continuously govern that access. By converging ForgeRock Identity Governance with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022">industry-leading identity and access management</a> capabilities, you can gain efficiencies and cost savings with the ability to manage, secure, and govern identities throughout their entire lifecycle — all from a single platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Benefiting from Our AI investments 

<p>In May, when we <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/identity-perimeter-just-got-smarter">released Autonomous Access</a>, the ForgeRock Identity Platform became the industry's first to infuse AI into the entire identity lifecycle. Our new governance solution leverages these capabilities by applying AI and machine learning to help you determine whether your employees, contractors, partners, and suppliers should or shouldn't have access to applications and data. Security decisions become immediately actionable for IT teams — excessive access can be automatically removed, and low-risk access can automatically be granted — without the need to integrate additional products.</p>

 Connecting the IAM and Governance Dots 

<p>Today's large enterprise needs it all: full-suite governance features that scale to process hundreds of millions of permissions for all identities, combined with comprehensive identity and access management, all powered by AI and delivered from the cloud. We're excited to bring all these requirements together, starting with Access Certifications. ForgeRock Identity Governance will be available in the beginning of 2023. We’d love the opportunity to start a conversation about how ForgeRock can help your organization.</p>

<p>Oceaners!</p><p>We have important updates for&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Energy Efficiency data challenge is officially over and here are the top 3 winners revealed.</p><p>Launched in October 2022, the initiative was designed to incentivise data-driven understandings and innovations to improve energy efficiency for domestic buildings in Scotland. Out of a total prize pool of $6000, rewards for this challenge are as follows: 1st place: $3000, 2nd place: $2000, 3rd place: $1,000 (in OCEAN). All valid entries submitted will also receive an award of 500 OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Let’s explore&nbsp;more!</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-10-21-ocean-protocol-energy-efficiency-data-challenge">Energy Efficiency Data</a> challenge is part of the broader <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Data Challenge</a> program that is driven by the vision to spearhead the shift into a New Data Economy by incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms to solve complex business challenges. The idea behind its launch was to harness the power of energy data, build algorithms that facilitate innovation and spearhead the shift towards smarter, greener, more efficient buildings for global&nbsp;change.</p><p>As part of the challenge, participants were presented with an energy performance dataset originating from the <a href="http://www.scottishepcregister.org.uk/">Scottish Energy Performance Certificate Register</a>. The challenge was to create context around the data by generating rankings and visualizations that illustrated how and why the presented data is valuable. Participants were required to build algorithms that could run on the provided data, identify correlations between given attributes and generate specific output/ input. They were also asked to draft a concluding report that presented findings along with quantitative and qualitative analysis and recommendations.</p><p>A panel of evaluators from Ocean reviewed all the submissions and offered the award for 1st place ($3,000) to Andrey Bessalov, 2nd place ($2000) to Viviene Siew and 3rd place ($1,000) to Hoe Jun Leong for their reports. The winners were selected for identifying key insights into the cities and towns with higher energy performance resulting in reduced energy costs and CO2 emissions. Their entries also proposed machine learning models for outputting energy-efficiency improvement suggestions. Further, they also analyzed which building factors contribute to the total cost of energy and what changes can be made to reduce costs by using different building materials.</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners and thank you to all the participants for the entries!

<p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We are back with exciting news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from US Treasury Chief and Indian Finance Minister discussing crypto regulations to FATF’s push for Travel Rule implementation before the “No Money For Terror” meeting on November&nbsp;18–19.</p><p>Shyft’s Veriscope also rolled out a new feature, “<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscopes-address-proofs-enable-vasps-to-protect-critical-data">Address Proofs</a>,” last week, enabling beneficiary VASPs to prove they control the respective crypto wallet address. This, in turn, would ensure that Originator VASPs share critical user data with only the right counterparty VASP for Travel Rule compliance. So, let’s dive straight into it without further&nbsp;ado.</p> Shyft Network: A “Vital Balancer” Between CeFi &amp; DeFi Amid Upcoming Regulatory Blitzkrieg <p>The FTX fiasco has got everyone in the crypto space on their toes, compelling virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to come out clean on their exposure to the erstwhile 3rd largest crypto exchange and its native&nbsp;token.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/josephweinberg/status/1591569280914661376?s=20&amp;t=H5nDcC59oczltbDhQrk_1A">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>Speaking of the impact of FTX’s meltdown, it will be multifold. On the one hand, the expectation for sound crypto regulations has also been blown away. And now, instead of regulations that could have spurred crypto innovation, we will get “knee-jerk reactionary” regulation, as per Shyft Network co-founder Joseph Weinberg.</blockquote><p>On the other hand, the losses that major institutional investors like Ontario Teacher’s Pension Fund and sequoia Capital experienced with FTX’s collapse will impact the institutional activity within the crypto&nbsp;space.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/josephweinberg/status/1591589684299563008?s=20&amp;t=H5nDcC59oczltbDhQrk_1A">Image Source</a>)<p>However, amid accelerating regulations, Shyft Network will prove itself as a “Vital Balancer” between centralized and decentralized finance. Wishing for the demise of either of these options can strain the crypto industry, as both are required to prevent the upcoming regulatory onslaught.</p> US Treasury Chief &amp; India Finance Minister Discussed Crypto Regulation <p>US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss crypto regulation at the 9th India-U.S. Economic and Financial Partnership meeting.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1099">joint statemen</a>t by Yellen and Sitharaman after the meeting, the US and India look forward to discussing… digital assets, payment system modernization, and sustainable finance.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/FinMinIndia/status/1591033855884296194?s=20&amp;t=7Y0Kr3Fci0I4K-b8491X5A">Image Source</a>)<p>Both promised to strengthen their cooperation in AML/CFT efforts through increased information sharing and coordination, including expediting digital evidence and information sharing for ML/TF investigations.</p><blockquote>Following the meeting, Yellen noted that crypto regulation had been a “tremendous focus” of the Biden administration, and while “a good deal of progress” has been made, there’s still some way to go. She also called on taking steps to reduce the cost of cross-border payments.</blockquote> Indonesia to Tighten Crypto Oversight <p>According to the latest media reports, Indonesia plans to grant crypto regulatory oversight to the Financial Service Authority (OJK) from Trade Ministry and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency to better protect investors.</p><p>The new plan, which would regulate and supervise all digital asset-related activities in Indonesia, was presented by Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the country’s finance minister, as part of financial sector legislation currently being debated in parliament.</p><blockquote>“We need to build a mechanism of supervision and investor protection that is quite strong and reliable, especially for investment instruments that are high risk,” she told a parliamentary hearing.</blockquote><p>The bill was submitted in September and will be enacted into law once greenlighted by the legislative and executive branches.</p> FTX Collapse could be “Catalyst” for Regulation: SEC Commissioner (<a href="https://www.techinasia.com/retail-investors-barred-borrowing-crypto-mas-draws-tentative-measures">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The much-publicized collapse of centralized crypto exchange FTX and the subsequent filing of bankruptcy may be the wake-up call US lawmakers need, said SEC commissioner Hester M.&nbsp;Peirce.</blockquote><blockquote>While the incident has brought much negative attention to the crypto industry, this act as a “catalyst” that will compel government agencies to “sit down” and create clear and “more comprehensive” regulations, she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>According to her, if the SEC and CFTC work together, the difficulty of regulating crypto can be solved more efficiently as “having one regulator devoted to crypto could be problematic.”</p><p>Peirce suggested that crypto and the underlying blockchain technology could be “integrated into the back end of the financial system,” which requires SEC jurisdiction.</p><p>“The SEC would be a good regulator for spot crypto markets if we got our act together,” she&nbsp;said.</p> FATF Push for “Travel Rule” Implementation (<a href="https://twitter.com/fatfnews/status/1229327843932430336">Image Source</a>)<p>With India ready to host the “No Money For Terror” meeting on November 18–19, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is urging countries to implement the crypto Travel Rule to prevent the misuse of virtual assets by terrorist groups.</p><p>The upcoming meeting will focus on the misuse of virtual assets and crowd-funding platforms, as well as encourage strong cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs) to improve the sharing of information.</p><p>The Paris-based financial watchdog recently warned that the implementation of its standard is “going far too slowly.” Out of over 200 countries, only 60 have started to regulate and supervise crypto, while more than 50% “have not even started the process,” said FATF vice president Elisa de Anda Madrazo during the CTC meeting in New&nbsp;Delhi.</p><blockquote>“This is very concerning because while standards take time to be implemented, there is a sense of urgency here. Until most countries implement these new rules, it will not be possible to start implementing the travel rule,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1562430776326508544?s=20&amp;t=r5jER9JyQxGazRPmVlv5mQ">Image Source</a>)<p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope. This offer will remain valid until December 31, 2022, or till the VASP exhausts its SHFT&nbsp;grant.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Mydex CIC is delighted to say the company has now been awarded a Framework Contract by the UK’s Crown Commercial Services for its G-Cloud public services procurement platform.</p> What is&nbsp;G-Cloud? <p>G-Cloud is a framework by which public and third sector organisations can quickly and easily procure pre-vetted, pre-certified cloud-based solutions. It addresses a fundamental problem facing public and third sector organisations: the extremely high cost and complexity of finding and sourcing technology=based solutions that fit their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Current procurement processes create huge amounts of friction, effort, risk and cost. (We call it FERC). An organisation wanting to procure a tech-based solution has to invest much time and effort writing a specification. They then have a lengthy process by which the spec is published, bidders send their bids in, and where the organisation has to invest more time and effort assessing the merits and pitfalls of each&nbsp;bid.</p><p>Once a potential supplier has been chosen, lengthy negotiations can follow, including about price and associated legal terms and conditions.</p><p>Sometimes the costs of going through the procurement process are as big as the size of the contract that’s been awarded. Overall, the process can result in an absurd amount of wasted time, money and&nbsp;effort.</p><p>G-Cloud strips much of this FERC away. Thousands of suppliers are listed on the platform and their services are searchable. Services are broken down into modules with fixed, public, pre-set prices, and the procuring organisation can mix and match the modules they need to address their particular problem or requirement. All suppliers are pre-vetted and pre-certified, with standardised legal contracts.</p><p>Out go the laborious tasks of spec writing, bid assessments and bespoke contract negotiation. What previously took many months (and huge amounts of time and effort) can now be successfully completed in&nbsp;weeks.</p> Mydex’s G-Cloud solutions <p>All of the Mydex solutions listed on the latest G-Cloud framework continue the theme of FERC busting — of taking friction, effort, risk and cost out of the collection, sharing and use of data to deliver better services and lower cost. Each solution can be procured separately, on a modular&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Organisations interested in seeing and sourcing these solutions need to register on the Public Procurement Gateway, but what follows is a brief description of what is now available to procure ‘off the&nbsp;shelf’.</p> Personal data or attribute store <p>At the heart lies the Mydex personal data or attribute store which provides the citizen with a secure vault to store their information. It is the individual’s secure digital filing cabinet, designed to support them in any aspect of their life, for their entire life. Its data schema are infinitely extensive and it supports self-asserted, self-collected and verified data, including certified copies of proofs issued by third party authorities, in any data format. It provides the citizen with unique encryption with a private key that remains under the sole control of the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>Data can be delivered to this vault via APIs or entered directly, making it portable and exportable under control of the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>Left alone, the personal data or attribute store is a purely private digital filing cabinet. Only the individual can look into it or use it, for example, to bring different data points together and to view them in different ways to provide insights and different perspectives on their&nbsp;lives.</p> Secure attribute exchange&nbsp;platform <p>But coupled with the secure attribute exchange platform it transforms the ways in which service providers and citizens do business with each other. With it, service providers can safely, easily and efficiently deposit data into the individual’s personal data store (via secure APIs), and individuals can share data held in their personal data store with service providers (automatically translating data from one format to another as necessary).</p><p>By enabling citizens to provide pre-verified proofs-of-claims e.g. age, benefits, right to work, identity it helps eliminate form filling and strips out multiple costs for service providers in collecting and checking data. It operates very much like a line rental on a phone network. Subscribers pay a connection fee to access the service, and there are no transaction fees on&nbsp;top.</p> Identity as a&nbsp;service <p>Mydex’s identity as a service gives individuals a unique identifier, which remains under their control, by which they can verify their identity and access services.</p><p>Two key benefits of the Mydex approach are that it avoids the fragmentation that occurs when multiple different service providers each try to provide individuals with their own separate identities (the Mydex ID works for all subscribers), while also avoiding the privacy bleed that takes place when individuals use single sign-on tools provided by commercial digital platforms. It meets all Government and security standards, and provides the citizen with an identity for&nbsp;life.</p><p>It can be integrated into any environment supporting open standards and protocols and can support a range of multi-factor authentication mechanisms, profile management, identity assurance and age verification to meet diverse needs. Service providers control the end to end journey of registration and authentication and can elect to extend the scope of a service to include profile sharing and passing of personal data into online transactions.</p><p>Mydex provides a range of additional modules that address many other service&nbsp;needs.</p> Inclued platform <p>Inclued is a citizen and community engagement platform which turns traditional engagement processes on their heads. Under the traditional approach, organisations offering a service seek to publicise this service to potential users in multiple ways, by publishing information about the service on their website, for example. Potential users then have to go searching for the services they need and, if (at last) a fit is found, they then have to go through the often-laborious process of making an application, providing eligibility, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>With Inclued citizens can publish an anonymised profile providing details about themselves. Service providers can search these profiles, and send messages, including offers and incentives to join or take part and notifications, via a web app. This greatly reduces service providers’ costs of ‘going to market’ while citizens can sit back and let the right services come to them. The same platform can be used to recruit communities to take part in projects.</p> Web app generator as a&nbsp;service <p>The Inclued interface is an intuitive, easy-to-use web app that can be accessed from anywhere, via which citizens receive invites to any services from subscribers. Web apps are like the apps made available by digital platforms like Apple or Google, except that they are not dependent on these platforms for access, and can be accessed by anyone able to use a web&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Unfortunately few public or third sector services currently use web apps because of the cost and complexity of building them. As a result, many services still rely on paper or online forms, which means the ‘last mile’ of service provision remains undigitised, and therefore costly and inefficient.</p><p>Mydex’s Web app generator as a service lets non-technical front line service providing teams to define the service they are trying to deliver, including the information they need to collect and provide and to use the resulting requirements and service ‘map’ to automatically generate a web app at a fraction of the cost of traditional approaches.</p><p>The web app generator has built-in compliance to all UK Government service design manual guidelines and Digital First Service Standards and allows different roles for different team members e.g. story mapper, journey builder, administrator, content editor and deployment manager. All data required and generated by the resulting web app automatically flows into (and comes out of) the individual’s personal data, thereby protecting their privacy and keeping them in&nbsp;control.</p> Cluster Collaboration Platform <p>The Cluster Collaboration Platform meanwhile enables front line service teams that need to work with others from different organisations to safely and easily share the data they need to share in order to provide the best possible service to the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>People have spent many years and huge amounts of time, money and effort trying to solve the governance conundrums of the inter-organisation sharing of personal data. Every time, it has resulted in a complexity catastrophe. By putting citizens’ personal data stores at the heart of the data sharing process, the Cluster Collaboration Platform sidesteps these complexities, enabling organisations across varying sectors and regulatory environments to work together to deliver joined-up services to individual citizens, with GDPR compliance and ethical governance of data&nbsp;assured.</p><p>Services operate via secure API’s with the service providers back end systems sending and receiving personal data. Service providers may create specific web applications or native applications for citizens to use that to provide an integrated view of a&nbsp;service.</p><p>As a collaboration platform, it enables multiple low-cost community based, community driven, local services.</p> Consent Management and GDPR Compliance Service <p>Mydex’s Consent Management and GDPR Compliance Service gives service providers a set of tools and utilities that enables them to meet their legal data protection obligations and to use this process to both cut the costs of compliance and build better working relationships with service users. An important part of the service is efficient mechanisms for when individuals assert their legal rights, for the right to be forgotten or for subject access requests, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Service providers may create defined use cases for data usage sharing to support one or more services, these are added to the platform. When a citizen signs up for a service they formally approve the data usage and sharing. Consent Management enables organisations to integrate seamless consent journeys into existing services, with consents being formally recorded for both the citizen and the service provider. Individuals are equipped with a consent management dashboard for the use of personal data across any&nbsp;sector.</p> Master Reference Data&nbsp;Service <p>But not all services need to access and use only personal data. Very often, the most value is created when an individual’s personal data is linked to other non-personal data such as a directory of services that may be relevant to that individual. Mydex’s Master Reference Data Service addresses a long standing problem that all public/third sector organisations are faced with: how to access accurate and timely reference data — look-up tables that they can rely on, whether it is postcodes or directories of service providers.</p><p>At the moment they do this by accessing downloadable files or visiting websites. But they then have to integrate this information manually into any apps or services that they build. Often, they pay multiple times to access the same reference data because it is being used for different services.</p><p>The Mydex Master Reference data service provides a set of canonical lists that are drawn from authoritative sources and maintained by Mydex which manages all the updates behind the scenes. This greatly reduces the friction, effort, risk and cost of accessing accurate authoritative reference tables.</p> Orientation, planning and implementation services <p>Organisations using these services may need some help in terms of orientation, planning and implementation, so there are also specific G-Cloud modules for both the Mydex and Inclued platforms.</p><p>Key elements of these services include discovery and scoping (e.g. use cases, data requirements, stakeholder analysis etc), provisioning, configuration, sandbox testing and live operational deployment.</p> Conclusion <p>New, better citizen-empowering ways of collecting and using personal data are making dramatic improvements in service productivity and quality possible, aiding citizen access and inclusion and resulting in greatly improved outcomes.</p><p>But it has often been hard for service providers to implement these solutions. Traditional public and third sector procurement and project management processes were so complex and time consuming that many were put off even trying. It’s as if, instead of being able to pop out to a local shop to buy a pint of milk, if we wanted a pint of milk we had to tend the cows and venture into fields to milk them ourselves.</p><p>Complexity and effort is a barrier to getting things done. Procuring services like those offered by Mydex should be as quick, easy and simple as buying a pint of milk. G-Cloud is a great step forward towards this goal. We look forward to see how it evolves over the coming&nbsp;years.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/making-better-easier-bc8690ca77d0">Making ‘better’ easier</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

             November 2022   
	 
		 
			 5 years of hard work pays off as the tokenization wave begins 
<p>In October, we celebrated our 5th birthday in Luxembourg. Since our inception, we have progressed from a startup to a global leading tokenization solution provider, recognized and trusted by institutions. It was important to us to acknowledge the great work the team has done, so we took three days to meet and celebrate in person with teammates and partners. Let me share with you how we started and where we are heading to.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 🥚 Born out of the ICO boom, with compliance and real world assets in mind 
<p>2017 was the first crypto boom. It demonstrated that public blockchain had the potential to change the financial world. We had the vision to bring real world assets and financial securities to this shared IT infrastructure to make finance more transparent, real-time, and accessible. Tokeny was founded the same year and started to propose solutions for projects raising funds on blockchain.</p>
<p>We successfully provided software tools to onboard thousands of investors within minutes and to automatically reconcile their payments on the blockchain in order to mint their utility tokens. This demonstrated the power of smart contracts and that a good UX for investors was possible. In 2019, we’ve secured fundraising from Euronext, the largest stock exchange group in Europe, allowing us to develop a complete set of tools for financial actors to easily adopt the technology.</p>
 ⛓ Creating the open-source security token standard ERC3643 
<p>Tokenization relies on smart contracts to represent assets on blockchain. Upon reviewing all existing smart contract standards, we realized that no existing token standard was ensuring compliance properly for tokenized securities. Compliance validations were relying only on wallet addresses or on the software database. In addition, key features for agents were missing (recovery of assets, batch operations, etc.).</p>
<p>To this end, we created the open-source security token standard, <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643/">ERC3643</a>, using an identity-based compliance approach to ensure on-chain compliance. Also, more than 120 functions of control were added. Now, ERC3643 is becoming the market standard for digital securities as it is adopted by large financial institutions and governments.</p>
 🎛 5 years of investment to build solutions covering the whole value chain 
<p>ERC3643 is open-source, anyone can freely use it. However, managing smart contracts can be very cumbersome. Issuers and their agents need a robust operating platform to manage their tokens and investors in a secure and efficient way.</p>
<p>The platform needs to scan the blockchain in real time, reconcile blockchain and investors’ data, and allow smooth blockchain-based operations via user-friendly interfaces. In addition, it needs to include more sophisticated functionality such as token recovery, permission delegation, cross-chain capability, and more. After years of development and optimizations, we now offer our customers with complete, compliant and <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9q9VB-Z_GLmcek1_W2j5i6HH9yCdsSSie6y30XwGCXcW5Rd3W-55eiiVwCAcOLTNSFQPE8">white-label solutions</a>, covering the entire tokenization value chain.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Our hard work is paying off as we are signing large institutions and riding the wave of tokenization. Institutions are realizing that building a platform takes time, is costly, risky, and could prevent them from accessing an interoperable ecosystem of applications and providers. The time to market is the main element to consider for institutions, and our suite of tools allows them to quickly adopt the proven standard to offer blockchain-based services for their investors.</p>
 🌐 Growing the ecosystem and preparing for institutional DeFi 
<p>Asset issuers and service providers (custodians, KYC providers, data oracles, liquidity providers, DeFi protocols, etc.) are now joining the ERC3643 ecosystem. Issuers immediately access hundreds of service providers, while service providers can offer services to any issuer in the ecosystem. We act as an ecosystem facilitator, ensuring that the technology stack remains interoperable and compatible with all major players of the market.</p>
<p>As the ecosystem grows, all the elements needed for institutional DeFi are coming together: higher quality of tokenized assets, valuation oracles, compliant DeFi protocols, DINO distribution networks for liquidity providers, etc. Our team is ready to assist any players in accessing institutional DeFi, and we expect it to be the next big thing in the tokenization industry.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of our journey, stay tuned for more exciting updates.</p>

 Updating Onfido’s ID capture experience to help people submit high-quality photos of their identity documents  Overview  Context <p>At <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a>, we help protect businesses against fraud by verifying their customers’ identities. This process requires users to take a photo of their identity document and a selfie. Once submitted, machine learning algorithms check both are genuine and match the selfie to the photo ID to verify them. To do this, most users provide their photos using our <a href="https://onfido.com/solutions/smart-capture-sdk/">Smart Capture SDK</a>, a drop-in set of screens customers integrate into their&nbsp;app.</p> Problem <p>Users frequently submit low-quality photos of their IDs. Low-quality photos make it harder for us to verify their identity, which often means they can’t access our customer’s services. These failed verification attempts cost our customers time and money as their would-be users must try again or give up and drop off entirely.</p> Goals <p>Our goals for this project were&nbsp;to:</p>  Help people provide high-quality photos of their IDs using our iOS and Android&nbsp;SDKs.  Increase the number of people who get verified on their first&nbsp;attempt.  Decrease the number of verifications that fail due to ID-related image quality&nbsp;issues.   Team <p>I led the design process and was responsible for running usability testing. My team included:</p>  1 x Product Designer&nbsp;(myself)  1 x Product&nbsp;Manager  1 x Engineering Lead  3 x Engineers (1 iOS, 1 Android, 1&nbsp;Backend)  1 x User Researcher  1 x Applied Scientist  1 x Data&nbsp;Analyst   Process  Discovery <p>Through our data and user research, we discovered that:</p>  Despite the SDKs already having blur detection, blurry photos were still getting submitted.  The most common image quality issues responsible for failed verifications were blur, glare or essential parts of the ID getting cut off (such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport">MRZ</a> on a passport photo&nbsp;page).  When reviewing a photo, ‘submit photo’ was always the primary button. Because of this, people often submitted photos inattentively, even when their details weren’t clear. They expected the SDK to tell them to retake their photo if it wasn’t good&nbsp;enough.  Due to the personal nature of identity documents, most users wanted to review their photos before they submitted them.   Exploration <p>I explored a number of different ways to prevent users from submitting low-quality photos, from automating the review step to capturing a video and using machine learning to select and enhance the best&nbsp;frames.</p><p>After discussing the pros and cons of each with the team, we decided on a dual approach. We’d use machine learning algorithms to detect the most common image quality issues and provide instant feedback to users during a smarter review step. With this approach, we’d be able to let users know if there’s an issue with their photo and how to fix it in real-time before submission.</p> Technical approach <p>Introducing these new algorithms meant choosing whether to have them as part of the SDK or Onfido’s backend. We decided the backend would be best as we’d be able&nbsp;to:</p>  Use the same solution across platforms instead of needing to create different algorithms for iOS and&nbsp;Android.  Improve existing algorithms and introduce new ones to detect other issues (e.g. expired documents) without having to release a new version of the SDK each&nbsp;time.  Use more powerful algorithms and not be constrained by the SDK’s file&nbsp;size.  Build on top of the Web SDK’s existing Image Quality Service&nbsp;(IQS).  <p>To accommodate this approach, I updated the user flow. Photos are now uploaded to the backend before users review them so that the algorithms can flag any issues&nbsp;first.</p> Validating our&nbsp;approach <p>I created some prototypes and ran two rounds of usability testing on the review step, each with ten participants. By changing the primary button to ‘retake photo’ when an issue is detected, users found the review step “makes more sense as it advises you what do&nbsp;to”.</p><p>We also ran an A/B test to measure the effectiveness of the new algorithms. The results showed a 16% decrease in identity checks that failed due to image quality issues. We also saw a 2% increase in the number of people successfully verified.</p> Solution <p>With the new algorithms, the SDKs give users feedback during the review step if there’s a problem with their photo. If an issue such as a blur is detected, ‘retake photo’ is the primary button. If the photo is ok, then ‘submit photo’ is. This change steers users to retake their photo when needed whilst still allowing them to review it themselves, providing more clarity without compromising control. To prevent users from submitting photos we know aren’t good enough, we also now hide the submit option if an issue gets detected on their first&nbsp;attempt.</p> Impact <p>This project was a success on multiple&nbsp;fronts:</p>  We released a new version of the SDK with the changes on iOS and Android. They’re now used by millions of people each month to submit photos of their&nbsp;IDs.  We’ve seen a decrease in the number of verifications that fail due to ID-related image quality issues and an increase in the number of people verified on their first attempt since this change. Both have helped contribute to improved customer conversion rates.  We put the foundation in place for the team to improve existing algorithms and introduce new ones without having to release a new version of the SDK each&nbsp;time.  <p>Since finishing this project in late 2021, the team have made several improvements, including releasing an improved glare detection algorithm. The foundation we put in place meant we could deliver these improvements to users and start seeing results without relying on customers to adopt the latest SDK&nbsp;version.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/helping-people-verify-their-identity-first-time-bc27587907b">Helping people verify their identity first time</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Passwords have been around since the dawn of the digital age and today are a part of our daily routines.

<p>Passwords have been around since the dawn of the digital age and today are a part of our daily routines. Surveys have shown that the <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">average person has 100+ passwords</a>, and it’s only logical that the number will increase as more applications and services emerge. But who really wants more passwords?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passwords are a great source of frustration for users. The rules behind them continue to get more complex and cumbersome. That in turn leads to more password resets, which require extra steps. In fact, a study of US consumers showed that on average, a <a href="https://www.iproov.com/blog/16-online-purchases-abandoned-every-year-by-the-average-consumer-due-to-password-frustration">consumer abandons 16 online purchases a year</a> due to password frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passwords are probably adding friction to your sales process and affecting your business from capturing revenue. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason passwords exist is, of course, security. However, the truth behind the effectiveness of passwords is much different. As we have seen time and time again in various high-profile breaches, passwords offer little resistance to malicious actors. Passwords are the most popular and frequent target for hackers looking to steal data or gain remote access.</p>

DF11&nbsp;Details <p>DF11’s reward function and parameters are identical to those of DF10 and&nbsp;DF9.</p><p>DF11 is part of DF Beta. DF Beta’s aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology. DF Beta may run 10–20 weeks. In any given week of DF Beta, total budget may be as low as 10K $OCEAN or as high as 100K&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p><p>Some key&nbsp;numbers:</p>  Total budget is 50K&nbsp;$OCEAN  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (25K $OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (25K $OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.  <p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behavior. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Further Reading <p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Data Farming Series</a> post collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

  Media reports were abuzz this week with news around FATF’s decision to penalize countries that haven’t yet implemented the agency’s proposed guidelines on crypto anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF).  However, it turned out to be a speculation, and nothing more, as a FATF spokesperson denied any changes to how the agency graylists countries or tracks cryptocurrencies.  Although global regulatory response towards cryptocurrencies is still evolving, authorities worldwide have started preparing to bring the nascent assets within the regulatory net.  <p>According to an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/11/7/countries-to-face-grey-list-for-shunning-crypto-guidelines">Al Jazeera report</a> dated November 7th, the global financial watchdog, FATF, is preparing to conduct annual checks. It aims to ensure countries are enforcing the anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) rules on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in their jurisdictions.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/mrlegendcrypto/status/1589989723644493825?s=20&amp;t=GsYvJ4BOePwDW4q00AUUWw">Image Source</a>)<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has no enforcement powers and mostly relies on governments to enforce its recommendations. However, countries that fail to comply risk serious reputational harm, which could halt investment flows and access to the global financial system.</p> Annual Reviews vs. Evaluations <p>Using annual reviews over reciprocal evaluations would allow non-compliant countries less time to implement FATF-set standards. This, in turn, will raise the risk of being added to the graylist.</p><p>The “gray” list refers to the list of countries the FATF deems as “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring.”</p><p>This list is different from the FATF’s blacklist, which relates to countries with significant strategic weaknesses concerning money laundering, including Iran and North&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>There are currently 23 countries on that list, including Syria, South Sudan, Haiti, and&nbsp;Uganda.</p><p>Crypto hotspots such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Philippines are also on the FATF’s blacklist. Still, according to the global financial watchdog, both countries made high-level policy commitments to working with the global financial watchdog to bolster their AML and CTF&nbsp;regimes.</p> FATF’s Denial (<a href="https://jessierlewis.com/customers-subconscious-desires/thats-not-true-gif/">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>However, the report was later refuted by the agency. A FATF spokesman told Al Jazeera that the regulatory body’s discussions are confidential and do not comment on media speculation.</blockquote><p>He reiterated that the organization has not changed how it tracks virtual assets or adds countries to its graylist.</p> Slow Implementation <p>In April 2022, the global financial watchdog reported that many countries, including those that had implemented VASP licensing regime, were in noncompliance with its standards for AML and&nbsp;CFT.</p> Current Outlook on Crypto Regulations (<a href="https://www.livemint.com/brand-stories/cryptocurrency-regulation-around-the-world-how-india-compares-11636355438835.html">Image Source</a>)<p>The global regulatory response towards crypto assets varies widely, with some countries adopting the new technology while others strictly or completely limiting its legal uses. But agencies have begun to look closely at cryptocurrencies and how they can fit them into existing financial regulations.</p><p>Overall, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and it will likely take some time before there is a clear global consensus on how to deal with&nbsp;them.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

   As we enter 2023, Gartner calls for convergence, resilience, and cost-effectiveness 

<p>In its new report, the 2022 Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management, Gartner® brings attention to the increasingly critical role of access management in the enterprise — along with the fact that it has become a prime target for attackers. The crux of the report reveals that modern threats and economic constraints demand more resilient and cost-effective access management.</p>

<p>It has become clear that enterprises need to evolve their CIAM and workforce strategies to reduce risk, create efficiencies, and support all their use cases.</p>

<p>In its Magic Quadrant report, Gartner provides a distillation of all its research on access management products, vendors, and industry trends. This year's report highlighted several trends, including the need for identity threat detection and response (ITDR) to protect against breaches caused by credential misuse, which now represent 40% of all breaches. Gartner also identified journey orchestration as a way to reduce risk, cost, and complexity. Weak and compromised passwords remain a huge threat, and Gartner called attention to the need for passwordless and phishing-resistant authentication. Finally, the report emphasized the need for converged platforms, which improve security and create cost efficiencies.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Zero Trust has been established as the guiding principle for cybersecurity. The “don’t trust, always verify” approach stands for methods that don’t rely only on singular security tools, such as the traditional network perimeter firewall, to keep attackers out. Instead, Zero Trust builds on layered security and repeated or &nbsp;continuous verification.</p>
<p>The concept of Zero Trust has evolved beyond a network perspective, restricting lateral movements of users once they have passed the firewall. It involves a broader model that looks at many different layers of access and permissions. Zero Trust spans identities, devices, networks, systems, applications, data, and software.</p>
 The Role of Identity in Zero Trust 
<p>Identities are where Zero Trust starts, with user authentication and with IGA (Identity Governance and Administration) solutions managing the user accounts and their entitlements, but also providing &nbsp;access governance capabilities, including regular review and recertification, making it a key component of a Zero Trust model. In the future, we expect – also following the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final">NIST Zero Trust concept</a> of policy-based controls – an uptake of policy-based, real-time enforcement and verification of access authorizations.</p>
<p>Zero Trust &nbsp;on ServiceNow Every IT environment must be protected against cyberattacks, and to achieve this, Zero Trust must become ubiquitous. ServiceNow, delivers a range of business applications on the platform to protect enterprises. With its capabilities &nbsp;for managing IT services and assets, as well as GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) and support for SecOps (Security Operations), it’s a smart way to start implementing Zero Trust with your existing IT Service Management (ITSM) investment.</p>
<p>The criticality of ServiceNow becomes obvious when looking at some of the use cases. CMDBs are an important repository when it comes to advanced device management in the context of Zero Trust. Device verification must build on valid information. With its ITSM capabilities supporting the management of employees, contractors, and partners and their entitlements, e.g., in manual fulfilment, ServiceNow also must be protected against fraudulent use.</p>
<p>There are various further use cases: &nbsp;</p>
 
 the role of CMDBs for delivering attributes that are used for defining entitlements, and for real-time authorization; 
 the integrated Risk Management capabilities; 
 the protection of workflows in Portfolio Management; and 
 IT and Security Operations, that is both a solution for better managing and protecting the IT infrastructure, and a potential attack target for taking control about large parts of the IT infrastructure. 
 
<p>ServiceNow &nbsp;requires &nbsp;strong identity management to govern users and their entitlements. This goes beyond the capabilities of ITSM solutions, such as ServiceNow, that are primarily focused on supporting manual fulfilment activities within IGA.</p>
 Zero Trust with ServiceNow and Clear Skye IGA 
<p>Clear Skye is an IGA solution built natively on ServiceNow. It utilizes a wide range of platform capabilities, such as the data model and database, workflows, and the ServiceNow user interface. While supporting a wide range of applications, a particular strength of Clear Skye derives from being native to the ServiceNow platform and the ability to manage identities and their access in this environment.</p>
<p>With that, Clear Skye provides an essential building block for enhancing Zero Trust to ServiceNow environments and beyond. It can protect both the various applications within the ServiceNow environment and other, external systems and applications via connectors.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right. Hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Robert MacDonald, our VP of Product Marketing. Robert, you recently went to the FIDO Authenticate conference. I want to chat with you about that. How was the event?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It was great. It was very well attended. It was in Seattle, so got a chance to go out west and attend the event. About 500 people or so. Very well organized, lots of really good presentations and met a lot of really good people while I was there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. Well, let’s take a half step backwards. I’m familiar with FIDO and you probably are, but for folks who are not familiar with the FIDO Alliance, can you talk about what it is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Sure. FIDO Alliance, it stands for Fast Identity Online. They’re a consortium that works at delivering a passwordless experience primarily for consumers. There is a workforce integration with them as well, but they’re trying to get customers secure access to things online is really their focus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, and step away from passwords. That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Your presentation was interesting. The title was what? Web 3.0? What was the title of your session?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it was How Web 3.0 Will Reshape Authentication was the presentation. Funny enough, like I said earlier, there was lots of presentations. Every presentation that I sat in on talked about passwords and talked about the timeline of passwords that the industry has gone through and how FIDO is going to help reshape that, which aligned very well into what my presentation got into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right, so let’s take this one step a time. Web 3.0. Just set the baseline. What is Web 3.0 or Web three?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it’s known as either of those things and it’s the next iteration of what the web is going to look like. Web one, back when you and I were less gray Michael, was static read only webpages. That was kind of 1900’s into the 2000’s. Then Web two came along, which is kind of what we’re really used to these days. That had a centralized information centric content way about it. That’s your Facebook’s, your LinkedIn’s, YouTube, TikTok, all those kinds of things. Now, Web three is the next iteration of how the web is going to work and that promises more user-centric, decentralized, secure, and funny enough, private engagement online. Now we know that privacy in general online is a bit of an issue as it stands currently, but all of that’s going to change with Web three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right, so how does Web three affect the future of authentication?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yes, that’s a good question. There’s a couple of things. From an authentication standpoint, what’s going to happen is that people are going to be more identifiable online. What I mean by that is that we’re going to have known identities as we’re engaging with people online. There’s going to be steps or processes involved where people will have a digital wallet and that digital wallet will hold their identity. That identity in that digital wallet will be used to authenticate people as we go forward in this new world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Let’s just be clear about something here. The web is still a place where people can behave anonymously. I mean, kind of like walking through a crowded stadium. You’re not declaring yourself to everybody you pass by, but in certain instances, people want to declare their identity when they access their bank account, for example. They don’t want other folks declaring an identity that will give them access to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>You’re talking about the digital identity for authentication or for logging in, correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s right. The digital identification for logging in and also just knowing who somebody is. If you look at the way in which identity is managed online now, all of these organizations own your identity. Facebook has an identity of you, Google has one, your bank has one, the government has one. Anywhere you’ve put in a username and password to some degree has a version of your identity, whatever that might be. That’s why you can log into things with your Facebook account or your Google account or your LinkedIn account as example, but they own your identity there and they monetize it in a lot of cases. That’s where the privacy concerns kind of come into play.</p>
<p>What’s going to happen now is that you are going to then own that identity and you’re going to choose to allow maybe Facebook or Google or somebody else to have access to it when you are authenticating. Instead of using the identity they’ve given you to log in, you’ll use your identity to log in where they’ve added, how would I say that? A debit card into your wallet. When you use your debit card to log into an ATM, that’s your identity to get that money out so they would put something into your wallet for you to be able to authenticate with your identity. Does that make sense?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, kind of, but we use the word identity a lot and I’m wondering why do I need an identity? I had passwords before. I’ll just use a biometric. Why do I need an identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, so I mean, identity, the way it stands now, it’s proof of possession. You have a username or yeah, proof of possession. You have something you know, you know the username and the password. Maybe you might get a one time password that goes along with that, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t really prove who you are when you authenticate into something.</p>
<p>What Web three is promising is that every time you now authenticate, I know that it’s Michael. It’s not somebody else using Michael’s username and password, it can only be Michael and I don’t want to say the seismic shift, but that’s the significant shift in all of this. It can only be the owner of that wallet which is cryptographically locked down. It has private and public. We won’t get into the background behind all of it, but at the end of the day, it can only be that person that owns the wallet that can authenticate and that’s really the big shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, so if it’s a biometric, then it’s tied to the person or to the identity, so to speak I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That’s correct. Absolutely, yep, that’s exactly right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, did you have a chance to sit in on other presentations at the event?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>I did. I got a chance to see a couple. I got a chance to see a bunch of them actually. It’s funny, almost every presentation had some sort of, I mentioned earlier a timeline of passwords and how passwords have been used over time and what we’ve done to try to mask or secure that password because as I mentioned earlier, all a password does is just it’s a proof that you know the password, it’s not a proof of who you actually are. The way in which that discussion was formulated was kind of fun to watch, especially based on what we do here at 1Kosmos. Everybody kind of started with that and where the future of FIDO and this identification online is going is exactly in our wheelhouse here at 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Well, I mean the password has worked for 60 some years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>60 years. Yeah, absolutely, 60 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>When you start to have 100, 150, 200 of these things, a little bit unwildly to private and-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>That was, not to interrupt you, but that was an interesting stat. There was, a CISO got on stage and said on average people have 140 credentials for digital assets that they need access to. Whether that be things that you do at work, things that you do in your personal life, all of the different apps you have on your phone that require a username and password, all the websites that you want to have access to, all the things you have access to at work. There’s a lot of credentials out there that really don’t prove identity of anybody at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, well, what were maybe one or two of the top questions that you were being asked when you were running through your Web 3.0 Presentation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, the one question I got asked was how does that wallet transfer itself as we go through different use cases? That was a great question. Specifically workforce and customer. How does that, is there two or do you just use the one? The reply to that is just like your wallet that you carry around in your pocket, it’s used the same way.</p>
<p>When you go and start at a new job, they’re going to ask for your identification so you can share that identification with a new employer to fill out your I9, I think you guys have in the US. We have similar things here in Canada as well, but you’re going to use that digital wallet for that. You’re also going to use it for when you go to apply for a new mortgage or a new loan for a car or just trying to get access to government services. That wallet’s going to be the digital format of what you use today in a real life format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Isn’t Apple doing things with a wallet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, so there’s lots of talk around the new passkey which is coming. Which is Google’s and Microsoft’s and Apple’s version of this kind of digital identity wallet. There’s lots of discussion around that. It’s still really early on. You’re going to have a public and private key that you can identify yourself in the Apple environment or the Google environment or the Microsoft environment. The issue as it stands right now because it’s so early on, is that that’s not interoperable. There’s a bit of a hurdle there where it works within their own ecosystem, but as soon as you step outside of that, well now I need new wallets again. That kind of defeats the purpose. That’s still early on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Was there any talk about the [inaudible 00:11:06] standards at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there was. Being able to prove identity with a high assurance, there was some discussion around that and how organizations are going to go about trying to implement that in a digital first environment. Again, still early on from a FIDO perspective in terms of how they’re going to integrate with that. We know here at 1Kosmos, we have certified ways of doing that right out of the gate.</p>
<p>By the looks of it, Michael, everybody’s starting to turn in that direction, but they’re still trying to figure out how it’s going to work, even though we already have a solution that will more than get people there. That’s why I had such a high, I did have a very high turnout for my talk, just as an aside, which was great. A lot of people came to listen to a marketing guy talk which was pretty surprising. At the end of the day, there were a lot of questions afterwards around how do I verify identity and what’s that process look like and how are you going to store the identities and things along those lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Well, we’re going to put that presentation on our website here with a full transcript shortly. I know FIDO has been at this for quite a while, at least 10 years or so, evolving along this journey. I’m sure we’ll be participating next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>We will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Looking forward to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, thanks for having me today. It was a great presentation. Lots of great feedback on it and go check it out on our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That’s awesome. I heard great things about it, Robert, good job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Thanks, appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Thanks a lot and have a good rest of your day.</p>

  <p>At ForgeRock, we have great respect for the Forrester Wave report due to its deep analysis, and we are thrilled to have been named a leader in their report, The<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022"> Forrester Wave™: Customer Identity and Access Management, Q4 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Forrester researched, analyzed, and scored customer identity and access management (CIAM) vendors based on a range of 22 criteria that represent important capabilities for enterprises evaluating CIAM for themselves. The research is intensive, including a detailed questionnaire, hours of live demos, multiple briefings, and customer interviews.</p>

<p>Because of the depth of the Forrester analysis, we are particularly proud to have earned the highest scores in both the current offering and strategy categories. The current offering category includes criteria such as data orchestration, users and roles, customer identity verification and registration, authentication methods, customer self-service, and reporting and dashboarding. The strategy category includes the criteria of product vision, execution roadmap, market approach, planned enhancements, supporting products and services, partner ecosystem, delivery model and commercial model.</p>

<p>About ForgeRock CIAM, the report noted, "The solution is a match for organizations that need to map complex-to-very-complex customer registration, authentication, and self-service workflows to a CIAM solution and have internal CIAM administrator expertise and staffing."</p>

<p>For us this description encapsulates exactly what we've aimed to do over the years with our CIAM solution — and it just continues to get better, with more robust orchestration, broad integrations, a range of authentication methods, and more.</p>

<p>This year, we introduced significant enhancements to our orchestration engine that make it easier to create user personalization and self-service. We also simplified authentication by extending the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard to enable passwordless and usernameless login, and we introduced behavioral analytics for authentication and authorization that enable customers to make smart, fast access decisions powered by AI.</p>

<p>As consumers spend more time carrying out digital interactions with brands, government entities, financial institutions, healthcare providers, and others, they have become far more sophisticated and they expect a personalized and secure online experience. Our focus has been to make it as easy as possible for our customers to deliver those experiences.</p>

<p>One customer, Partners Health Management, is using ForgeRock CIAM to create a 360-degree view of member information in order to offer more personalized care. They're using our single sign-on to bolster security and improve the experience for members and providers. Tracy Styles, Partners' IT Support Services Manager, wrote: "A primary advantage of ForgeRock is its ease of use. We considered several solutions on the market, but we found that ForgeRock was definitely the easiest to work with."</p>

<p>We know that large brands face stiff competition as they become increasingly digital, and user experience is a huge factor in their ability to acquire, engage, and retain customers. We've focused on delivering CIAM capabilities that provide highly personalized and secure digital experiences that increase customer satisfaction and build loyalty.</p>

<p>I encourage you to<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2022"> download the report</a> to understand the criteria for which Forrester evaluated the 15 CIAM vendors. The report distills many months of research into an easily consumable format with specific recommendations for availability, scale, and risk-based authorization, as well as the capabilities you may want to evaluate as you select a CIAM partner.</p>

<p>This interview is originally posted <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/interview-with-locke-brown-nuid/">on the PIA website.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/">PIA </a>sat down with Locke Brown, Co-founder and CEO of NuID. We spoke about the importance of Trustless Authentication, the issues surrounding the traditional online password, the future of NuID, and he gave some tips for staying secure online.</p> Private Internet Access: Hi Locke, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you got into cryptocurrency? <p>Locke Brown: I’m originally from Birmingham, Alabama. Then I went to school just outside of Los Angeles at Claremont McKenna College. I studied math and econ. I was the lunatic running around campus in 2013 talking about Bitcoin.</p><p>I’ve always been into computers, gaming, tech, not coding so much, although I have built a lot of websites when I was younger. Math, science, and econ are kind of my jam. I’ve always been into investing. In fact I also got my master’s in finance while I was at Claremont McKenna.</p><p>During college I did an internship at Google, and decided I wanted to go into finance following school. So I went and worked up in Seattle after I graduated in 2014, for Bill Gates’ private Investment office. It was pretty wild; I was a trader there for a couple years and then moved over to the private investment side.</p><p>The last year and a half or so that I was there, around 2016, myself and the COO started an internal blockchain working group because blockchain was kind of getting hot again. At that point, I had lost way too many Bitcoin, like online gambling and random stuff. Of course, it wasn’t worth as much as it is today. It’s worth noting that I mined Bitcoin back in my college dorm. I had one of the first ASIC miners, so I’ve always been into this space, and it was good to get back into the space and follow it more closely. It was also around that time that I started using PrivateInternetAccess, I had a dedicated IP back in 2016, so I thought it was cool when you guys reached out.</p> PIA: What motivated you to start NuID? <p>LB: I was thinking about digitizing things like real estate assets and car titles. Then I happened to meet this guy Nolan Smith through a mutual friend. He was a data scientist at Microsoft at the time. We met on a hike outside of Seattle, and we hit it off immediately. We ended up getting dinner and going down the rabbit hole. We spent a lot of 2016 in my basement, called it the cave. Just exploring a lot of stuff in the cryptography and blockchain world and stumbled into zero knowledge proof cryptography, which ended up becoming a large part of what we do in our core technology.</p><p>We had a lot of ideas, but for them to work we needed a certain type of distributed system. We also needed identity to be trusted, right? A better version of identity than what we have today, which is just create a username and password with every service you use and let it get hacked.</p><p>So we’re like, okay, authentication is the layer there that needs to be fixed really, because if you can authenticate yourself as me, then how can you ever trust the digital identity representation of me if someone else is going to authenticate that.</p><p>We had fortunate timing, pairing these two technologies that were relatively unheard of, or new at the time: distributed ledgers and zero knowledge proofs, and devised a protocol to what we said at the time was abstracting identity from the device to the individual. In January of 2017, we got connected with Professor Matthew Franklin at UC Davis. He’s a professor in cryptography, known for the Boneh-Franklin scheme of identity based encryption, and a ton of other stuff in public key infrastructure that we use today. In fact, PIA uses some of the technologies that he helped invent back in the day. So he ended up vetting and validating the kind of protocol we had devised. Later in January that same year, I think it was a Sunday night, I decided I had to go all in. I quit my job and filed the initial patent applications, and then founded the company NuID. A month later, I raised a small seed round, and the rest of his history. So that’s the abridged version.</p> PIA: What is NuID’s flagship product? <p>LB: One thing you might hear in Silicon Valley is fail fast, you know, break it and iterate. That does not work for authentication and identity. So, we were super meticulous and thorough, and it was all about doing it right, not quick. Despite what some people were pushing. Because, if authentication fails it’s over. You can’t fail once, right?</p><p>So, we released our product, Trustless Authentication, NuID’s authentication solution, which is a B2B SaaS product. It was and is a monthly subscription API plugin for companies to completely replace their authentication workflow.</p><p>In the current user login experience, you can imagine you build an app or a website or what have you, that has users that need to log in. In today’s paradigm, the status quo is that you have the user put in a username, or an email address, and a password. Then that goes from their device to the server. Then if they’re decent, they would hash the password and/or encrypt it at the source and store it on a database. This way, the next time the user signs in and enters their credentials, it goes over their server, where it’s compared and if the passwords are the same, it checks out and logs you in, creating a session.</p><p>So that is, as we are all realizing, a huge problem for a number of reasons. Each of the servers have to store this big database of credentials. Now you have a huge target for hackers and people that compromise systems. And it can create this cascading snowball effect, because when that server is breached, 9 times out of 10, it’s a compromised credential that’s used to actually execute the breach, or hack it. For instance, with a big hack like LinkedIn, Twitter, or any of these big sites, other subsequent hacks are done because someone’s credential was found, and some admin was using the same password for his email or this or that site, and people reuse passwords.</p><p>NuID’s authentication system is designed to eliminate that workflow, and we have 57 claims patented on this in the US. It’s free to use, up to a point, and can be installed in under 30 minutes. It sits behind the log-in box, so as far the user is concerned, there’s no added friction, and their login experience doesn’t change. What happens on the backend is that when the user creates an account, they enter a username, password on their device. On that user’s device, that password is used to generate what’s called a zero knowledge proof. So, you can think about that as magic – I’m kidding, or half kidding. It’s basically a lot of math is done to it, right?</p><p>The password entered on the user’s device is deleted. It’s never transmitted over the internet to any server, and it’s not stored locally. The public reference parameter output from that then gets stored on a distributed ledger. We default to Ethereum, but it’s ledger agnostic and in the future we’re going to be coming out with the KiiChain ledger. We are actually launching the token Kii that underpins that. I won’t go into that right now. But the idea there is that this public reference parameter is decentralized and immutably stored. So that, you know, there’s no single party holding it.</p> PIA: Is NuID just for businesses or do you have a consumer product? <p>LB: We launched the beginning of the Nu Identity Ecosystem recently, and we’re gearing up for that. We’ll be launching our consumer products next year. It’ll be a credential wallet that allows users to manage their own credentials.</p><p>I like to say what we’re doing is making cryptography accessible to everyone. Right now, managing keys is difficult, right? I mean, if we use public key infrastructure, public private keys, for login, which we should, it’s a nightmare for people to manage and use that. For example, with a Bitcoin wallet it gives you that seed phrase that basically says if you lose your private key, you’re done, you’re X-ed out. Right?</p><p>That’s public key infrastructure for you. It’s not very forgiving. There needs to be a good way and a good interface for people, and that is what NuID is doing. We needed the enterprise solution first because, if I went out on the street three, four years ago, and said, “Hey, I’ve got this great new authentication solution, do you want to try it,” and you’re like, great, where can I use it, and the answer was nowhere, it’s not going to help you very much.</p><p>So, getting our protocol ingrained and used by services was step one. So we launched that a few years ago. And now like I was saying, we have a self-service developer portal for anyone who’s building an app or website, and they can go implement it for free, and play around with it.</p> PIA: Do you have any tips for the average person to protect their password? To increase their online privacy? <p>LB: The longer the better. A lot of times the websites will say, use a number, use uppercase, lowercase, and symbols, whatever. But the truth is, length is the biggest thing on your side.</p><p>Use different passwords for more important things. I’m not going to tell somebody to use different passwords for every account, because people have 50, 60, 70 different accounts, maybe even more now. I will also say this with a little asterisk, but use Password Managers like LastPass or 1pass. These are a godsend, we require everyone at NuID to use them. However, they perpetuate the problem, for sure, and they don’t solve anything real. So it can be pretty scary to have to trust them. That being said, they are a step in the right direction. The convenience you get is worthwhile, if you use it correctly, which means you use their auto secure password generator. You can use it to generate a random string of numbers, characters, and symbols that’s 32 digits long and they’re all different. So, if you’re going to use something like that, take advantage of the capabilities of the secure password generator.</p><p>Lastly, make sure you always have two factor authentication on that if that’s an option. So those are the biggest things. Otherwise, stay tuned to NuID and get a verified credential when we launch it in a few months.</p> PIA: Are you still involved in cryptocurrency? <p>LB: Yeah, in fact, we are about to be launching, five years in the making, our token Kii.</p><p>I still follow cryptocurrency. I’ve traded it a bit. I go in waves on how into it I am, depending on how busy I am. But ya know, I definitely follow it, I definitely stay abreast because it’s so relevant to cryptography. It’s worth noting as well that NuID credentials, because crypto is built on public key infrastructure, can serve as your private key to crypto assets.</p><p>So the NuWallet that we are going to be launching this next year will serve as not only a credential wallet, but your crypto wallet as well. Because your authentication credentials can secure any crypto asset. This is huge in cryptocurrency because you are your identity. You should have your assets follow you around, and only you should be able to authenticate those things.</p>

<p>At Spruce, we recently ran a survey to learn more about the type of applications web3 developers are building and what technology stacks they’re using. Our objective was to collect insights directly from the community to help inform some of our own building decisions we make at Spruce. </p><p>We received responses from over 40 individual developers building applications across various use cases. While we recognize this sample size is unlikely to be a representative sample of the overall web3 ecosystem, we found the results insightful from a high level and wanted to share some takeaways from the survey with the broader community. </p><p>To start, we looked to gather information about what developers are building and the core building blocks they are using to do so. We asked what type of apps developers are building and found the majority of applications being built are web apps, at 81%. </p>Note: some answers were directly user-provided<p>Next, we asked about the predominant languages used while building applications. Javascript and TypeScript took the lead, which makes sense as both are widely popular for web application development. These are followed by Python, Go, and Rust.</p><p>For quick bootstrapping of applications, we found that developers largely prefer React and Express as their frameworks of choice.</p><p>We also asked what chain developers are focusing their development efforts, finding the majority are building on Ethereum/EVM. Only 14% are building an application with multi-chain use cases. It’s important to note here, however, that we have close ties to the Ethereum community, so the participants who opted into this survey might not be representative of the entire broader ecosystem. <br></p><p>So far, we know that the majority of applications are web-based, using JavaScript/TypeScript, and built on Ethereum/EVM. </p><p>Next, we were curious - what are developers building? Web3 technology has the potential to disrupt many different industries, ranging from gaming to finance. We found that, according to our survey participants, most builders are creating applications for DeFi and NFT use cases.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how this distribution evolves as Web3 use cases for various industries mature.</p><p>Next, we asked how many of these applications required users to create accounts or sign-in in some way. We found that the overwhelming majority of applications do - over 90% require a sign-in. This is a powerful metric to inform our work in improving the experience of installing Sign-In with Ethereum into applications.</p><p>One of the powers of web3 yet to be unlocked in a meaningful way is the opportunity to bridge on-chain and off-chain data for customization and personalization of experiences. </p><p>While roughly ¼ of applications solely focus on on-chain data, the remaining ¾ have either solely off-chain or a mixture of off-chain and on-chain data that they need to manage. </p><p><br></p><p>We appreciate all the developers who participated in this survey and shared insights with us. We hope these high-level takeaways are insightful for other builders thinking about tooling and web3 developer experiences. </p><p>Furthering this work, we’re conducting additional research to gather feedback from developers who have either successfully installed Sign-In with Ethereum or have considered installing Sign-In with Ethereum into their application. If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you!</p><p>You can find the survey for feedback on SIWE <a href="https://bit.ly/siwe-survey">here.</a></p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

				 <p>Six years ago, Darrell posted the tweet below, and it’s still just as relevant today. If anything, it’s even more relevant now as organizations undergo digital transformations.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote><p>Control only what you must. Influence the rest.</p> — Darrell O'Donnell (ʎpoɹɐd) (@darrello) <a href="https://twitter.com/darrello/status/792496888444575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2016</a></blockquote>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Most companies now realize they need to digitize to remain competitive, but the question is how to do that. There’s no magic formula, and every organization is different, so it’s essential to focus on what you can control and influence the rest; rather than trying to control everything. This may mean working with other companies or institutions to advance their digital transformation goals. But ultimately, everyone must be moving in the right direction if these efforts are to be successful.</p>
<p>After all, you can’t force people or other organizations to change, but you can try to influence them.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Learn to Influence Others 
<p>Many believe controlling everything around them is the only way to success. However, this is only sometimes possible and is often not the most effective approach. Instead, focus on honing your ability to influence those around you. When you learn to influence others, you can achieve your goals without controlling everyone and everything around you.&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
 “Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement.” ― Daniel H. Pink 
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>It is natural to desire a particular outcome and then work to achieve it. Control can be advantageous, but it comes with a price tag that can eventually surpass justification. Trying to exert control over too much can cause one to lose control entirely; the amount of effort required to maintain control grows to exceed the ability to improve the situation.</p>
 Control Leads to Problems 
<p>The misplaced need for control leads to various problems, for instance:</p>
 
 Stifling Growth. Some environments need to be uncontrolled to grow. When a community expands, costs associated with maintaining control will eventually hinder further growth. 
 Community Suppression. When an individual place demands on an ecosystem, other community members will either step back to let them do things or back away from conflicting ideas. 
 Lack of Resilience. Rigidly controlled systems may be robust but will fail when conditions change, or control points are not fully understood. 
 
<p>The challenge with influence is that it is far less predictable than control. As a result, the rewards that come through influence can be incredible.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
 “Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It’s about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire teammates and customers.” — Robin S. Sharma 
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Control vs. Influence Example 




<p>Twitter is an excellent example of the effective use of influence and poor use of control.</p>
<p>Successful Influence – Twitter has exercised limited control while allowing the community to create new features. Retweets (RT) and direct messages emerged from the community – they merely made tools that helped users do what they already were doing. Arguably where Twitter acts to influence its community lightly, it grows.</p>
<p>Control Failure – In the early days of Twitter, the community expanded rapidly. Thus tools and apps were created and made Twitter grow faster. Then Twitter exerted control on an ecosystem and nearly died. Twitter was inconsistent and destroyed successful partners by limiting access and developing competitive features. This failure still impacts the Twitter community. Twitter’s CEO, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/21/9586084/jack-dorsey-twitter-ceo-apology-developers">Jack Dorsey, apologized in 2015</a>, and they continue to struggle to rebuild the developer community.</p>




 A Power Function 
<p>Influence is a power function – we can influence far more than we can control. It can help you to achieve your goals, build better relationships, and more. In many ways, Darrell’s philosophy is what guides successful digital transformations. By focusing on what you can control and influence, you can make changes that will ultimately benefit your organization. So if you’re embarking on a digital transformation, keep Darrell’s words in mind and focus on what you can control and influence the rest. It might just be the key to success.</p>

<p>In the digital age being able to prove who we determine our opportunities to establish trust with each other and carry out meaningful interactions. But the reality is that the existing models of exchanging information are inadequate in the context of this new era – one can reasonably say archaic, insecure, insufficient privacy protection, adds friction into interactions, and are largely inaccessible for over a billion people.</p>



<p>We need a system that will allow us to own and control our identity, reputation, capabilities, achievements, ownerships, and connections; securely and selectively disclose context-driven information to counterparties; access digital services; digitally sign transactions and documents, and prove who we are with any provider – online, on the phone or in-person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the frictionless future Dhiway aims to enable – an environment in which data can be easily shared across systems where trust in data is not brokered by intermediaries —as has been the case until now— but is embodied algorithmically in the data itself. Individuals and organisations can take back ownership of their information and control the flow as regards — who sees it, what they see, and when.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We all want to be in control of our data and manage who has access to specific information about us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CORD blockchain project from Dhiway combines distributed ledger technology with the themes of privacy, trust frameworks, governance, unique persistent data identifiers, and information management protocols using cryptographic models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CORD is a Layer 1 blockchain designed to simplify information management, making it easier for owners to control; agencies and businesses to discover, access and use data to deliver networked public services. It provides a transparent history of information and protects it from unauthorised tampering from within or without the system. CORD creates new possibilities for addressing trust gaps, managing the authenticity of transactions, and exchanging value at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CORD shifts the lens from the information a siloed application holds to the cross-entity history of transactions backed by the information. Transaction details are shared and updated in near real-time across the network. CORD does not store personally identifiable information (PII) or the business data linked to the transaction on the chain. Digital transformation initiatives are augmented through the combination of verifiable digital identities linked with verifiable credentials. The individuals who are the holders of the data records can now receive, manage and share the records based on requests from verifiable sources and determine when and how to fulfil the request.</p>



<p>Enterprises can now use an existing <a href="https://cord.network/">utility network</a> built using CORD or create a new network to integrate applications or services that complement and upgrade current practices. The utility network model of CORD supports the potential to catalyse exceptional levels of innovation in both existing and emerging industries, from conducting transactions and maintaining records across many sectors of the economy such as finance, trade, health, energy, water, agriculture, education and many more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CORD is an essential building block of Web 3.0 with its ability to reimagine real-world interactions that best fit a particular purpose, balancing security and control with the convenience and opportunity of sharing data between institutions and individuals. The potential this creates for new business models is endless.</p>



 



 The technology will continue to evolve over the coming years, and for that reason, this overview should be considered as the start of the conversation on how we can all work together to reimagine industries, rebuild financial processes, and build markets once considered improbable or unprofitable. Together, we can drive the long-term development and adoption of the technology and capitalise on the economic and social opportunities it offers.

The data feed returns the most recent 500 hours of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) history of ETH/USDT, from&nbsp;Binance.</p><p># get the&nbsp;data</p><p>url = ‘https://cexa.oceanprotocol.io/ohlc?exchange=binance&amp;pair=ETH/USDT&amp;period=1h'</p><p>df = pd.read_json(url)</p><p>df.columns = [‘dt1’,’open’,’high’,’low’,’close’,’volume’]</p><p># convert to&nbsp;UTC+0</p><p>a = [dt.fromtimestamp(x/1000) — relativedelta(hours=6) for x in&nbsp;df.dt1]</p><p>df[‘dt1’] =&nbsp;a</p><p>df.to_csv(‘data/ETH_USDT_free.csv’, index =&nbsp;False)</p><p>df.set_index(‘dt1’, inplace =&nbsp;True)</p><p>print(df.shape)</p><p>display(df[-3:])</p><p>_ = df[‘close’].plot(figsize =&nbsp;(10,4))</p><p>As shown above, the contestant here converted the time to UTC+0 timezone as per competition guidelines.</p><p>Step 2 — Functions &amp; Models&nbsp;Training</p><p>Once the training data was collected and polished and/or augmented [Related:<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/value-creation-across-data-pipelines-75c66b0878cf"> Value from data pipelines</a>] the next step was to identify the best prediction algorithm to use for predicting ETH&nbsp;price.</p><p>There are different types of machine learning algorithms, such as regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM) and more. Each algorithm has its own benefits and drawbacks. In this specific case, the contestant examined 3 different algorithms: exponential smoothing, last available value prediction and prophet&nbsp;model.</p><p>To evaluate the accuracy of each model, the following metrics have been used: NMSE (normalised mean squared error), MSE (mean squared error), MAE (mean absolute error), and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error).</p><p>def ts_metrics(y_true, y_pred):</p><p>return {</p><p>‘mae’: metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred),</p><p>‘mse’: metrics.mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred),</p><p>‘mape’: np.mean(np.abs((y_true — y_pred) / y_true)),</p><p>‘smape’: np.mean(np.abs( 2*(y_true — y_pred) / (y_true+np.abs(y_pred)))),</p><p>‘nmse’: np.sum((y_true — y_pred)**2) / np.sum((y_true)**2),</p><p>}</p><p>To run the analysis, the contestant selected picked one day as an evaluation set and used the data before that day for training. Then, to the training model one more parameter was added called “hours_skip” — this is the number of last values that needed to be excluded from the training&nbsp;set.</p><p>As shown in the picture below, Prophet resulted to be the most accurate model and so it was chosen as the prediction algorithm for this challenge.</p><p>Step 3 — Final Predictions &amp; Exploration</p><p>Now that the model has been tested and no relevant drop in quality was identified when using the provided dataset, the contestant proceeded with using the<a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet"> Prophet</a> model and added the following parameter:</p><p>m = Prophet (weekly_seasonality=True, daily_seasonality=True)</p><p>from prophet import&nbsp;Prophet</p><p># 1) prepare dataframe</p><p>x =&nbsp;df.close</p><p>x = x.reset_index()</p><p>x.columns = [‘ds’,’y’]</p><p># 2) build&nbsp;model</p><p>m = Prophet(weekly_seasonality=True, daily_seasonality=True, )</p><p>m.fit(x)</p><p># # 3)&nbsp;predict</p><p>t1 =&nbsp;50</p><p>df1 = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=t1, freq=’h’)</p><p>df_out = m.predict(df1)</p><p># 4)&nbsp;plotting</p><p>_ = x.set_index(‘ds’).plot(figsize =&nbsp;(10,4))</p><p>_ = df_out.set_index(‘ds’)[‘yhat’].plot()</p><p>_ = _.legend([‘real’,’prophet’])</p><p>Finally, by running the command m.plot_components() we can see the overall trend that ETH is following, as well as check its price performance filtered daily and&nbsp;weekly.</p><p>Step 4 — Upload &amp; Publish Predictions via&nbsp;Ocean.py</p><p>It’s now time to use the Ocean.py library to publish the output of the model in a tamper-proof manner. For this we will start by publishing the prediction in a permanent decentralized storage using a convenient Python approach: a wrapper of Bundlr&nbsp;Network.</p><p># Put the csv&nbsp;online</p><p>from pybundlr import pybundlrfile_name = “output.csv”url = pybundlr.fund_and_upload(file_name, “matic”, alice_wallet.private_key)print(f”Your csv url:&nbsp;{url}”)</p><p>Once the prediction is uploaded onto Arweave via the Bundlr wrapper, we will then use the Ocean.py library to publish the asset as a data NFT on Ocean. This way, the prediction is recorded on the blockchain for the judges to make a tamper-proof audit&nbsp;trail.</p> Hypothesis &amp; Conclusion <p>While it is possible to analyse the historical price of ETH to find patterns and fit a price function, the normalized mean squared error tells us that we may miss the price by hundreds of dollars. This is due to several reasons such&nbsp;as:</p>  The model is too basic and it’s not calculating intraseries patterns.  Not enough data sources have been used in training the model. Metrics such as whale ratio or momentum factor could have been incorporated and provided further insights into the price movement.  External factors that are unpredictable may lead to over/underestimation of the price, making predictions always imprecise.  <p>Crypto price prediction can be an interesting and fun task, and it can produce more and more results when better features are implemented into our&nbsp;models.</p><p>This ETH predict challenge was the first of a long series of challenges. We aim to incentivise the community of data scientists to understand how to use Ocean.py to create value across data pipelines whilst, over time, increasing the accuracy of their predictions.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to democratise AI, break down data silos, and have open access to quality data.

<p>Recently, the concept of Web3 has become almost ubiquitous, as a variety of organizations have gone out of their way to promote it. When it comes to Web3, we have to talk about DID (decentralized identity). There has been a lot of discussion and analysis about the definition of DID and identity in general, and the techniques involved in establishing on-chain identity, and we don’t do too much more development here. Today, we will show you a different way of describing your identity in terms of identity&nbsp;use.</p><p>First, when it comes to identity, we mainly focus on two&nbsp;issues:</p><p>·How do you establish or describe your identity?</p><p>·How do you prove that the identity that you describe is&nbsp;you?</p><p>In the real world and Web2, we describe identity in roughly the same&nbsp;way.</p> Describing identity in the real world and in&nbsp;Web2 <p>In real life, the way you describe your identity may be to introduce yourself when you meet new people, it may also be a business card, a resume, or a more formal way to show your ID card or passport.</p><p>Identity in Web2 is easy to understand, and your google ID, twitter tag, and the KYC that you provide when signing up for an App account are all part of your identity. The way to describe your identity becomes the display page of your account, the self-introduction written on your home page, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>You can see that both in real life and Web2, the way to describe identity is mainly subjective.</p><p>For example, when looking for a job, you need to edit a resume that includes your name, age, contact information, and, most importantly, your past experience, learn to “polish” and express selectively, and use data to know you more positively. In addition to authenticity, you also need to “polish,” use selective expression, and use data to make recruiters think more about&nbsp;you.</p><p>As a result, recruiters now often need to do background checks on candidates to check the authenticity of their resumes, giving rise to a thriving industry called back-checking.</p><p>Whether in real life or in Web2, the same problem exists when describing and proving your identity — when you’re describing yourself, writing a resume, or trying to introduce yourself, you’re trying to figure out how to demonstrate your “best” self; After you describe your identity, others will have to verify your identity through a background check or by looking at supporting documents, adding costs to society and businesses.</p><p>But all this will be different in the Web3 era, and the way we describe identity will be completely reconstructed by the advent of decentralized technology.</p> Describing identity in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Due to the existence of blockchain and the application of the distributed ledger, in Web3, the behaviors of participants will be permanently and truly recorded, whose authenticity cannot be tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>So when looking for a job, you won’t need to write your own resume — your on-chain identity is a trusted collection of past on-chain behavior. Simply by sending a few of your usual decentralized data client addresses to recruiters, they can easily learn about your past on-chain behavior and extrapolate from that to your capabilities and experience.</p><p>In recent years, there is a growing trend for blockchain industry applicants who describe their identity in this way, and blockchain enterprise recruitment also prefers such a “resume” — — “when they have their own identity in the most popular platforms and data clients on a blockchain, and they use it frequently, their understanding of the industry will be deeper than the average person”, a blockchain enterprise HR&nbsp;said.</p><p>However, at the moment the advantages of this identity description are only known within the industry, and if you want to “get out”, appropriate tools to simplify data analysis are necessary. Below, we list several similar on-chain behavior analysis&nbsp;DApps.</p> Ape Board <p>Ape Board is a digital asset display product. If you input the address of the decentralized data client on Ape Board, you can see the past interactions of the address, the digital assets, and even the Profit &amp;&nbsp;Loss.</p><p>Investment is one of the best ways to realize personal cognition. Your investment income and the direction of the investment target reflect your personal cognition level of the industry and recent research efforts you have made. Of course, investment returns are influenced by many factors, and more information is needed to understand you more&nbsp;fully.</p> Cyberconnect HQ <p>In this project, you can see which NFT the target address holds, which POAP badges it has earned, and which articles it has posted on the Mirror. The accomplishments you have and the opinions you put out will become part of your identity, and people will be able to see you through those&nbsp;things.</p> Degenscore <p>Enter the centralized data client address into Degenscore, and Degen will generate a Degenscore based on on-chain behavior. The higher the score, the more involved and experienced you are in the blockchain field.</p><p>If you want to show that you are a blockchain industry veteran, your Degenscore will be the best proof, it will be far more persuasive than your subjective statement. People will be able to get a sense of who you are through intuitive scores.</p> OScore <p>OScore, the Ontology credit scoring system, is an on-chain credit score designed for programmable credit. Through the use of a variety of different on-chain interaction data calculations, it can show the user’s past credit status in the form of a&nbsp;score.</p><p>OScore provides a comprehensive picture of a user’s on-chain credit status, and also helps to predict a user’s potential credit risk. OScore analyzes your credit score for all your on-chain behaviors, making on-chain identity descriptions more diverse and&nbsp;rich.</p><p>Through the analysis of the above sites, the employer can intuitively understand how much energy and what kind of behavior the candidate has invested in the industry. Words and subjective descriptions can be deceptive, but actions do&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Of course, since Web3 is still in its early stage, the on-chain information is mainly the interactive on-chain data, and the on-chain behavior that can be analyzed is not enough. The above way of describing identity can only be limited to the blockchain industry at&nbsp;present.</p><p>But as the Web3 infrastructure builds and spreads, it’s reasonable to believe that the future will be an era where everything is connected, where all of your actions will become valuable, and your identity will be aggregated from all of your past on-chain&nbsp;actions.</p><p>When introducing yourself, you no longer need to use a resume, all of your past experience will be portrayed and represented by your on-chain behavior, and your identity requester(such as the recruiter) will no longer need to do a background check on you, because the traceability and Immutability of the blockchain is the best endorsement of your identity.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-tech-viewpoint-in-web3-the-way-of-describing-identity-will-be-completely-reconstructed-1d1d0fff8cc3">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | In Web3, the Way of Describing Identity will be Completely Reconstructed!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				<p>Trinsic’s <a href="https://trinsic.id/ecosystems-exclusive-platform-for-new-users/">next generation platform</a>&nbsp;delivers decentralized identity infrastructure that is not tied to a specific ledger. In the world of decentralized identity, this may seem like a surprise, but it’s actually a huge win for product developers.

				<p>At Trinsic, we prioritize building a platform that helps IDtech product builders to get significant end user adoption for their solutions. In order for any technology to reach mass adoption, it needs to be fast, cheap, and reliable. Most blockchains, at the moment, are often compromised on at least one of those characteristics, so we designed a solution that would be ledger agnostic.</p>

				<p>Keys and data are the underpinning of a decentralized identity system. While blockchains and cryptocurrency have brought more attention than ever to the idea of public/private keys, the concept of using these key pairs to prove who you are on the internet has been around since the 90s. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) used public private key pairs to encrypt and verify that an email was sent from a specific identity.&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic’s Approach to Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Current decentralized identity systems use decentralized identifiers, or <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">DIDs</a>, to establish and verify identities of the users exchanging information. Usually, a “flavor” of decentralized identity is tied to a specific DID method. For example, the Hyperledger flavor is tied to did:sov and did:indy methods. There are over 100 registered DID methods ranging from simple to extremely complex to implement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When developing the Trinsic Ecosystems platform, we wanted to use the simplest possible approach by default that would allow builders to layer in additional features and complexity as needed by use case. We use the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a> method which is a lightweight, ledger-less DID method allowing users to created decentralized identifiers without the need to pay ledger fees or wait for a blockchain.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Using Trust Registries and Verified Domains to Build Your Ecosystem 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trusted issuers are often the foundation of an ecosystem, acting as the source of the data inside wallets of the holders. For example, a trusted issuer might be a professional licensing entity who wants to issue verifiable credentials to people who obtain a certification. For an IDtech company who is building a trust ecosystem, you want it to be clear to the participants in your ecosystem that the issuers are trustworthy.</p><p><br>There are two ways you can create trust in Trinsic Ecosystems. The first is by implementing a <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/">trust registry</a> which outlines who can issue and verify certain credentials. For example, your trust registry could specify that only the DID of the professional licensing organization is allowed to issue a certification. Second, the licensing organization can verify their domain name allowing users to see that the credentials were issued by a trusted entity. The <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a> specification allows for this to happen in a standardized manner, creating outputs that are legible by any system abiding by the specification.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 When Might You Want to Anchor DIDs on a Blockchain?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While Trinsic Ecosystems is ledger-less by default, we provide the option to <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/concepts/dids/#upgrading-wallet-dids">upgrade DIDs</a> to a blockchain if this would be desirable for your use case. We currently support did:ion with plans to support many more DID methods in the near future. Here are a couple reasons you may want to upgrade DIDs to be anchored on a decentralized ledger:</p>
 
 If you value persistence and censorship resistance, both of which could be at risk if you tie a DID to a domain name 
 If you want to provide your users full ownership and portability of their identities<br> 
 
<p>Blockchains provide a level of censorship resistance, interoperability, and persistence that would not be possible if your identity were tied to something like a domain registrar. While upgrading a DID to a blockchain often has a small cost associated with it, the ledger fee could be a fraction of registering a domain name and paying a yearly fee.</p>
<p>In reality, most of the IDtech builders that utilize Trinsic are building products that do not require this level of persistence, censorship resistance, and ownership when they’re first starting out. Luckily, our platform was built in a modular way, so you can start building your solution quickly and simply, while maintaining the option to upgrade DIDs at any time.</p>

 	 Performance of blockchain-based solutions can be hit or miss. Depending on your choice of blockchain, you may end up with a costly or slow solution that is not ready for real-world implementation. 
 	 It might be easier to gain adoption if you’re using widely-accepted web standards instead of blockchains. This is especially true if the benefits of decentralization aren’t applicable to your use case. 
 	 Starting with a ledger-less solution allows you to have optionality down the line about how you roll out your solution. We are in the early days of seeing IDtech companies use web2, web3, and web5 technologies to solve identity problems. Building on Trinsic means you don’t have to pick a winner and can stay open as technology develops.

				<p>Using decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, you can create platforms, products, and experiences that incorporate varying levels of decentralization. The Trinsic Ecosystems platform was created in a modular way, so IDtech builders can tailor their solutions to the needs of their use case, without being locked into a particular technology stack.

  <p>For any large company, regulated or not, it is essential to have a mechanism or process for detecting vulnerabilities. For this purpose, various scanners exist that can automatically scan the company's IT assets for known and new vulnerabilities. However, this is where the big challenge begins: most scanners tend to find a large number of vulnerabilities. This is important and good, but not every vulnerability is equally relevant for every company.</p>
<p>Typically, most organizations drown quickly with the number of vulnerabilities they have. Different specific scanners for compliance, containers, source code, operating systems and applications deliver a hardly manageable number of different potential problems per asset.</p>
<p>For vulnerability management to work, you need to build a sustainable vulnerability management, define intelligent processes and specify intelligent bundling and prioritization.</p>
<p>In this presentation, Christopher Schütze will show how this was achieved in a successful project.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-schuetze-hick-sustainable-vulnerability-management"></a>

  <p>Over simplifying, IT security means defending the IT systems from threats procured by cybercriminals. Their targets are, for example, the manipulation of systems, the extorsion or exfiltration of data, and the interruption or alteration of services. However, what happens if we have humans instead of IT systems? Given that the scope of an attacker is always the same, as aforementioned, attacking a human is an entirely different process, and the attack tactics must change. This well-known fact involves social engineering and human sciences (e.g., psychologists or behavioural sciences instead of informatics). However, from the cyber security side of the coin, what does it imply dealing with humans? What does it mean, for example, to perform convincing penetration testing or vulnerability scanning to deeply test human weaknesses: it is not merely a problem of sending a phishing email and waiting for clicks. How can be done a threat analysis or threat intelligence on humans? Moreover, how can a company calculate the cyber risk that a human represents and how many effective ways to reduce it? If we fully put humans (either as employees or IT security operators) at the centre of cybersecurity, the questions become several.</p>
<p>The problem is complex because, by its nature, it is multicultural and requires different non-technical competencies. It includes experts in philosophy, political science, cyber sociology, pedagogy, acting performance, etc., collaborating with cybersecurity experts. Facing the human element of security is a genuinely multicultural and interconnected approach. Furthermore, humans are coincidentally “human” and not machines: there are also ethical and legal issues to consider, and their reactions change during the day. The talk will explore and present a comprehensive view of what happens when there are not the IT systems but the humans at the centre of cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-frumento-cybersecurtiy-human-element"></a>

  <p>When speaking about cybersecurity, Hollywood has made us think of hooded figures in a dark alley and real-time cyber defense while typing at the speed of light. However, proper cyber security means, above all, good, clean and clear security practices that happen before-hand and all day, everyday. This is particularly true for Identity and Access Management, which is a component of every domain within Cyber Security, and it's identified as a cause for more than 80% of data breaches. IAM is rarely about white-hat hackers counter-attacking an ongoing intrusion. It's mainly about a set of good practices, clearly defined processes and, overall, good hygiene in the way we manage our identities, our resources, our entitlements, and the way they relate to each other.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-loureiro-cyber-hygiene"></a>

<p>As always, best start with a plan, and with defined methods to evaluate the contribution of the various tools you have to your targets. The plan must help you in understanding which elements you need most for protecting your IT. On the other hand, you must understand how well your existing tools landscape contributes to this.</p>

  <p>Current frameworks from Cyber Essentials in the UK, to the NIST Cyber Security Framework, HIPPA, PCI-DSS and even ISO27002:2022 often take at least 18-24 months to agree by their governance bodies. The world is much faster moving that that, the fact many regulatory frameworks will take years before the kinks are ironed out demonstrate that they are good for what they were designed for at inception, but after that many of them do not keep up with the changing threats and risks enterprises face, let alone the real controls that are required to protect the enterprise. This is why they are more than often just a tick-box exercise for many enterprises. This session will demonstrate with an analysis of several standards and frameworks, that they are a great starting point if you don't know where to start, but if your really want to protect your enterprise you need to go beyond using controls checklists designed for yesteryear's threats and risks. And what organisations can do to improve security to keep in touch with current threats and risks?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-sembhi-static-frameworks"></a>

  <p>Cyber Security traditionally has been seen as the domain of Technology, with an expectation that the solution for cyber resilience has to be provided by IT – and we happily accepted this challenge and delivered numerous software and hardware solutions, design and development principles, policies and process controls.</p>
<p>However, as most successful cyber-attacks in recent time have started by targeting users with phishing emails or social engineering, raising awareness of their role in increasing cyber resilience is at least as important as providing “just a technical solution”.</p>
<p>This presentation will – based on example of a famous real robbery in Berlin – show how user awareness can become an important line of defence in cyber security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-husain-social-engineering"></a>

<p>Shyft Veriscope supports assets across all major blockchain networks, including BTC, ETH, MATIC, AVAX, ATOM &amp; thousands of&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The crypto industry has come a long way since the first virtual asset service provider Bitcoinmarket.com launched in 2010. Today, the number of active crypto exchanges alone has surpassed <a href="https://www.cryptimi.com/guides/how-many-cryptocurrency-exchanges-are-there">500</a> by some estimates. And if we add other virtual asset service providers like custodians, brokers, and more, the number would surpass&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vaspnet.com/">35,000</a>.</p><p>Crypto transactions can be abused by malicious actors for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. That’s where the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines for VASPs, known as the Travel Rule, come into the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>To date, few countries have adopted the Travel Rule for crypto transactions. However, many are having discussions at the highest level, and it’s only a matter of time before most jurisdictions globally enforce it under increasing pressure and scrutiny from the FATF, the global anti-money laundering watchdog. Crypto regulations are also expected to be key topics during G20 &amp; V20 meetings <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/india-to-prioritize-crypto-regulations-under-its-g20-presidency">under India’s presidency</a> next&nbsp;year.</p><p>When in force, the FATF Travel Rule will require all VASPs to exchange originator and beneficiary transaction data with one another. However, two significant problems make crypto Travel Rule compliance challenging: Attribution and Data Security.</p><blockquote>Shyft’s Veriscope — the only Travel Rule solution that is frictionless for users — has leveraged Address Proofs to solve these problems.</blockquote> What is an Address&nbsp;Proof? <p>Address Proofs enable beneficiary VASPs to prove they actually control the crypto wallet address, which, in turn, helps originator VASPs ensure that transaction data is exchanged only with the right counterparty for Travel Rule compliance. This further ensures that VASPs comply with data protection regulations they may be subject&nbsp;to.</p><blockquote>As for what difference this will make to Shyft Veriscope, address proofs will be automatically processed as a part of the Travel Rule compliance workflow.</blockquote><p>Shyft Discover enables VASPs to search for counterparty VASPs based on the cryptocurrency address without requiring users to input additional information themselves. And <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> Share makes VASP-to-VASP user data exchange possible in a fully secured manner without storing user data in third-party servers.</p><p>Shyft Discover with Address Proofs is a fully functional Travel Rule address discovery solution that can enable originating VASPs to accurately determine control of a cryptocurrency destination address.</p><p>Address Proofs is available to all Shyft Veriscope customers.</p><p>Want to know more about the address proofs?

<p>SAML SSO vs. LDAP can be challenging to parse out. Still, we go through both methods to help clear up the differences and help you decide which to use.</p>
<p>Is SSO possible with LDAP? Yes, SSO is possible with LDAP as many providers support LDAP for SSO.</p>
 What Is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)? 
<p>LDAP is an open and vendor-neutral protocol that applications can use to access directory information services. This means providing support for navigating and interacting with local network resources, like users, directories, files, apps, and other services for local enterprise users.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the protocol structures these resources like a phone directory only available through the foundational TCP/IP stack–meaning that any computer system can deploy it on top of their existing network capabilities. The directory contains several core pieces of information for each resource on the network:</p>
 
 Entry Attributes: Each resource is an entry in the directory, and each entry has a set of attributes that are used to identify it on the LDAP network. At a minimum, these attributes have names and subsequent values, the meaning of which is defined in an attribute schema. 
 Unique Identifiers: Entries each have a unique identifier called its Distinguished Name (DN). This identifier includes a Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) plus some selected attributes. 
 Operations: LDAP provides a set of acceptable operations that allows users to interact with the server itself, including modifying entries, initiating encrypted sessions, and searching for resources. On the front end, however, users interacting with applications won’t see these commands, they will just see relevant network resources. 
 
<p>Because LDAP handles resource access, it also handles authentication, a crucial part of local data security (and an overlap with Single Sign-On capabilities).</p>
 Benefits of LDAP 
<p>LDAP brings a few critical functions and benefits to enterprise users, especially in the area of managing network resources. These benefits include:</p>
 
 Lightweight: LDAP has been around since the earliest days of computing and was created to provide lean, simple, and lightweight directory management. 
 Vendor-Agnostic: LDAP can be deployed nearly anywhere, with any technology, and run relatively smoothly. This, along with its small footprint, means it can scale very easily with new technology or network segments. 
 Directory Security: LDAP provides security layers for authentication and encryption for data in transit. This security will apply to directory entries’ underlying attributes, including personally identifiable information (PII) and username/password credentials. 
 
 What Is Single Sign-On (SSO)? 
<p>SSO is a method of authentication where a central identity provider handles authentication and authorization requests for multiple system resources or applications. A form of federated identity, SSO allows enterprise organizations to streamline identity verification such that employees do not have to remember multiple passwords.</p>
<p>The term SSO refers specifically to a strategy for authentication. Several different SSO solutions are used in practice, including:</p>
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an XML-based protocol for token-based authentication. 
 Kerberos, a ticket-based service created at MIST that relies on LAN domains to authenticate users on applications. Most often used in educational settings. 
 Shibboleth, A SAML-based SSO approach is also used in academic settings where federated identity management across institutions is ideal. 
 OpenID Connect, A JSON-based identity verification protocol focusing on web and mobile authentication. 
 OAuth, A protocol more focused on authorization for access to system resources, OAuth often works closely with authentication to provide an overall SSO solution. 
 
 Benefits of SSO 
<p>The benefits of SSO as compared to LDAP are rooted in singular authentication. While LDAP can provide authentication for users, it cannot support more web-based and portable Single Sign-On like typical SSO methods. These benefits include:</p>
 
 Simplified Authentication: Simplified authentication is a major goal for most solutions because user error or poor security practices (often tied to managing too many passwords) lead to the majority of data breaches. An SSO can minimize the attack surface and the potential for social engineering hacks. 
 Stronger Security: While centralizing authentication might seem counterintuitive, it actually provides a stronger platform for robust security. Identity providers can implement strong encryption, multi-factor authentication, and even passwordless authentication that covers several platforms rather than just one. 
 
 What Are the Differences Between LDAP and SSO? 
<p>It’s not entirely accurate to completely separate LDAP and SSO. Obviously, they aren’t the same technologies, but an organization can deploy LDAP with SAMLof OpenID Connect SSO to support more robust authentication.</p>
<p>However, there are some key differences:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">Authentication</a>: Both technologies support authentication. LDAP, however, is an underlying server through which other protocols can authenticate users for access to system directories. Other SSO technologies, like SAML, maybe more open in terms of their implementation and more applicable to cloud-based platforms and applications. 
 Features: SSO is typically focused on authentication, possibly authorization. LDAP provides several types of access controls and information cross-checks for network resources above and beyond authentication. 
 Integration: LDAP will usually be more recognizable to users across different applications. For example, using an SSO system will allow a user to access multiple platforms with web portals. LDAP, however, might be a key technology that syncs email contacts in an email client.

 Making it Easier to Sell is Just the&nbsp;Start <p>* may contain actual revolution</p><p>The Holy Grail of selling physical assets on the blockchain has always been real estate; it is the world’s most valuable asset class, but at the same time one of the trickiest to deal with because of all the legal apparatus that comes with it (more about that&nbsp;later).</p><p>Now, though, the innovative partnership between Mattereum and leading property consultants West London City Lets (WLCL) has succeeded in putting real estate on the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/09/26/mattereum-customer-west-london-city-lets-launch-first-real-estate-physical-asset-nft-for-land-in-uk/">Mattereum Customer West London City Lets Launch First Real Estate Physical Asset NFT for Land in UK</a></p><p>The result has been the launch of the first real estate physical asset non-fungible token (NFT), for a prime beach-front property on England’s south coast by WLCL, listed on the NFT marketplace <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa6cd9f96f73015bf6b2eaac9d7da09c860b377b2/0/">OpenSea</a> for offers over £1.25M through their blockchain subsidiary <a href="https://tokenized-properties.com/">Tokenized Properties</a>. This is a first of its kind transaction and is set to revolutionise real estate deals, not just in the UK, but for customers worldwide by using Mattereum’s innovative <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1ef0jF7SltECHp40AgY13ihp_XlHvvW-XIEGLyEtRYrE/edit">Universal Bridge</a> to create a market that is both efficient and transparent.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">The Mattereum Universal Bridge</a></p><p>How does this work exactly? Well, the NFT is linked to a <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> that stores relevant data for the property and is held on the blockchain. The MAP bundles together legal rights and warranties and is paired with Mattereum’s smart contract. This means that the required searches, title deed and reference media for due diligence are displayed accurately and transparently so that the NFT purchaser can sell on the property without the next purchaser needing to go through the process all over&nbsp;again.</p><p>What the NFT purchaser gets for their money is an interest in the property. If they wish to take full ownership of the property itself, they simply pay an extra pound, and full legal title is transferred to them, they can then do as they wish with the property and the NFT is burned. If they do not wish to do that and want to sell on their interest in the property instead, it can be done in moments, just like any other NFT transaction. Even if they do take full ownership of the property and burn the NFT, there is nothing to stop them coming back to Mattereum again at a future date and setting up a new NFT for the property to return it to the market. In fact, in a mature market for trading real estate on the blockchain, we’d expect that to be&nbsp;routine.</p><blockquote>Suddenly property trading becomes swift, frictionless and efficient</blockquote> Mortgages, fractionalisation and stablecoins <p>NFTs for property titles is pretty much a game changer, suddenly property trading becomes swift, frictionless and efficient instead of a three-month slog for every single transaction; but the implications of this are greater still. Once you start thinking about what this can do for DeFi, a whole bunch of further possibilities emerge — things like improving liquidity, collateralising, loans and mortgages, which may not sound all that revolutionary — you can go to a bank and get a&nbsp;loan.</p><p>But it’s not what you can get, it’s how you can get it; it’s not uncommon for real estate owners to need to talk to banks for two or three months to access liquidity, but once all the documentation is on the blockchain and there are warranties in the asset passport, it suddenly becomes possible to bypass all that and avoid the interminable delays.</p><p>The DeFi ecosystem is perfectly capable of financing mortgages and remortgages, and Mattereum expects DeFi financing of property deals to be a huge growth area in&nbsp;future.</p><p><a href="https://decrypt.co/40679/defi-meets-real-estate-as-aave-readies-crypto-mortgages">DeFi Meets Real Estate as Aave Readies Crypto Mortgages - Decrypt</a></p><p>It’s also possible to easily fractionalise properties by forming a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). You can then get a line of buyers willing to buy into these at a very advantageous price, then you can go to the liquidity provider and say, “Hey, would you lend us on those assets that you would be able to sell for those different prices?” It speeds the whole thing&nbsp;up.</p><p>When it comes to loans it’s also possible to have better competition in terms of things like rates using the blockchain, when you have real estate as collateral, with the potential for private people to offer loans within the DeFi ecosystem, as long as they can show they have the right backing in terms of money and security. It is even possible to use real estate to back a stablecoin, this is being done by <a href="https://www.tangible.store/real-estate">TangibleDAO</a> who use income-producing and tokenised residential properties as a source of both collateral and yield to back the USDR stablecoin.</p> The blockchain brings systemic transparency <p>The opacity of the real estate ecosystem has made it a source of corruption and pain for a long time. In 2008 mortgage backed securities <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/subprime-mortgage-crisis-effect-and-timeline-3305745">basically destroyed the financial system</a> because of their complete opacity — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/business/economy/25gret.html">no one could figure out who had the mortgages</a> and what the probability was that they were going to fail to repay&nbsp;them.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/business/economy/25gret.html">If Lenders Say 'The Dog Ate Your Mortgage' (Published 2009)</a></p><p>And today’s financial crisis can be seen as just the consequences of the response to that finally catching up with us. The original <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1667902707586469&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xWpjGwa46mb3ihGfTpBYe">Satoshi white paper </a>that started Bitcoin actually references the 2008 financial crisis and the bailouts. Satoshi understood that there was a problem with financial system stability in real estate right from the very beginning of the blockchain, and that what he was proposing could be a solution to all that. The blockchain brings systemic transparency, you can see who has what, and what the securities are made up of and make it possible to avoid all that mess. There are now companies like <a href="https://www.milo.io/">Milo</a> or <a href="https://www.figure.com/">Figure</a> that are willing to provide mortgages with NFTs as collateral too, and dealing with mortgages on the blockchain makes the whole thing much safer and more trustworthy.</p><blockquote>The blockchain can drive a whole new way of thinking about land ownership and our responsibilities towards the&nbsp;planet</blockquote><p>So, now all these things become possible, that adds a whole extra dimension to putting real estate on the blockchain, but it doesn’t have to end there, there is potential for using the blockchain to drive a whole new way of thinking about land ownership and our responsibilities towards the planet. To understand exactly how that could work, we need to think about what gives us real estate ownership, and I apologise in advance if this seems like a large diversion, because it is, but it is necessary, so bear with me, it’s not going to be dull though, it involves both wolves and the Holy Roman&nbsp;Emperor.</p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Top_Decoration_of_Ottoman_Title_Deed.png">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Top_Decoration_of_Ottoman_Title_Deed.png</a> Part 2: The Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of&nbsp;Time <p>First the wolves; owning real estate can be seen as the earliest form of “ownership” there is. It predates humans. In its earliest form it’s something like a bear defending its cave, you want the cave, you fight the bear, one on one conflict to defend a patch of land; then there’s wolves. They run in packs and if you look at how packs divide the land up, you find each pack has a territory with pretty clearly defined borders and conflict only occurs when one pack crosses into another’s territory — so that’s evolved from the simple territoriality of the bear and its cave to something like an agreement between packs about who owns which patch and it works out pretty clear cut; here’s a map showing the movements of wolves tracked by radio collar in Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota where they settle out into distinct territories.</p>Wolf Pack Territories <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/01/voyageurs-wolf-project/">https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/01/voyageurs-wolf-project/</a><p>So, humans work a bit like the wolves, individuals or groups of people have a patch of real estate, and they fight each other to decide where the line between them is drawn, except humans have some form of government and that government sets property ownership laws. This means that in a property dispute, instead of the two people having a fight, they take it to the law and put their case for where they believe the property line ought to be and the government comes down on one side or the other and resolves the dispute without violence (mostly). The two party fight is now a three party fight, and one of those parties is the state. Zoom out from that and you get nation states bordered by other nation states each with national sovereignty, and when these come into conflict, there is the international community and alliances that try and provide checks and balances, and on top of all that, these days, the UN. It’s all intended to try and stabilize the borders between nations by having third parties come in on one side or the other if a dispute&nbsp;starts.</p><p>This system of national borders is, of course, the Westphalia system of nations which came out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia">Peace of Westphalia in 1648</a>. This was the treaty that ended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War">30 Year’s War</a> (one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history) and which came up with an agreed way of defining national boundaries which did not need the Holy Roman Emperor to make the final decision (because, by 1648, there were protestant countries who weren’t inclined to listen to a Catholic Emperor). All of which is supposed to work to resolve territorial disputes and ultimately decide who owns a piece of&nbsp;land.</p>The Holy Roman Empire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg</a><p>Sometimes, of course it fails, and there is war, just as on a personal level, someone having a boundary dispute with their next door neighbour will go round and smack them in the&nbsp;face.</p><blockquote>Land law is ancient, gnarly, hard and&nbsp;weird</blockquote><p>Ultimately, what this means is that there’s an ancient, layered system of real estate rights in place that governs everything from the borders of your country to the fence around your back garden, and the rights people have and how disputes are resolved is based on where they live, Germans get their disputes resolved in Germany, the English in England, and the Scots in Scotland (Scotland operates on a completely different legal system to England and Wales, despite being in the UK, so property law is different there; it also explains why in England witches were hanged but in Scotland, burned, but I digress). The result of all this is that land law is about the oldest law there is, and in most countries with a degree of antiquity, elements of their land law go back 1000 years or&nbsp;more.</p><p>In England, the pattern of land ownership recorded in the Domesday Book in the late 11th century is still reflected in the division of land today, in the Netherlands, they have deeds 900 years old written on parchment in old Dutch scanned into the national property rights database. As a result, land law is incredibly site specific because each country has its own history of how it did land in antiquity and most of those land deeds still apply at some level. Buy a house in the UK dating back to the 19th century or earlier and you’ll probably find the deeds still have clauses banning you running a tannery on the premises, or boiling down horses for glue. This means land law is inherently very strange because it is very old, very local and therefore extremely diverse. It’s not like copyright law, for example, which has a lot of global harmonisation because the law is relatively young and the rights are harmonised as nations link their laws up to international treaties.</p><p>Land law is ancient, gnarly, hard and weird, and that’s what controls the world’s most valuable asset&nbsp;class.</p> Part 3: A New Global Real Estate Settlement Rail <p>So, what Mattereum have done to sell real estate as a physical asset NFT is to put the NFT on top of this stack of law that goes all the way back to those wolves and their territory, which takes this enormous ancient pre-human machinery about territoriality and gets it down to a digital token that uses brand new technology to transfer the ownership of the land. To do this we have a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that owns the land. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030515/what-most-typical-holding-spv.asp">Special Purpose Vehicles</a> are single-function companies which typically exist to own or share ownership of a single asset, usually something like real estate or a painting.</p><p>The physical asset NFT legally locks onto the SPV, and the SPV legally locks onto the real estate register and the real estate register locks onto the law, ancient and&nbsp;modern.</p><p>That law then plugs into the kind of globalized Westphalian equilibrium that was ratified when the UN formed, and all of that reflects thousands of years of disputes over real estate that the Westphalian system was set up to avoid in the future. The end result of which is a Physical Asset NFT that has the power to legally transfer the ownership of the land anywhere in the world when it is sold and the purchaser takes up the interest in it. This now works without the buyer and seller having to wade through the old, weird processes of a thousand years of property law, specific to the particular country where the land is, every time it is traded. The result is a fast and simple way of buying and selling land on the blockchain that at the same time conforms to all that property&nbsp;law.</p><p>Finally, all this ties in with one of those recent bits of globally harmonised law, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards">1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards</a>, commonly known as the New York Convention. This means that if there is any dispute relating to the property and its sale, there’s a mechanism for resolving that dispute and that the outcome is legally valid in all 170 countries that are signatories to the Convention, again without having to get entangled in hyperlocal property&nbsp;law.</p><p>We are literally driving a thousand year old (or older) global legal equilibrium institution using Ethereum!</p> Part 4: Decolonising Real&nbsp;Estate <p>Now we have an NFT through which a property can be sold; yes, it is a great way of handling all that ancient legal machinery, but it’s also laying the foundations for the next generation of property law. How is that? Looking back at all this history of property law, it does seem as if law based on land with maps, boundaries, straight lines and owners, verified by a state register is objectively real and the only way doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>But in cultures like Greece, though, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-landregistry-idUSKCN1QW23B">the state register isn’t an accurate record of who actually owns the land</a>. They don’t use the state register in the villages because many people dissemble about who owns what for tax reasons. Transferring land means paying taxes. So they make an informal agreement, where you give me 50 grand in cash, and I give you the bottom 20 acres of my farm, and nobody will write this deal down because if they do that, then they have to pay taxes. Because they have to pay taxes for the government to know that the thing happened for them to deal with any dispute, they do dispute resolution at the village level. They don’t want the government to know and they don’t want to pay the government for doing the dispute resolution. To buy land in Greece, you have to go and talk to the locals to figure out what the real ownership situation is, because if you buy it from somebody that the locals don’t consider owns it, you’re going to have real problems even if you have legal title, you will not be able to use the land, so the system kind of breaks down there, ownership is down to local knowledge, community consent and personal negotiation.</p><p>In fact, it is a quirk of fate that the world basically uses a system that is of European origin; in the Ottoman Empire, it wasn’t where you lived that defined your rights, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_law#Legal_system">it was your religion</a>. There were courts for christians who resolved matters between christians, for jews that dealt with their matters, and for muslims, which dealt with matters between muslims, or between muslims and members of the other faiths. If the Battle of Vienna in 1683 had gone the other way, the Ottoman approach to property law could have become the prevalent system.</p>The Ottoman Empire at its peak in&nbsp;1590<p>A key reason the Ottoman system was so different was that a big chunk of their empire was desert inhabited by <a href="https://www.routledgehandbooks.com/doi/10.4324/9780203142851.ch1">nomads</a> who did not stay in one place and so having their legal status tied to a patch of physical real estate was pretty useless. One result being that nations within the empire were not as important as they were in the west, so after the First World War when the empire fell and western powers divided it up into countries their way, the resulting borders planted the seeds for decades of conflict as they cut across all kinds of accepted traditional territories wandered by the&nbsp;nomads.</p><p>For nomads, what was valuable about land was that there was good pasture here in the spring, water there in the height of summer, shelter over there when it snows in winter and so on, it is what the land provides that gives it its value, not where it is, and land that is valuable to nomads in summer isn’t in winter, so it made sense for the law to be about the people, not the&nbsp;place.</p><p>The Westphalian system is a horrible fit for this kind of way of looking at the land, which also makes it a horrible fit for dealing with the reality of environmental damage, climate change, overpopulation and all that. It’s hundreds of years old and pre-scientific and is fundamentally unsuited to dealing with anything like&nbsp;that.</p>The wind pushes the clouds and the clouds bring the&nbsp;rain<p>Any scientifically rigorous definition of the land has to include the ecosystem if you have valuable fertile land beside a river, then someone dams the river upstream so that everything below the dam dries up and dies, your fertile land suddenly isn’t fertile anymore and it is worth a fraction of what it was before, and that is true for a river and its irrigation channels, as it is for rainfall patterns. There’s no patch of farmland in the world that is equally valuable if it has ten times as much rain or a 10th as much rain. So, because we built this pre-scientific model of land and what makes it valuable, our data representations are inadequate for representing the scientific reality of what it is that actually makes the land valuable, for capturing the environmental dimension; it treats the ecology as an externality. Now, though, if you are selling the land using a Mattereum Physical Asset NFT, it comes with a Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) and that really changes what you can do about documenting the ecological value of the&nbsp;land.</p><blockquote>Much of the dispute resolution could be done inside the SPV, without needing to involve the government</blockquote><p>Going back to all the stuff we were saying earlier about Westphalia, about the Greeks and the Ottomans, the one thread that links how they all deal with land is that ownership of the land is about dispute resolution, whether that is done through a government land register, local agreement or a court that is based on your religion. Whichever way you are doing things, somewhere there is a way to resolve who does what with a patch of land, whether it is where you put your garden fence or which group of nomads gets to water their flocks at a particular oasis in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Now, if the ownership of the land is linked to a Physical Asset NFT that can transfer the ownership of an SPV that is the owner of the land on a government register, the SPV can, for example, issue leases or other user rights on the land. Much of the dispute resolution between different users of the land could then be done inside the SPV, without needing to involve the government, or indeed, anyone else. Private land management arrangements, on the blockchain. But still backed by the entire international legal stack so they are fully enforceable under&nbsp;law.</p><blockquote>Land management agreements which have the full force of law that run dramatically ahead of the nation&nbsp;state</blockquote> Creating positive political change with improved land&nbsp;rights <p>So imagine we take 100,000 acres of rainforest, we have it inside of a single SPV. Everybody on that land is a contractual tenant of the SPV including being able to do things like purchase 1000 year leases or something like that, so they’re de facto owners. But then the dispute resolution for the vast majority of the stuff is contained by arbitration clauses in the contracts, and this happens within the ruleset defined by the SPV and documented in the MAP that comes with the NFT. We can’t remove existing restrictions from the nation state or the international law level on land transactions by using these kinds of rule-making SPVs, but we can add new restrictions as matters of contract&nbsp;law.</p><p>So when the environmental law for managing a patch of land is insufficient, we can add new restrictive covenants in a way that forces correct management of the land for the current tenants or the future ones. This is how we basically build the possibility of land management agreements which have the full force of law that run dramatically ahead of the nation state legislation on environmental management. We do it through the physical asset NFT and its associated MAP which governs the way the SPV functions.</p><p>The prototype for this is systems like veganism. There is a whole certification machinery to say that food is vegan, and that certification machinery largely runs outside of the nation state. Some of the vegan certification machinery has become nation state legal certifications over time. But imagine if you had a way of specifying the rules for managing land that said, right, this land is rewilded land, and we manage it with absolutely zero extractive agriculture, and you’re not allowed to sell this land to anybody that will not take on a legal obligation to maintain that, and it becomes a restrictive covenant for environmental management. And this is how we can make what effectively acts like new law for land right the way up the governance stack. We’re trashing the entire world because we don’t say that the rain is as much of the value of the land, or the river irrigation is as intrinsic to the value of the land as its physical location. As a result, we’ve got people wrecking other people’s rainfall patterns with no legal liability attached. By looking at the ownership of the land in this different way we can do something about that, and without having to make governments change the law, because there are a lot of governments and they take forever to change anything and we don’t have that long. Landowners can start to enable the world to make the change here and now by using the warranties in the MAPs to govern the&nbsp;SPVs.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison#/media/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison#/media/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg</a> Indigenous Land Law and the New Buffalo&nbsp;Commons <p>One revolutionary proposal of this kind is the Poppers’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Commons">Buffalo Commons</a> proposal which envisages turning the American prairies into a vast open range for buffalo. The buffalo would return to their traditional migration patterns, and a percentage of them would be culled every year. The harvest would be sold, and the profits split among the people that had put their land into the scheme. Buffalo are smart: they evolved to cope with some drought, some changing weather patterns. They evolved not to crop the grass too low and kill it. They’ve survived everything for 5 to 10 million years and might be the best chance the midwestern states of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota">North Dakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota">South Dakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas">Kansas</a> have of surviving climate change. A scheme like this is exactly the kind of proposal that the blockchain could support. Track the donations of land into the system, track the animals, track the harvests each year. Run transparent markets so that the land-donors are 100% sure they are getting their due. A huge amount of the endeavour could be run on contract law and permanent blockchain records of who did what and when, aligned with satellite data and other ways of keeping&nbsp;score.</p><blockquote>We can get to sustainability by adding new restrictive covenants to land and tracking them in the property rights databases</blockquote><p>It’s not just schemes like the Buffalo Commons that blockchain-based land registries could empower. Imagine an indiginous group which owns some part of its traditional lands, but does not have all the governance powers they would wish for regarding the environmental and other management of these lands. It may be possible to implement some or all of the traditional land management norms of the culture using SPVs and contract laws, and adding these restrictions on top of the land ownership norms — a way of extending environmental protection in advance of that which is mandated by national governments.</p><p>To create this kind of structure, a group of landowners would pool their titles inside of a single company (an SPV) and then the SPV would add restrictive covenants on the land titles. The blockchain is then used for tracking who currently owns what plots, and provides a mechanism for exerting stronger local control on the land. Anyone buying land there would have to uphold the restrictive covenants, and that would hold true all the way up the governance stack — because any dispute that occurred would be handled under international arbitration law. Depending on the local legal framework, land ownership could be restricted to the traditional owners of that&nbsp;land.</p><p>This is a delicate area, and the struggles for control of land between colonists and the colonized are extremely subtle, complex and bitter, and are being fought all over the world every single day. There is no technological silver bullet for these issues, but a combination of good lawyering and good technology might put new tools into the hands of land rights activists.</p><p>Almost every aspect of land ownership can be reshaped by appropriate use of contract law, with the blockchain to keep records clear and demonstrate fair dealing on every level. Existing restrictions from nation state and international law cannot be removed but nearly all of our problems in environmental land management come from too little law not too much. Just as the vegans had to add new contractual restrictions to food (“contains no animal products”), we can get to sustainability by adding new restrictive covenants to land and tracking them in the property rights databases.</p><p>Indigenous peoples have lost entire continents to settlers, but as the world seeks new ways to manage land to protect the ecological balance of the entire planet, the traditional ways in which people managed agriculture, settlement and forestry may turn out to be the only long term sustainable models that&nbsp;exist.</p>  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/24/899422710/to-manage-wildfire-california-looks-to-what-tribes-have-known-all-along">To Manage Wildfire, California Looks To What Tribes Have Known All Along</a>  <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/indigenous-fire-practices-shape-our-land.htm">Indigenous Fire Practices Shape our Land - Fire (U.S. National Park Service)</a>  <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/03/us/california-native-american-fire-practitioners-wildfires-climate/index.html">California once prohibited Native American fire practices.

<p>The world of options for actionable, verifiable data is suddenly much bigger than it was. With the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-joins-google-cloud-partner-advantage-program/">news</a> that Indicio has joined Google’s Cloud Advantage Partner Program, there is now native cloud support on a global scale for implementing verifiable credential technology and building interoperable Trusted Digital Ecosystems. And there is no vendor lock in: Indicio provides fully open-source solutions through Google Cloud.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://indicio.tech/google_cloud/">initial products</a> are Indicio Proven™, a complete open-source system for implementing verifiable credentials; Indicio Mediator, a reliable way to connect to mobile devices so that they can use verifiable credentials; and Indicio NoDe — or Node-on-Demand for Hyperledger Indy— an easy way to spin up a validator node for an Indy network.</p>
<p>With Indicio NoDe, we want to make it as simple as possible to either join a network — such as the Indicio Network — or to create one for production or testing. With Indicio Mediator, we’ve made it easy for, say, a wallet developer to test their agents and get into production quickly without having to develop their own mediator to connect to mobile devices. Indicio Mediator is also a way to manage connecting to agents that have strict firewall rules—essentially, speak to the mediator first.</p>
<p>Proven gives companies and organizations the ability to stand up an entire ecosystem on their own — or with our help. It has all the pieces needed, reduces the learning curve for the technology, which in turn reduces time to deployment, and, critically, lowers cost. And because customers fully own Proven, it provides a great foundation for customizing solutions to meet the needs of specific verticals.</p>
<p>Our goal with these solutions is to provide the shortest possible route to using verifiable credentials. Everything comes straight from the open source codebases but without customers having to master these codebases to use the technology.</p>
<p>Having a complete solution available through Google Cloud will accelerate digital transformation. Cloud availability is the path to adoption; and with fully open-source solutions, the path to continued innovation too.</p>
<p>The full power of decentralized identity is now on tap in Google Cloud Marketplace. All the privacy-preserving features are there. Making decentralized identity solutions easy to build and implement is the path to making verifiable data the new currency of business and social interaction online, bridging Web2.0 and Web3.</p>

 How Adding Context Turns Siloed API Messages into Globally Connected Data <p>In our previous Transmute Tech School article, I described the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qmW_9xxG6kl83XOTzwyo_EpUku0QL8_a?usp=share_link">basics of Linked Data</a>, the integration benefits of which are driving the accelerating adoption of Linked Data for modern, data-driven business. My aim for this post is to dig deeper and sketch how actors across supply chains stand to gain tremendously from wider adoption:</p>  Linked Data is the perfect tool for capturing the inherently networked nature of supply&nbsp;chains.  Web-based semantics function as a machine-based lingua franca, connecting data models originating from diverse cultures, languages and jurisdictions.  <p>I will go into a little bit of technical detail, but promise to keep it light weight and not lose sight of the business benefits which the technology enables.</p> From Messages to Snippets Connected Data <p>It is generally understood that APIs are the enabler of digitization and automation. The “API Economy” is upon us, and there are competing platforms for all aspects of logistics and commerce processes. Linked Data builds upon this established infrastructure.</p><p>An API is — roughly speaking — a list of operations called by a client to invoke services and manipulate resources on a server. Each operation can have a request object and a reply object which are essentially digital documents with data relevant to the given operation. Data is normally kept in systems and databases and is mapped to and from these API documents, most often represented in JSON&nbsp;format.</p><p>The same data is often used in conjunction with multiple APIs, from a multitude of providers. On one platform, my product might be mapped to offeredProduct and assigned an identifier abc, whereas on another platform it maps to vendor-product as xyz. It is cumbersome for me to map data separately to every platform individually. And you would not be able to tell that these documents in fact deal with the same&nbsp;product.</p>Context is required to understand that these documents describe the same&nbsp;product. Adding Context to Message&nbsp;Data <p>Someone receiving these two documents will require a significant amount of context and human interventions to determine a) that these are the same type of products and b) that this is in fact the same product. This is essentially the problem which Linked Data solves by providing the necessary context.</p><p>By use of the standard JSON Linked Data, web identifiers can be assigned to every type and object. This way, instead of defining and identifying data locally (within the document), they can be defined and identified globally (on the internet).</p><p>Continuing from the earlier example, here is how JSON-LD could add web identifiers “on top” of the API documents:</p>  offeredProduct and vendor-productare both of the type <a href="https://schema.org/Product">https://schema.org/Product</a>.  Although assigned abc on one platform and xyz on another, the product’s unique web identifier is https://example.com/prod/123 and are in fact the same&nbsp;product.  Linked Data adds a layer of context, pointing data elements to unique web identifiers.<p>Linked Data deals with data rather than a particular document representation of the data. JSON-LD was invented to combine these two&nbsp;aspects.</p> Non-Breaking <p>The question you should now be asking is: “does this mean we need to rebuild our APIs?” The answer is a solid: No! JSON-LD works with a small set of keywords such as @id and @type, shown in the above example. In JSON, unknown elements are simply ignored, so these can be added to the exchanged documents and freely used or ignored by API users. Adding JSON-LD is a “non-breaking” change.</p> Semantic Vocabularies <p>We have established now how it is technically possible to make data much more expressive by applying URIs to API messages. The next topic to address is which URIs? The technical linkability isn’t worth much if I use https://my-product-definition.com and you use https://your-product-definition.com.</p><p>This is where semantic web vocabularies come into play. Earlier I referenced https://schema.org/Product, and <a href="https://schema.org">https://schema.org</a> is exactly such a vocabulary, providing many of the most used terms on the internet. Proper vocabularies should:</p>  Be static and not change established URIs because data definitions depend on&nbsp;them.  Have URIs resolve to human readable explanation of the defined&nbsp;term.  <p>Other vocabularies are targeting more focus domains. Noteworthy vocabularies specialized for supply chains&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/">United Nations CEFACT, which defined terms and code lists used for international trade and transport</a>.  <a href="https://ref.gs1.org/epcis/">GS1 EPCIS, for visibility of product status, location, movement and chain of&nbsp;custody</a>.  <p>Agreeing on terms used is an essential part of any standard, akin to agreeing on which language to speak. The fact that the semantic layer can be added without breaking APIs makes this conversation much easier. Agreement is easier reached when neither party risks bothering their customers.</p> Business Case <p>Let us now move to some of the business cases considerations which I expect that you would now be rightfully contemplating. Under which circumstances might Linked Data make sense for industry adoption?</p> Who Pays, Who Benefits? <p>I will first discuss how better defined data logically switches the effort of interpretation from the data consumer to the data provider.</p><p>As a data provider, Linked Data lets&nbsp;me:</p>  Communicate unambiguously, expressing my data with explicit, uniquely identified semantic&nbsp;terms.  Pre-map data to globally understood terms in a serialization format with strong tool&nbsp;support.  <p>As a data consumer, Linked Data lets&nbsp;me:</p>  Receive data in computer readable form, which can be directly used and&nbsp;stored.  Understand the data directly, without human interpretation.  <p>The burden of “understanding” is shifted from the data receiver to the data sender. The clarity of the sender obviously benefits the receiver.</p><p>For an API with only a single sender and a single receiver, this clarity can arguably be established more efficiently by traditional system integration where data models are manually mapped to each other. However, such one-to-one APIs are rare, and there isn’t much “API economy” about it. Platform and pipeline business cases are typically based on scaling business partners and/or customers. So with this in mind, let’s consider some cases where the investment in concise and expressive data pays&nbsp;off.</p> Many Data Providers <p>Let’s imagine there are 1000 providers of data to a platform. Establishing 1000 data mapping projects would be insanely expensive in consulting costs. Not to mention maintaining them. Here, requesting the data providers to be expressive and computer readable is practically a&nbsp;must.</p><p>Case</p><p>This is literally how Google search works. Search indexes are built not from interpretation of page content, but from terms expressed explicitly by the page owner, defining their own content. A Google recipe is indexed and rendered from linked data terms such as <a href="https://schema.org/recipeCuisine">https://schema.org/recipeCuisine</a> and <a href="https://schema.org/cookTime.">https://schema.org/cookTime.</a></p>How to explicitly tell Google that this page is about an Apple Pie recipe. (https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/introstructured-data)<p>Comparative situations exist throughout supply chains, logistics and commerce: customs declarations to a single window, credit checks to a financial institution, shipping instructions to a carrier, purchase orders to a manufacturer or ecommerce platform. These are all examples of large groups of participants expressing data, passing it to platforms. As long as they point at, say, <a href="https://schema.org/Order,">https://schema.org/Order,</a> their differing data representation does not&nbsp;matter.</p> Many Data Receivers <p>Now let’s consider the reverse situation, 1000 receivers of data from a platform. Everyone has to learn and understand what the platform’s data&nbsp;means.</p><p>Case</p><p>EDI, which is so prevalent in supply chains, is the perfect anti-pattern. An EDI endpoint comes with an “implementation guide”, which is a document which a human is expected to read to make sense and map the codes of the EDI messages. Manual integration efforts are assumed, perceived as the solution.</p>Sample page from an EDI Implementation Guide. No human should suffer such pain. (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GOVPUB-C13-0d00b8dcbbecadc6e1609edf97e9a0b6/pdf/GOVPUB-C13-0d00b8dcbbecadc6e1609edf97e9a0b6.pdf)<p>A monopoly might get away with this kind of “read the spec” attitude, but most often you want to make integration as seamless as possible. Granted, modern API specs (“swaggers”) are friendlier than EDI implementation guides. But it is still based on the premise of “here is how you should interpret my language”. By overlaying the platform’s API with Linked Data, any of your customer or business partners with LD capabilities can plug the platform data stream directly into their operational environment.</p><p>Industry specific examples of this include manufacturer or ecommerce product listings, carriers’ bills of lading, and trade certifications from inspectors, chambers and other organizations.</p> Knowledge Graphs <p>Sprinkling some URIs over JSON documents may seem rather simple — and it is. Yet, it is all that is needed to reveal that data on one API is in fact the same as on another API, despite differing nomenclature.</p><p>This opens up a whole new world of data analytics. JSON-LD implements the Resource Description Framework, which is a first order logic data representation, opening up the world of Data Science. Graphs of data, so-called Knowledge Graphs, can be built from the linked data elements. These can be stored in modern graph databases and directly subjected to massively powerful graph algorithms, revealing connections, outliers, patterns, inconsistencies hidden as implicit connections within the data, turning them into explicit, actionable ones.</p><p>The downstream Machine Learning which Linked Data enables deserves dedicated attention, and I promise to follow up soon with a blog post specifically on this&nbsp;topic.</p> Conclusion <p>Linked Data is in much broader use than most people realize, but its value has not yet bubbled up to industries which are still transitioning to API-based digitization. JSON-LD extends this, with the promise of greatly simplifying API integrations, while paving the way to data graph analytics. In all but the most simple cases, there is good business justification for adopting JSON-LD to lower your or your customers’ integration complexities. Supply chains in particular stand to benefit from this, being connected networks and spanning a heterogeneous, international set of languages, jurisdictions and&nbsp;models.</p><p>Transmute holds editor roles on essential open source Linked Data projects including:</p>  <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/017_EDI-API_Linked-data-vocab.pdf">UN/CEFACT semantic vocabulary</a>  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/">W3C Traceability Vocabulary</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers Specification</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials v2.0 Specification</a>   About Transmute <p>The author is editor of the United Nations CEFACT Vocabulary, which expresses the prevalent supply chain semantic model on the as referenceable web URIs.

<p>2022 is set to witness a FIFA World Cup like no other. We are less than 2 weeks away from the world-famous tournament, where 32 nations are all set to compete in the winter months of November and December for a chance to lift the famous Jules Rimet trophy. This will be the final World Cup tournament to feature 32 teams before its scheduled expansion to 48 teams in 2026.</p>



<p>Significantly, this is the first time the tournament has taken place in the Middle East and is the first time the event will be held during the winter. Although it will be held in the comparatively cooler winter months (with temperatures around 30C vs 40C+ in June and July), every stadium will have air conditioning, and there will be increased water breaks to help players stay rehydrated.</p>



<p>The competition is anticipated to be as intense off the field, as operators compete to grab the attention of bettors with the best possible customer onboarding and betting experience.</p>



<p>There are, however, a number of challenges that operators must meet before they can begin to welcome new customers.</p>



 Sustaining interest: Long run of matches in a short period. 



<p>To adjust to the World Cup’s winter scheduling, the Premier League season began a week earlier, at the beginning of August, and will break before the World Cup commences. The Premier League season will then pick up where it left off, almost immediately after the World Cup ends. That is a long stretch of football mania for fans, players, and UK gambling operators. Sustaining the bettor’s interest throughout this extended period could prove to be challenging.</p>



<p>Operators will also require a strong customer acquisition strategy since players may be distracted during the Christmas holidays.</p>



<p>Since the 2022 World Cup has a reduced timeframe of only 28 days, numerous matches will be held in a short time, however, just because a sportsbook has gained a new customer during the World Cup doesn’t mean they will place multiple bets throughout the tournament. This was demonstrated on the <a href="https://www.kambi.com/qatar-2022-what-a-winter-world-cup-means-for-sports-betting/">Kambi network during the Euro 2020 tournament</a>, when 78% of new players bet on the event when given a coupon, but only 76% returned for a second bet during the same event.</p>



<p>Customer acquisition and retention after a big tournament are crucial to successful sportsbooks. The timing of this year’s World Cup creates a real opportunity for operators to capitalize on. Indeed, when the World Cup ends on December 18, the Premier League is scheduled to resume a week later, on December 26, allowing for a much shorter window for player retention compared to Euro 2020, which had a gap of over a month.</p>



 Unique operational challenges for gambling operators. 



<p>The extreme Qatar heat, combined with the crammed football schedule before and after the Qatar World Cup is likely to lead to an increased risk of player injuries.</p>



<p>Offering a stable and scalable betting experience during an uncertain World Cup will therefore be crucial for retaining bettors and keeping their interest after the tournament ends.</p>



<p>The last thing sportsbooks need is for consumers to try their platform – whether they are solid bet builders or player props – only to lose interest and vanish when the World Cup ends.</p>



<p>On the plus side, since the Qatar 2022 World Cup is being held during the winter, sandwiched between Premier League games, and followed by Champions League knockout phases, it could be advantageous from an upselling perspective, with increased opportunities to retain customers, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/a-wintertime-world-cup-and-its-impact-on-online-betting/">increased betting activity</a>.</p>



<p>The worldwide tournament offers operators a unique opportunity to optimize their platforms and provide team and player-specific content, allowing customers to place bets on various football markets.</p>



<p>Operators that can offer a great customer onboarding experience, and a product that delivers a wide variety of markets and an outstanding level of combinability, are perfectly positioned to benefit from the opportunities at the World Cup and beyond.</p>



 Festive financial commitments may keep bettors away. 



<p>The World Cup tournament’s unique scheduling during the winter holiday season brings about increased competition for customers’ funds.</p>



<p>As most bettors may prefer to stay indoors to watch the World Cup tournament this winter, sportsbooks may experience an inflow of online players. That said, since the sporting event will happen so close to the Christmas holidays, operators may also experience a decrease in numbers. The reduction in numbers may be linked to bettors choosing to allocate their funds elsewhere due to the festive expectations of parties, gifts, and increasing heating costs, etc.</p>

 How to prepare for Qatar 2022 as a gambling operator 



<p>As sportsbooks will be focusing on new markets and a (possibly) smaller pool of customers this World Cup season, they must ensure their services are competitive, if not the best.</p>



<p>As new users in particular will not want to complete a long, arduous sign-up process, operators must make the onboarding experience as intuitive, streamlined, and safe as possible. New users tend to abandon a product because it’s either too complicated to register, they don’t understand the product, or they do not get value from it.</p>



<p>Gambling operators endure many challenges, such as risks of fraud, underage gambling, regulatory compliance, and offering a safe and smooth onboarding process for new users.</p>



<p>IDnow streamlines the onboarding process of gambling platforms. Bettors must simply scan their identity documents via a mobile device and AutoIdent automatically does the rest, processing the data and verifying identities within a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>IDnow’s AI-powered identity verification tool, AutoIdent is compliant with regulations across 195 countries and offers coverage in over 30 languages.</p>



<p>Download our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2022-fifa-world-cup-gambling-operators/">‘The Fifa World Cup 2022 is just around the corner’</a> guide to discover how identity-proofing technology enables gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience for bettors, new and old.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/classification-of-blockchain-types-and-introduction-to-layer-1-blockchain-12a0bc955eec">The second article</a> discussed blockchain types and Layer 1 solutions to the blockchain scalability problem. In this article, I would like to explore what Layer 2 solutions are and analyze the characteristics of each solution.</p> 1. Layer 2&nbsp;concept Fig 1. Layer 2&nbsp;concept<p>Layer 2 refers to an auxiliary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain. To confirm a transaction that occurred in a specific framework/protocol, it can be defined as a Layer 2 solution by referencing the data of the existing blockchain (Layer 1) or when transaction data recording is required in Layer 1 for transaction confirmation.</p><p>The chain can solve the scalability problem by reducing the data burden given to Layer 1 because the chain records only the result value in Layer 1 after performing calculation/transaction record/transaction verification in a separate layer above the Layer 1 blockchain.</p><p>For example, in Fig 1., the user does not record their transaction (100 USDC remittance) directly in Layer 1 but performs the transaction in Layer 2, and a third aggregator communicates with other transactions. Records Layer 2 transactions in Layer 1 in compressed form (the recording method differs depending on the Layer 2 solution&nbsp;method).</p><p>Layer 2 solutions can be broadly classified into Channels, Sidechains, and Rollups. In this post, we will analyze each Layer 2 solution.</p> 2. Layer 2&nbsp;solution  2. 1&nbsp;Channel <p>A channel creates a private channel between parties carrying out transactions, conducting transactions on that channel, and recording the final transaction result value in Layer 1. In addition, a set of rules needs to be predefined for transaction reliability.</p><p>Channels can be classified into two main categories: status channels and payment channels, which are generalized versions, while payment channels are limited to payment-related applications. Figure 2 is an example of a state&nbsp;channel.</p>Fig 2. Example of&nbsp;channel<p>Assume that a channel that performs round 2 is opened. At this time, Bob sends 100 USDC in Round 1 and receives 70 FTM; in Round 2 sends 40 FTM and receives 50 USDC. Finally, 50 USDC and 30 FTM become the state values for Bob, and 50 USDC and 40 FTM become the state values for Alice. Even though two transactions have occurred, the intermediate transaction process is entrusted to the private channel, and only the final transaction result value is recorded in the Layer 1 blockchain.</p><p>Since transaction reliability is fully obtained through an agreement between the channel parties, securing transaction reliability within the channel is essential. In addition, since it is necessary to establish a private trading channel between participants, it is difficult for many participants to participate.</p> 2.1 SideChains <p>Sidechains transfer assets/states in Layer 1 to Sidechains and perform transactions within the sidechain. For example, assuming you have 100 ETH in the Ethereum chain, transfer 50 ETH to the Sidechain and complete the transaction within the Sidechain. When the transaction in Sidechain is closed, the remaining assets can be transferred back to Layer 1 after the transaction is closed. For this, a bridge is required to allow the mutual movement of assets. Fig 3. is an example of a Sidechain.</p>Fig 3. Example of SideChains<p>In Fig 3., Bob moves 100 USDC in Layer 1 to his sidechain account. The above deposit transaction is written in Layer 1, and Bob’s assets in Layer 1 decrease. Referring to Fig 3., the above-deposited USDC is sent to Alice in the sidechain, and 150 USDC is received from Alice afterward, so Bob has 50 USDC in the sidechain. After that, 50 USDC can be withdrawn to Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>As mentioned above, moving Layer 1 assets to Layer 2 and performing transactions is called a sidechain. A sidechain is characterized by the need for trust in the sidechain, just like the state channel. The difference is that while rules agreed upon by the parties determine the state channel’s reliability, the sidechain is determined by the consensus algorithm of each&nbsp;chain.</p> 2.3 Rollup <p>Suppose the state channel and sidechain were a method of processing the intermediate process of a specific transaction at Layer 2 and recording the final result value at Layer 1. In that case, the rollup records all transactions occurring at Layer 2 in a compressed form at Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>For example, all transactions in Layer 2 are committed to a short value (ex. SHA256 Hash function) cryptographically, and only compressed commitments and final state values are periodically recorded in Layer 1. At this time, the reliability of transaction aggregation is required to ensure that the correct Layer 2 transaction is recorded in Layer 1, which can be classified into Optimistic Rollup and zk-Rollup depending on how the above reliability is guaranteed.</p><p>Optimistic Rollup</p><p>Optimistic Rollup is a method of trusting the results of Layer 2 transaction compression and post-validating by participants for invalid rollups. Optimistic Rollup does not require much computing cost to compress transactions. However, the disadvantage is that it requires more than a week to finalize transactions because it requires time to post verification for invalid&nbsp;rollups.</p>Fig 4. Optimistic Rollup<p>Optimistic Rollup verifies the compression results afterward, so the rollup node that performed the invalid compression is penalized, and the user who finds the illegal transaction gets a certain&nbsp;reward.</p><p>zk-Rollup</p><p>Unlike Optimistic Rollup, zk-Rollup does not post-verify the Rollup results but is a method of recording after verification. Zk-Rollup uses Zero-knowledge proof technology that can prove the validity of the information without revealing the information.</p><p>A simple example of proof of knowledge is to prove that I can pay 10,000 won, but whether I have ten 1,000 won bills or two 5,000 won bills. It should be understood as a technique for proving without revealing. Replacing the proposition “I have 10,000 won” with the request “If you compress all Layer 2 transactions, you will get the A state value” is proof of&nbsp;Rollup.</p><p>Zk-Rollup is performed as follows. When a transaction first occurs at Layer 2, the Rollup node responsible for Rollup performs transaction compression and generates a zero-knowledge proof value for the entire chain of compression processes. Specifically, the input is layer 2 of a specific period, and the output is a SHA256 hash value that proves a function expression using zero-knowledge proof technology.</p><p>Rollup verification does not check all transaction results like Optimistic Rollup but verifies the attached zero-knowledge proof, so immediate transaction confirmation is possible. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring a lot of computing cost since it requires proof values for the compression process.</p><p>Figure 5 is an example of a zk-rollup.</p>Fig 5. zk-Rollup<p>Referring to Fig. 5, the Rollup server in charge of Rollup compresses Layer 2 transactions and generates zero-knowledge proofs for all compression processes. A miner who records a rollup transaction in Layer 1 can check the validity of the zero-knowledge proof and record the compression result and the zero-knowledge proof value in Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>In this article, we have covered various Layer 2 solutions. Although each solution has advantages and disadvantages, research on Rollup is generally being actively conducted. Rollup technology differs from other solutions because it can compress and process multiple transactions into one transaction and ensure data availability. Among them, zk-Rollup is attracting more attention because it can ensure rapid transaction confirmation and expand the stage of transaction compression to the compression of the blockchain itself.</p><p>Research groups such as Polygon and Starkware are researching the modularization of blockchain and blockchain capacity compression through zk-Rollup. Modularization and capacity compression, as described above, are expected to be efficient ways to solve the scalability problem in Ethereum. Therefore, Metadium is considering R&amp;D on Layer 2 blockchain applications through close cooperation with the zk-Rollup research&nbsp;group.</p> References   <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/">Optimistic Rollups | ethereum.org</a>  <a href="https://www.web3.university/article/sidechains-vs-layer2s">Ethereum Sidechains vs Layer 2s: What's the Difference?</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/layer-2-blockchain-analysis-50270a8a4989">Layer 2 Blockchain Analysis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We will look at the reasons why security teams utilize SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) to keep pace with threats and technological innovations, without their organizations needing to add headcount. Learn how when the security team automates traditional Tier 1 work, the entire organization benefits - from upskilling staff to eliminating spend on managed services. This session draws from real-world European enterprises whose adoption of NextGen SOAR was the catalyst for fundamental security and organizational improvements.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-collins-security-automation"></a>

Sophisticated tools such as machine learning mechanisms and software bots is opening a huge battlefield for creating and spreading manipulated information at scale even for those with limited technical skills. From nation state attacks through organized crime down to that one single customer who feels treated unwell – they all can use such tools. What does this trend mean for your organization and what ist he CISO´s role combating MDM attacks? In this extra-long panel session we will try to find answers on how MDM will affect our organizations and how we can increase antoi-MDM resilience.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-panel-misinformation-disinformation-malinformation"></a>

Many different facets are important: authentication, authorization, governance, policies, processes, monitoring and surveillance, cyber defense and many more.</p>
<p>Putting a company on the right track in the long term requires strategic and technical expertise that is usually managed from the information security area within the company - by the Chief Information Security Officer.</p>
<p>But what skills does a modern CISO need? What should be his or her strengths, what does a company need to look out for if it has this role, or how does a security expert need to develop in order to meet the numerous requirements for this position?

  <p>Every business should be equipped to understand for itself what most threatens and endangers its business model. This is the starting point for preparation measures for disruptions and crises that, if not properly managed, can endanger and even kill organizations as a whole.</p>
<p>Assessing and understanding key assets and the threats towards them is true, applied, real-life risk management. Acting and reacting in the crisis needs to be based on a proper preparation. Service continuity and IT service continuity do not happen out of the blue but out of business-informed planning, and preparation.</p>
<p>Christopher Schuetze, Matthias Reinwarth and Kai Boschert will highlight the most important steps of an organization's journey to prepare for and even embrace disruptive events and circumstances as part of a holistic, sustainable business approach.</p>
<p>They will provide guidance and, even more importantly, challenge the audience with collaborative exercises for understanding and applying key methodologies to converge business resilience management and cybersecurity into a single, tailored, yet agile survical strategy. Five building blocks will be outlined that form the foundation of a unified strategy to achieve the common goals of resilience and recovery while limiting the impact of cyber attacks on business operations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-workshop-kuppingercole"></a>

  <p>This is the story of our journey to Zero Trust, from the initial analysis to its technical and effective implementation. As many organizations our starting point was not the best one (lack of proper asset management, mixed permissions, etc) but when we started to work on a Zero Trust implementation we were able to overcome these and also solve some unforeseen problems and offer major&nbsp;security also through Human Factors and Risk Management. The aim of this talk is to inspire security leaders on what is a Zero Trust Architecture (which is not an off-the-shelf solution and desn't require massive initial investments) and how they can reuse their internal knowledge and tools to deliver it.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-di-carlo-zero-trust"></a>

  <p>Thanks to cybersecurity technologies such as Privilege Access Management and security concepts like Zero Trust, we now have the capacity to secure all digital access, from the cloud to IoT.</p>
<p>Digital access in software and hardware must be secure by design to minimize risk as much as possible. We have seen official agencies including the US and UK governments signing off expansive cybersecurity executive orders to boost national security, and cybersecurity chiefs pushing for the inculcation of security by design in software.</p>
<p>However, the technology itself is not enough to build a trusted digital world. To cultivate this world, we need to raise general cybersecurity awareness for all citizens. This is no easy feat, so the first logical step is to focus on building knowledge and awareness in business schools, mentoring the directors of the future because they will have to learn how to deal with cyber risk daily.</p>
<p>To bring a trusted digital world to life, we must also disrupt the political sphere in the UK and surrounding European countries. The European continent must become a leader in digital sovereignty – where data protection and privacy are respected by all – by cross-country collaboration and the establishment of a European Business Act. European countries are democracies that produce large amounts of data, so to achieve this act, we must create a separate European model that protects and respects our valuable data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<p>• Educate attendees on the concept of digital sovereignty</p>
<p>• Build interest in the better protection of our data</p>
<p>• Provide attendees with the appropriate tools and knowledge to start working towards making digital sovereignty a top priority for their organisation and beyond</p>
<p>• Inspire attendees to collaborate with other departments and countries to create a more&nbsp;trusted digital sphere</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2022-galzain-trusted-digital-world"></a>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — October 31st to November&nbsp;6th <p>Welcome to another exciting edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We bring you some of the hottest news from the crypto regulations space, from the EU postponing MiCA legislation to February next year to Canadian authorities currently consulting on crypto regulations. So, let’s dive straight into it without further&nbsp;ado.</p> EU Postpones MiCA&nbsp;Vote <p>European Union lawmakers are delaying voting on the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-european-unions-proposed-markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation-mica-law-is-far-from-perfect">Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA)</a> until February. Previously, the plan was for the Parliament to vote at its December plenary session. Given the length and complexity of the text, that’s now abandoned.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny520i/status/1589386740225441792?s=20&amp;t=nXWBTGq67rAEW-NQatASww">Image Source</a>)<p>MiCA legislation was approved in June, and its final text was published in&nbsp;October.</p><p>The text, however, still needs to be officially signed off by lawmakers and EU’s Council national governments.</p><p>The EU crypto law’s provisions set reserve requirements for stablecoins and require crypto companies such as exchange platforms and wallet providers to seek authorization from national regulators. Once the final document is published in the EU’s Official Journal, it will be applied between 12 and 18&nbsp;months.</p> New “crypto token regime” in&nbsp;Dubai (<a href="https://www.agoda.com/city/dubai-ae.html?cid=1844104">Image Source</a>)<p>To encourage crypto innovation in a “measured, responsible, and transparent” way, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has introduced a new “crypto token regime.”.</p><p>After introducing regulation for investment tokens in October 2021, this regime marks the DFSA’s regulatory work’s second phase, aimed at AML/CFT, crypto trading and holding, consumer protection, market integrity, and&nbsp;custody.</p><p>The DFSA is also extending the scope of its current financial services activities to allow firms in the special economic zone DIFC (the Dubai International Financial Centre) to provide products and services related to crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><blockquote>“Our work to develop a comprehensive crypto token regime has taken into account feedback from a broad range of stakeholders. It aims to strike a balance between encouraging innovation in the DIFC and protecting the consumers of these financial products,” said DFSA CEO Ian Johnston.</blockquote> Canadian Authorities Begin Consultations on Crypto Regulation <p>The Canadian government has started consultations on cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and CBDC with shareholders to determine what regulations to impose on the crypto industry.</p><p>The ruling body says that crypto assets pose “a challenge to democratic institutions” and should be under strict supervision.</p><blockquote>“In the last several months, digital assets and cryptocurrencies have been used to avoid global sanctions and fund illegal activities, both in Canada and around the world,” noted Canada’s federal government, adding that to address these challenges, they will be launching “a financial sector legislative review focused on the digitization of money and maintaining financial sector stability and security.”</blockquote><p>As of the end of 2021, the Bank of Canada has estimated that about 13% of the nation’s adults were&nbsp;HODLers.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer!

<p>The partnership and joint market collaboration aims to help healthcare provider organizations safely deliver more patient value from their greatest digital asset, patient data.</p>
<p><br>
<a href="https://identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc</a>., a leading digital identity and access control technology company, today announced a collaboration with <a href="https://www.medicasoft.com/">MedicaSoft</a>, a leading provider of cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant software solutions and health information technology services.&nbsp; Together, they have a shared vision for the future of digital healthcare and have a highly compatible set of solutions and services ready to help healthcare providers fully realize the value of their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Healthcare challenges they’re tackling, together<br>
Today, our healthcare systems are burdened with various health platforms that silo data and fail to deliver the necessary data to its required destination.&nbsp; Healthcare providers want greater autonomy over patient data while maintaining confidentiality of the data being used and stored and having the ability to share it appropriately.&nbsp; Beyond this, the <a href="https://rce.sequoiaproject.org/">ONC/TEFCA</a> and the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Section 42</a> regulations mandate digital access to personal health information on demand and securing required consent to share information. Currently, there is no easy way to safely mobilize sensitive health data externally or across a health system without advanced authorization and consent.</p>
<p>A first of its kind solution in the healthcare market<br>
The <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html">FHIR</a> specification, the standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically, is now the basic requirement in the U.S.&nbsp; However, compliance isn’t enough to safely put data in motion. A layer of authorization and data control is also required to help providers fully realize the value and impact of the data being collected.</p>
<p>Under their partnership, IDENTOS and MedicaSoft will fill the gaps in long-standing data sharing and access challenges by offering a first of its kind solution to the healthcare market, including:</p>
<p>-FHIR compliant data strategies<br>
-FHIR compliant implementation<br>
-Fine-grain resource and scoped access<br>
-Consented data sharing and revocation<br>
-Externalized authorization<br>
-Centralized policy management<br>
-Provider and patient app support</p>
<p>These enhanced products and services will ensure both data interoperability and seamless sharing of health information between providers and existing applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
An integral union between two trusted companies<br>
MedicaSoft provides fundamental support for digital innovation in healthcare. Powered by a translation engine that can transform data into standardized inputs compliant with all standards in today’s healthcare market.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“In navigating the evolving healthcare data landscape, Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN) relies on the technical expertise, industry experience and excellent customer service consistently provided by the MedicaSoft team! MedicaSoft has been an invaluable partner in our journey, and we look forward to our continued collaboration and innovation.” &nbsp;–Dr. Jan Lee, CEO, Delaware Health Information Network</p></blockquote>
<p><br>
IDENTOS&nbsp; <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/digital-identity-service-to-place-patients-at-the-centre-of-their-care-861696514.html">implementations are already helping various health providers safely mobilize health information</a> across their digital ecosystems:</p>
<blockquote><p>“At North York General we are dedicated to building the connections patients need to access their health information and interact with the hospital online.” –Duska Kennedy, Chief Digital Officer, North York General Hospital</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“At Niagara Health, we’re excited to be leading this initiative, which will empower patients by giving them increased control over their personal health information.” –Lynn Guerriero, President and CEO, Niagara Health</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve become an innovative leader in the field of digital health… St. Joe’s patients and their loved ones can view their health information, coordinate appointments, see test results and message with their care team.” –Tara Coxon, Chief Information Officer, St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton</p></blockquote>

08 November 2022 - 10:29

                    
      
    
      
             <p>INNOPAY is proud to be launching its German version of the award-winning management book ‘Everything Transaction’ (‘Alles Transaktion’ in German) during&nbsp;Transactions (TRX).&nbsp;TRX is Germany’s pioneering event for payment, banking, tech, digitalisation and the platform economy. Each year, thought leaders from the national and international digital business gather to provide an outlook on the most important industry trends.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.transactions.io">TRX 22</a> will take place in Frankfurt on 17 November 2022 and is organised by Payment &amp; Banking. This is a leading association of the most important driving forces of the German fintech industry and operator of Paymentandbanking.com, one of the most important finance blogs in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

 Alles Transaktion 

<p>In an increasingly digital world, every interaction is becoming a transaction. These transactions go beyond the exchange of money in return for a product or service. In fact, exchanges based on data are rapidly becoming the norm in the digital world. These data-driven transactions are becoming relevant across industries, and especially in the financial services industry in the shape of ‘Open Finance’. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financial institutions have reached a strategic crossroads and need to answer several fundamental questions, including: How will transactions evolve in the context of financial services? What role should entities like financial institutions and service providers play? And which commercial opportunities and risks are involved?</p>

<p>These and many more questions are answered in the award-winning book called ‘Everything Transaction’, which has now also been published in German (‘Alles Transaktion’). The book offers numerous up-to-date insights and concepts for players operating in an increasingly data-driven economy, and helps executives better navigate the digital world from the unique perspective of data-driven transactions.</p>

 Book presentation 

<p>On Friday 25 November, we will present the book ‘Alles Transaktion’ in conjunction with Payment &amp; Banking at TechQuartier in Frankfurt. Jochen Siegert, co-founder of Payment &amp; Banking, will chair a discussion with the authors of the book as well as Mounaim Cortet, head of INNOPAY in the DACH region.</p>

<p>Today the GLEIF announced two new Validation Agents within the Global LEI System – Sparkasse Bank Malta plc and UK-based Diligencia. We are incredibly excited to announce that both organizations have become Validation Agents using Ubisecure / RapidLEI’s LEI Everywhere solution. LEI Everywhere enables mass issuance without friction or barriers, and has proven extremely popular with banks, fintechs and KYC service providers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-expands-global-footprint-of-validation-agents-with-sparkasse-bank-malta-plc-and-diligencia">GLEIF press release</a> reads that Validation Agents enable banks and other regulated institutions to leverage their KYC and AML onboarding procedures to help their clients obtain LEIs. By providing their client base with LEIs, they promote financial inclusion, while creating value and opportunities such as cross-border supply chain relationships, thanks to easier counterparty verification and simplified cross-border payments. </p>
<p>The GLEIF also asserts that the growth In Institutions becoming Validation Agents is a strong endorsement for <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/lei-solutions/mckinsey-company-and-gleif-leis-and-client-lifecycle-management-in-banking-a-u-s-4-billion-beginning">McKinsey’s research</a> findings, which revealed that broader adoption of LEIs could save banks an estimated U.S. $2-4 billion per annum in client onboarding efficiencies alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is our philosophy to establish long-term relationships with our customers ensuring the provision of efficient and seamless financial solutions. We recognize the LEI’s value in creating the transparency that strengthen ties between organizations. Our approval as a Validation Agent is a significant milestone. It enables us to streamline our approach to client lifecycle management, enhance our customer experience, and provides a uniquely powerful foundation to create new value-added services for our corporate clients.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Mifsud, Managing Director of Sparkasse Bank Malta plc</p>
<blockquote><p>“Diligencia was established with the strong belief that access to accurate information promotes stable economies and provides a foundation for growth. There is enormous potential for the MEA region to lead the way in terms of LEI issuance growth as global investors seek the transparency, trust, and confidence to engage with markets such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. As a Validation Agent, we look forward to working with GLEIF and our partners to further accelerate the issuance of LEIs across the region to broaden access to reliable entity data.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Nouri Bakkali, Managing Director, Diligencia</p>
<blockquote><p>“The global appeal of the Validation Agent role comes from its ability to deliver tangible benefits for both the Agent organization and its legal entity customers. The processes are very similar for obtaining an LEI and customer onboarding to a financial or regulated institution. A raft of information related to legal status and ownership structure, among other things, has to be provided and verified in both scenarios. By de-duplicating this process, Validation Agents can create efficiencies for both themselves, and their clients, while equipping their clients with the means of establishing trust with any other legal entity anywhere in the world, irrespective of language or location. Transparency and trust sit at the heart of good business practices.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Stephan Wolf, CEO, GLEIF</p>
<blockquote><p>”GLEIF-approved Validation Agents are using Ubisecure’s LEI Everywhere program to streamline LEI issuance for client onboarding and refresh. We’ve worked closely with the GLEIF, and our Validation Agent partners to develop the ideal solution – an API-first, automated platform that ensures Validation Agents can register LEIs without barriers or friction, and at massive scale. We are happy to support Validation Agents as they contribute to the widespread adoption of LEIs and help meet the GLEIF goal to place LEIs at the center of modern, connected business.”</p></blockquote>

  Despite pressure from resident crypto enthusiasts, Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) didn’t budge. It went ahead with its plans to make ID checks mandatory for crypto-to-cash transactions worth over 1000 Swiss Francs a&nbsp;month.  Industry proponents and crypto enthusiasts were demanding that the agency increase the monthly crypto-to-cash transaction threshold for mandatory ID checks to 25,000 Swiss Francs from 1000 Swiss&nbsp;Francs.  However, these new rules will only apply to anonymous transactions.  <p>Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is extending money-laundering checks for certain crypto transactions, which aligns with FATF’s limit for the Travel Rule provision to kick in. The new rules are scheduled to go into effect in January&nbsp;2023.</p><p>FINMA’s anti-money laundering (AML) ordinance will require customers to prove their identity if they make transactions equivalent to or more than a total of 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,000) for a month when they swap crypto for cash or any other anonymous form of&nbsp;money.</p><blockquote>“Virtual currencies are often used as a payment instrument for illicit trade, notably in drug trafficking, on the darknet, or for the payment of ransoms after cyberattacks,” a report issued by the Swiss regulator said. “The risk of money laundering in the domain of virtual currency is reinforced by potential anonymity and by the speed and cross-border nature of transactions.”</blockquote><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/uk-passes-bill-to-recognize-crypto-as-regulated-financial-instruments">UK Passes Bill to Recognize Crypto as Regulated Financial Instruments</a></p> Didn’t Budge Despite&nbsp;Pressure <p>It was back in May when FINMA first published a consultation that proposed tightening the limit to stop “smurfing,” which involves breaking up a large payment into smaller chunks to avoid money-laundering checks.</p><blockquote>Despite significant pushback from users, FINMA said “in view of the risks and recent instances of abuse,” it “stands by” its plans and would not be increasing the threshold to as much as 25,000 francs, which was what some of the country’s industry proponents and crypto enthusiasts were demanding.</blockquote><p>The new rules would only apply to anonymous transactions conducted through unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>FINMA also noted that the mandatory identity verification of beneficiaries and the periodic checks establishing that client data is up to date do not need to be detailed.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/oecd-releases-a-tax-reporting-framework-for-crypto-derivatives-stablecoins-and-nfts-2">OECD Releases a Tax Reporting Framework for Crypto Derivatives, Stablecoins, and&nbsp;NFTs</a></p> The FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Virtual asset service providers (VASPs) in Switzerland are already required to share identifiable customer data when transferring crypto if its fiat value exceeds a certain threshold and prove ownership of non-custodial wallets under the “travel rule.” The country implemented the FATF Travel Rule on August 26th,&nbsp;2019.</p><p>At first, FINMA decided to set the Travel Rule threshold at 5000 francs but later agreed to lower it to 1000 Swiss francs, citing increased money laundering risks.</p><p>Interestingly, the latest rules come when Switzerland is setting itself out as a crypto hub. And the plans seem to be working, as over 1,000 blockchain companies currently operate in Switzerland, encouraged by the welcoming political and legal infrastructure.</p><p>Speaking of the FATF Travel Rule, we have some excellent news for VASP. Any VASPs that integrate to Shyft mainnet before December 31st will <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/shyft-dao-approves-veriscope-vasp-grant-proposal-to-enable-free-fatf-travel-rule-transactions-77e51d735cd6">receive free SHFT tokens</a> to pay for the gas fees consumed while posting attestations on Veriscope. However, the offer may also end before the said date if the fund of 10,000 SHFT is exhausted before&nbsp;that.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

				  Open source software sits in contrast to proprietary — or “closed source” — software. With proprietary software, only the legal owners of the source code have the right to access, copy, or alter the code, and the software must be used only for its intended purpose. Open source software, on the other hand, allows the user to access, modify, share, and use the code base in almost any way, including redistribution based on the open source license.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Building software through open source methods is increasingly popular, and it’s not hard to see why. First, the codebase is free and free beats expense; second, free means more people will use it and more use leads to continuous development from those using it, often through working groups; this has two important aspects: increased innovation and increased resilience. Third, open source provides flexibility as you can adjust existing code to your specific use case rather than have to start coding from scratch.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.openlogic.com/success/resources/2022-open-source-report">2022 Open Source Report</a>, the main values organizations see in open source technology is that it gives them access to innovations and the latest technologies, an overall production cost reduction, and frees them from vendor lock-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if the code is free, why do you need companies like Indicio?</p>
<p>An analogy might help. If you think of an open source codebase as a pile of wood, pipes, wires, and glass that you want to use to build a house, you could build that house on your own — if you have all the necessary skills, from architectural design to plumbing. Or, you could hire a contractor who has all these skills and a track record of building great houses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what open source companies like Indicio do: they serve as your partner or guide, adapting the codebase to your specific needs, providing technical support, and managing interoperability with your current systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio also offers kit or pre-built solutions like <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a>, where the codebase is rendered to provide a more plug and play experience, and is pre configured and ready to use for specific use cases right out of the box.</p>
<p>How to choose an open source provider</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing your partner in open source development there are a few factors to keep in mind, just as in choosing any kind of contractor. Do they contribute to the open source code base or just implement it? How open source is their solution? How big is their open source community and how involved are they?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contributing to an open source community is a bigger deal than some might think at first glance. It means the company will have a deep, working familiarity with the code; indeed, their engineers could well have helped to create it. They will be aware of updates and additional functionality on the code’s development roadmap, and if the company has customers that consistently request features you are interested in, they can draw the working groups attention to those needs, and work towards making those features part of the codebase.</p>
<p>One other thing to keep in mind is how open source the open source solution you’re thinking of using really is. One of the biggest benefits of open source is you avoid vendor lock in and if most of the code is built on open source, this holds true. But, if only pieces are built on open source, then it may be difficult to adapt the code down the line, if it turns out that you need to. It’s always a good idea to assess whether the full solution is open source.</p>
<p>Lastly, it matters how big an open source community is. It is quite literally the difference between having hundreds of mechanics that can work on your Honda, or the one <a href="https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States">Tesla certified mechanic</a> within your state (if you even have one!) Some companies will have claimed to have open sourced their software, but if they’re the only ones that contribute to or work on the codebase it still doesn’t help you avoid that vendor lock-in&nbsp;— plus, updates will be subject to their team’s timeline.</p>
<p>When it comes to open source decentralization technology Indicio works with the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, a branch of the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/?sscid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966CIZptMERGQfbN1r8QvekUhLsMJKKnPWFSxYATy70-HmpMlyP0eDwQaAsMaEALw_wcB&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966CIZptMERGQfbN1r8QvekUhLsMJKKnPWFSxYATy70-HmpMlyP0eDwQaAsMaEALw_wcB">Linux Foundation</a>, and one of the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-totally-dominates-supercomputers/">biggest</a> and most-contributed-to open source projects.

<p>While zero trust implementation can advance your security, you may want to know of the best practices to really get the most out of your zero trust framework.</p>
<p>What are the main concepts of zero trust? The main concepts of zero trust are:</p>
 
 User Authentication 
 Least Privilege Access 
 Continuous Monitoring 
 Response and Remediation 
 
 What Is Zero Trust? 
<p>As the name suggests, “zero trust” is an approach to system and network security where trust between that system and a user or device is never assumed but always re-examined and re-established as the user performs actions and interacts with resources.</p>
<p>So, for example, once a user logs in to an application or a server, the system will continually require them to re-authenticate themselves as they change their user context (moving into new servers, accessing different files, executing different applications, etc.).</p>
<p>This lack of inherent trust between a system and a user extends across all resources in a system, calling for rigorous and ongoing monitoring of security related to data, applications, and network resources. Implementing several types of security technologies to promote zero-trust principles is called a zero-trust architecture.</p>
 Zero-Trust Architecture 
<p>Implementing a technical architecture to ensure zero-trust practices involves touching on all the critical attack surfaces through which hackers could abuse system trust to breach a system. The particulars will vary from system to system and between organizations, but the National Institute for Standards and Technology (<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/nist-cybersecurity-compliance/">NIST</a>) has offered a framework for ZTA.</p>
<p>NIST Special Publication 800-207, “Zero Trust Architecture,” offers a generalized approach to zero trust that addresses the core requirements for ZTA. This document defines logical components, such as policy enforcement points, continuous diagnostics, compliance systems, threat intelligence, and network logs.</p>
<p>Further, this publication also provides suggestions for implementing actual architecture around these components, including:</p>
 
 Enhanced Identity Governance: This approach calls for the use of policies around actor identities, including roles, attributes, use history, devices used, and environmental factors. 
 Micro-Segmentation: This approach follows a strategy of segmenting network resources from one another such that users, data, and system assets are logically separated from each other and connected via network gateways. 
 Network Infrastructure and Software-Defined Perimeters: This approach involves using different layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model to monitor network perimeters and internal network traffic to monitor and enforce zero-trust principles. 
 
<p>While there are several different components, layers, and models for zero-trust architecture, some basic features will always be present:</p>
 
 User Authentication: Strong authentication, almost always through multi-factor methods, is necessary to implement zero-trust at system perimeters. Without a reliable and secure way to verify user identities when they try to access resources, there is no ZTA. 
 Least Privilege Access: In ZTA, it’s critical that the system re-authorize users as they interact with new resources and applications. Moreover, this re-authorization should follow the Principle of Least Privilege, which states that resource access should only extend as far as the user’s immediate job or task. 
 Continuous Monitoring: NIST states that a true ZTA will never assume that a resource or user is inherently trustworthy and must be regularly monitored. 
 Response and Remediation: Any security breach, or suspected vulnerability, must be immediately addressed and remediated. Any security event must have an immediate response. 
 
 What Are Some Best Practices for Implementing Zero-Trust Architecture? 
<p>Best practices in zero-trust systems revolve around maintaining the level of security required to ensure that the entire concept of always-on verification and monitoring is reliable. These best practices, therefore, extend across the entire landscape of technologies used within a system, albeit with different applications depending on the context (user identification, monitoring, etc.).</p>
<p>Some of these best practices include:</p>
 
 Utilize <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">Multi-Factor Authentication</a>: A best practice for almost any security posture, specifically called out by NIST in their <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-security-framework/">zero-trust framework</a>, is using MFA to strengthen authentication. Because properly identifying and vetting users logging into a system is so critical to ZTA and all the components therein, the importance of having a strong MFA can’t be understated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a floor-up practice, rock-solid authentication is the baseline for ZTA, the “front door” of system access, and anything that can bolster that security (passwordless security, hardware-based MFA, liveness testing, identity assurance) is essential here. 
 &nbsp;Validate Devices: Your employees and users will almost certainly connect to wireless networks through various devices, whether mobile devices or laptops, as part of their work. Under ZTA, you cannot simply trust that a device that has been verified once is forever trustworthy, and as such, a regular device validation solution will be necessary. 
 Create Zero-Trust Networks: A zero-trust network (ZTN) is a sub-component of ZTA, focusing specifically on user interactions and network components. A ZTN will verify user access whenever they move between devices, gateways, or network segments. 
 Lean on the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">Principle of Least Privilege</a>: The Principle of Least Privilege dictates that no user or process has elevated privileges beyond exactly what they need to accomplish their task.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While this might seem like a no-brainer, you’d be surprised how easy it is for privilege creep to slip into systems with complex user hierarchies or without proper role administration. By following PoLP, however, you can minimize the impact of a compromised account. 
 Implement Automation: Behavioral monitoring and AI have grown as useful tools to help security experts better understand potential threats. As such, these solutions are quickly becoming a system monitoring component, particularly in ZTA contexts where the admins must explicitly assume that any user or resource could be compromised.

				 <p>In our <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/product-passports-trust-registries/">previous post</a>, we explored the advantages of Trust Registries and a decentralized ecosystem for Product Passports. Trust Registries are essential for managing trust and reputation; they allow us to confirm that the data shared is accurate and current. Digital product passports have numerous potential uses across industries like transportation, forestry, mining, energy and healthcare. This post showcases some real-world examples of Digital Product Passports and Trust Registries.</p>
 Product Circulatory Data Sheet 
<p>+ImpaKT has designed the <a href="http://positiveimpakt.eu/en/pcds/">Product Circulatory Data Sheet</a> (PCDS), a universal digital circulatory fingerprint for products. Throughout the supply chain, each provider is responsible for creating and storing the PCDS that will be accessible to customers/users. The data template has pre-set true/false statements, enabling the user to describe a product’s circulatory properties without revealing trade secrets. After a third-party verification process to analyze the PCDS’ validity, the information is shared within a standardized IT exchange protocol that circulates trusted data without relying on a centralized database. This IT exchange protocol is secure and dependable due to the Trust Registry used among 50+ enterprises and affiliate organizations from 12 European countries and the USA. The PCDS is endorsed by NGOs and business frontrunners in the circular economy and is already used in product data forums for the building industry.</p>
 Digital Product Passport 
<p>Spherity, one of Europe’s leading decentralized digital identity technology providers, has <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/digital-identity-company-spherity-becomes-a-member-of-the-global-battery-alliance-15a327de9abd">joined the Global Battery Alliance</a> to support the development of the GBA Battery Passport, a solution to boost compliance with EU regulatory requirements. As of January 2026, Companies operating in the EU-wide manufacturing and trade industry will need to comply with the New <a href="https://www.eba250.com/legislation-market/eu-legislation/">EU Battery Regulations</a> and will be required to implement a digital product passport. Spherity’s<a href="https://www.spherity.com/digital-product-passport"> decentralized Digital Product Passport</a> aims to increase trustworthy, verifiable information about batteries, textiles, building materials and electronics; their reuse, content, and recycling process. The Digital Product passport is easy to integrate, interoperable, SAP-Certified and based on W3C Standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The<a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en"> EU Action Plan</a> includes electronics, textiles, construction, plastics and food measures.

 Project Overview  Context <p>At Onfido, we help protect businesses against fraud by verifying their customers’ identities. This process requires users to take a photo or a video of their identity documents and their faces. In what follows, I relate the creation of the new Motion product and how we improved the face-capture experience through user empathy, cross-functional collaboration, and an iterative process.</p> My team <p>Initially, the team included a Product Designer (myself), a User Experience Researcher (<a href="https://medium.com/u/bc0ccce22a4c">Sofya Bourne</a>), and Applied Scientists. Our objective was to find opportunities to improve Onfido’s facial verification solutions.</p><p>My role was to design the best-in-class user experience for the new facial verification product and to support my team in its implementation. I was involved in all stages of this product’s creation: from ideation to the&nbsp;release.</p><p>Today, due to the value this project has generated, our team is bigger. I am now working directly&nbsp;with:</p>  A Product&nbsp;Manager  An Engineering Lead  An Applied Science&nbsp;Lead  A UX Researcher  4 Applied Scientists  6 Front-End Engineers (2 iOS, 2 Android, 2&nbsp;Web)  A Test&nbsp;Engineer  A Product Operations Analyst   Problems   User problem: Our current Selfie Video product was designed to block more advanced fraud than our Selfie Photo product by adding movement and voice challenges. Specifically, it asked users to do a head-turn and to read out loud 3 random digits. These challenges lacked granular feedback and added complexity which could mean too much negative friction for genuine users, resulting in frustration, drop-off, and false rejections.  Business problem: The Selfie Video product is good at catching more advanced fraud but was not designed for automation. Its manual reviews take longer processing time and have higher&nbsp;costs.   Goals <p>I was responsible for both setting user experience goals and ensuring we meet them. In addition, I contributed to setting product performance goals.</p><p>On the whole, our objective was to create a simple, smooth, and pleasant user experience which would be accessible and transparent. At the same time, we were to achieve full automation, reduce processing time, reduce False Acceptance Rates and False Rejection Rates, and achieve iBeta level 2 compliance (a fraud performance industry standard).</p> Design Process <p>I worked closely with <a href="https://medium.com/u/bc0ccce22a4c">Sofya Bourne</a>, who led the UX Research. Together we planned the research, sampled the qualitative and quantitative data it had produced, and translated it into insights to ensure we achieved our goals. Overall, this project included 11 rounds of user research and design iterations. We created 30 design prototypes and 20 native prototypes and tested them with users by conducting more than 70 face-to-face interviews and by collecting over 100 responses to our UX surveys. We took extra care to conduct user testing with people from diverse backgrounds to prevent our learnings from being&nbsp;biased.</p> Discovery <p>To design relevant and engaging experiences and interactions, I had to identify the fraud signals needed for Machine Learning models, as well as empathise with users’ expectations and concerns regarding facial verification. I took a user-centred approach and designed 25 prototypes with various interactions. Then, with the help of <a href="https://medium.com/u/bc0ccce22a4c">Sofya Bourne</a>, we conducted interviews with&nbsp;users.</p><p>From these interviews we learned the following:</p>  Users prefer captures with minimal and/or simple interactions  The speed of the capture process should be well balanced: if it is too slow users are frustrated, and the product feels laggy. If it is too fast users can get confused, feel a lack of control, or perceive the product as less reliable.  It is important for users to understand the relationship between a required interaction and a facial verification process (e.g. capturing more details of the face) and the value they get from that interaction (e.g. security purposes)  Using patterns from gaming can help people understand and engage with the required interactions. However, the verification process shouldn’t feel like a game; it should be serious and professional.  Users believe that the user interface reflects the product’s reliability and its technological efficiency.   Device movement VS Head&nbsp;movement <p>After the interviews, I asked Applied Scientists to review the data that was generated by the different prototypes. We discovered that the prototypes that captured users’ faces in motion provided significantly better signals for our Machine Learning models to detect&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>To define the ideal movement that would generate good signals (a device movement or a head movement), I created 4 design prototypes and tested users’ reactions to lateral and circular movements with their devices filming their faces (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>We were able to identify the kind of movements with which people felt the most comfortable. But since the design prototypes were not responsive to live movements, the users’ feedback was insufficient. Subsequently, I worked with an iOS engineer and created 20 native prototypes that we tested with users (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>According to our tests, head motions felt more natural. Users intuitively understood the connection between the movement and the verification process. Head motions were also more predictable as the possible physical movements are limited. Overall, users preferred a lateral head-turn movement which provided enough signals for Machine Learning models. We discovered that requiring users to turn their heads in a specific order was limiting users’ control, and they preferred the freedom of turning their heads as they wished. Additionally, a majority of users wanted to be able to keep an eye on their screen while turning their heads, meaning we had to reduce the range of movement required.</p><p>Eventually, I created a completion pattern as an intuitive way of guiding our users. As the users turn their heads to the left or right, a progress line follows their head movement and indicates when a side is complete. I also added vibrations at key moments to draw users’ attention.</p> Validation on all platforms <p>After finding the best user experience for iOS users, I needed to check if our findings also apply to Android and Web (desktop) users. I worked with engineers from the three platforms to create and test native prototypes on iOS, Android, and Web (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>Even though users from the different platforms tend to have their own mental models (for instance, iOS users are used to Face ID head-roll motion), all users were able to use our new head-turn experience with no&nbsp;problem.</p><p>There were a few adjustments that needed to be made to provide the same experience on all three platforms. Our team had to refine the pattern on Android and Web as their face tracking was not as smooth as iOS. We also realised how much the difference between devices and cameras could impact the user experience. This pushed us to test more&nbsp;devices.</p> Alpha release <p>Based on all the previous learnings, I designed a simple flow with the lateral head-turn experience that would fit into our overall identity verification process. I then worked with iOS and Android engineers to implement Motion in our Software Development Kit (SDK). (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>Before launching this product with real customers, we asked 40 users to test it and to fill out a UX survey to understand how people were experiencing Motion at a bigger scale. This UX survey will be re-used for future major updates. This way we can compare results and measure improvements over time. Finally, our Product Manager (<a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/giulia-di-nola-75495418">@Giulia Di Nola</a>) recruited 3 customers to Alpha test the new Motion&nbsp;product.</p><blockquote>“Motion enables [our customers] to set up an account in seconds and be on their way on one of our mopeds, while enabling us to keep operating costs low and run efficiently as an agile and high-growth business.” Rick van’t Hof, Product&nbsp;@Check</blockquote> Results  Measuring success <p>We were all extremely proud to see real people using Motion to verify their identity with no problem! We are now waiting for more users to capture their faces via Motion so that we can learn from them and move to the next stage of iterations.</p><p>The qualitative and quantitative feedback we got from users, and metrics we tracked from our production data, allowed us to analyse how well we performed against our goals so&nbsp;far.</p><p>Quality of the user experience measured against the product principles that we&nbsp;created:</p>  Simplicity: 82.5% of users found the steps easy to complete and 90% of users succeeded in capturing their faces on their first&nbsp;try  Control: users can decide the order of head-turns and keep their eyes on their&nbsp;screen  Speed: the head turn interaction is fast, taking only 5 seconds on average for people to&nbsp;complete  Delightfulness: 92.5% of users reported a positive experience  Accessibility: an accessibility audit has been performed by the <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre</a> (DAC). Motion Alpha is already very accessible. It only needs more work on supporting screen readers to be <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_overview&amp;levels=aaa&amp;showtechniques=131">level AA</a> (accessibility standard in digital services)  Transparency: users can see which data will be collected. To be fully transparent, 45% of users said they would like to see a preview of the recording  <p>Technical performances of our product measured against key performance indicators:</p>  Automation: we successfully achieved a product with 100% automation  Processing time: 99% of users’ faces are processed in less than 20&nbsp;seconds  Pass rate: 96.6% of users’ faces have been&nbsp;cleared  False Acceptance Rate (FAR): we are below 1% of falsely cleared&nbsp;users  False Rejection Rate (FRR): we are below 1% of falsely rejected&nbsp;users  Fraud prevention: we were granted <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/iso-30107-3-presentation-attack-detection-confirmation-letters/">iBeta level 2</a> on both iOS and&nbsp;Android   Next steps <p>Now after we have released the new Motion product for Alpha customers, I will work with a Product Operations Analyst to track specific UX metrics and measure the performance of Motion at scale (e.g. drop-off, completion timing, percentages of first-time success, etc.). I will then turn metrics from production data into insights to fine-tune the user experience. I will also work on accessibility (e.g. support screen readers for visually impaired users) and on increasing the device and platform coverage.</p><p>Since this article was written, we have launched our Beta release in September 2022. The next step is a General Availability release when the product will be available for every customer.</p> Key learnings  Cross-functional collaboration <p>Building Motion was a team effort. I constantly collaborated with different stakeholders from various functions, listening to my colleagues and making sure that I have a good understanding of what they were trying to achieve while advocating for good design. This was essential to designing a realistic solution.</p> Iterative process <p>My team followed a two-week sprint approach. This allowed me to focus on designing and building essentials, test various prototypes, and gather feedback from real users as quickly as possible. Consequently, I was able to learn, reflect, and iterate fast. This approach has given my team and me confidence in the success of my designs throughout the entire&nbsp;process.</p> Measuring success <p>To reflect and improve on my solutions, measuring success was done at each iteration. The way in which I measured success evolved according to the stage of the product. In the early stages, we mainly collected qualitative data by talking directly to users. Then, we collected both qualitative and quantitative data by testing a few prototypes on a bigger scale. Finally, we collected quantitative data by tracking users’ behaviour in production. My job was to translate these different types of data into insights to validate the success of my&nbsp;designs.</p><p>Oh, and my face eventually appeared on a billboard in Las Vegas as part of our launch of Motion ads during the Money20/20 event.</p> Learn more about&nbsp;Motion   <a href="https://onfido.com/resources/blog/onfido-launches-motion-the-next-generation-of-facial-biometric-technology-improving-verification-speed-by-12x">Onfido Blog Post: Onfido launches&nbsp;Motion</a>  <a href="https://go.onfido.com/landing/building-ai-without-bias">Onfido Whitepaper: Building AI without&nbsp;bias</a>  <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/onfido-launches-industry-first-biometric-id-verification-system-motion">The Next Web Article: UK scaleup launches groundbreaking approach to ID verification: turning your&nbsp;head</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/IoScEjYYn94">BBC Series: The Secret Genius of Modern&nbsp;Life</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/motion-onfidos-next-generation-of-facial-biometrics-5c19ef0b50a0">Motion: Onfido’s next generation of facial biometrics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The last few Holochain releases have been without breaking changes but contain multiple bug fixes and a few new features.</p><p>Over the weekend, a group of about 25 folks met in Berlin, Germany for the first Holochain hackathon since before the pandemic. A few interesting hApps were built, of course, and there was a clear desire for more in-person events like this.</p><p>And finally, we’re talking a lot about hREA these days. If you’re thinking about building software for economic coordination, you now have an off-the-shelf library to get you started. Scroll to the bottom for highlights.</p> Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.0.167: SweetConductorConfig <p>Release date: 10 October 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.1 to 0.1.4<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152 to 0.0.155<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>New (Sweettest): If you’re using Sweettest in your Rust-based hApp testing, there’s a new struct that lets you create various conductor configurations more easily. <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/0.0.168/holochain/sweettest/struct.SweetConductorConfig.html"><code>SweetConductorConfig</code></a> wraps around <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/0.0.168/holochain/conductor/api/conductor/struct.ConductorConfig.html"><code>ConductorConfig</code></a> and lets you choose common networking scenarios. Some of them are useful only for Holochain devs testing gossip, but others could be used to test offline or low connectivity scenarios. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1616">#1616</a>) This comes along with other changes to Holochain proper, which may or may not affect your Sweettest tests: <code>ConductorHandle</code> has been merged into <code>Conductor</code>.

(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1627">#1627</a>)</p><p>New (<code>hc</code> command): Bundle unpacking commands (e.g., <code>hc dna unpack</code>) now have a <code>--raw</code> flag, making them work even if the manifest file’s format doesn’t match the format that the current version of the command expects. This is useful when you want to ‘salvage’ bundles that were created with previous versions of <code>hc</code> that used different manifest formats. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1593">#1593</a>)</p><p>Additionally, the dev team has started to add diagnostic tools to the conductor, giving them insight into how much time and resources gossip rounds are taking. This is part of an ongoing effort to improve gossip performance. This has come along with a bump in default gossip parameters; the defaults for recent and historic gossip bandwidth limits, both inbound and outbound, have been increased to 100 mbps.

(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1583">#1583</a>)</p><p>New (<code>hc</code> command): hApp bundles (both <code>.happ</code> and <code>.webhapp</code>) can now be bundled recursively; that is, it’ll read the app manifest, look for all the referenced DNA manifests, and pack the DNAs before packing the whole hApp. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1628">#1628</a>)</p><p>New (HDK): The HDK now pins the HDI version it depends on. The reasons for this are documented in issue <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1596">#1596</a> and involve dependency resolution issues that were introduced once HDI’s version number was bumped to 0.1.x. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1605">#1605</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.170: Authorise signing key, get DNA def <p>Release date: 2 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.1 to 0.1.7<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152 to 0.0.158<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>New (admin API): This release brings two new admin API functions (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1641">#1641</a>):</p>  <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.AuthorizeZomeCallSigningKey"><code>AuthorizeZomeCallSigningKey</code></a> lets the author of a chain create a new capability grant on a given source chain. This lets a hApp installer authorise a client that wants to use a cell without requiring the client to actually hold the author key. In spite of the name, it can be used to create any kind of grant, not just ones that involve a signing key. It does, however, require a provenance from the cell’s author key. This is further prep work for the moment when all local zome function calls must supply a valid capability token. Future breaking change warning: this has already been modified in the <code>develop</code> branch (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1647">#1647</a>) and the changes will be included in 0.0.172; the name will be changed to <code>GrantZomeCallCapability</code> and the <code>provenance</code> field will be dropped.  <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.GetDnaDefinition"><code>GetDnaDefinition</code></a> lets you interrogate a cell for its DNA definition — not just hash-modifying components such as <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/prelude/struct.DnaModifiers.html"><code>DnaModifiers</code></a> and integrity zomes, but also currently installed coordinator zomes. The return value is a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_zome_types/latest/holochain_zome_types/dna_def/struct.DnaDef.html"><code>DnaDef</code></a> struct.  <p>As admin API functions, these aren’t generally available to a hApp’s UI and are meant for people implementing end-user Holochain runtimes — for example, the Launcher and <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/electron-holochain-template">self-contained Electron apps</a>. The official JavaScript and Rust clients will be adapted to recognise what sort of execution environment they’re in and do the right thing.</p> Holochain 0.0.171: DNA modifiers in hApp manifest bug fix <p>Release date: 2 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.1 to 0.1.7<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152 to 0.0.158<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>Bug fix: This out-of-schedule release brings one small bug fix. DNA modifiers specified in a hApp manifest file (network seed, properties, and origin time) weren’t being honoured.

If you’ve experienced this bug, please talk to us on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MwPvM4Vffg">DEV.HC Discord</a> server.   Client release notes  JavaScript client 0.9.3: getDnaDefinition admin API function <p>This release supports Holochain 0.0.170’s new admin API function that allows you to get information about an installed DNA by its hash (see release notes for 0.0.170 above). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/135">#135</a>). It also fixes a bug involving improper serialisation of <code>AppEntryType</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/136">#136</a>).</p> Launcher release notes  Launcher 0.7.0: A whole new UI <p>Release date: 8 October 2022<br>Supported Holochain versions: 0.0.162, 0.0.165</p><p>This release is a big one. It features a beautifully redesigned UI, the result of a collaboration between a UX designer and the Launcher maintainer. You should check it out; it’s quite inviting and easy to use.</p>Holochain Launcher 0.7.0 shows off its redesigned UI, with hApp UIs that open up in Launcher itself<p>There’s another big change: UIs now open up in their own Launcher windows (it’s using an embedded WebView in the background). This improves the security of web hApps — in fact, this change was made in anticipation of the upcoming breaking change to Holochain, in which <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/">capabilities</a> will finally be enforced on all zome function calls. This will reduce vulnerability to attacks from locally installed malware. With calls coming from embedded WebViews, the Launcher knows that it’s an ‘official’ UI making the call and applies the author capability (that is, the owner of the source chain), which gives strong protection with no hassle for devs.</p><p>We’re aware that some applications want ‘headless’ hApps without a bundled UI, either ones that are accessed from another hApp’s cells or UIs, or have an external client (e.g., a hybrid Web2/Holochain UI or a background service that polls an IoT sensor). As you can see above, there’s a section in the Launcher’s installed apps screen for those, and the Launcher still exposes their functions via a local WebSocket port which will soon require capability tokens as described in the previous paragraph.</p> Launcher 0.7.1: Holochain version support, bug fix <p>Release date: 27 October 2022<br>Supported Holochain versions: 0.0.162, 0.0.165, 0.0.169</p><p>This small release adds support for Holochain version 0.0.169 with HDI 0.1.6 and HDK 0.0.157. It also fixes a few small UI issues.</p><p>Get <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.7.1">Launcher 0.7.1</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p> Scenes from Berlin Hackathon <p>The first Holochain hackathon in about two years finally happened this past weekend in Berlin, Germany, at the headquarters of <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom</a>. It was attended by roughly 20 people, who got together to talk ideas and start implementing them. We saw a few exciting projects get their start here, including:</p>  An app for <a href="https://github.com/matthme/distreviewed">peer review of academic papers</a> that takes the journals out of the middle without sacrificing reach  An integration between Holochain and Jolocom's Web3 identity wallet  An app that allows members of a group to collaborative draft a constitution in Holochain and publish it to a <a href="https://github.com/matthme/distreviewed">Cosmos</a> appchain  Infrastructure for building ‘social assembly’ tools — think work bees, flash mobs, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/PermaBlitz">permablitzes</a>, festivals, and other contribution-based events and the communities that form around them  <p>Holochain hackathons aren’t like your usual hackathon. Rather than competition and prizes, they prioritise cooperating on shared goals and mutual learning. The pace is a lot calmer as a result.</p><p>There was also a lot of interest in having more regular in-person events around the world. If you want to come to the next hackathon or meetup near you, sign up for our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/#subscribe">newsletter</a> or follow our <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain">Twitter account</a>.</p> Holochain In Action videos: Cell cloning and hWorldle <p>I’ve got two videos from the Holochain in Action community for you. The first one walks through all the cell cloning features I described in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/cell-cloning-milestone/">last Dev Pulse</a> (and caught a couple mistakes!)</p><p>And the second one delves into the code behind <a href="https://github.com/kansmama/hwordle">hWordle</a> — yes, the open-source Wordle game, ported to Holochain and given multiplayer features like status sharing (and, in the future, maybe word lists shared among friends and family).</p> Update from hREA project <p>The <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> project has posted an <a href="https://opencollective.com/hrea/updates/major-milestone-release-build-phase-is-done-whats-next">update</a> on their OpenCollective funding page. As you may know, they reached their first major milestone release, version <a href="https://github.com/h-REA/hREA/releases/tag/happ-0.1.0-beta">0.1.0-beta</a>, in September. This release includes:</p>  A set of zomes that fully implement all of the <a href="https://valueflo.ws">Valueflows</a> economic grammar spec except <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/agents/#agent-relationships">agent relationships</a> (for creating groups and partnerships) and <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/concepts/recipes/">recipes</a> (for open-sourcing production and logistics processes in a collaborative economy)  A full (and passing) test suite  A GraphQL client that mediates between a DNA that uses hREA zomes and a client that conforms to Valueflows’ <a href="https://lab.allmende.io/valueflows/vf-schemas/vf-graphql/-/tree/sprout/lib/schemas">GraphQL spec</a>  A comprehensive <a href="https://docs.hrea.io/">documentation</a> website  A beautiful <a href="https://hrea.io">introductory website</a>  <p>The next stage of development will involve completing the final two ValueFlows features and using hREA to build real applications for the folks who are <a href="https://blog.holochain.com/economy-as-ecosystem/">excited to start using it</a>. They’re still <a href="https://opencollective.com/hrea">accepting financial contributions</a>, which will be managed by an informal consortium to further the completion of the project.</p><p>And if you’re not familiar with this constellation of projects… Valueflows is an ontology for economic coordination. It aims to provide a minimal yet complete set of semantics for defining all sorts of flows of resources between economic actors, and can be used to build applications that support bookkeeping, enterprise resource management, supply chain, and next-horizon organising structures like <a href="http://ovn.world/index.php?title=Main_Page">open value networks</a>.</p><p>The creators of Valueflows have been working closely with hApp developers to build out hREA, which is Holochain’s implementation of the spec. Connor Turland, who has been involved in hREA development for the past few months, describes it as “basically an API in a box”, like Shopify but more versatile and connected to a peer-to-peer database. He says that you don’t need to build a database backend and you don’t need to learn Rust to get started.</p><p>Here’s a little bit of my story: Five years ago I was looking for something to help our local community garden project keep track of shared work and harvest projects. I didn’t find what I was looking for, but I did find a strange and compelling project called Holochain. As I learned more about it, I realised that it did speak to my desire for such software (and more). Now I see the very thing I was imagining come to life as a collection of modules for building apps, and I’m absolutely thrilled.</p><p>We’re talking a lot about hREA and Valueflows right now, because we’re excited that it’s maturing. We see it as the foundation of a lot of the next Holochain apps, as well as a whole host of application classes we’ve never dreamed of. We’ve published an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/happs-spotlight-hrea/">interview with Connor</a>, a set of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/economy-as-ecosystem">case studies</a> on three groups that plan to use hREA, and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsIut-gtCvQ">Ecosystem Sessions video</a>. Watch the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/project-hrea/">hREA blog category</a>, Holochain’s <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain">Twitter account</a>, and our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Holochain/videos">YouTube channel</a> for more as they come out.</p><p>And finally, if you want to get involved, you can <a href="https://opencollective.com/hrea">sponsor the project</a>, or <a href="https://discord.gg/3CCUSFV6xr">join their Discord</a> to learn how to start building Valueflows hApps.</p>

<p>SSO Protocols can be extremely helpful in your organization as it cuts down on time spent on logins, but how do you choose which protocol to use?</p>
<p>What is SSO? SSO stands for Single Sign-On (SSO), a type of federated identity management where a user only needs to log in with one set of credentials to gain access to many applications.</p>
 What is a Single Sign-On Protocol? 
<p>Single Sign-On (SSO) is an approach to authentication that reduces the number of logins a user must engage with by allowing them to authenticate with multiple platforms through a single platform.</p>
<p>The user logs in once, and that login authenticates them across several different systems. This is also known, in some cases, as “federated” identity management, with a few differences between the two terms based on their applicability.<br>
To support SSO as a legitimate technology, the underlying infrastructure must promote the same priorities as any other form of authentication–anonymity, security, and reliability. A single sign-on protocol allows for the secure communication of authentication and identity verification from an SSO provider and participating platforms,</p>
 How Do SSO Protocols Work? 
<p>The primary task that an SSO protocol is intended to accomplish is to facilitate authentication between different accounts, systems, or platforms. It wouldn’t be very secure to send usernames or passwords between different accounts simply, nor is it feasible to expect every platform to support the same forms of biometrics or MFA capabilities.<br>
That’s why SSO protocols will often use a common series of responsibilities and actions:</p>
 
 An Identity Provider (IdP) manages the central authentication server. This is where the core authentication steps will be taken–managing digital identities, processing user credentials, handling MFA factors, or other forms of authentication. You get a general idea if you’ve ever been asked to use Facebook or Google to log in to a third-party platform. 
 Once the IdP affirms the user’s credentials, they start an SSO session with the platform the user is attempting to log into. They will often exchange proof of trust (such as a secure certificate) and, depending on the protocol, exchange information through an SSO server. 
 The IdP will then pass information as a token to the SSO server, and the platform or application will confirm that the user has been authenticated and allowed access. The token is encrypted and signed, meaning the SSO server can guarantee that it hasn’t been falsified or modified. 
 
 What are the Different Types of SSO Protocols? 
<p>Like any other technology, there are multiple ways to operate a basic SSO protocol, and these different approaches all follow different application domains or security philosophies. All have their place, and all have been deployed in one way or another in some industry or specific infrastructure.<br>
Some of the most common SSO protocols include:</p>
 
 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): LDAP is a tool for local network access of files and folders in a system. This software protocol allows users to locate and identify individual users, resources (files, folders, devices), or even organizations connected to an intranet. 
 
<p>The LDAP server serves as a central authentication space that allows users to connect to the intranet and, depending on that authentication, connects to other connected devices and servers.</p>
 
 Kerberos: Kerberos provides secret-key cryptography and strong authentication for local single sign-on using a ticket-based system. A central server handles tickets generated from users attempting to access system resources, and the ticket authentication allows the user to proceed. 
 
<p>Kerberos is freely available through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is often deployed in academic settings when the institution doesn’t have a contract for a third-party cloud and application provider like Google or Microsoft.</p>
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML): This open protocol uses XML to facilitate the exchange of authentication data between IdPs, an SSO server, and participating platforms. 
 OAuth 2: OAuth 2 provides SSO access for web applications and user accounts over HTTPS–chiefly using web resources and social media platforms. 
 
<p>Suppose the user wants to link an application to their social media account (say, by linking a browser game to their Facebook account for updates). In that case, this protocol facilitates that request and authorizes data sharing.</p>
 
 OpenID Connect: OpenID Connect, or OIDC, uses OAuth 2 and JSON Web Tokens to support customer facing SSO. This includes uses in web applications, mobile applications, or hybrid web-mobile apps. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of SSO? 
<p>Single Sign-On is a significant benefit for almost every organization that adopts it–which may seem counterintuitive for some readers. By centralizing authentication, it may seem like organizations are just inviting the potential for hackers and other security threats at a single point of failure.<br>
The truth is that SSO introduces more robust security, stronger interoperability, and better user experiences.<br>
Some of these benefits include:</p>
 
 Eliminating User Error: The weakest link in the security chain is, more often than not, the user. This security weakness is only amplified when these users have to juggle multiple complex, ever-changing username and password combinations. 
 
<p>With a single combination, the user is likelier to use an appropriately complex set of credentials. Since many SSO providers also offer MFA, the benefits of that MFA will also extend to connected platforms and applications.</p>
 
 Centralized Security and Auditing: Security auditing is critical to managing any authentication infrastructure. With a centralized IdP and authentication server, enterprises can minimize their security footprint and make auditing much easier–thus making compliance and reporting easier. 
 Access Control: With a centralized authentication server, you can much more easily implement effective access control mechanisms based on role or other user attributes.

GitHubspruceid    </a>  As mentioned in a previous update, most of our efforts are currently focused on a product that will make working with Sign-In with Ethereum even easier for developers. Additionally, this initiative will also include enhancements to existing applications and additional information on user interactions. Interested in testing this out early? <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">Get in touch</a>!  As mentioned in a previous update, we're specifying ReCaps which provides concise wallet-signable messages with capability delegations. If approved, this will be EIP-5573, and an extension specification to Sign-In with Ethereum. For more information on ReCaps, check out this post:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/extending-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-authorizations-recap/">  Extending Sign-In with Ethereum to Authorizations - ReCap  Sign-In with Ethereum describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain applications. ReCap introduces a mechanism that allows an off-chain application to combine authentication and authorization of such, while preserving security and optimizing UX.  SpruceOliver Terbu    </a>  We've updated and added fixes to our NextAuth example that incorporates Sign-In with Ethereum (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-next-auth-example/pull/14">siwe-next-auth-example #14</a>)    Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Kepler is undergoing architectural changes, doubling down on rust IPLD from the rust IPFS project, thereby improving performance by removing the block size restrictions. This will further improve maintainability and agility to select network protocols, which we hope to contribute back to the rust IPFS ecosystem soon.   SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information. Documentation for our core identity tooling can be found here:</p><a href="https://www.spruceid.dev/">  SpruceID - SpruceID  The Toolkit for Decentralized Identity  SpruceID  </a> SSI/DIDKit   Added support for did-jwk (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/466">#466</a>).  Added support for VP holder bindings (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/450">#450</a>).  Updated cryptographic libraries, allowing for better definition of hashes length (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/385">#385</a>).  Fixed the default verification method selection (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/475">#475</a>).  Refactored features across crates and improved CI coverage of features (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/479">#479</a>).   Rebase   Merged support for Solana wallets, as well as linking accounts together for both Ethereum and Solana wallets respectively (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/32">#32</a>).  We are concluding our work on a workflow that involves linking an email address to a public key &nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/34">#34</a>).   TreeLDR   Upgraded the <code>json-ld</code> and <code>rdf-types</code> dependency libraries to the latest versions, <code>0.9.0-beta</code> and <code>0.12.2</code> respectively (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/39">#39</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/36">#36</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/33">#33</a>). This will allow TreeLDR to compile with stable Rust 1.65.  Added support for literal identifiers (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/46">#46</a>) - this is particularly useful when exporting TreeLDR to JSON-LD contexts to specify a type field to be exported to the JSON-LD `@type` keyword:  Added support for the combination of <code>multiple</code> and <code>required</code> property/field attributes (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/47">#47</a>), When specifying both attributes, <code>required</code> was ignored before.  Fixed a bug where the field name in a type definition was ignored in the associated implicit layout definition (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/48">#48</a>).  Added new tests to the parser and JSON-LD context generator (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/issues/44">#44</a>).   <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Spruce provides an ecosystem of open-source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place they control, and show their cards however they want.</p><p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="http://discord.gg/WjvuYqvm5Y"></a>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Verifiable Credentials are tamper-proof digital data which can be cryptographically verified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other terms, these are credentials which the holder of them cannot edit or falsify, while guaranteeing to anyone verifying them that the data and provenance of that data being claimed is in fact true.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials live at Layer 3 of the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">Trust over IP Stack</a>. This is the layer where issuers, holders, and verifiers exchange credentials and proofs using credential exchange protocols.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are different implementations of verifiable credentials in the market today. One of them which has seen good traction, having been adopted by major digital ID programs is the<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/anoncreds"> AnonCreds specification</a>. AnonCreds supports important privacy-preserving capabilities through the use of zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography. </p>
<p>The use of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the verifiable presentation process enhances privacy protections available to the holder in presenting data to verifiers.</p>
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Stephen are:</p>
 
 Introduction to Various Credential Types – AnonCreds and different types of W3C credentials 
 Converting AnonCreds VC to W3C VC Standard format and adding other signature types (e.g. LD-Signature/NIST/ed25519/BBS+) 
 History of AnonCreds – blinding signature work in the 1970s, advancements and track record since then 
 Why are AnonCreds suited for Government Digital ID use cases? 
 Capabilities provided by AnonCreds – non-correlability, minimizing data shared, zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs), etc. 
 Comparing transferable vs non-transferrable credentials 
 Can the way that W3C credentials are formatted get in the way of interoperability in the future? 
 Are there use cases where AnonCreds aren’t the right implementation? 
 Are AnonCreds more computing intensive than W3C credentials? 
 Future for AnonCreds and for Hyperledger Indy 
 Why Revocation remains the weak point of AnonCreds and Indy 
 Is mDL better suited than AnonCreds for Driver’s Licence use cases?

The Sudo Platform DI Wallet SDK is available for iOS and Android.  



<p>Let’s dive into the technical detail about the Sudo Platform DI Wallet SDK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Identity wallet approach is defined in Aries RFC 0050: Wallets 



<p>Aries RFC 0050: Wallets specifies identity wallets in the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem. This RFC defines several requirements for an identity wallet.</p>



Figure 1: An RFC example of an identity wallet implementation (Indy).<a>[1]</a><br><br>



<p>The RFC suggests that identity wallet should provide public interfaces for encryption and queries. Figure 1 displays this layer as “encryption, query (wallet core).” Implementations of these layers should guarantee proper encryption and secret (e.g. private cryptographic keys) handling, as well as query features for information it stores.</p>



<p>The RFC also states that stored items in identity wallets are records, which may be secrets or non-secrets (e.g. public keys and DIDs) and that there are certain extra restrictions on the handling of secrets. For example, private keys cannot be returned across the public interface.</p>



<p>DI wallets can be supplemented with pluggable storage to facilitate data persistence and querying. This pluggable storage may be implemented using a variety of databases, a file system, or any similar value store.1 All pluggable storage options will receive data that are already encrypted, so they do not need to perform any cryptographic operations.</p>



<p>Querying in identity wallets is achieved using tags. Each record in the wallet may be associated with a set of tags, where a tag is a name and value pair. These tags can be used to search using a set of pre-defined tag filters, such as whether the value equals or does not equal a value. Tag values may be encrypted, which limits the types of tag filter that can be applied. Tag filters comparing values, such as greater than and less than, cannot be applied to encrypted tag values. Therefore, it is a trade-off between security and the richness of queries available on the wallet data. The RFC also implies that the identifier and type of the record can also be used to query the records.</p>



<p>There are some specific encryption requirements for identity wallets. While wallets must be searchable, data patterns in encrypted data must be avoided. For example, repeated patterns <a></a><a>for common prefixes </a>and fragments should be avoided. Further, the wallet master key should be rotatable without the need to re-encrypt wallet contents. As a result of these requirements, the RFC specifies an encryption approach for record attributes, record values and wallet keys. This encryption approach is described <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/64e5e55c123b2efaf38f4b0911a71a1c40a7f29d/concepts/0050-wallets#encryption">here</a>.</p>



 Identity wallets are not cryptocurrency wallets 



<p>While there are similarities between identity and cryptocurrency wallets, they are not identical. Both wallets are a storage mechanism for keys, but cryptocurrency wallets are often designed to hold only a small number of keys. Conversely, identity wallets are designed to hold verifiable credentials, DIDs, generic records, as well as cryptographic keys. This allows identity wallets to present proofs and establish connections, and facilitate other DI interactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, a custodial cryptocurrency wallet (e.g. Coinbase) is a common approach that bestows control over private keys to third parties. This is a violation of decentralized identity principles and is not used in identity wallets.</p>



 The Sudo Platform DI Wallet SDK is available for iOS and Android 



<p>Sudo Platform DI Wallet (SudoDIWallet) is packaged as iOS and Android SDKs. It is built on top of Hyperledger <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-askar">Aries Askar</a> with Swift and Kotlin wrappers created using Mozilla’s <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs">UniFFI</a><a>[1]</a> tool, which automatically generates the necessary foreign function interfaces (FFI).</p>



<p>Aries Askar is written in the Rust programming language and allows for creating and deleting wallets, managing keys, and managing generic records. Aries Askar’s wallet implementation assists in various decentralized identity interactions such as establishing connections, DIDComm messaging, and receiving and presenting credentials.</p>



<p>To run this Rust library on mobile platforms, Aries Askar was compiled into mobile-ready binaries for iOS and Android. FFI layers were also generated in Swift and Kotlin using UniFFI. UniFFI is a cross-platform bindings generator for Rust. The stack of technologies can be seen in Figure 2.</p>



Figure 2: The Sudo Platform DI Wallet is built on top of Aries Askar, using UniFFI to automatically generate Swift and Kotlin wrappers.



 Aries Askar provides secure storage and cryptographic operations for Aries agent wallets 



<p>Aries Askar is an open-source project in the Hyperledger Foundation providing secure storage and cryptographic operations for Aries agent wallets. Aries Askar is the underlying library upon which SudoDIWallet SDKs are built. Maturing quickly, Aries Askar has become the recommended wallet and storage solution for other larger projects such as Aries Cloud Agent Python (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases/tag/0.7.4">ACA-py V0.7.4+</a>).</p>



<p>While Aries Askar is largely derived from Indy SDK—a large SDK for decentralized identity features—Aries Askar does not provide Indy domain-specific APIs, such as DID, pairwise and verifiable credential operations. This allows Aries Askar to provide a lower level of control over wallet items, resulting in faster performance. According to the 2022 Q2 Hyperledger Aries project health update, load testing found Aries Askar to be more stable than the Indy SDK over time. Aries Askar also performed twice as fast as the Indy SDK.<a>[1]</a></p>



<p>Aries Askar offers key management functionality such as key generation and storage, encryption and signing. The project also provides Rust bindings for other required operations, such as non-secrets APIs, whereas Indy SDK does not. While Anonyome Labs considered alternative open source libraries such as Indy SDK, we found Aries Askar to be the most suitable for SudoDIWallet when considering performance and feature compatibility.</p>



 We used UniFFI as a Swift and Kotlin bindings generator 



<p>UniFFI is an open source toolkit created by Mozilla for generating cross-platform Rust components. Leveraging UniFFI, common components can be written in an underlying Rust layer and then wrapped to multiple platforms. For Sudo Platform, we wrapped Aries Askar in Swift and Kotlin wrappers.</p>



<p>Alternative options were to implement the core wallet functionality natively or to use Aries Framework JavaScript. Aries Framework JavaScript does not have a standalone wallet, but instead relies on Indy as its default. Native implementations in Swift and Kotlin would entail code duplication between platforms. This comes at the cost of extra maintenance and difficulty in guaranteeing interoperability. As such, we decided that generating wrappers over Aries Askar was the better alternative.</p>



<p>UniFFI is used in Mozilla’s application-services project, which provides browser storage and syncing functionality for mobile Firefox browsers.<a>[2]</a> Similarly, the core functionality is written in a common Rust layer, and UniFFI auto-generates the relevant bindings for Kotlin and Swift applications.</p>



 We will expand our wallet features 



<p>Identity wallets should allow users to export the contents of the wallet to another wallet, to prevent vendor lock-in. This means identity wallets need some level of interoperability with each other.</p>



<p>The RFC also states that wallets should have a backup and recovery feature, which allows a user to store their contents (e.g. to a cloud service) and restore them to a new device or multiple devices.</p>



<p>Both of these features are part of Anonyome Labs’ future roadmap for the Sudo Platform DI Wallet.</p>

 Ontology Tech Viewpoint | A Brief Analysis of Web3 Credit System Construction Ideas, Difficulties, and Solutions <p>With an increasingly enthusiastic and in-depth discussion around Web3, users have developed a deeper understanding and as such now have clearer and higher requirements for Web3 projects. This also makes project parties and users turn their eyes to some topics and fields still under exploration, such as “reputation” and “social”.</p><p>After Vitalik published an article about the concept of SBT, “Web3 reputation system construction” was pushed to the forefront of the topic. This paper will discuss the definition of reputation, development status, existing problems, and solutions through two articles respectively.</p> What is “Reputation”? <p>The definition of reputation will not change because of Web2 or Web3, as its existence is essentially due to the needs of social order and system maintenance. For individuals, reputation is a certificate to prove that they have no bad behavior and is widely used in daily exchanges and transactions between people and financial institutions. For enterprises, project parties, and organizations, reputation involves competition in the market and the collaboration between them. It is a tool for enterprises and organizations to obtain universal social recognition, so as to obtain relevant resources, opportunities and support, and then complete value creation.</p><p>Reputation is a basic means to maintain social order, the basis of distribution and spontaneous social control. Its influence covers a wide range of things, from interpersonal communication to the maintenance of relations between organizations and countries. Therefore, the reputation system is necessary for the normal operation of society, which is particularly important in both Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.</p> What is the difference between the Web3 reputation system that is in the exploratory stage and the Web2 reputation system that is relatively mature in its construction process? <p>The Web2 reputation system is characterized by having a large scale, can be applied in many scenarios, and has limited display time for poor credit records. Let’s take the world’s largest personal and corporate reputation system as an&nbsp;example:</p>Image source: Official website of the People’s Bank of&nbsp;China<p>By the end of December 2020, the People’s Bank of China had collected credit information on more than 1.1 billion people and 60.9 million enterprises and organizations. The average daily number of credit investigation reports for individuals and enterprises had reached 8.66 million and 190,000 respectively. It can be seen that the social demand for credit data has been very&nbsp;large.</p><p>With the development of science and technology, and the exploration of credit use scenarios, in addition to the common traditional financial field, credit systems are also widely used in more life-like scenarios such as rental platforms, and travel and accommodation apps.</p><p>Meanwhile, bad information can only be displayed on the credit report within 5 years from the date of the termination of the bad behavior or incident, which also means that the negative impact of bad information on individuals and enterprises in the Web2 reputation system is limited. Compared to Web2 reputation systems, which are widely used and have strong supervision, the construction of Web3 reputation systems is still in its infancy, and there is no cross-field, cross-project reputation system with credibility at present. The ideal Web3 or new generation reputation system should have comprehensive credit data, strong technical support and reasonable supervision process:</p><p>First, create a comprehensive three-dimensional credit portrait.</p><p>The future reputation system should include both off-chain and on-chain data to record individual and corporate credit behavior from all dimensions. For example, on the basis of traditional financial data, related interactive data on the chain should also be included in the credit report. In addition, because on-chain data is difficult to tamper with, the negative impact of bad behavior on individuals and organizations is often permanent. Data integrity and the difficulty of tampering can also ensure that individual and enterprise credit behavior is better regulated, so as to consciously resist bad behavior.</p><p>Second, have strong and privacy-preserving data storage and technology.</p><p>This is the most lacking point in the Web2 reputation system at present, and it is also the reason why we repeatedly discuss and explore the Web3 reputation system.</p><p>The current distributed storage can ensure that the possibility of loss is much lower than that of centralized storage when the data storage volume is very large. More importantly, the use of blockchain, VCs, DIDs and other technologies can ensure the authenticity of credit data, and users can also maximize the control of their own data, in line with the Web3&nbsp;vision.</p><p>For example, users can choose to disclose only the necessary credit data to pass to the relevant credit authentication, or even choose to disclose only the credentials that meet the conditions to pass the authentication.</p><p>Third, establish a new generation of regulatory norms and&nbsp;roles.</p><p>Regulatory agencies or organizations need to be responsible for the development of a new generation of reputation system norms and regulatory roles, in order to avoid project parties creating reputation systems that only benefit themselves. With a professional regulator, the reputation system can be adopted and tested more quickly and comprehensively by more project parties and fields, so as to create a set of Web3 reputation systems recognized by the&nbsp;public.</p><p>In the Web3 world, the use value of a reputation system will be further extended on the basis of&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>Individual users can choose to expose their credit score or rating on social media and Dapps, present a good profile in Web3 socials, and use their credit report for potential benefits. For DAO and Web3 project parties, they can better understand their community through user credit reports, so as to make targeted promotions and function developments to improve community member engagement. More importantly, they can use smart contract technology to automate the implementation of norms and rules related to credit&nbsp;ratings.</p><p>For example, the DAO project can increase the voting proportion of members with good credit, and improve their autonomy and sense of belonging. As you can see, we have a very clear need for a Web3 reputation system, but there is no consensus on a reputation system for Web3. What is the reason for this? What’s the difficulty?</p> The first difficulty is to obtain complete on-chain and off-chain reputation data. <p>As the interactive data on the blockchain is open and reputational, most of the Web3 project parties involved in the reputation score are developed around these open data on-chain, and only for a specific field to develop the reputation model.</p>Image source：Spectral Finance<p>Spectral Finance, for example, trained a scoring model for credit risk using machine learning and named it Multi Asset Credit Risk Oracle score (MACRO score). In the latest open beta model, the reputation scoring system for user interaction on Ethereum, referring to 4 types of credit risk-related behavior, 2 types of dimensions related to the history of decentralized data clients, and market macro environment factors, a total of about 100 data sources, and support multi-client connection.</p><p>However, the reputation system should not only include the above data, but also include interaction data in other areas of Web3, such as contribution interactions within the Web3 community, involvement in intra-community fraud, dApp interactions, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>However, the reason this data has not been used yet is that there are so many existing Web3 communities and many community platforms, including Discord, Telegram, Notion and self-built forums, where there is no common data to capture the user community behavior perfectly and to add observation and analysis. Also, this part of data is not completely open and transparent, which becomes the most important part of the data missing in the existing Web3 reputation system.</p><p>In response to this data, some project parties chose to use NFTs to record user behaviors, such as POAP and Noox. The benefit of this format is that different dimensions of user behavior can be recorded, linked, and authenticated, and the project can further classify community members based on whether or not the user holds certain specified NFTs, as well as targeted maintenance and promotion. The disadvantage is that there is no uniform indicator to measure which criteria a user needs to reach to qualify for a claim, so the NFTs are likely to be used only in closed loop on the platform.</p><p>In addition, from the perspective of DAOs, the project side collects the corresponding user behavior data according to the characteristics and requirements of different DAOs and sets the score. For example, Karma has customized models for several DAOs, such as Aave, Bankless, ENS, etc. These DAOs can use this customized model to continuously observe the member activity and facilitate the discovery of new members who contribute more to the organization. Each member can also refer to the contribution score to further improve their contribution to the DAO to get more revenue. On-chain data is difficult to obtain, and off-chain data is even more difficult to&nbsp;obtain.</p><p>Currently, Web2 data are basically held in the hands of centralized organizations (such as Facebook and Twitter), so it is difficult for Web3 reputation systems to obtain the most core off-chain user reputation behavior data. At present, the reputation system can only access the off-link data through the open API, which also requires user authorization and undoubtedly adds a lot of obstacles to building a new generation of reputation systems.</p><p>At the same time, the biggest difficulty in the data aspect of the reputation system is the balance between data volume and user privacy. On-chain data that requires user authorization is even more criticized. In the future, Web3 reputation builders will need to work closely with Web2 applications and think carefully about the reputation model architecture.</p><p>Only with a comprehensive and large scale user on-chain and off-chain data can we accurately quantify user reputation according to user behavior, and promote the use of the same reputation standard system in all&nbsp;fields.</p> The second difficulty is that on-chain and off-chain identity systems are not&nbsp;unified. <p>As we all know, on-chain behavior is bound to the address of the decentralized data client. The same person can register multiple addresses for interactions. While off-chain behavior is bound to the identity system of each country, each person has only one unique identity code, but each person can have multiple Web2 social application accounts, so the reputation system often cannot capture the complete behavior of users, and the authenticity of user identity cannot be guaranteed.</p>ont.id<p>As a decentralized identity identification protocol based on W3C DID specification, ONT ID can better integrate the identity of Web2 and Web3 by recording the address associated with DID in real time and the interaction records of Web2 and Web3 platforms, so as to build a more comprehensive reputation system. At present, Web3 reputation system infrastructure projects such as Orange Protocol have been equipped with ONT ID as the unique user&nbsp;account.</p>Image source:&nbsp;BrightID<p>Another way to solve this problem is developed by BrightID, which acts as a Web3 authentication system that requires users to participate in verification meetings, establish connections with friends, and verify their identity based on social relationships. Its advantage is that it does not need to collect any personal data or third-party certification, which protects users’ privacy to the greatest extent. However, its disadvantage is that the verification process is tedious and tests users’ patience.</p>Source: Gitcoin&nbsp;Passport<p>The Gitcoin Passport allows users to authenticate multiple apps on a single platform by aggregating their identity data offline. The platform already integrates Web2 and Web3 applications such as Twitter, Google and BrightID. In addition, users are allowed to select data according to their own needs to generate VC authorization. For example, users can choose to only verify the Facebook account name, the number of friends or the entire account, which also protects the privacy of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>These projects can be used as the basic system and identity verification tools of the new generation of Web3 reputation system, and integrate the on-chain identity system to further expand the availability and authenticity of the reputation system.</p><p>The third difficulty is that Web3 reputation systems lack regulatory processes and regulations.</p><p>This is not just a problem in the field of reputation right now, but a bottleneck in Web3 as a whole. In the absence of supervision, it is difficult for the reputation system to be authoritative and truly promoted, and the user behavior is difficult to be constrained.</p><p>At present, the blockchain field is still in the early stage of development, and the projects of each track are also in the process of exploration. Projects with reputation requirements will develop a set of favorable systems according to their own characteristics to improve their growth and retention, which cannot be used across platforms and&nbsp;fields.</p><p>However, the institutions responsible for supervising the Web3 reputation system should involve members from different countries, and formulate relevant regulations that are in accordance with different national conditions, so that the reputation model can have a “global consensus”. The intervention of authoritative regulatory agencies can not only ensure the fairness and justice of the reputation system, but also further improve the problems of difficult data acquisition and inconsistent identity systems, which is the basis for promoting a new generation of reputation systems.</p> Conclusion <p>The construction of a new generation of reputation systems is necessary. It will be based on the existing Web2 reputation system, with the development of a Web3 field, giving full play to the characteristics of Web3, to create a set of systems with perfect data, privacy protection, and reasonable supervision.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-brief-analysis-of-web3-credit-system-construction-ideas-difficulties-and-solutions-c84a74f3a603">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | A Brief Analysis of Web3 Credit System Construction Ideas, Difficulties…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Trading Physical Assets on the Blockchain  Mattereum Head of Design Kate Pincott’s Presentation from design&nbsp;FAO <p>So, I’m not going to talk about the blockchain; I’m going to talk about cool things we can do with the blockchain. I’m kind of more interested of what we can do with technology than the technology itself.</p><p>The topic of the talk is called Enabling the Spiral Economy, on that blockchain stuff, and before I share with you this project, I want us just to take a moment — there’s a lot of information — I want you to close your eyes — if you trust me; I’m going to close my eyes with you — and I want you to think back to what was the reason why you got into design or into creativity or into problem-solving. Whatever industry you’re in, what was the reason that drew you in? Take a moment to&nbsp;think.</p><p>For a lot of designers and creatives, it’s that they want to help people, they want to solve problems, they want to have an impact, they want to make the world a better place. And designers are naturally very empathetic, they empathise with everybody around them, and this makes it quite difficult to find “What is it that I want to do? What is it that I care about?” I had this struggle, and I noticed that I wanted to help all these different people and do all these amazing things, but the places that I was working in didn’t match my values. I was working in big tech companies like Facebook, I worked with Barclays, with US2, with Pentagram, and they weren’t talking about things that I was excited about. And this started to eat away at me, I was feeling really disheartened — I can see some nods; you’ve felt this before yourself.</p><p>And then I started to find what I find interesting, and I moved into coaching, I’m also a design coach, and what I love about coaching is that you help people to increase their self-awareness and their confidence, and to level up. So, I kind of found my thing, and I started coaching people from Google, from IDEO, from Figma, and I started to notice that each of us have this thing in common, where we want to find that thing that gives us fire and gives us fuel and lights us up. And the reason I’m excited to share this with you is because this is what my fuel is and my fire is, this is what lights me up, this is what gets me really excited. And so for any of you in the audience that are feeling like “Oh, I just haven’t found that yet…” I want to encourage you that it will come, as long as you stay&nbsp;curious.</p><p>We are living in a world of stuff! So much stuff everywhere! If you picture your bedroom right now, if you picture your house… Is there a lot of stuff in there? Behind the cupboards, under the carpets… The average US household has around 300,000 objects, from paperclips to spatulas to whatever, you name it. That’s a lot of stuff! How does it all fit in this tiny&nbsp;home?!</p><p>But the shocking thing about all of this stuff is 90% of it is trashed! And you think “God, I don’t think I throw that much away!” but this is a global statistic, this is across the world, and it could be from packaging to elements of it. And why do we care about all of this being trashed, why should I&nbsp;bother?</p><p>Well, because it’s kind of getting a big number, guys: it’s 2.12 billion tonnes of waste every single year! And I’m thinking “Why has this number got so big? Why are we throwing away so much stuff?” It’s really hard to picture that amount of stuff, isn’t it? When we say these numbers, how do you picture that? One way to think about it is that in the last 50 years, so let’s go back to the 1970s until now, we have created more waste than the entire human history! I’m talking about going back six million years, my friends! All of the rubbish that all of those people made, all out throughout time, is not the same as the rubbish that we have created — not just us; and our grandparents — in the last 50 years! That’s mind-blowing! Nearly at the present&nbsp;day…</p><p>And why do we care about all this rubbish? Okay, it’s ugly, it causes pollution, etc… The reason we need to care about it is because of these guys: greenhouse gases. Do we remember them? They’re kind of in the news a lot lately, they’re kind of annoying&nbsp;things…</p><p>Well, all that material that I showed you, 70% of greenhouse gases is because of all of that material. “Okay, that’s a lot… Again, why should I care?” Because — just as a recap, and I know you know this — we are on a trajectory: pre-industrial era to 2100, we’re on this current trajectory. If we don’t stop the planet warming at 1.5°C, we’re going to have some serious problems, and at the moment we’re kind of heading towards&nbsp;3°C.</p><p>So, what does that mean? Well, that means there won’t be any fish anymore, so if you have kids, they just won’t know what it is like to see or eat fish… The sea levels are going to rise about seven metres, so that’s going to change a lot… And I’m going to skip this, but basically lots of extreme weather, which we’ve already started to see, drought, famines… Three degrees is really not good! So, that is why we need to care about all of this waste. And in a room full of creative people and designers, you have power to change this, and that gets me&nbsp;excited!</p><p>You’ve probably heard the reuse-reduce-recycle thing. Have you heard the mantra before? Yes. Guys, there’s actually 10, there’s not three, and this is good and bad. The top ones here in green are the most green solutions, and that’s where the designers come in: if we redesign before manufacture, to make products, services, digital and physical, with less raw materials, less servers, less energy, this is going to be the best solution we can possibly come up&nbsp;with.</p><p>But for all the stuff that’s already out there in the world right now, these [Reduction, 04–08] are our options, and then these guys [09–10], this is the last resort. And you notice that recycling is the last resort. Who here thought that recycling was, like, the Lord’s work? We often think that that is the best thing we can do. but actually reuse [04] is at the top of the list here for products that are in the world right&nbsp;now.</p><p>When we think about reuse, it means things that you have in your home, businesses that have products in circulation today: you can either continue to reuse them until they break, or you can resell them, and the resale or the second-hand economy is what I’m going to talk about&nbsp;today.</p><p>Who’s heard of the linear economy? 91% of all things that are made on the planet use this process: it goes in, they make it, it gets distributed, you use it, and then you chuck it away. And what we want to move to, as you’ve probably heard, is the <a href="https://mattereum.com/circular-economy/">circular economy</a>. This is where let’s say a bottle of water, it gets used multiple times… I’ve got one here… Can you pass me that one? Reusable, great, I’m going to use it again and again… Actually, this one is probably indestructible, I can probably throw this on the floor and… Yeah, that’s not a good&nbsp;example!</p><p>A plastic one, let’s say it’s getting a little bit end of its life, a little bit scratchy… Then I could recycle it, melt down the plastic, and use it for a car part, and then it could go in and be used as the car, and then maybe that car gets out of date and maybe the parts need to be upgraded. What are we going to do with all of that plastic? Well, then it might get used in a new chair design, we call this remanufacture, and it comes into anew. And you get the point: it goes round and round and&nbsp;round.</p><p>But if we remember what I just told you about this reuse thing… That’s a lot of recycling! The energy that goes into collecting all of that stuff, remelting it down, putting it back, distributing, etc… This is not energy-efficient, right?</p><p>So, I want to introduce to you the spiral economy. This is one of the ways that we are going, as a generation, to get ourselves out of a pretty sticky situation. And this is where a product has gone through this process, it’s being used… But, instead of melting it down, breaking it, putting it in landfill, we start to resell it, so that the next person can use it, and the next person and the next person and the next person… and what this creates is a spiral. And so we’re doing a circular economy — kind of, in circles — but not of raw materials but of the objects themselves.</p><p>And this is really exciting, because there’s a lot of value stored in an object — there’s a lot of memory, there’s a lot of history, there’s a lot of information — and all of that can be maximised in the spiral economy, rather than&nbsp;lost.</p><p>So, what we’re going to start to see is people selling — I’m going to sell to you, and you’re going to sell to you, and you’re going to sell to you, and you’re going to sell to you — and there’s going to be this wonderful dance. But, how are we going to do that today? I mean, eBay is not going to cut it, is it? Amazon is not going to cut it. I mean, they’re terrible… No offence to anyone that works there, but it’s a bit of a headache: listing your item, and then waiting for them to reply, and then… There’s a lot of problems, right? So we’re going to need a new system to build the spiral&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Let’s talk about pain points, because I know designers love pain points: on the seller side, it’s pretty annoying to keep getting low offers, when you know that your Leica camera is the business, it’s authentic, when you know that your Abercrombie &amp; Fitch jumper is the real deal. And how can you prove that? You’ve got your word, you might have a receipt or a certificate… You could have forged that, right, you could have faked it — it’s really difficult to prove yourself.</p><p>And then on the buyer side, you’re looking at the pictures, maybe you’re looking at some videos on your phone, you’re trying to work out “Is this true, or are you just making this up? Am I being gaslighted? Am I being lied to? Is it being exaggerated?” It’s quite stressful, especially when you’re comparing multiple products and trying to make an informed decision, there’s really not that much choice, because there’s not that much information. And even when you do make a choice, who is to say you’re going to get your money back, if you don’t like what you get? There’s no consequences.</p><p>To do a little recap on capitalism: the idea is that you make low-durable products, and you don’t share any information with anybody, and then you make loads of money! And “everybody” has a great quality of life, and you have a really big carbon footprint, that’s how it’s working today. Do you want it to be like that? I don’t want it to be like&nbsp;that!</p><p>I think there’s a better way. And again, our job as designers is to say how might we: how might we imagine a different world? What if we could have a world where the capitalistic system incentivised more durable objects, that made you more money, that gave you more information, that made your valuable objects even more valuable? Increased life quality, and at the same time reduced your carbon footprint? “That would be great!” It sounds too good to be true, isn’t it? We haven’t seen this before, because it’s hard to do what I’m talking about, and that’s the main reason… Until&nbsp;now.</p><p>There are three problems [on the left] that we need to solve, if we’re going to make this happen, and I need all of your brains in the room to stick with me. We’ve got hidden information — number one, lack of transparency — false claims, there’s a lot of counterfeiting going on, two trillion dollars’ worth of counterfeiting in the world globally, that’s not a small number; all poor legal liability, very little consequences when people screw up, make mistakes, human error, lie, greenwash, right?</p><p>In order to fix that, we need to have these three values on the right hand side: we need to be building products for the spiral economy around transparency, trust, and accountability.</p><p>The way that we’re doing this today is we are taking physical objects, and we are giving them a digital version, a digital version where all the information about that object is stored: the measurements, the descriptions, the condition reporting, the provenance, where it came from, the history, the manufacturing, the parts that go into making it, the raw materials — the whole supply chain. And we pair these two things for the entire life of the object; wherever this product is resold, the person receives the digital version. And up until now, digital receipts for your purchase — normally you get a paper one — have been pretty tricky to track, pretty tricky to keep hold of. But now we have this thing called an NFT, which is a digital receipt, so now we can track the life of a product and see where it goes and keep updating that information. This makes the product more valuable, it makes it more interesting, and it also poses another problem: where are we going to store all this information, and how am I, as a user, going to be able to access that information?</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum </a>has created this thing called an <a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/">Asset Passpor</a>t. Just how each of you have a passport that has stamps and that tells you where you’ve been, each object is now going to have a passport, and it’s going to have different category passports, gold will be treated different to wine or to houses. And inside that passport there’s some really impressive and very cool legal contracts that state “This description is true. This object is in fact connected to this NFT. This has been offset,” and these warranties are certificates that are made by experts in that&nbsp;field.</p><p>What’s really cool is that when a claim is made, or a description is put into this passport, you can now have an army of certifiers all around the world, saying, “I verify that’s true. And if I’m wrong, I’m going to give you your money back.” What brand can make that promise? Most brands have terms &amp; conditions in the bottom of the thing, doing everything they can to avoid helping you, serving you, and making things clear for you. But also, brands make mistakes, and it’s not them that normally pays for it; it’s normally the customer, and I’m going to come back to an example&nbsp;later.</p><p>Now, you might think “Okay, but I’ve seen loads of stickers that cover this, and I’m pretty happy with my stickers. My stickers tell me that this is vegan, and I’m happy with it. My stickers tell me this is Fairtrade, and I’m happy with it.” The problem with these is that these are centralised, these are central organisations: one charity, one brand. It’s difficult to keep them accountable, it’s difficult to check up on them, the frequency, as they scale — it’s very difficult to prove that these are continuously being held. My favourite recent one is B Corp: I feel like every company in the world now is a B Corp, it’s like the easiest thing to get. No offence to B Corp, it’s a brilliant initiative, but with new times comes new problems and new challenges.</p><p>So, what are we going to do? Any ideas? I’ve got one: we’re going to create instead something that is decentralised! Imagine you have this lovely car, and it has these claims: it has one warranty in the Asset Passport for the MOT, this MOT was done and it passed; we have one for the mileage, the mileage has not been faked, it is true; and there was an accident, and here is a condition report about the bonnet of the car, and that this scratch let’s say is there because I’m a really bad&nbsp;driver.</p><p>So, we have a certifier, a human person, saying, “I approve this is true. I approve this is true.” This way each of the certifiers is taking some risk. Who here in the room understands insurance? Anyone in the insurance world? The idea is that they’re absorbing risk. Picture a really big tent, like a really, really big tent, imagine we’re all under a big tent. I couldn’t carry that tent by myself; I would need each of you to hold one of the legs around the tent so that we could slowly move it across the grass, right? Each of us are carrying a leg, to lift something together, which one person cannot do alone. It’s the same kind of concept here: each of the certifiers are verifying that a certain aspect of this is true or false, and this way they’re absorbing the risk. We can never say something is going to be 100% accurate — we’re humans, there are always going to be error — but we can reduce that risk as much as we&nbsp;can.</p><p>And when there is a problem, and there is human error, or the bastards are lying, we get them: this certifier in this ecosystem would pay back the money, and they’d say, “You know what? I’ve made a mistake, I was&nbsp;wrong.”</p><p>So, suddenly we’re starting to build an economy where everything you see in this new world is trusted, transparent, and accountable — I can trust the information.</p><p>And this could be happening on all different types of marketplaces. I’ve got mostly crypto ones here, but it could be in the future Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, you name&nbsp;it.</p><p>And we have live ones right now: we’ve done it for a trumpet, we’ve done it for a ring, and we’ve done it for an Andy Warhol painting. So it’s real — this is not&nbsp;magic!</p><p>When we’re thinking about the spiral economy, we’re basically creating alternative revenue streams. Because the incentive now is not out of the goodness of my heart and because I love the world, no; it makes economic sense. I could get another revenue stream, as a certifier. I, as a brand, can take a little bit of that cut of that jumper that I’m selling in the contract, in the Passport, because I can write what I want in the Passport.</p><p>So, suddenly when I give let’s say this trumpet, if I sell it to you, and then you sell it to the next row, and then you sell it to the next row, and you sell it to the next row… I, as a seller, am getting a tiny little cut each time. So am I going to start selling you a really crappy product that’s not very durable? No. Because I want it to go on and on and on and on and on and on, I want this product to last forever so I keep making money. So now we’re changing the mechanics of the economy, we’re incentivising people to make durable products, so that they have extended lives, so that we have extended&nbsp;profit.</p><p>I’m going to give you an example of how it works today. Who knows Oatly? Anyone drink Oatly? Amazing, love them! Oatly with my cup of coffee, with my hot chocolate… It’s made of oats instead of milk, and they’re a Swedish company and they do lots of really good work, and even they have made some mistakes. And I continue to support them, because I adore them, and I love their focus on research and their focus on carbon footprint statistics, they put this on all their packaging, they’re an amazing company. I feel like my values align with them, I trust them, but they’re still a centralised company.</p><p>And a really cool advert came out. Did anyone see this advert? It was pretty refreshing. Basically, there’s this dad, he comes home late at night, and he goes into the fridge and he’s going to make himself a drink. And his son sits on the table, with the dim light of the fridge flickering at him, and glares at him, and basically the dad is getting really uncomfortable, because he feels he has to explain why he wanted to drink milk. And there’s this awkward, funny, very amazing moment where he doesn’t know what to say, because all he wants to do is drink milk, and the teenager is like “Yeah, dad, that’s really&nbsp;uncool!”</p><p>This ad was really successful, it was innovative, it was really witty. But, the problem was they claimed in the small print that their Oatly milk was 73% less carbon footprint than normal milk. It turns out only one of the models of milk that they make, only one of the range, it’s called the Barista range, the Barista range is 73% less carbon footprint, but not all of the milk. So, hundreds of thousands of people went out and bought this milk under a false claim, they spent their money, they invested in a product with false information — it’s a cool company, but that’s not&nbsp;right!</p><p>And so then the ASA gets involved, the Advertising Standards Authority, and they give Oatly a slap on the wrist and they say, “Naughty, naughty! Take down your advert, it’s not true!” And I’m sitting there, thinking “Mate, I want my money back! You told me this, and I only bought it because of this, and now it’s not true, and I’ve got this milk that is…” It’s a silly example, there are far more serious examples in our lives, but I just keep thinking…</p><p>How much of this greenwashing is going on? It’s so trendy and woke to be green now: everybody is trying to make these claims, everyone is slightly exaggerating. How are we, as consumers, supposed to know what is true and what is not true? There’s a lot of questions: who should hold them accountable? Who should pay me? How are we going to do this? No-one is protecting the consumer.</p><p>It comes back to that idea of we need transparency, we need accountability, and we need&nbsp;trust.</p><p>I want you to now imagine that we could actually live in a world that’s a bit different, where everything you buy has been ethically and environmentally checked, and you can search by that. Imagine if on Amazon you could search your preferences exactly as you wanted it but Amazon weren’t the ones saying that it was true; a third party, a decentralised group of people could verify that that was indeed true. Would you trust that?&nbsp;Right.</p><p>Imagine a world where nothing is ever made to be thrown away. Because these shoes that I like and then might get bored of, someone else will want. And the watch that you’re wearing might be interesting for a few weeks, but then you’re going to pass it on to someone else, and a house you might want to give to your children… Things are always moving, but they never need to be thrown away. So if you take one thing away from this talk, my friends, it’s — and I think you said it earlier — we need to un-brainwash ourselves. Things do not need to be thrown away; it is our own lack of imagination and ingenuity to change the system that needs to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Imagine instead that everything you ever buy you intend to resell and find a new home, to someone that needs it more than you do. And that is the future of global trade, and that is what we are building at Mattereum. And our founder, Vinay Gupta, has said, “Nothing is so unloved that it needs to be thrown away.” And I think when you come at it from a lens of love, not just hardcore economics and tech… That’s really nice, that gives me the feels, that makes me all gooey — cool, let’s&nbsp;live!</p><p>So, how does that work? Here’s the gradient Metaverse diagram — I feel like I should have like Daft Punk playing in the background or something — on the left-hand side we have the physical object: stage one is going to be in vaults, because we can monitor the condition a lot easier, it’s not going anywhere, it’s safe, in a vault, it’s cool. In phase two we’ll be dealing with objects that are out in the real world. Then on the right-hand side you’ve got the digital NFT, which has all this information and the provenance and what’s going&nbsp;on.</p><p>And in the middle you have what makes the Asset Passport unique and exciting and cool and different from anything else in the market today, and the first in the world, and that is the pairing of the certifier, the decentralised experts, and the legal contract, the warranty.</p><p>So for the first time in history you’ll be able to buy something and have a really detailed understanding of what you can and cannot do with it, who it belongs to, what happens when something is false, and a trust, an assurance that what you’re getting is the real&nbsp;deal.</p><p>And the reason we’ve been able to do this is because we started in this space in 2015, and we’ve been doing this for a long time — who knew that law takes a long time to move! It’s long! But, we were able to contribute to UK law, and turn some of these technological principles of smart contracts into law, turning code into law. So now, with our Asset Passports, if… Most of these things will not happen, most of these disputes will never happen, because you’ve got the contract… It’s a bit like a prenup between two people that are married: you have a prenup to make sure that you never get to the stage where you disagree — “I get the house, you get the jam jar, great.” We hope that we’ll never get to a dispute, but if there was a dispute, because for some reason part of the promises they made to you have been proved to be wrong, then you can go to a court of law, you can show your Asset Passports to a judge, they can push a button, and they can release your funds to you. For the first time in world history, a judge can make that decision — that’s powerful!</p><p>Let’s go back to doubt, let’s take an example of a bike. If you’re person 1, and you are selling this very fancy bike — Who’s got a $5,000 bike? Bike lovers! — and you have an expert to verify all the parts and where it came from, and that the brakes are working and that the tires haven’t have any holes in them, etc… Then the second person buys it, maybe they get a few scuffs, maybe the condition goes down slightly, but everything else is working, so it only drops $200. And this happens again and again and again, because these people are looking after it… You get less droppage in price, because there’s less doubt. When you buy a laptop today, you’re like “Oh, did someone drop it? What did they do to it? The keys are a bit sticky…” There’s so many things that you just don’t know about that product. But, when you have this full transparency, you’re willing to pay more for that product, because you know you’re getting a good&nbsp;deal.</p><p>So, if we think about all the objects around the world, and we take the ones that we can agree the price on, and the ones that we actually trust the data, it’s a very small amount that’s on the market today. And this is why we don’t have that much choice, there’s not that many objects that we can actually choose to buy from. There are so many objects around the world that will never-ever-ever get sold and they’ll just sit there, or they’ll got to landfill. Remember that image I showed you with all that rubbish? That’s where most of it is going to go, unless we increase this&nbsp;circle.</p><p>Now imagine all the world’s objects can be up for sale, because we can agree on the price, we can trust the data. Cue the Asset Passport.</p><p>We’re going to start with luxury goods, because there is genuinely a problem with counterfeiting: Gucci, Prada, luxury wines, real estate, gold — there are big industries that have a genuine counterfeiting problem that this could solve. But then we will roll out and move on to non-vaulted items, lower-priced items, everyday items, so that you, as customers, can have that safety and that&nbsp;trust.</p><p>And just to prove how serious I am about this: literally a few weeks ago we <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa6cd9f96f73015bf6b2eaac9d7da09c860b377b2/0">tokenised the first piece of land in the UK</a>, it was a $1.9 million plot of land and we turned it into an NFT, and it’s on sale right now — this is real, this is not hypothetical!</p><p>So, join the War on Waste, join me so that nothing else and nothing ever has to be thrown away again, so that we can Passport everything around&nbsp;us.</p><p>And my question to you that I’d like to leave you with is what object would you Passport first, and why? What history do you want to maintain? What transparency are you not seeing in your own life that you would like to see? What accountability would you like to&nbsp;bring?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/enabling-the-spiral-economy-b918df6e0cce">Enabling the Spiral Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc</a>., a leading digital identity and access control technology company, today announced a collaboration with MEDITECH, a leader in EHR innovation.&nbsp; Together, they share the vision to empower healthcare organizations to enable connected patient care with health information access.&nbsp; The MEDITECH Expanse patient portal is now interoperable with IDENTOS’ open standards based identity management system. Currently, it enables patients using IDENTOS identity management services to login to the MEDITECH patient portal to access their health information. This is a convenient and secure solution that also reduces the need for patients to maintain multiple usernames and passwords and is currently being deployed in Ontario to start.</p>
<p>MEDITECH’s Expanse platform is a globally used web-based EHR that places patients at the center of their care. By leveraging the Expanse patient portal, patients can take control of their health with convenient, mobile, easy to use tools that resemble the consumer technologies they already know well. By externalizing the identity and authorization service from MEDITECH, IDENTOS empowers the patient to benefit from a single sign-on experience to MEDITECH and other digital health services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their first use case together is now live at Southlake Regional Health Centre through Southlake’s Health Navigator app.&nbsp; The Southlake Health Navigator leverages the Ontario trusted account (Ota), a digital identity service giving patients a secure method to easily access health information and services online, across participating partners and multiple platforms with one secure log-in.&nbsp; As a partner of the Ota, patients at Southlake can now use the Southlake Navigator app to quickly find and securely access their personal health information on the MEDITECH portal, without creating a new credential.</p>
<p>Benefits:<br>
For patients:<br>
-Streamlines the process for portal enrollment; patients can log-in using a single, reusable trusted identity<br>
-Increased security and convenience<br>
-Patients can more easily access their health information and services online</p>
<p>For healthcare organizations:<br>
-Increased adoption and patient engagement<br>
-Reduced IT and administrative effort related to user onboarding, account and password management<br>
-Interoperability; this functionality is built with standards-based technology and can be deployed anywhere MEDITECH Expanse is.<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are proud to collaborate with MEDITECH to solve long standing data integration challenges and generate significant value to the end user through integrated identity solutions.&nbsp; In working together, we’re modernizing identity and access control, and providing trusted access so patients can access their health information and services more securely and conveniently, as well as making patient portal account management easier for health service providers.” -Joe Mayer, Chief Revenue Officer, IDENTOS</p>
<p>“With IDENTOS, we are helping healthcare organizations to lift many of the barriers they face with patient portal enrollment. Patients can connect using the same secure identity management solution they are accustomed to, without having to remember another username and password. And for our Ontario customers, the solution also helps them align with Ontario’s digital identity strategy and Ontario trusted account initiative.” Robert Molloy, Director, MEDITECH</p></blockquote>

				  A Step in the Right Direction 
<p>A <a href="https://tcocertified.com/blog/what-digital-product-passports-are-and-why-you-need-to-care/">product passport</a> is a tool that manufacturers can use to improve the sustainability of products and make it easier for consumers to make informed choices about the products they buy. Product passports provide information about a product’s environmental and social impacts and ingredients and the ethical and sustainable standards to which the product has been certified. This information helps consumers to make more informed choices about the products they buy and allows them to avoid products with a high environmental or social impact.</p>
<p>Product passports increase transparency in the supply chain and ensure that products are produced sustainably and ethically. They can also be valuable marketing tools, allowing companies to show their products are sustainable and ethical. Ultimately, they can improve the sustainability of the consumer goods industry. While product passports are a step in the right direction, current centralized or paper-based ecosystems impose limitations and can produce inaccurate information.</p>
 Current Limitations 
<p>Keeping track of the data associated with a product can take time and effort. This data can be spread across multiple departments and locations within an organization; as a result, making it hard to track and manage. Additionally, centralizing data can make it more susceptible to security breaches. If one central location is breached, all the data stored there can be compromised. Centralizing data can also make it difficult to update or change information. Once data has been entered into the system, it can take time to make changes or updates. This can lead to inaccurate information being stored in the system, which can, in turn, lead to problems down the road. Finally, centralizing data can be costly. Keeping data in one central location requires specific infrastructure, which can be a significant expense, particularly for small businesses. These inefficiencies can lead to problems with product passports and their validity. Moreover, Inaccurate data, security breaches, and high costs can all hinder the effectiveness of these systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identity Ecosystems present a solution.&nbsp; 
<p>Product passports can be integrated into decentralized trust-based ecosystems to help increase transparency and make information available to more users, decrease waste and make the supply chain more efficient. When all the information about a product is in one place, anyone can locate the information they need more quickly, reducing the risk of lost data. When a product’s lifecycle information is readily available, companies can make informed decisions about whether to repair, recycle or dispose of a product. As a result, improved efficiencies make finding new business opportunities and developing partnerships easier.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
 Decentralized technologies make it possible to ensure end-to-end verifiability of product data across the entire value chain. 
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  The Benefits 
<p>In a decentralized system, there is no central governing body for the flow of information. No matter the industry, there will always be different players who don’t trust each other, so decentralization and its governance methods are reliable tools for building this trust. In order to build this trust, a decentralized system is maintained and linked to a Trust Registry. The Trust Registry fosters trust within the ecosystem via decentralized identifiers (DIDs), so anyone can exchange product information without worrying about its authenticity.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to having a product passport anchored to a Trust Registry. These benefits include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Increased trust: A Trust Registry helps create the conditions for trust to emerge amongst everyone in the ecosystem. Trust is essential within any functioning ecosystem. Decentralized ecosystems can generate exceptionally high levels of trust as there aren’t organizations holding inordinate control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced transparency: A product passport anchored to trust-based ecosystems creates a more transparent supply chain by having all current and relevant information about the product, including where it was made, when it was made, and what materials were used.&nbsp; 
 Improved efficiencies: A product passport anchored to a Trust Registry can help to reduce waste and improve efficiencies in the supply chain. By having all the relevant information about a product in one place, anyone can more easily find the information they need.&nbsp; 
 
 Create a more transparent and secure supply chain 
<p>The benefits of integrating product passports into a trust-based decentralized ecosystem are varied. They include improved security, increased trust, and enhanced transparency, which are essential in a decentralized ecosystem. Product passports anchored to Trust Registries can help to create a more transparent and secure supply chain, and they can also help to reduce waste and improve efficiencies.</p>

<p>Gordian Envelope is a specification for the achitecture of a “smart document”. It supports the storage, backup, encryption, authentication, and transmission of data, with natively supported cryptography and explicit support for Merkle-based selective disclosure. It’s designed to protect digital assets including seeds, keys, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and Verifiable Presentations (VPs).</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons is currently working with multiple companies on the development and deployment of Gordian Envelopes via regular biweekly meetings; <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">contact us</a> if you’d like to be involved. We are also presenting Envelopes as a prospective Informational Draft for the IETF and engaging in discussions with the W3C Credentials Community Group.</p>

 The Envelope as Metaphor 

<p>The name “envelope” was chosen for this smart-document architecture because that provides an excellent metaphor for its capabilities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>These capabilities include:</p>

 
   Envelopes can have things written on them. Plaintext parts of a Gordian Envelope can be read by anyone. 
   Envelopes can have routing instructions. That plaintext information can include data on how to use the Gordian Envelope, such as how to open or close it. 
   Envelopes can contain things. Things can be placed within the structure of a Gordian Envelope. 
   Envelopes can contain envelopes. The Gordian Envelope structure is fully recursive: any part of an envelope can actually be another envelope. 
   Envelopes can have a seal. A signature can be made for the contents of a Gordian Envelope, verifying their authenticity and that they haven’t been changed. 
   Envelopes can be certified. Beyond just guarding against changes, a Gordian Envelope signature can also act as a certification of the envelope’s contents by some authority. 
   Envelopes can be closed. Encryption allows any part of a Gordian Envelope to be protected from prying eyes. 
   Envelopes can have windows. Selective disclosure allows for some parts of a Gordian Envelope to be readable while others have been redacted. Merkle proofs can proof that those parts were present in the original envelope. 
   Different recipients can open envelopes in different ways. Just as people might use letter openers, their fingers, or a machine to open a normal envelope, special permits can grant people different ways to open a Gordian Envelope. 
 

 Why Envelopes Are Important 

<p>The Gordian Envelope is intended as a more privacy-focused encoding architecture than existing data formats such as JWT and JSON-LD. We believe it has a better security architecture than JWT and that it doesn’t fall victim to the barriers of canonicalization complexity found in JSON-LD —&nbsp;which should together permit better security reviews of the Gordian Envelope design.</p>

<p>However, new features of Gordian Envelope not available in JWT or JSON-LD offer some of the best arguments for using the Smart Document structure.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Fundamental Structure:</p>

 
   Sematic Triples. Gordian Envelopes are built on powerful semantic triples, sometimes known as semantic graphs. (Semantic graphs are a feature of JSON-LD.) 
   Known Values. A set of “known values” for regularly used predicates can reduce the size of content within a Gordian Envelope. 
   Structured Merkle Tree. All parts of a Gordian Envelope can be hashed, creating a tree of digests that forms a structured Merkle Tree. (In this variant of Merkle Trees, all nodes contain both semantic content and digests, rather than semantic content being limited to leaves.) 
   Bottom-Up Support. Support for elision, privacy, and authentication is a fundamental element of Gordian Envelope, not an add-on. 
 

<p>Elision Support:</p>

 
   Elision of All Elements. Gordian Envelopes innately support elision for all the elements of their triples: subjects, predicates, and objects. 
   Redaction, Compression, and Encryption. Elision can be used for a variety of purposes including redaction (removing information), compression (removing duplicate information), and encryption (enciphering information). 
   Holder-initiated Redaction. Elision can be performed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, not just the Issuer (which is a large advance over most redaction designs to date). 
   Granular Holder Control. Elision can not only be performed by any Holder, but also for any data, allowing each entity to elide data as is appropriate for the management of their personal (or business) risk. 
   Progressive Trust. The elision mechanics in Gordian Envelopes allow for progressive trust, where increasing amounts of data are revealed over time. It can even be combined with encryption to escrow data to later be revealed. 
   Consistent Hashing. Even when elided or encrypted, hashes for those parts of the Gordian Envelope remain the same. 
 

<p>Privacy Support:</p>

 
   Proof of Inclusion. As an alternative to presenting redactive structures, proofs of inclusion can be included in top-level hashes. 
   Herd Privacy. Proofs of inclusion allow for herd privacy where all members of a class can share data such as a VC or DID without revealing individual information. 
   Non-Correlation. Encrypted Gordian Envelope data can optionally be made less correlatable with the addition of salt. 
 

<p>Authentication Support:</p>

 
   Symmetric Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key. 
   SSKR Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) using a symmetric key sharded with Shamir’s Secret Sharing, with the shares stored with copies of the Envelope, and the whole enveloped thus openable if sufficient  copies of the Envelope with a quorum of different shares are gathered. 
   Public Key Permits. Gordian Envelopes can alternatively be locked (“closed”) with a public key and then be opened with the associated private key, or vice versa. 
   Multiple Permits. Gordian Envelopes can simultaneously be locked (“closed”) via a variety of means and then openable by any appropriate individual method, with different methods likely held by different people. 
 

<p>Future Looking:</p>

 
   Data Storage. The initial inspiration for Gordian Envelopes was for secure data storage. 
   Credentials &amp; Presentations The usage of Gordian Envelope signing techniques allows for the creation of credentials and the ability to present them to different verifiers in different ways. 
   Distributed or Decentralized Identifiers. Self-Certifying Identifiers (SCIDs) can be created and shared with peers, certified with a trust authority, or registered on blockchain. 
   Future Techniques. Beyonds its technical specifics, Gordian Envelopes still allows for cl-sigs, bbs+, and other privacy-preserving techniques such as zk-proofs, differential privacy, etc. 
   Cryptography Agnostic. Generally, the Gordian Envelope architecture is cryptography agnostic, allowing it to work with everything from older algorithms with silicon support through more modern algorithms suited to blockchains and to future zk-proof or quantum-attack resistent cryptographic choices. These choices are made in sets via ciphersuites. 
 

 Usage of Envelopes 

<p>Gordian Envelopes are a foundational architecture that we expect to support many advanced projects involving self-sovereign control of digital assets.</p>

<p>Currently, it’s being used in two major Blockchain Commons projects.</p>

 
   Crypto-request/response. Requests and responses are specified ways to ask for and send information needed for self-sovereign operations, including when transmitting across an Airgap. Our second generation of requests and responses encodes those communications in Gordian Envelopes. 
   Collaborative Seed Recovery. The <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR system</a> requires the use of Smart Documents to store shares of seeds that have been sharded for backup and recovery. The Gordian Envelope is thus the heart of that system. 
 

<p>There are a broad swath of additional use cases, some of which can be found in our [Use Case Overview of Envelopes] (PENDING). These include:</p>

 
   Self-Sovereign Control of Assets. There are many different use cases for helping users to resiliently control their digital assets, going beyond the specific design of CSR. These include the inclusion of metadata for resilience, the usage of salts to block correlation, and the creation of variable-use permits to allow multiple ways to open an envelope. 
   Educational Credential. All sorts of credentials can be created in Gordian Envelopes, but certifications and other educational credentials are likely to be some of the most popular. These can be credentials signed by accredited institutions or by Web of Trust peers. Elision and third-party manipulation can allow these credentials to be safely passed around for a variety of purposes. Herd privacy features can create even greater anonymity. 
   Source-Control Signing. The standardization of Gordian Envelopes is another of their strengths. Case studies involving source-control signing demonstrate how a field that is currently managed in a variety of different ways could allow for real improvements in security.

  With India taking over the G20 presidency from Indonesia for a period of one year, the focus will be on crypto regulations, as expected from statements issued over the last few months by the country’s finance minister.  Nirmala Sitharaman, India’s Finance Minister, has time and again called for global cooperation on crypto regulation, citing the borderless nature of virtual asset transactions.  However, FM Sitharaman made it clear that if crypto regulation does take shape, it will be as an asset class and not as a currency.  <p>As expected, Indian Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday that the global regulation of cryptocurrencies would be one of the key focus areas during the country’s G20 presidency. Her remarks came at the event hosted by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) at the upcoming G-20 conference.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/GlobalWeb3News/status/1587636498975064064?s=20&amp;t=sdbtx_p1kM4mQB5E7NzVqA">Image Source</a>)<p>The G20 is an intergovernmental group comprised of 19 economies and the EU. Currently, Indonesia holds the presidency of the group. However, India will take over the forum’s presidency for one year, starting in December, and will host the G-20 Leaders’ Summit for the first time next&nbsp;year.</p><p>The G-20 Leaders’ Summit will also involve Finance Track which includes meetings among the forum’s finance ministers and central bank governors. And in the Finance Track, about 40 meetings are expected to be organized, focusing on areas such as international financial architecture.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/why-imf-calls-for-regulating-crypto">Why IMF Calls for Regulating Crypto?</a></p> All Countries Need to be on&nbsp;Board (<a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-india-prepares-to-take-over-g20-presidency-it-can-learn-from-indonesia-8178463/">Image Source</a>)<p>At the seminar, Sitharaman said India must encourage international groups such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Financial Stability Board (FSB), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation to help form cryptocurrency regulations with “all countries” involved.</p><blockquote>“No one single country can succeed in individually being in a silo trying to regulate the crypto assets,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>She also reasoned why India hasn’t set any crypto-specific legislation yet, saying, “we need to have all the members of the G-20 first of all to come on board to see how best it can be&nbsp;done.”</p><blockquote>Joining her at the same event, V. Anantha Nageswaran, the chief economic adviser to the government, echoed Sitharaman’s comments. He said that identifying “consensus-based solutions for accelerating the scale and scope of the response of the global community to many transboundary challenges, such as regulation of virtual assets,” would be the third objective of India’s G20 presidency.</blockquote><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/oecd-releases-a-tax-reporting-framework-for-crypto-derivatives-stablecoins-and-nfts-a44ab7093214">OECD Releases a Tax Reporting Framework for Crypto Derivatives, Stablecoins, and&nbsp;NFTs</a></p> Crypto Regulation in National&nbsp;Interest <p>While speaking at the event, Sitharaman clarified that she was talking about crypto as an asset, not a currency.</p><p>She further said that regulating crypto as an asset is in the “national interest.” Sitharaman pointed out that there is no knowing “what the trail leads you to” while referring to crypto usage. Expanding further on her statement, she added it is not known if crypto is used for drug funding, terror funding, or “just gaming the&nbsp;system.”</p><p>Sitharaman said that showcasing India’s digital revolution will be another priority during this G-20 presidency. This involves the nation’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), whose pilot program for the wholesale segment was launched by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on November 1st. The digital rupee pilot program involves a three-step graded approach and is expected to be rolled out “with little or no disruption” to the traditional financial system.</p><blockquote>Sitharaman also commented on the country “moving speedily forward” with digital financial technology.

<p>As someone who’s spent a career leading financial operations for successful cybersecurity startups such as Attivo Networks and Cloudmark, I knew it would be hard to resist an invitation from 1Kosmos board member Alberto Yépez to meet and talk with 1Kosmos CEO and founder, Hemen Vimadalal, about a role as the company’s first CFO.</p>
<p>Alberto is the founding partner at Forgepoint Capital and has a long history of building next-gen companies that become leaders in protecting the digital world. Like Attivo Networks, 1Kosmos was in the Forgepoint portfolio prior to acquisition, so from a distance I was familiar with the 1Kosmos passwordless MFA solution. After further discussions, it would become very clear why in early 2021, Forgepoint led Series A funding with a $15 million investment in 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>1Kosmos has developed today’s most advanced and user-friendly platform for unifying identity verification with multi-factor authentication. For a finance guy, that’s a mouthful, but what it essentially means is that fake accounts that trouble the financial services and government industries along with account takeover attacks that lead to ransomware, data breach and billions in fraud losses get shut down when hackers can’t log in. To me, that makes intuitive sense.</p>
<p>My curiosity peaked when I learned that to their growing number of customers, 1Kosmos represents much more than the convenience of passwordless access. For them, closing the gaps between identity and user authentication is critical so they know who is logging into corporate services. This is a level of trust that you can’t have without verifying identity at every access request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s more, for CFOs like me who view user privacy and the security of PII (including user biometrics) as materially significant issues, it quickly became clear to me that 1Kosmos solutions present organizations with an architectural advantage to fend off cyber attacks, and with it every downstream security system becomes more effective.</p>
<p>As conversations progressed, I happily accepted the CFO position at 1Kosmos to help establish the people, process and financial systems necessary to scale the organization and meet the enormous market opportunity its technology represents. Here are the top three reasons why it was an easy “Yes!”&nbsp;</p>
 #1 Passwordless MFA without Verified Identity Still Relies on Hope 
<p>The challenge 1Kosmos solves is one faced by every organization in every industry. According to SecurityBoulevard.com, account takeover attacks were <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/08/how-to-deter-fraud-in-a-consumer-friendly-way/">30% higher</a> during the first quarter of 2022 than the average over the past three years. Also, according to the Verizon 2022 Data Breach Report, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2022/dbir/2022-data-breach-investigations-report-dbir.pdf">more than 70%</a> of all data breaches are now caused by compromised credentials. More than 83% of organizations have been compromised this way more than once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now throw in account enrollment fraud, in which cybercriminals use stolen or synthetic identities to open new banking, government, and merchant accounts, and the problem grows worse. When taken together, account takeover and account enrollment fraud contribute to up to <a href="https://martechseries.com/analytics/customer-identity-management/new-report-reveals-fraud-management-is-vital-to-the-business-strategy-of-most-organizations/">$5 trillion</a> in global fraud losses each year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: Identity verification and authentication have always been decoupled, making passwords and antiquated MFA the default for both. Without unifying the two, organizations still do not know with certainty who is logging into their digital services … meaning even with unverified biometrics logins are still vulnerable to impostors posing as legitimate users. For digital business in all shapes and sizes, identity should be verified at every login attempt. An exception to this rule of thumb equates to a security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Not only does 1Kosmos prevent account takeover, it can also be strengthened by scanning a driver’s license, passport, or other form of government-issued identification to prevent account enrollment fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the identity management market entering a major growth phase in the face of mounting attacks,&nbsp; these capabilities mean 1Kosmos is in a position to capture a very large piece of the action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 #2 1Kosmos Architectural Advantage Tilts the Playing Field Against Cyber Criminals 
<p>Passwordless authentication is the future, but it has to be done right to avoid missteps along the way. Like other PII, biometrics can be compromised and using technology that introduces racial bias presents obvious shortcomings.</p>
<p>We’ve seen single sign-on be used as a weapon by cybercriminals who trick employees and sometimes contractors out of passwords, and for years have deployed two-factor authentication. But technology has advanced and simply putting passwordless in front of SSO ignores critical elements that should be in place – namely user identity verification, user privacy, and data security.</p>
<p>From the beginning, 1Kosmos architecture addressed these challenges, and they have embraced the responsibility of every security vendor to produce quality code and ensure interoperability within what can be highly complex corporate IT networks. They don’t just preach compliance with industry standards. 1Kosmos has put their entire platform through multiple, rigorous industry certifications that prove their systems are commercial grade.</p>
 #3 More Than a Company—a Mission 
<p>Start with a proven executive team made up of seasoned veterans behind some very successful startups in the industry. Add a culture that’s laser-focused on delivering successful outcomes for employees, customers, and investors with deep domain expertise in identity and access management. Then, mix in a passion to make the digital world a better and safer place despite cybercriminals ranging the gamut from drug and human traffickers, to terrorists, rogue governments and various other scoundrels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel this is a winning combination because what you get as a whole isn’t just a group of can’t-lose industry leaders. You get a tribe of game-changers committed to putting an end to the financial and human carnage caused by cyberattacks—forever. I mean, how do you say no to that?</p>

 Open Source Standards Enable Digitization with Security and Interoperability in Trade — Trade Customs Logistics <p>Originally published at <a href="https://tradecustomslogistics.net/open-source-standards-enable-digitization-with-security-and-interoperability-in-trade/">https://tradecustomslogistics.net</a> on July 7,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>One estimate shows that global container <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trade-talks/id1270804213?i=1000554103417">shipping generates 28.5 billion paper documents a year</a>. Yearly, paper <a href="https://theloadstar.com/why-digital-standards-matter-in-global-trade/">bills of lading cost an estimated $11 billion</a> and still only <a href="https://theloadstar.com/why-digital-standards-matter-in-global-trade/">1.2% of bills of lading were electronic</a> by the end of 2021. Modernizing the trade industry through digitization is just one of the pain points industry stakeholders at large can agree upon. Simply moving from paper to PDF cuts down on cost, reduces environmental impact, and improves a single company’s internal efficiency. But that one step doesn’t address critical industry needs such as security and interoperability. This is where open source standards provide a comprehensive pathway towards a modernized supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>To address some of global trade’s key pain points, we look for technologies that:</p>  Codify networks of&nbsp;trust;  Add community value;  Free you from vendor lock;&nbsp;and  Offer peak interoperability.  <p>Open source standards as applied to the trade industry have demonstrated the&nbsp;answer.</p> Open Source Standards Provide Supply Chain Security and Enable Stakeholder Interoperability <p>Open source standards for Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) have created an ability for trust to travel with data by <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/encoding-trust-that-travels-with-data-a-new-product-introduction-case-study-powered-by-solutions-a4be7e80bfdf">issuing authoritative information about companies and products</a>. The key to supply chain interoperability is to meet customers on the systems they already rely on. Software that builds on top of standards with this requirement in mind will enable companies to securely share verifiable data across existing silos.

<p>November 1st,&nbsp;2022</p><p>The Government of British Columbia (B.C.) and Spherity, both members of the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), are cooperating to facilitate the secure exchange of sustainability information using digital trust technology. As a global movement builds towards low-carbon and net-zero environmental strategies, natural resource companies need to prove they’re adhering to international climate change goals. Greenhouse gas emissions reporting is also a relevant ingredient of the upcoming digital product passport regulated by the European Commission.</p><p>The Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust (EMDT) pilot project was initiated in November 2020 by the Government of British Columbia in partnership with TELUS. It is enabling a collaborative digital ecosystem between the B.C. government, natural resource companies, and global organizations around the world through their pilot project. The EMDT expedites the global exchange of trusted sustainability data with investors, purchasers, and regulators.</p><p>Using the Spherity Product Passport Solution, mining companies (here: Copper Mountain Mining Corporation) can receive a business registration credential from the B.C. government and a greenhouse gas emissions report verification statement from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in the form of digital credentials.</p>Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust Ecosystem<p>Digital credentials, also known as verifiable credentials, are the digital equivalent of a physical credential, such as a mining company’s permit to operate. Verifiable credentials are cryptographically signed and thus provide verifiability, integrity, and non-repudiation. With verifiable credentials, natural resource companies can in the future bypass the need for physical documentation, instead sharing information in a digital format that is secure and trustworthy.</p><p>To support the ecosystem’s growth to scale, EMDT has created a highly interoperable tool, called Traction. Using Traction, natural resource companies, governments, and non-government organizations can exchange sustainability information in the form of digital credentials.</p><p>Using Traction, the Government of British Columbia can issue a business registration digital credential to Copper Mountain Mining Corporation. PwC issues a greenhouse gas emissions verification report digital credential Northern Block’s Orbit. With just a few clicks, Copper Mountain holds two digital credentials and can use them to satisfy requests for information, including those from an automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM).</p><p>Facilitating Interoperability</p><p>All involved parties have developed digital trust technologies using Hyperledger Aries, Hyperledger Indy, and the Aries Interop Profile 1.0 to enable the exchange of sustainability data in the form of digital credentials. The credential formats are compliant with the existing analog registration form and the greenhouse gas emission report&nbsp;format.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p><a href="http://www.spherity.com">Spherity</a> offers a production-grade Digital Product Passport solution for multiple industries, such as batteries including the natural resource sector, pharmaceuticals, textiles, buildings, and electronics. This wallet technology will make it easier for companies and organizations to prove that they are adhering to regulatory audit &amp; compliance requirements in their respective fields.</p><p>To learn more about the Energy &amp; Mines Digital Trust project, visit <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">the case study&nbsp;site.</a></p><p>To learn more about Spherity’s digital trust work, visit <a href="https://www.spherity.com/digital-product-passport">this&nbsp;page</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/cop27-digital-trust-technology-supports-international-climate-action-458424360a81">COP27: Digital Trust Technology Supports International Climate Action</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining this new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll have a geographical focus perspective in which today we’ll focus on the Middle East. And for that we have very special guests who is Dr Salah Rustum. He is a PhD in Aerodynamics, and has occupied very high positions in this field, including a vice presidency at Boeing.</p>
<p>Dr Rustum is also the founder of CIEL, a Lebanese company dealing in cybersecurity ever since 1990. And he is the founder of CIELTECH of Qatar, which has the same concept and has set its mission to support and develop the integrity of information technology and information sent on the internet. Hello, Dr Salah.</p>
<p>Dr Salah Rustum: Hi. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s a pleasure having this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Salah: It’s my pleasure as well to be online with you. And I hope our meeting would be a good one and successful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely, I’m sure it’s going to be. So, let’s get started, let’s talk about digital identity. And as always, I want to hear something about our guest. So please tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Salah: Well, as you said, I had my PhD from MIT, I worked with Lockheed Martin to begin with. And then I had an offer from Boeing which I couldn’t refuse. And later on, I was moved to, transferred actually to the Middle East, and started Boeing Middle East. It didn’t work there due to political reasons. And after that returned to the States continued my aviational career. During which I became the Chairman of the Introductory Commission of the Jumbo Jet in the world. I was the chairman of the Future Planning Commission of Rome Airport, and other different positions that I held throughout the time I served in aviation.</p>
<p>But the most outstanding of my career is my absolute transfer from aviation to technology, which I am intruding on it as my real study is concentrated on aviation and the effect of wind on any object. But the transition was easy as everything based on physics is easy. And it is easy comprehensible. I started with introducing the electronic digital signature as early as 1996. And from there on, it became – the scope became wider and wider. And we got to the extent that we started dealing with cybersecurity, and what it meant at that time and what it means now.</p>
<p>Of course, we did a lot of work on bridging the digital divide, which was very important between the Middle East and the West. And of course, it was very painful in the start, it was a very, very dark tunnel, which I entered. But luckily speaking, I managed to really introduce the sense of the electronic digital signature authentication, encryption, the confidentiality of the message and its long reputation.</p>
<p>We started our company in Beirut in 1974. And dealt with cybersecurity as it meant then, as the world meant then in the early ’70s. But throughout the time, and step by step, gradually, things developed, and the picture became clearer. And it was a pleasure looking back. If I have to look over my shoulder now and look back to what we have achieved, I would say we have done a lot. We have really done a lot in bridging the digital divide and bringing knowledge and new functionalities in the region.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. I can imagine all the achievement you have had in so many years in the region. And with this fascinating start of your career with aviation and then merging to data identity with electronic signature to start that journey. Now that you have been working many bigger part of this digital identity journey in Lebanon, now in the last years, you have moved to Qatar, you definitely know very well the region. So, what would you say are the challenges, the main challenges that companies in the region, companies and organisation in the Middle East are facing today in terms of digital identity?</p>
<p>Salah: Well, if I may comment on that, the main challenges that we’re facing here and everybody faces here is their lack of comprehension of the essence of doing business over the internet, which requires authentication and encryption at the same time, and of course, applying digital laws, which are there, but nobody deals with them. This is the basic challenge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the digital laws are quite understandable. They don’t differ in any way or the other from other digital laws, I would say, it’s good. I must emphasise that the problems we face here is the integration between conventional methods of doing business and doing business remotely from home or from other places. And it is really about when you pay so much for the conventional way on paper-based business, and then you want to go paperless. And what happens? Your budget is too high. And both parties, the laws that are really there and nobody pays attention to them are not taken into consideration. And this is the basic obstruction for the promotion and for the development of the digital ID in the region.</p>
<p>But in Qatar, if I may speak about the region, I’m in, I think it’s doing pretty well as the Highness the Prince of Qatar is most enthusiastic about converting Qatar to a 100% paperless country, and he’s not sparing anything to stop him from achieving that objective. And of course, it’s not enough that the will of His Highness is there, it needs the other people around to support his wish, which is still, I wouldn’t describe it as incompetency. No. But slackness in putting things in order and abiding by the digital law, which nobody pays attention to it at all. And at the same time, they don’t know that there is a digital law since 2012.</p>
<p>I reckon these are the basic obstructions that hinder the advancement of the digital era in the region as a whole. I’m not speaking of a certain particular country. Nope, but I’m speaking in general.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah. As you said, the understanding, right? The understanding of how things work in the digital world. And also, you have mentioned that even though there are some digital laws, they are not fully understanding, fully put in practice.</p>
<p>Salah: There is another thing, time isn’t really taken into consideration. “Yeah, OK, we’ll do it tomorrow.” But tomorrow never comes. It could be a week, it could be two weeks, it could be three weeks, but ultimately it comes. But converting a country from one type of business to another, or not only one type of business, but one type of doing things to technology, time makes a big difference in its application.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And seeing all these obstacles that you have described, have you seen some – what will you say about the solution? Solutions that have already put in practice or potential solutions that you believe that they will solve these obstacles. What will you say about the solutions?</p>
<p>Salah: It’s raising awareness. And that’s what we’ve been doing ever since 1990. We’re raising awareness to all people at all levels, whether it is in the public sector or in the private sector. And raising awareness isn’t something that you could do overnight. It takes not days, not months, it takes years to change the concept of doing business. But so far, so good, from say turn of the century in 2000, where after 22 years, I think the region has advanced a lot. And there is a big significant change in the attitude of the people as a whole in both the private and the public sectors.</p>
<p>Oscar: So yeah, raising awareness is super important. It’s one of the first thing that has to be done. And as you clearly said it takes years.</p>
<p>Salah: Yes. There is another thing. In most countries of the region, and I reckon in most of the world, the SMEs play a very important role in the development of the country, because sometimes it’s 70% are SMEs, 30% are the larger and bigger companies, organisations. So, if we don’t really treat the SMEs and tell them what to do, and give them proper advice, to move into technology, and into doing business the right way, and becoming paperless, it’s very difficult to really make a nationwide change.</p>
<p>But as far as Qatar is concerned, they have special programs about it, the same thing applies in United Arab Emirates, and the same thing applies and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And the same thing applies in Kuwait, and in Sultanate of Oman, and Lebanon, of course. But you have to try to give them solutions that are inexpensive. A company that has two employees, if you tell it, “All right, you want to become paperless, it’s going to cost you $50,000.” Nobody’s going to say, “All right, I’m in.” And there are ways and means to do it in a very cheap manner.</p>
<p>And there are ways that the technology offers itself for the promotion of SMEs in the world. And we should take advantage of that, listen to sound advice, and implement it. A basic issue is that there is much talk about it, and little action is taken. We have to reverse the issue. We need to do a lot and talk less.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, a better balance. Absolutely. Absolutely agree. Yeah. And it’s a great point that you made about the small and medium enterprises, the SMEs, which, yeah, we don’t talk too often actually in – when we have guests talking about digital identity, we tend to talk about the corporations or also government, but we don’t talk too much about the SMEs. And it’s true, in the Middle East, not only there, in many other parts of the world they are a big part of the country’s economies.</p>
<p>Salah: The SMEs are the people who form the majority of the business. I mean, you can’t ignore them. We have to tell them, “Hey, get on the train now.” Otherwise, the gap between the bigger companies and the SMEs is going bigger. And that’s not healthy at all, because there will be different societies, richer and poorer. And this will create problems later on in the foreseen future. I’m not saying in the far-fetched future. No, immediately, probably in a few years, you will see a big difference between the big enterprises and the smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>Oscar: Something else you have mentioned shortly before is the digital laws. You mentioned that caught my attention. You mentioned that I think in Qatar, which one example you mentioned, you mentioned that the law was already released in 2012. Which country was that? And please tell me also, how is across several countries in the Middle East, so do many of these countries have a data law already for a long time ago? How was the status?</p>
<p>Salah: Yes, actually, all countries in the Middle East in the MENA region, let’s say Middle East and North Africa, they have digital laws. I personally have assisted in Lebanon, Kuwait, Egypt, Iraq, these are the countries that I have personally assisted in the digital laws. But unfortunately, our Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, State of Qatar, the Emirates, Bahrain, they have their digital laws, and it’s very good. But as I said earlier, it is not implemented, or partially implemented. And this doesn’t make one plus one, two. It makes one plus one, sometimes one or like when you say the square root of one is one. That’s it.</p>
<p>I mean, we need to apply these digital laws to indoctrinate people. When the people say, or IT manager says, “Well, I don’t need to apply to protect my email because it’s protected.” That’s a very illogical argument. Nothing is protected over the internet. And nobody has forced anybody to go over the internet for the love of the internet. Nobody. Each company, each organisation went on the internet because of its own freewill.</p>
<p>And they think that since they are sitting behind their computers and doing business, that means nobody is going to see them. They don’t know that there are middlemen, there are hackers, there are so many different types of hacking and spear phishing, and so on and so forth, that disrupts the flow of work of their companies or organisations. And this is ignorance.</p>
<p>And still, up to this very last minute, we’re talking now, we carry on raising awareness for any company that contracts with us for the provision of solution, or two or three solutions put together. We do the training free of charge, because it’s very good and you feel safe when everybody is [0:15:51] [Indiscernible] of what’s going on. And little knowledge is dangerous.</p>
<p>So, I think it’s – the best way is to educate. And this is our role, we started raising awareness since 1990. And when I started talking about it in 1990, everybody, it was a dark, very dark tunnel, with hardly zero glimpse of light in it. But look now, I mean, after 30 years, it’s totally different. Everybody wants to be on the internet, everybody wants to apply in new technologies. The danger is that sometimes they get wrong advices. And they pay you a lot for these wrong advices. And this is the problem that not only in the Middle East and North Africa, MENA countries, but in Europe and the United States, and even South America, and whatever it is. I mean, there are many people that give wrong advices just for making money, they don’t care how.</p>
<p>I would say, if I may describe it as treacherous, it shouldn’t be. We should have our own code of ethics, when you try to educate, when you try to become computer literate. And you know what’s going around you in technology. The law is there. But the law doesn’t teach you, you have to read. And how can you convince people to read? I would say, many people are reading and that’s why the MENA region has developed tremendously, and I bet it’s going to be a good, developed region in the world that deals with the technology on a very high and sophisticated level.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Excellent. Excellent to hear that. So definitely, we will be following the developments in this region on the MENA region, as you describe, your being involved also, in not only Middle East, but Northern Africa, countries. And we look at the – the future, it’s always difficult to get it right, talking about the future. But in the near future, let’s see, how do you foresee digital identity in this region?</p>
<p>Salah: I think that the future of the MENA region is beautiful. And I think it will turn into a multibillion dollar worth of business. It’s escalating exponentially. And I have no fear whatsoever that the MENA region is really erupting. But I have to be very true with myself first to be able to address the others. I need to know the weak points to enable me suggest a solution. I can’t take things in general; we go into specifics. And the future of the region is pretty high. And I suggest that those who are not in this area, they’re going to suffer of the expansion and of the boom, that’s happening, and it’s going to multiply in the very foreseen future.</p>
<p>Oscar: Would you foresee is economical growth in the region?</p>
<p>Salah: Absolutely. And so many other different positions will be made available.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, definitely, super interesting to see in the years to come, how its evolved, and how of course the use of digital identity is part of that success.</p>
<p>Salah: Yes, it is. If you look at Egypt, for example, if you take Egypt as an example, over 100 million people and a big country and its government is definitely planning to go in the right direction. So, what’s stopping it? Nothing is stopping it. It’s undergoing the different changes that are required for the promotion and the achievement of what you call going paperless. Having a government that deals electronically only, that deals with its subjects and residents alike without the use of conventional methods of doing business. That saves a lot on time. That saves a lot on space. That saves a lot on the efficiency and the productivity of any office involved in this.</p>
<p>Speaking of Qatar, and speaking of the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states, let’s speak of the Gulf states without mentioning them. The Gulf states are the leaders in this field, but they could do better. It’s not enough. In technology, there is no place called stationary, I can rest now. I have achieved what I want to achieve. In physics, there is no point called stationary. If you’re not moving forward, you’re moving backwards. And that is technology, if you don’t keep on moving forward, you’re actually moving backward. And technology can’t afford that. And I think to what the region has adapted itself to, I think they have done a pretty good job.</p>
<p>But I’m a perfectionist by nature. And that’s why I’m criticising myself first, to be able to improve on what needs to be worked at. Before? No. IT, no, don’t speak to me about IT. No, no, no, no. Information Technology, don’t speak to me about it. I don’t understand that, well, you know. And when you go to the politicians, it’s even worse. And they tell you, “There is no time for it. We are busy with other political issues now.”</p>
<p>But now, at present, everything has changed. There is time for discussing politics. And there is enough time for technology. And it’s being practiced, and it’s being cultivated, and its end results are being felt. And that’s the beauty of technology, you realise it immediately. You’ll see it in front of you.</p>
<p>And I would like to go back to the question, what do you foresee for the future of the region? It’s going to be a beautiful haven here. Really, many people, including the West, are going to be not only surprised, astonished of the remarkable advancement achieved in this part of the world. When there is a will there is a way. And I’m sure the will is here, and we have found the way. This is the future of this region.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, very promising indeed.</p>
<p>Salah: It might differ between one country to the other by one or two points or three points. But that’s negligible. The trend is to change. And one more thing which hinders is IPv6, the introduction of IPv6, which nobody yet has talked about. And I don’t think the present IPv4 is going to last long. But so far, nobody has made any effort to change to IPv6, and the need is on demand.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot for really enlightening us what is been happening. It’s happening today and it’s coming in the future in the Middle East and the MENA region. I would like to ask your final question, Dr Salah, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, so what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Salah: If they need to go digital and be a paperless country or company or organisation, participating and practicing e-commerce and move to a remote work, they have to choose the right scalable solution. We don’t do it or don’t do it at all. I mean, you can’t say “I’ll apply half the way, half measures taken.” It’s bad. Don’t do it. If you don’t do it 100% correct, don’t do it at all. Because it will be more costly to salvage what would be left from a cyber-attack maybe. It is very dangerous to do work wrongly as it could cost money, time and reputation.</p>
<p>We are doing our level best and we are doing a pretty good job. We are active in every, what you call it seminar, workshop, conferences, we are there to say a word and try to be a good example to the to the public, and at the same time, a try to be down to Earth. We don’t live in the clouds and the people are on Earth down here. No, we are with the people, and we are working for the people, and we hope that we will achieve brilliant results.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. I’m sure you will do more results that you already have been achieving with this great job you do with CIEL, and CIELTECH now in Qatar. So, thank you so much, Dr Salah. Finally, I would like to hear how our listeners can continue this conversation with you, or follow you, or get in touch with you. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Salah: Our email is info@cieltech.qa. CIELTECH, C-I-E-L T-E-C-H, CIELTECH. www.cieltech.qa, this is our website. Our email info@cieltech.qa. If we’re contacted, we’re ready to give immediate reply. We have very active and live buddy on ground. And there is also of course another one, info@ciel.com.lb.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thanks a lot Dr Salah Rustum, it’s been a pleasure talking with you and I wish you all the best.</p>
<p>Salah: Thank you very much.</p>

				<p>Trinsic Ecosystems, the next generation of our full-stack platform for building identity products, is now the default product for new users when you&nbsp;<a href="https://dashboard.trinsic.id/">sign up</a>&nbsp;for Trinsic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since we <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id/status/1232289435317784582">launched in 2020 with our our v1 platform</a>, Trinsic Core, over 1,000 developers have issued their first verifiable credentials using Trinsic. While we’ve gotten great feedback and solidified our place as the best platform to get your hands dirty with verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity (SSI), we’re ready to move towards identity technology that is suited for mass adoption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic Core was underpinned by a bundled set of libraries including Hyperledger Aries, Indy, and Ursa. We’ve <a href="https://trinsic.id/moving-toward-identity-technology-ready-for-mass-adoption/">documented our challenges</a> with this approach—put simply, it did not meet our customers’ requirements for scalability or performance needed for their products to become mainstream.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic Ecosystems contains a number of key improvements that make it more performant, flexible, and adoptable. We believe these improvements will help make SSI technology more widespread.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What’s New in Trinsic Ecosystems  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Every decision we’ve made when building Trinsic Ecosystems has been driven by an intense focus on what <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/10/19/idtech-is-the-new-fintech/?sh=722f6e6e3a88">IDtech</a> product developers need to build an amazing end-user experience. Products developed on this next-gen infrastructure inherit a host of capabilities designed to make them succeed. Here’s a quick summary of what’s new in Trinsic Ecosystems:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Performant and Scalable Verifiable Credential Exchange  		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>Everything in Trinsic Ecosystems is faster. Issue and verify credentials in milliseconds. Bulk issue credentials without any concern about slowdowns.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Awesome New Wallet SDK 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>The first of its kind, our wallet SDK was built from the ground-up for native support in several mobile languages, to be embedded in existing applications, or delivered as a web app—and wallets are synchronized between multiple devices, enhancing user experience.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Ledgerless by Default with the Options to Upgrade DIDs 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				Our default product experience is ledgerless (utilizes the DID:key method). You have full control over how DIDs are upgraded to a ledger/blockchain in your ecosystem, saving you money on ledger fees, and ensuring your independence from any particular chain.					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Standard-compliant, Flexible, ZKP-enabled Credentials 		 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				W3C compliant Verifiable Credentials unlock more flexibility (including use of PDFs, images, dates, etc. rather than just strings in credentials) and interoperability. Additionally, revocation registries are implemented with&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/">Status Lists</a>, a W3C spec.					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Governance Built In 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Ecosystem providers can establish rules in their ecosystem that enhance safety and trust, including managing which participants can issue and verify credentials. Governance can interoperate between ecosystems since we&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-builds-open-source-trust-registry-sponsored-by-essif-lab/">open sourced</a>&nbsp;our Trust Registry implementation which is based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">ToIP spec</a>.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				<p>These are just a few of the exciting updates in Trinsic Ecosystems. For a more in-depth and technical breakdown, please refer to our <a href="https://trinsic-docs-pr-tm-docs-migration.netlify.app/learn/migrate/">migration documentation</a>.</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What Stays the Same in Trinsic Ecosystems 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trinsic’s goal is to be the infrastructure of choice for developers who are building identity wallets and ecosystems to provide more people access to re-usable and self-sovereign identity. We make complex technology easy to use through turnkey APIs and understandable documentation. With that said, here’s what will be the same with the release of our new platform:</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
								 
				  It’s still free to get started with Trinsic  You can start issuing and verifying credentials in minutes manually or programmatically  Trinsic’s high quality infrastructure is ready to scale up as your company grows  Our APIs and SDKs are still easy to use and supported by great documentation  Our team of digital identity experts is still available on Slack, or if you want to schedule time for a call  We’re still focused on spec-compliance, interoperability, and contributing to the broader identity ecosystem  					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Timelines for Moving Forward 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trinsic Core, our v1 platform based on Hyperledger Indy and Aries, will remain operational, supported, and accessible for our existing customers. We will continue to work closely with current customers to help them migrate to our Trinsic Ecosystems platform. You can still access our v1 Studio by visiting <a href="http://studio.trinsic.id">studio.trinsic.id</a> and view the documentation at <a href="http://legacy.docs.trinsic.id">legacy.docs.trinsic.id</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As of November 1st, 2022, Trinsic Ecosystems is the exclusive platform that we provide to new users and customers. We will continue shipping features in Trinsic Ecosystems to support people building IDtech products. If there is something you’d like to see, we’d love to hear from you in our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-pcsdy7kn-h4vtdPEpqQUlmirU8FFzSQ">Slack Community</a>!</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 We’re Ready for the Future of IDtech 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Widespread adoption of SSI will only happen when we have great products built on top of open technologies. Trinsic is ready to be the infrastructure layer that powers a generation of builders reimagining identity in every vertical from education to medical to professional services and beyond. We’re more excited than ever about the future of IDtech, and if you’re building something in the identity space, we would love <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">to talk</a>.&nbsp;</p>

   A new report from KuppingerCole Names ForgeRock an Overall Leader in Passwordless Authentication 

<p>If passwordless authentication is a destination, then identity orchestration is the highway to get there.</p>
	
<p>To define the term, "passwordless authentication" is the act of gaining access to digital resources without the use of traditional user-selected passwords. Given the pervasiveness of data breaches and their association with stolen or misused passwords, the momentum towards a passwordless future is undeniable. In recognition of this movement, KuppingerCole has published its very first <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-overall-leader-passwordless-authentication">Leadership Compass for Passwordless Authentication</a>. But more on that in a minute.</p>
	
 The essential piece: orchestration 
	
<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">Identity orchestration</a>, or just "orchestration," is a way for organizations to quickly build and put in place user access journeys — from beginning to end — that are both easy for users and secure for the enterprise. Within this journey flow, passwordless methods can be enrolled, used, measured, and tweaked to give the organization the assurance that the benefits they seek — making users' lives easier while elevating security — are truly being achieved.</p>
	
 Orchestration is a no-code no-brainer 
	
<p>Orchestration is both strategic and tactical. At a strategic level, orchestration is a critical capability of an identity and access management (IAM) solution, as essential as access management or identity management. It provides the capability to respond rapidly and with maximum agility to changing business conditions, using identity to create a competitive advantage for both your workforce users and for your consumer population, without breaking the budget.</p>
	
<p>At the tactical level, it is a graphical, drag-and-drop tool that IT administrators use to design different user journeys to support the business. In the past, user journeys needed to be hard-coded by developers, which was a timely and expensive process that would often take months to get even a few user journeys in place. When the business or security landscape changed, developers would need to be called back in to re-code those journeys.</p>
	
<p>Modern orchestration involves no coding. This means non-technical IT and identity administrators can design journeys by simply selecting different nodes and flows consisting of users, authentication methods, anti-fraud signals, registration events, step-up authentication, and services, and test them out in near-real time. Putting these journeys into action involves just a few mouse clicks. Post-implementation metrics can be reviewed to evaluate the success/failure rates of different user groups or authentication methods to identify potential issues. Adjustments can be made on the fly. (Picture your business owners smiling.)</p>
	
 How passwordless and orchestration are inextricably linked 
	
<p>Orchestration helps us to get to a passwordless world much quicker. This is not only because user journeys can be rapidly created using passwordless methods, such as fingerprints, facial scans, push notifications, a variety of hardware tokens, and QR codes, but also because orchestration helps support a phased approach.</p>
	
<p>We often find organizations get cold feet because they feel passwordless is an "all or nothing" approach. Either all my users get it or none of them do. But orchestration allows for testing out certain groups, experimenting with different methods and rolling out passwordless on your own schedule. You can define which passwordless methods you want to support based on your security policies. Not comfortable with QR codes? No problem, don't add that option to your passwordless orchestration flows. Need to add the latest biometric method to your user flows? Simply drag and drop it into your user access flows. Click. Done.</p>
	
 Don't forget the registration 
	
<p>Registration is often the first step in the orchestrated flow. Users need to enroll themselves or their devices, usually mobile phones and sometimes hardware tokens, in order to enact passwordless authentication. Registration is where this happens.</p>
	
<p>But interesting things are going on in this space. Users want options. They want a primary authentication method and a secondary one as a backup, just in case they are working from a different device or location. Orchestration and registration make this easy by giving users a simple, lightweight, step-by-step enrollment process.</p>
	
<p>The ultimate goal of the symbiosis of registration and orchestration is to create great user experiences that keep people from getting frustrated and dropping out of the process. For employees, such a scenario may mean they are being kept from the resources they need to do their jobs. Worse, for consumers, it can mean an abandoned shopping cart and lost revenue. These situations are all-too familiar in the traditional password world, but become rarities in the passwordless world of self-service and choice.</p>
	
 I got a new phone. Now what? 
	
<p>Passwordless authentication is the new frontier. The standard implementation of FIDO2 with its WebAuthn standard relies on asymmetric cryptography that generates and securely places the private keys on the user's mobile device or in their web browser. This is great, but what happens when the user is without that device, or loses it or gets a new one?</p>
	
<p>Here again, all roads lead back to a well-designed orchestration flow. A process can be designed wherein a user can request and be granted emergency or new device access without IT intervention. The ways to do this are myriad, but they can rely on some combination of QR code, known enrolled secondary device (see registration above), signals such as location, and a one-time code to a confirmed email.</p>
	
<p>But know this: if you've heard that passwordless seizes up in the face of users getting new devices, you should understand that well-designed, automated, and secure orchestration can keep your users happy, productive, and safe.</p>
	
 ForgeRock named an overall leader by KuppingerCole for passwordless authentication 
	
<p>ForgeRock has been named as an overall leader in the 2022 KuppingerCole Passwordless Authentication Leadership Compass. We invite you to download the free report <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-overall-leader-passwordless-authentication">here</a>.</p>
	
<p>When evaluating the 24 vendors for its report, KuppingerCole defined its requirements for functionality and support for integration, as well as requirements regarding the architecture, deployment model, and interoperability with traditional applications, cloud services, and new digital services. Some of these requirements included:</p>
	
  An integrated and secure authentication approach 
   A strong level of usability (e.g., simple device onboarding; recurring authentication) 
   Authentication methods that eliminate passwords and other easily phishable factors 
   The ability for organizations to control which users and devices can access sensitive information 
 <blockquote><p>"With its many innovative features and flexible architecture, ForgeRock Identity Platform should be on the short list for organizations considering deploying passwordless authentication solutions."</p>
		<p>– Alejandro Leal, Analyst, KuppingerCole Analysts AG</p></blockquote>
	
 Why ForgeRock for passwordless authentication 
	
<p>In an ever-changing world, one variable that has remained amazingly consistent year after year is that user-selected passwords continue to be the main source of data breaches everywhere they are used.</p>
	
<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/2022-forgerock-consumer-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock 2022 Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, shows that unauthorized access has been the number-one cause of breaches for four consecutive years, and that account takeover (ATO) attacks rose more than 300% between 2020 and 2021.</p>
	
<p>The great news is that passwordless is real, and the obstacles that once prevented your ability to move to a passwordless system can be eliminated with excellent orchestration, such as ForgeRock Intelligent Access Trees.</p>

  UK legislators greenlighted a proposed bill that seeks to legitimize crypto assets by recognizing them as regulated financial instruments.  However, the proposed bill is yet to be enacted as a law, as it will still have to be approved by the House of Lords and receive royal approval from King Charles&nbsp;III.  The bill was introduced during the time when the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was the country’s finance minister in the Boris Johnson-led administration.  <p>In what could be defined as one of the most significant moments for the crypto world in 2022, UK legislators voted to recognize crypto as regulated financial instruments and products in the country last&nbsp;week.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1584976211926974465?s=20&amp;t=8V3t6i7wjCE0NPrlprrl5w">Image Source</a>)<p>Introduced by Parliamentarian Andrew Griffith, the proposed bill seeks to establish a framework for the ongoing regulation of digital assets and extend payment rules to stablecoins as&nbsp;well.</p><p>This is how it went: the lower house of the Parliament voted to add digital assets to the scope of activities to be regulated via the proposed Financial Services and Markets&nbsp;Bill.</p><p>Known as the House of Commons, the lower house had a line-by-line reading of the proposed bill, which broadly covers the UK’s post-Brexit economic strategy.</p><blockquote>Speaking on the proposed bill, Mr. Griffith said, “The substance here is to treat them (crypto assets) like other forms of financial assets and not to prefer them, but also to bring them within the scope of regulation for the first&nbsp;time.”</blockquote> Quite a way to go,&nbsp;yet <p>This crypto provision in the bill depends on the definition of a crypto asset included by a new clause 14. Under this, the authorities can regulate crypto promotions and outlaw those crypto companies that are not authorized to operate in the&nbsp;country.</p><blockquote>Griffith further said that the Treasury would be consulting on its approach with industry stakeholders before it uses its power to ensure the framework reflects the unique benefits as well as risks posed by crypto activities.</blockquote><p>According to Griffith, the inclusion of crypto in the bill will ensure the country’s Treasury is equipped to respond quickly to the developments made in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Moreover, the Treasury will also work on delivering regulation in an “agile” way, in accordance with the country’s broader approach to regulating the financial services sector, he&nbsp;added.</p><p>That said, the bill is yet to be passed into law as it will be next sent to the upper house of the Parliament, the House of Lords. The amendments will then be given a final consideration and finally go before King Charles III for royal approval.</p><p>This latest development comes as the country welcomes Rishi Sunak’s appointment as the UK’s new Prime Minister. The markets bill was actually introduced during Sunak’s time as finance minister in the Boris Johnson administration.</p><blockquote>The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sunak, is known for his crypto friendliness as earlier this year, he said, “It’s my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology.”</blockquote><blockquote>The leader of the Conservative Party also commissioned the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token (NFT), saying at the time, “We want to see the businesses of tomorrow — and the jobs they create — here in the UK, and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term.”</blockquote><p>According to Sunak, this is the part of the plan that will ensure the financial services industry of the UK is “always at the forefront of technology and innovation.”</p><p>He has also talked about crypto’s potential to provide exciting new opportunities by offering people new ways to transact and invest while ensuring consumers are protected.</p><p>However, the 42-year-old investment banker-turned-politician is a long-time proponent of the Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and has also set up a task force to lead the UK’s work on a digital fiat,&nbsp;CBDC.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/DrProfitCrypto/status/1584616629589409793?s=20&amp;t=8V3t6i7wjCE0NPrlprrl5w">Image Source</a>)<p>Many from the crypto world have also called out those celebrating because of Rishi Sunak’s crypto affinity by saying that he is “CBDC-friendly” and not “crypto-friendly,” as portrayed. Whatever may be the truth, it would be interesting to see how the UK’s policies under the new PM impact crypto in the coming&nbsp;days.</p><p>Crypto exchanges and custodians need a FATF Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<blockquote>With Indonesia greenlighting the Personal Data Protection Bill, crypto exchanges and custodians offering services to its citizens, be it within the country or abroad, must obtain explicit consent before collecting, storing, and processing user data for FATF Travel Rule purposes.</blockquote><blockquote>Indonesia’s PDP bill has many similar segments to the EU’s GDPR, which includes definitions, obligations, accountability, etc.</blockquote><blockquote>Although the PDP bill does not mandate data localization, it demands that cross-border data transfers be undertaken securely and transparently.</blockquote><p>Indonesia’s House of Representatives gave the go-ahead to the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP) on September 20th, paving the way for the country’s first ever data privacy-focused law. The next step in the loop was a presidential signature, which was granted on October 17th, enacting the bill into&nbsp;law.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/empo11on/status/1572144329233207299?s=20&amp;t=YWddzLUhPCQ8reBo9J5FZA">Image Source</a>)<p>With this, the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) have their work cut out to comply with the regulation while wading through the brutal crypto winter that has brought the global crypto market down to trillion&nbsp;dollars.</p><p>And therefore, in this article, we will look at the bill’s impact on Virtual Asset Service Providers, or VASPs, with respect to the FATF Travel Rule and a solution that can make the VASP compliance journey frictionless. But before that, let’s look at what the bill is all&nbsp;about!</p> What’s the Purpose of the&nbsp;bill? <p>The PDP bill will enable Indonesia to meet the international standards of personal data and rights. As such, it consists of many segments similar to the internationally-recognized personal data protection laws, most notably the EU’s GDPR, including definitions, obligations, and accountability, to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>However, there are more than a few differences as well. For instance, the bill will only apply to foreign entities when they violate Indonesia’s laws or handle user data of Indonesians based outside the&nbsp;country.</p> The Key Factors: PDP Bill &amp; Travel Rule Compliance  User Consent <p>The Personal Data Protection Bill mandates that all entities obtain explicit consent before storing and processing the data of Indonesians.</p><p>As such, collecting user data without consent is a serious offense under Indonesia’s new data privacy laws and can attract severe penalties, which can be up to 2% of annual&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Thus, VASPs with Indonesian customers must obtain explicit consent to collect and process FATF Travel Rule data before sharing it with counterparty VASPs for compliance purposes. As a reminder, the FATF Travel Rule is a mandated requirement that countries are implementing where VASPs will have to share details of the originator and beneficiary to transactions.</p><p>That’s where Shyft Veriscope comes into the picture, as it simplifies this process by taking consumer consent every time before personal data is&nbsp;shared.</p> Secure and Transparent Travel Rule Data Processing <p>Under Art 16(2) of the bill, organizations must ensure that data transfers are secure and transparent. Thus, VASPs complying with the FATF Travel Rule must use a solution that can process user data securely and transparently. And by doing so, VASPs will not only comply with the recently approved PDP bill but also the FATF Travel Rule as mandated by the country’s regulator BAPPEBTI.</p><p>Now, the question is, how can a VASP ensure security when using a FATF Travel Rule solution that stores and routes user data through third-party servers? Moreover, will such a Travel Rule solution take responsibility in case of a breach? And, even more important, who is responsible for detecting if a breach has occurred?</p><p>The fact is, in most cases, such Travel Rule Solutions will point out that they are not contractually liable for the breach. Thus, the onus is on VASPs. So, VASPs must understand the legal aspect of data privacy, data security, and consent before choosing a Travel Rule solution.</p><blockquote>Simply put, Shyft Veriscope is a true game-changer among all options available in the market as not only are all Travel Rule data transfers on it VASP-to-VASP (i.e., peer-to-peer) but also encrypted with public-private keys that only the transacting VASPs have access to. Moreover, at no point does the FATF Travel Rule data pass through Shyft Network’s infrastructure.</blockquote><p>Whilst we are discussing Indonesia here, the new bill is reflective of data privacy laws around the world. So, the implications of Shyft Veriscope’s global solution can be far wider than the 16 million transacting Indonesian users.</p> No Data is&nbsp;Secured! <p>IBM’s 2022 Cost of a Data Breach Report notes that the entire life cycle of a data breach among mature organizations is <a href="https://www.traceable.ai/blog-post/lessons-ibm-2022-cost-of-a-data-breach-report">237 days</a>, which includes the total days the organizations spent on identifying (184 days) and containing data breaches (53 days). If this seems like a rather big figure, the early and mid-stage organizations, including decentralized organizations, will likely spend even&nbsp;longer.</p><p>This points to the fact that no data is secured, regardless of the stage or type of organization. In fact, even organizations with best-in-class security can (and do) get&nbsp;hacked.</p><blockquote>Thus, VASPs must choose a FATF Travel Rule solution that can enable them to mitigate the risks of data breaches, to be able to detect in real time any unwanted attempts to access data and ensure that they prioritize the “Privacy by Design” mechanism, which is one of the fundamental principles of GDPR as&nbsp;well.</blockquote><p>Shyft Veriscope has this in hand — offering VASP-to-VASP data transfer capability, automated VASP discovery, and obtaining explicit user consent to store and process data. It is privacy-by-design, compliance-by-design, frictionless-by-design, and efficiency-by-design.</p><p>Crypto exchanges and custodians need a FATF Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Shyft Veriscope is built to meet that requirement, regardless of country or digital&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Visit our website to read more: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">https://www.shyft.network/veriscope</a> and contact our team to discuss: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact">https://www.shyft.network/contact</a></p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://bb.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> for up-to-date news from the world of crypto regulations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/indonesia-approves-data-protection-bill-impact-on-travel-rule-compliance-daa27a8cc1c2">Indonesia Approves Data Protection Bill: Impact on Travel Rule Compliance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Keeping your money somewhere safe and accessible is a problem as old as civilization. In modern times, we have a few practical solutions. You could always keep some cash “under the mattress” such as at home in a safe and some spending money in your wallet. But for larger sums, it makes sense to keep your money with a bank, where it’s secure and FDIC&nbsp;insured.</p><p>That money at the bank also exists in digital form, recorded on the bank’s internal ledger, making it easily accessible via ATM or debit&nbsp;card.</p><p>In the context of this piece, keeping your money at the bank is a form of a custodial wallet. By depositing your money with the bank, they now have custody of your assets and hold the keys, but allow you to access your funds at your convenience. Naturally, some restrictions apply, both from a regulatory and operational perspective. There might be limits on how much money you can take out without providing additional information. Or the bank might be closed on&nbsp;Sunday.</p> The arrival of the non-custodial wallet <p>The rise of Bitcoin and crypto — now a trillion-dollar asset class — has birthed a new way of storing your funds: the non-custodial wallet.</p><p>Similar to the bank, your money exists in digital form on a ledger, but rather than sitting on the bank’s ledger, the accounts are listed on a blockchain.</p><p>And because this is a non-custodial wallet, you own the keys to your wallet rather than the bank. In a way, it’s akin to keeping cash at home in a safe or in your physical wallet. Since it’s in digital form, you can securely and conveniently keep far larger sums under your direct control. The best part? You can access your funds and initiate payments for transfers 24/7/365 in real-time and with minimal costs. That’s the benefit of relying on a blockchain (and yourself) rather than a&nbsp;bank.</p><p>Non-custodial wallets can hold an assortment of assets — from crypto to NFTs to fiat-denominated currencies such as US dollar stablecoins. With the emergence of decentralized finance or DeFi in this last crypto cycle, we saw non-custodial wallets facilitate the transfer of billions of dollars of&nbsp;value.</p> A compliant wallet that you own and&nbsp;control <p>With sums like that, regulators and policy makers are taking notice. Now that crypto winter is upon us, the focus will now shift towards digital identity and how to make non-custodial wallets compliant.</p><p>Last week, GlobaliD <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">released its non-custodial wallet</a> with support for crypto, NFTs, and US dollar stablecoins — all while being attached to a digital identity, one of the first of its&nbsp;kind.</p><p>Our vision for the future of digital wallets is straightforward. You should be able to have ownership and control of your identity and your wallet. You should have the keys to your economic potential in a fully compliant manner.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — October 24 to October&nbsp;30 <p>Welcome to another interesting edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We bring you some of the most exciting news from the world of crypto regulations, from Singapore’s proposed crypto regulation to the Vietnamese Prime Minister’s call to regulate cryptocurrencies. Without further ado, let’s dive straight&nbsp;in.</p> Singapore Proposes New Crypto Regulation <a href="https://www.relinvestmentsgroup.com/en/novosti/denezhno-kreditnoe-upravlenie-singapura-issleduet-transgranichnuyu-cbdc_-kotoraja-mozhet-brosit-vyzov-swift.htm">Image Source</a><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has released new crypto regulation proposals outlining rules for crypto trading by retail investors to protect&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>These proposed measures “mark the next milestone in enhancing Singapore’s regulatory approach to foster an innovative and responsible digital asset ecosystem. Regulations go hand-in-hand with innovation in financial services,” said Ms. Ho Hern Shin, Deputy Managing Director, MAS.</blockquote><p>Under the new regulations, digital payment token (DPT) service providers must ensure adequate asset segregation, reduce potential conflicts of interest, and develop procedures for managing complaints.</p><p>Meanwhile, the central bank promises to permit stablecoin development as a reliable means of exchange, noting MAS will regulate the issuance of those stablecoins pegged to only a Single Currency (SCS), where its value in circulation surpasses S$5&nbsp;million.</p><p>However, all SCS issuers must hold reserve assets in cash, cash equivalents, or short-dated sovereign debt securities.</p> US Voters Demand Crypto Regulation <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3861814-Legal-Regulations">Image Source</a><p>A national poll conducted in October by the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry group backed by the likes of Coinbase, Paradigm, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Block, revealed that 52% of the 1,200 voters surveyed want the industry to be more regulated. Only 7% of respondents voters said the industry should be less regulated.</p><p>The poll results further show that more voters want to see lawmakers treat crypto as a “serious and valid part of the economy” than as a “mechanism for fraud” and other&nbsp;crimes.</p><p>But when developing crypto regulations, 58% of voters want lawmakers to prioritize market stability and fraud detection.</p><p>According to the poll, 13% of respondents own cryptocurrency, but only 1% said they own an&nbsp;NFT.</p> Hong Kong to Make Retail Crypto Trading&nbsp;Legal <a href="https://lepetitjournal.com/hong-kong/hong-kong-perd-20-places-etude-qualite-vie-326114">Image Source</a><p>Hong Kong is planning to make retail crypto trading legal in the city by introducing mandatory licensing for crypto platforms.</p><p>The government is proposing to allow retail investors to trade in crypto and crypto ETFs in an attempt to become the centre and a financial hub for&nbsp;crypto.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/CurlleySean/status/1587022545001144320?s=20&amp;t=ReX1kHZd6141QpJ6eBrCJA">Image Source</a><p>Moreover, the government plans to review property rights for tokenized assets and explore legalizing smart contracts. This is likely to pave the way for real estate&nbsp;STOs.</p><blockquote>“We want to make our policy stance clear to the global market, to demonstrate our determination to explore fintech with the global virtual asset community,” said Financial Secretary Paul Chan at the Hong Kong Fintech Week conference.</blockquote><p>While expected to launch in March next year, the program is still subject to public consultation.</p> Vietnam Prime Minister Calls for Crypto Regulation <p>Vietnam Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has called for research into crypto legislation because people continue to trade virtual assets despite them not being recognized.</p><p>Surprisingly, Vietnam actually leads the world in grassroots crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis.</p><p>According to a report from online news source VnExpress, Chinh reportedly suggested that a bill on anti-money laundering (AML) should recognize an amendment on virtual currencies.</p><blockquote>“It is necessary to study appropriate sanctions and assign the government to make detailed regulations,” the prime minister&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Back in July 2021, the prime minister ordered the State Bank of Vietnam to research and carried out a pilot for a digital currency.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! <p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope.

 New IDnow whitepaper, ‘Preparing for the known: Operating in a world of crypto regulation.’, explores the challenges facing UK crypto exchanges in 2023 and beyond. 



 



<p>In April 2022, the UK government announced plans to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology and investment. This was a bold proclamation, especially considering how painfully prohibitive the UK crypto money laundering registration can be, and how difficult competing on the global stage will soon become as UK crypto exchanges juggle domestic and European regulations, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With upcoming regulations from the EU and the UK in 2023, the crypto asset market is about to receive a level of protection and accountability that it has never experienced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, will bringing cryptocurrency into the mainstream and adding stability and accountability have a positive effect on crypto exchanges, or will organizations decide to trade elsewhere?&nbsp;</p>



 Riding the crypto waves and crashes.&nbsp; 



<p>In their short existence,&nbsp;cryptocurrencies have experienced an extremely high level of volatility. The price of Bitcoin broke $1,000 for the first time in 2017, and rose to nearly $20,000 in the same year, only for the price to dip to nearly $3,000 within the space of a few months. In 2022, the crypto market is at the mercy of considerable bull and bear markets, although many crypto users are predicting that this will change as the crypto market matures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A considerable volume of crypto assets is used by bad actors&nbsp;for money laundering, fraud and payment for other nefarious activities because it can be transferred quickly and with a high degree of privacy. Indeed, in the early days, cryptocurrency platforms did not&nbsp;require customers to undergo ID verification or background/credit card checks. In fact, some still don’t.&nbsp;</p>



 Brexit and cryptocurrency.&nbsp; 



<p>As the UK’s laws regarding cryptocurrency are a) not particularly clear, and b) do not offer any protection or authority outside of the UK, it is very likely that UK consumers may instead go to offshore providers, which UK regulators have no authority over. In the internet era, where consumers can access services of international platforms as easily as domestic, the FCA, alongside other financial regulators from around the world, face an uphill battle to ensure its citizens are not being targeted by foreign crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



 Europe to steady crypto ship.&nbsp; 



<p>There were two major developments in EU crypto regulation in 2022. The first was an extension of the European Transfer of Funds Regulation to include crypto assets, meaning the sender and beneficiary of all applicable or centralized crypto transactions will need to be identified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While those in the crypto community that relished the anonymity of decentralized transactions are likely to be unhappy with the development, others see it as a sign that regulation is finally catching up with the industry and bringing some much-needed clarity for crypto asset service providers. &nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p>So, how feasible is the task of not only taming UK’s crypto Wild West, but building a world-leading crypto hub? &nbsp;</p>



<p>Underpinning many of the debates regarding regulations is the need for crypto exchanges to be able to identify who their customers are. In an industry where anonymity is often touted as one of&nbsp;its biggest selling points, this will be no easy feat. Therefore, it’s important to not only offer secure customer onboarding, but for the process to remain as convenient as possible.&nbsp;</p>

 Looking after a fleet of vehicles is already a big undertaking and that’s not even including the drivers. With automated driver’s license checks, fleet management drivers can head out on the highway without any unexpected adventures. 



<p>Taking care of an entire fleet of vehicles is no easy task as there are many important aspects to the job. So when it comes to fleet management, anything that makes processes smoother, safer and helps the company improve its safety and liability is worth investing in. Such an investment can be achieved through driver’s license checks with all employees within the fleet.</p>



 Responsibility as Fleet Manager 



<p>As an employer of thousands of vehicles and drivers, responsibilities can pile up quickly. However, one of the main responsibilities as fleet manager includes taking the proper care to ensure that all employees, including professional drivers, company drivers, pool car users, etc. are appropriately licensed and insured to drive. This is especially the case considering that employers have a duty of care when it comes to their drivers to make sure they are operating in a safe and healthy way.</p>



<p>By conducting <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-checks-car-fleet-management/">driver’s license checks for all employees within the fleet</a>, in order to verify the validity of their licenses, both the company, the driver and the manager are covered in the case of an accident. This is especially important considering that Fleet World reports that road accidents are the biggest cause of accidental death in the workplace, and around 73,000 business drivers are injured each year in accidents. Thus, along with the moral and legal obligations to look after employees, it makes economic sense for firms to protect the wellbeing of staff.</p>



<p>But driver license checks don’t stop the moment the driver has been recruited. It is also crucial to do at least six-month checks in order to make sure the driver has not accrued any points on their license as well as other possible accumulations that could negatively impact everyone in the company such as specific mileage, accidents and endorsements. According to a survey conducted by RAC Insurance in the UK, <a href="https://media.rac.co.uk/pressreleases/a-quarter-of-drivers-have-kept-penalty-points-secret-from-their-insurer-1966321">almost a fifth of drivers (18%) would not inform their insurer if they picked up penalty points</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, when conducting the first driver’s license check upon recruitment, employers should be aware of the date of birth so <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">underage driving can be prevented</a> and fake licenses can be detected.</p>



<p>Driver’s license checking is one of the top responsibilities as a fleet manager, if not the most important. Keep your fleet safe by checking every driver’s license before the driver hops into the seat of the company’s vehicles.</p>



 Why driver’s license checking matters 



<p>The importance of driver’s license checking cannot be stressed enough within fleet management. With common EU laws, such as the Road Traffic Act § 21 StVG in Germany, stipulating the employer’s obligation to ensure that its employees have a valid driver’s license, safety becomes paramount for those owning the vehicles as well those driving them.</p>



<p>As such, employers have a legal obligation to perform regular driver’s licence checks for all employees driving within the fleet, no matter the type of vehicle.</p>



<p>According to the Automobile Association (AA) in the UK, <a href="https://www.drivetech.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Driver-Training-That-Changes-Behaviour.pdf">one in 650 fleet drivers are driving while disqualified</a> and one in 300 have a revoked or expiring driver’s license. Since it can be a criminal offense for a person to be driving without a valid license, this puts both the driver and employer at risk.</p>



<p>Furthermore, when driver’s license checks are not performed, employers can be liable for drivers within their fleet that do not possess a valid driver’s license. This also includes temporary revoked licenses, foreign driver’s licenses that have not yet been reissued, as well as the owner who is aware of the driver’s lack of valid license. If caught, both the employer and driver face the risk of a restriction or loss of insurance coverage.</p>



<p>Management can also be held liable if driver’s license checks are not performed on a safe system. The system should be able to detect all crucial information since <a href="https://www.drivetech.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Driver-Training-That-Changes-Behaviour.pdf">one in 16 drivers have issues with their photocard</a>. Thus, it is imperative to use a driver’s license verification system that is reliable, safe and compliant.</p>



 







 Benefits of automated driver’s license checks in the fleet 



<p>Although implementing an automated driver’s license check can sound burdensome and intimidating, the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages.</p>



<p>When comparing an automated driver’s license check to a manual or electronic system with reading station, an automated system saves time and money while also being more flexible. With a fully automated driver’s license check, the driver himself can perform the driver’s license check anytime and anywhere with a mobile application. In the end, this reduces the workload of the fleet manager while still getting immediate access to verified data so deadlines can still be met without losing any time.</p>



<p>Furthermore, by implementing such a system, it reduces the risks of potential fraud as well as misinterpretation of information. When an automated driver’s license check is performed, safety data is extracted and the authenticity of the license is verified by matching the security and personal information with the relevant government database.</p>



<p>In the end, fleet operations can feel confident in their drivers as well as avoid any unnecessary fines.</p>



 Implementing a robust driver’s license check solution 



<p>Making sure your <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-checks-car-fleet-management/">fleet has a robust driver’s license solution</a> set up should be a main priority in order to protect the company and the drivers. IDnow is here to assist in implementing such a solution.</p>



<p>As an important safety concern, IDnow can help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your fleet through its automated solution called <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>. It is easily installed on a mobile device and can be used by all drivers of a fleet.</p>



<p>AutoIdent can be integrated into an existing fleet solution as a web and mobile solution using the SDK as a white-label solution or as a native app from IDnow. Intuitive and robust, it reliably detects incorrect entries and quickly guides the user to successful completion of the driver’s license check.</p>



<p>Data extraction of the driver’s license can be conducted either through hologram verification or NFC verification technology. Additionally, verification is possible with RFID if the driver has an ID document with an RFID chip as well as an NFC-enabled smartphone. The IDnow app will recognize the chip and perform the necessary checks.</p>



<p>Add-ons such as a QES for additional security and regulatory compliance can be included. Plus, IDnow’s solutions are GDPR-compliant, but each company must take into account data protection requirements before introducing a new system.</p>



<p>Once a driver’s license check solution has been implemented into your fleet, the investment will pay off in the end. Make it part of the routine in order to keep the company, the drivers and everyone on the road safer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are your top 3 cybersecurity priorities? And have they changed much in recent years? 
<p>So, my top three cybersecurity priorities haven't actually really changed over the years. They actually changed in content and severity but not over all. So, a major concern, of course, are we seeing enough, do we know whether we are somehow compromised or not? The second question, of course, are we protected enough to actually avoid this happening in the first place, and as a regulated entity our third thought is already around regulatory compliance because security and regulatory compliance commend each other and build upon each other but doesn't mean that if you are regulatory compliant that you're automatically as well secure.</p>
 What are the central gaps in cybersecurity that have been left unaddressed in recent years? 
<p>So overall the market overall has changed obviously quite quickly and at all times like tooling and strategies and all this, we had many of them, there were really a lot on the market, and it felt a little bit like the market is fighting more than that we are fighting the adversaries. And it's difficult to keep up with the pace. Because we know that in the meantime we are pretty much attacked by bots, by attack-as-a-service and it's hard as an enterprise to keep up with that development in the pace that this is happening.</p>
 How mature are the governance processes to ensure secure software usage in companies today? 
<p>First of all, what we see is that vulnerabilities they actually are being created in the moment software is being created, and they are detected whenever they are detected. What we are missing a little bit is a warranty for pretty much all products you have a warranty that actually it functions as designed in all this. The software and the entire IT industry has avoided any kind of cyber warranty to begin with. If you follow that thought that could actually drive to a completely different setup.</p>
 How can companies prevent attacks on their supply chains with the help of software? 
<p>Supply chain attacks is definitely latest since last year top of the list of course. Because regardless which enterprise you are in, regardless what we are doing, we are always seen as one element in the chain of an end-to-end process. So third-party, in-party cybersecurity is definitely very important. In the recent past what we have seen is that tooling which focuses on GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) and all this have grown into monitoring and scanning tools and the scanning tools on the opposite side moved exactly into the GRC space. So, what we're currently seeing is a merger of third-party, in-party controls and companies who actually offer that as-a-service growing together with internal assessment of the security posture. So, I'm looking forward in probably a year or two from now that we're going to see one set of scanners in all this, we actually establish a security posture for an in-party relationship as well for the end own enterprise.</p>
 Which is the bigger factor in cybersecurity: Technology or people? 
<p>People, technology, processes and I don't want to weight them against each other. It is all around this triangle and you need to keep it up at all times, all three elements of that. And once one legs behind this becomes important and you need to actually ramp up. So not a big difference but it's still since quite a time, this is a magic triangle.</p>
<p>What can people expect who participate at the round table?</p>
<p>It is all around sharing intelligence, everybody has good ideas, everybody has really thought this term through how to deal with vulnerabilities overall, the value is being created sitting everybody on the table and exchange experience what works, what didn't work. It is all around that. And I think there's definitely some benefit behind this.</p>

<p>WeChat: From October 27 to October 29, Jelurida Korea took part in the BWB 2022, the blockchain conference in Busan City, Korea. In addition to welcoming crypto enthusiasts to the booth and showcasing the remarkable projects in the Ardor ecosystem, Jelurida held a Corporate Meetup session on October 29 with a great audience, while most of the meetups were cancelled for no-shows. Crypto trading companies, public blockchain developers for gaming and businesses, and KBIPA members (Korea Blockchain Industry Promotion Association) got very much interested in the topic of Ardor public blockchain use cases in the public sector, such as the Senator project.</p>

 DINO: the largest distribution network for tokenized securities 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Everywhere you read about the benefits of tokenization, you will hear about a&nbsp;broader access to investment opportunities, fractionalization, and democratization. It is true that security tokens, as a digital form of securities, are much easier to manage for issuers, their agents, and their investors. Therefore, it becomes possible to propose offerings to hundreds or thousands of investors without the hassle.</p>
<p>However, it is not because you tokenize an asset that investors will rush to buy it. When you launch a website, the traffic is not coming magically, it is the same for digital securities.&nbsp;Tokenization brings the investment infrastructure and automated compliance, but it doesn’t bring the audience.</p>
<p>To tackle this issue, we are building day after day&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-we-are-building-an-interoperable-ecosystem-for-private-markets/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8lUVA8jCXONUk8v-fVzU-yHgEUA7GgGUEfe_Hi0xl9soGpm8lxq6NBDTabGt1csvdw5LHD">a complete ecosystem</a>&nbsp;around the tokenization protocol we launched on the market years ago.&nbsp;Assets tokenized with the ERC3643 standard are immediately interoperable&nbsp;with all the service providers of the ecosystem, including dozens of liquidity providers, opening access to investors.</p>
<p>Depending on the assets tokenized, the targeted investors, and the objectives of the issuers,&nbsp;different types of liquidity venues can be made accessible for a token,&nbsp;and all embedded data and compliance rules are made available to liquidity providers. All stakeholders are included in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/dino/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8lUVA8jCXONUk8v-fVzU-yHgEUA7GgGUEfe_Hi0xl9soGpm8lxq6NBDTabGt1csvdw5LHD">the distribution network DINO</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;covers both primary and secondary markets.&nbsp;With over $28 billion of tokenized securities, DINO is already the world’s largest distribution network for tokenized securities.</p>
<p>Large financial institutions, banks, asset managers, broker dealers, securities distributors, advisory firms, market makers and exchanges are joining the DINO. They access the largest catalog of tokenized securities and are able to tokenize new assets as well.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Step-by-step, a galaxy of trading venues and distributors emerges consisting of&nbsp;digital trading desks&nbsp;(OTC, Billboard, etc.),&nbsp;regulated trading venues&nbsp;(ATS, MTF, exchanges, etc.),&nbsp;decentralized exchanges, and&nbsp;DeFi protocols.</p>
<p>Last month, Ownera, a global liquidity network backed by J.P. Morgan, was integrated to DINO, alongside Assetera, an EU-regulated trading platform. An ATS will soon announce the addition of DINO to cover the U.S. jurisdictions. Many more are preparing for integration into DINO in 2023.</p>
<p>As the ecosystem continues to grow,&nbsp;we are improving the scalability of our products to enable thousands of digital securities to access DINO, as well as helping liquidity providers join DINO with easy-to-integrate APIs.</p>

  ‘Ready or not?‘ Euro Banking Association (EBA) publishes practitioners’ guide to the Digital Operating Model for Open Banking 
bauke

30 October 2022 - 10:11

                    
      
    
      
             <p>Supported by INNOPAY, the EBA Open Banking Working Group (OBWG) has published&nbsp;a&nbsp;report titled ‘Ready or not? Gearing the bank operating model towards digital and Open Banking readiness’. Specifically aimed at those responsible for Open Banking within their organisation, the report supports them on their journey&nbsp;towards future-proof operations&nbsp;– regardless of their starting point.</p>

<p>The ‘Ready or not?’ report addresses both the general implications of digital readiness and the specific requirements for the successful implementation of Open Banking at the operating model level. It is designed to provide a reference point when transforming the operating model and to help the people responsible to execute their Open Banking strategy in the emerging digital environment.</p>

<p>Challenged by the changing environment, different banks are pursuing different strategies to achieve digital readiness. The report identifies five&nbsp;common underlying&nbsp;design principles for future-proof banking operations:&nbsp;</p>

  Customer-focused&nbsp;–&nbsp;embedding products and services at point of relevance for the customer&nbsp; 
	 Data-driven&nbsp;– expanding data availability with consumption of external data sources&nbsp; 
	 Openness-oriented&nbsp;– allowing interaction with third parties and ecosystems&nbsp; 
	 Technology-enabled&nbsp;–&nbsp;supporting&nbsp;state-of-the-art API infrastructure&nbsp; 
	 Adaptive to change&nbsp;– increasing&nbsp;flexibility and reducing the time to market for new propositions&nbsp; 
 <p>The report is based on interviews with Open&nbsp;Banking experts from various European banks combined with INNOPAY’s extensive experience in the field of&nbsp;Open&nbsp;Banking and&nbsp;operating&nbsp;model&nbsp;design. It explains how the design principles can be applied in practice to all aspects of a bank’s operations, right down to activity level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An abstract of the paper is available to everyone on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abe-eba.eu/thought-leadership-innovation/open-banking-working-group/">EBA</a>&nbsp;website (and members can gain online access to the full report). If you have any questions, whether about the report or about operating models for Open Banking,&nbsp;please&nbsp;reach out to <a href="mailto:%20mounaim.cortet@innopay.com">Mounaim Cortet.</a></p>

  <p>Winning Together is one of the key pillars of ForgeRock’s culture. Winning together doesn’t only mean our teams support one another to deliver for our customers, it also stands for doing the right thing. As a global company, we know it's our responsibility to make our communities a better place, to support the causes that matter to our people, and ensure that through all we do our communities continue to win.</p>

<p>This year we made strides in our ability to make a difference during Global Action Week, ForgeRock’s annual community volunteering campaign. The week is designed to empower our employees to take time to give back and make a difference to the causes that matter most to them.</p>

<p>How have ForgeRockers made an impact in 2022?<br>Restoring and donating hundreds of laptops to support disadvantaged youths in Bristol.</p>

<p>This year over 20 volunteers from across the company spent a day restoring over 150 laptops in preparation for donation. These will be donated to local causes that support children, helping them to gain access to computers and the internet, an effort to help close the digital divide. This initiative also resulted in the reduction of over 22,000 lbs of carbon going into landfill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In San Francisco, ForgeRockers helped create and donate hygiene kits to the homeless and also volunteered at the <a href="http://www.glide.org/">Glide Memorial Church</a> to feed those in need. GLIDE is a nationally recognized center for social justice and its mission to create an inclusive and loving community aligns with our Global Action Week’s goal to give back and make a difference to our communities.</p>

<p>Our Singapore team spent the morning distributing meals at <a href="https://willinghearts.org.sg/">Willing Hearts</a>, a not-for-profit charity that is almost entirely run by volunteers, apart from a handful of staff. The team at Willing Hearts prepares, cooks, and distributes 11,000 daily meals to over 70 locations island-wide, 365 days a year. Beneficiaries include the elderly, the disabled, low-income families, children from single-parent families or otherwise poverty-stricken families, and migrant workers in Singapore. Our Singapore team chose this organization because of the significant impact Willing Hearts has on the people who need it most in the area.</p>

<p>These are just some of the highlights - there were several other volunteering initiatives that happened during ForgeRocks Global Action Week. This was an important week for all ForgeRockers, to give back and make a difference to the causes and organizations that they are passionate about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we look to our purpose of helping people simply and safely access the connected world, it’s more important than ever to connect with our communities and provide them with the support we can.</p>

<p>We are at our strongest when we come together, and it is then we’re able to make the changes we seek.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we close the celebration of the 19th annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month this October, it’s an ideal time to focus on the need to improve all cybersecurity measures by eliminating passwords and enabling organizations public and private to identify exactly who is accessing their online services.</p>
<p>This year, the <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/">National Cybersecurity Alliance</a> has focused on four key cyber behaviors: enabling MFA, using strong passwords, updating software, and recognizing and reporting phishing. Identity-based authentication addresses three of the four.</p>
<p>The NCA has also released some statistics around these themes – all related at least in part to identity and access management:</p>
 
 495 million ransomware attacks occurred during the first 9 months of 2021, this was a 148% increase on the previous year (Source: SonicWall) 
 A successful phishing attack can be so convincing that you won’t even know that you were affected (Source: Soft Activity) 
 There are over 15 million passwords for sale by cybercriminals on the dark web (Source: Digital Shadows) 
 81% of breaches leverage stolen or weak passwords (Source: LastPass) 
 
<p>While these stats are staggering, they come as no surprise to most of us who see phishing emails and news worthy data breaches nearly every day. What advice do we commonly hear in response to these cybersecurity missteps? Use strong passwords. Enable MFA. Train your employees to watch for phishing emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there’s nothing wrong with these ideas, they don’t really solve the fundamental cybersecurity issue that is causing all of these breaches: impostors can hide behind legitimate, but compromised accounts. The net result is we don’t really know who is on the other end of our digital connections. And until we do, these issues will continue to inhibit the ability of IT and Security leaders to control their networks.</p>
<p>Just as Steve Jobs replaced the stylus with a fingertip 12 or so years ago, identity-based authentication replaces passwords with a verified, identity-backed biometric. When you prove each user’s identity every time they log in, this solves several issues and improves every downstream security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, the need for anti-phishing solutions, 2FA codes, and disjointed MFA become artifacts of obsolete passwords. But, verifying user identity pays other dividends. With a transformational level of trust, organizations can move higher value transactions online, improve the experience for legitimate users with less friction, and virtually eliminate <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/event/combatting-synthetic-identity-fraud-and-account-takeover-with-digital-identity-verification/">account takeover</a>.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, our BlockID solution delivers these capabilities, but also transforms user onboarding from a manual process where PII is exchanged in the clear over email, text and fax to a highly automated and streamlined process that protects user PII from end-to-end. BlockID also eliminates centralized storage and administration of user PII, so there is no honeypot of user information for hackers to target. Users manage their own data. Administrators have no access, alleviating <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/gdpr-compliance/">GDPR</a> and other privacy and compliance needs.</p>
<p>By adding identity as a key pillar to network security and putting users in control of their own data, we improve security with passwordless access, but we do so in a way that addresses privacy. With authentication that is truly based on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/identity-based-authentication/">identity</a> instead of hope, organizations will no longer be held hostage to data breach, ransomware, and financial fraud perpetrated via identity deception. This would certainly be something worth celebrating!</p>

 The Largest Internet Company in Mexico Taps Tec360 and Veridium for Trusted Phishing Resistant Passwordless Authentication and to secure Okta SSO 



<p>A top provider of internet, telephony, on-demand movies, and television services</p>



<p>and Tec360, the leading security service provider in Mexico, select Veridium for secure, easy to use,</p>



<p>phishing resistant passwordless authentication and to secure Okta’s SSO service.</p>



<p>NEW YORK, NY, October 26, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;Veridium, a leading provider of frictionless, phishing resistant</p>



<p>passwordless authentication solutions, today announced that the one of the largest internet companies</p>



<p>in Mexico has selected Tec360, the leading security service provider in Mexico, and Veridium’s award-</p>



<p>winning, phishing resistant passwordless MFA solution for use across the organization.</p>



<p>Implementation of advanced, phishing resistant passwordless MFA services across its workforce will</p>



<p>help the internet company thwart attempts to phish or share knowledge-based authentication</p>



<p>credentials because users cannot share what they do not know. This also eliminates possibilities for</p>



<p>capturing passwords in phishing attacks (since they don’t exist), as well as brute force attacks (since</p>



<p>threat actors can’t guess nonexistent passwords, nor can keyboard loggers capture them).</p>



<p>This internet company is part of a larger group that has made successive generations of businesses with</p>



<p>technologically advanced services readily available to all levels of society, while delivering strong</p>



<p>shareholder value.</p>



<p>Veridium was selected to provide user registration services for the internet company’s employees, call</p>



<p>center users, and mobile users, and multifactor passwordless authentication across multiple</p>



<p>applications, such as desktops, virtual desktops, VPNs, web applications, and legacy applications, as </p>



<p>well as to secure access to Okta’s SSO when users don’t have a mobile device, or are not allowed to use </p>



<p>their mobile devices, and in shared desktop environments.</p>



<p>“Veridium demonstrated that it’s the ideal partner for Tec360 for providing passwordless MFA to</p>



<p>protect the internet company and its workforce against cyberattacks,” said Peter Wiegandt, CEO of</p>



<p>Tec360. “We have observed the explosive growth of ransomware and other cyberattacks globally over</p>



<p>the last five years. Our move to establish strong, trusted digital identities will yield tremendous,</p>



<p>continuous cybersecurity benefits in the coming years and contribute to our customer’s focus on its</p>



<p>strategic business objectives: the delivery of superb business and consumer services, without the</p>



<p>internal distractions or external repercussions that reliance on legacy authentication methods, or</p>



<p>traditional MFA methods, inevitably entail.”</p>



<p>Veridium CEO Ismet Geri said, “The internet company in Mexico is a true driving force for next</p>



<p>generation consumer and business services and has achieved market leadership by leveraging the best</p>



<p>technological innovations. With the adoption of Tec360’s security services and Veridium’s intelligent</p>



<p>phishing resistant passwordless MFA, the internet company is providing its workforce with an optimal,</p>



<p>industry-leading user experience that is delightfully easy to use and secure. It is also strengthening its</p>



<p>resilience to support its business model of driving new generations of premium services.”</p>



<p>About Veridium</p>



<p>Veridium is the original passwordless multi-factor authentication company. Veridium’s Identity Platform</p>



<p>is a comprehensive authentication platform using AI-based behavioral biometrics. Veridium makes it</p>



<p>easy for organizations to eliminate passwords across applications, websites, and web services to create</p>



<p>a future with no passwords, no phishing, no fraud. For more information, please visit</p>

 IDnow sits down with Alex Pillow, Director, Market Strategy at Moody’s Analytics KYC to discuss the merits of risk-based vs one-size KYC approaches; the impact of upcoming regulatory changes on outdated processes; and the importance of matching the right people with the right technology. 



 What are some of the major issues/ challenges with the current KYC process for UK financial services? 



<p>The major challenge this year has been sanctions compliance. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine under Putin’s leadership has become the topic. I’ve been at conferences where practitioners and leaders of Sanctions departments, AML departments, and KYC departments are saying they’ve had staff in tears because of the workload, and the pressure and responsibility they feel to get this right.</p>



<p>When you look at how sanctioned oligarchs and sanctioned entities operate and get around regulations, it’s invariably through networks, and control of other entities and people. So, you’ve got to have the data, the technology and the expertise in place that can ensure your sanctions screening and sanctions programs go beyond the lists to truly understand your sanctions exposure.</p>



<p>Another challenge is that many organizations are still very siloed; one team may be responsible for screening the list, another team is looking at ownership, another looking at payments, and another group is looking at identity verification. How do you ensure all the risk signals are combined into a coherent profile and narrative so you can understand the risk of a customer, a third party or a supplier? Systems must be synthesized, and with the current stressors, my sense is that compliance and operations professionals are realizing this more than ever.</p>



 How does the UK’s risk-based approach to managing AML and KYC risk compare with countries like Germany that have more stringent, comprehensive ‘one size’ checks in place?&nbsp; 



<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. If you think about risk-based strategies and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-kyc-risk/">problems with those</a>, it really relies on the judgment of individuals and their respective firms. Sometimes, it’s a committee of people, and sometimes it’s just one person; it depends on the company and their governance structures. Again, if you think about risk-based strategies, regardless of the size of your compliance team, having the right risk assessment strategy and tool of solutions are critical to getting compliance right. That’s where my colleagues and I at Moody’s spend all of our time as I’m sure many of IDnow’s team do as well.</p>



<p>It’s important to remember if you are relying on judgment, you must also rely on effective enforcement when that judgment is wrong. So, this often leaves room for doubt, which can be a problem because what one person calls satisfactory, another will call inadequate. Where you draw that line is naturally subjective despite the best efforts to be objective.</p>



<blockquote><p>One problem with a one-size approach is, benchmarks are visible to the regulators and practitioners, and ultimately to the criminals.&nbsp;For example, the $10,000 rule in the US means payments above that amount go through a certain level of scrutiny. Criminals are smart, so many payments go under that threshold.</p>Alex Pillow, Director, Market Strategy at Moody’s Analytics KYC </blockquote>



<p>When you go to one size on anything, you are giving information to the opposition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A risk-based approach allows for some intelligent risk taking or calculated risk taking, which can lead to benefits for the vast majority of legitimate customers, third parties, and business people.</p>



 Customer onboarding processes remain a much fought-over area of a service provider’s customer’s experience. How can a financial institution balance its customers’ desire to be onboarded in the automated and digital-only manner that they have become accustomed, while complying with local regulatory and KYC and AML requirements? 



<p>People and technology. If you don’t have the right experts, then you’re not going to understand the regulations and requirements very well. You need people who understand the risk, know what they need to do and need to ask. They also need to be able to work with your technologists, product managers, and commercial people, so they can understand the implications. For instance, can they work with your marketers so they understand what claims they can and can’t make, and be accurate in what they say to their customers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there are always new risks, regulations, target demographics, risk typologies, and criminal typologies to which they’ve got to react. So, can you move to an agile development process? Can you make iterative changes? Can you have a perpetual KYC process so that you are staying current when analyzing your risks?</p>



<p>You’ve got to have people that can understand it, know how to measure it, and how to assess its performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, I think there’s a lot of available technology that’s&nbsp;not being used well nor enough. This is partly due to KYC vendors and customers who are typically not skilled at presenting the benefits to CFOs or COOs, arguing the need to increase budgets to achieve measurable return on investments. That ROI may well come from better mitigation of risk, or perhaps from improving customer experience via reduced onboarding times, more conversion and ultimately more revenue. More often than not, the business case should be a combination of these.</p>



<blockquote><p>People may believe the technology isn’t good enough yet, but I tend to think there’s more that could be done with greater ambition and better business case building. Practitioners and vendors need to work together on this to enhance KYC’s profile within business in general.</p>Alex Pillow, Director, Market Strategy at Moody’s Analytics KYC</blockquote>



 How important are identity verification and customer onboarding solutions in contributing to safer and more secure crypto exchanges? 



<p>In a word, very. I don’t see how they’re going to be able to do it without these sorts of technologies. Many of the “cypherpunks” from the whitepaper days and crypto originals might not like to hear it, but you must balance the rights of privacy with the right of society to protect itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a crime has occurred, investigators need to be able to go to the entity that has, perhaps unwittingly, facilitated this and gather information to find out the identity of the customer.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>To be a relevant crypto firm or crypto exchange for the long term, businesses are going to need to be able to demonstrate that they can meet standards and earn trust from third parties and the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>Alex Pillow, Director, Market Strategy at Moody’s Analytics KYC </blockquote>

<p></p>



 With increasing focus from the FCA and UK government on regulating the crypto industry, how do you foresee the near future of crypto in the UK? What challenges and obstacles do you envisage?&nbsp; 



<p>People often talk about London being the one place where the lawmakers, financiers and technologists all exist in the same place, often within a 20-minute walk of each other.</p>



<p>We saw it with the fintech boom and how that mix basically made London the centre of gravity for fintech. We are seeing a similar development with the crypto community; having companies here in the UK means there will generally be ways to collaborate, or when a new regulation comes in, there’ll be very smart people working on it.</p>



<p>I expect the industry will evolve with regulations. There are several large crypto companies that have been pushing for tighter regulation, as they believe it will help contribute to the classic adoption curve. When people know things are regulated and the authorities are involved, they will likely feel far more comfortable participating. I also think there’ll be a period of evolution and adaptation. There may be those that decide not to operate here [in the UK], and go elsewhere, potentially somewhere perceived to have more lax regulations and enforcement. However, that may indicate to third parties and customers the priorities of that business.</p>



<p>If you are going to adapt and evolve, you’ve got to retain the right people with the right expertise, who can communicate effectively with regulators, and who can understand what the vendors are offering. Technology is how you’re ultimately going to comply with regulations. You’ve got to have the right systems, processes and controls that match your policies.&nbsp;</p>



 Of all the recent, and upcoming regulatory changes (MiCa etc), which do you think poses the highest potential for disruption to outdated KYC processes and systems? 



<p>In this case, I don’t think it’s necessarily about crypto. I go back to the broader fintech market, in which I’ve often categorized crypto. I think traditional banking learns from the fintech market. If you consider the changes they’ve made in their onboarding process, the investments they’ve made in their apps, and their decreasing investment in bricks and mortar, I think it can at least partially be credited to the growth of fintech and other types of financial services (including crypto).</p>



<p>A lot of fintechs market their onboarding, which is effectively their KYC process – “Get onboarded in five minutes, rather than hours or days.”. They are marketing onboarding, and banks never did that before. Now, UK banks talk about customer service and experience, and I wonder if some of that is driven by trying to prioritize that over benefits like sign-up bonuses. They say, convenience is king and that certainly applies to this market.&nbsp;</p>



 What are some of the major UK and European fintech trends that we can expect in the coming years? 



<p>I’ve read a lot about the fintech market being like the “dotcom” bubble. The signs look similar. If that is the case, then I think we should embrace it; you can’t change macroeconomics on your own, but you can learn from what’s gone before and embrace the challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve certainly had easier times of on-tap venture capital money; now it’s more difficult. Business models are going to be vetted, profitability is going to be key. So, it can’t just be, “We’ll do everything,” anymore. It’s, “What do we do well? What are people willing to pay for? How can I finance my own growth rather than just raise another round?”</p>



<p>The fintech bubble bursting may be a good thing for the long-term health of the industry, because just like the dotcom bubble, only the “good” viable companies will survive. The ones that will remain will be good for consumers, third parties and the ecosystem at large.</p>



 With increasing importance placed on fintech [partly due to pandemic-induced acceleration], what are some of the dangers and challenges associated with banks and financial institutions rapidly implementing fintech and regtech solutions? 



<p>The major challenge is whether you can change your mindset. Are you committed to working fast? To experimenting? Are you willing for something to fail, iterate on it, and then go again, rather than say “the project didn’t work, kill it, let’s go back to what we know”?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a saying that perfection is the enemy of excellence. I think a lot of traditional organizations are so focused on doing things correctly that they’re prepared to move slowly. Some call it “analysis paralysis.” But you can work more efficiently, if after you’ve failed at something, you take what you’ve learned, and just go again. With that mindset, you can be on your second, third or fourth attempt while a more conservative team or company is still doing research.</p>



<p>That also goes for implementing initiatives, partnerships, producing your own products and innovating. That’s the big lesson and it’s a challenge. If you can’t move quickly, then those third party fintechs and regtechs who don’t have the same time horizon as a larger, more established player will.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There must be a happy medium between breakneck speed and 15+ committees to make a decision. People have to be willing to make mistakes, accept those challenges as part of the process and fail fast, and ultimately move on.</p>

<p>Every so often, an unspectacular technology comes along and quietly changes the face of the planet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu">Knotted strings</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485">sticks pressed into wet clay</a> helped us remember promises made and kept, birthing concepts like trade and debt. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin">Small metal discs</a> gave kingdoms the power to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">transcend</a> relationships in trade and finance armies, changing the stories of entire cultures in a moment. Banking and double-entry accounting gave Mediterranean traders new eyes with which to see commerce, allowing greater understanding of business operations and eventually helped pave the way for explosive industrial growth in the past several centuries.</p><p>These seem like such tame technologies; all they do is help us keep track of numbers. And it can be argued that they merely reflect the values of the cultures that created them. But as the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/06/26/shape/">unknown</a> sage says, “we shape our tools; thereafter our tools shape us.” As a lens through which we see the world, they both enable and push us to affect the world, sometimes violently, according to their numerical, linear logic. Every <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/externality.asp">externality</a> — every ecological or social cost shouldered by the commons — simply doesn’t have a place on the books.</p><p>I don’t honestly think that bookkeeping practices are the sole cause of depleted fisheries, desertification, income disparities, polluted air and water, and increasing atmospheric CO₂ levels, but I do find it telling that there isn’t even a place in our balance sheets for the imbalances we cause.</p><p>But what if there were ways to account for, and more consciously see, environmental and social externalities? And what hidden opportunities might appear when everyone has a clearer view of the people, resources, and processes that make up the whole of our geographic, economic, political, and social activity?</p><p>This article explores a nascent technology that gives us a new lens through which to look at the world, and three groups that plan to use it in an effort to create more integrated and innovative ways to provide for human needs within the current system. <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> is a software toolkit, built on Holochain and based on the <a href="https://valueflo.ws">Valueflows</a> economic vocabulary, itself based on a seemingly unspectacular but quietly innovative accounting standard called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources%2C_Events%2C_Agents">Resources, Events, and Agents</a> (REA).</p><p>hREA allows developers to build economic and financial apps that take a zoomed-out view of the economy, allowing us to see the ecosystems within it and recognise its place within the biosphere. This happens in two ways: first, economic activities are situated in a network view, breaking down silos around people, organisations, and locations; and second, it can track multiple forms of value as they flow through exchanges, regions, and production processes.</p><p>In other words, it helps us focus our economic lens more clearly on the deeply networked world we live in, so we can optimise our resource use with an aspiration of living in harmony with nature.</p> Code A: Giving the ecosystem a stake in the economy <p>Dr Leanne Ussher is an economist who works with Code A, which is short for ‘Community Decision-making for Ecosystem Adaptation/Accountability/Action’. It’s a project created by an international group of professors, and it aims to build tools that help communities understand and be more intentional about their impact on the planet. And because the economy’s tendrils are woven through every aspect of our society and environment, part of this work means developing a much more accurate way of seeing our economy within its geography.</p><p>Traditional economic models assume an ideal person — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">Homo economicus</a> — who makes rational decisions about what’s best for them. And what’s true of an individual, they reason, is true of the sum of these individuals, or the economy: given a whole marketplace of these mythical self-interested, intelligent decision-makers, things will settle into the most beneficial situation for everyone. Philosopher Adam Smith called this the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand">invisible hand</a>’ of the market, and many economists since have grounded their economic theories on a faith in this principle. And things do seem to work this way — for simple, competitive markets that we make easy to understand.</p><p>But that’s not true of most real markets. Dr Ussher’s complaint of traditional macroeconomic theory is that it assumes individual independence. This simplification supports aggregation and generalisation but it can’t anticipate the complex and surprising things that happen when a bunch of individuals get together and interact. At best, it vaguely asserts that scale does not matter and a description for an individual is also a description for a market. But in reality, we see this theory break down in catastrophic ways in an unequal world; it seems that the invisible hand has always had tremors.</p><p>My hunch is that the economy has become too large, complex, and dominated by big players for anyone to make truly rational decisions in their own self-interest. How do I make sense of whether my smartphone purchase is going to come back to haunt me and my grandchildren? It’s merely one among <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-03-01-4q21-smartphone-market-share">1.5 billion each year</a>; does it really contribute that much to civil unrest in Africa, pollution in China, and increased CO₂ levels all around the world? But then again, I recognise that “no individual raindrop considers itself responsible for the flood”. In our acceptance of the sole moral guide of economics — does it benefit me — it seems we paradoxically end up doing things that are very, very bad for ourselves. And even if we’d like to <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-ones-who-walk-away-from-omelas">excuse</a> ourselves, we’re often unsure how — life in the global north all but demands that I own one of these stupid smartphones.</p><p>Post-Keynesian macroeconomics, a branch of economics that gains insight through accounting equations of an economy as a whole, attempts to correct for the flaws in microeconomic theories of independent individuals by recognising that complex systems are always greater than the sum of their parts. It creates models founded on theories of the entire economic system, populates those models with big aggregate data, and uses the output to inform policies of regional and national governments and international trade.</p><p>This is the school of thought that Dr Ussher comes from. But she also acknowledges that there are blind spots in such a theory too: its abstract models and aggregated data sets take a big-picture view, and it doesn’t offer an explanation or prescription for individual behaviour. As such, it doesn’t tell us how we can organise our individual decisions for better global outcomes.</p><p>Dr Ussher explains that micro- and macroeconomics both have their place, but they’re taught as separate classes in university and there isn’t really any good way to reconcile the two. It would be great, she says, if there were something that could combine the micro’s individual behaviour approach with the macro’s systems thinking lens. A sort of ‘grand unified model’ for economics.</p><p>Then she says something that surprises me: Valueflows, the economic grammar at the heart of hREA, offers a path in this direction. It records the flow of resources between individuals, but it records them from an <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/introduction/core/#independent-vs-dependent-views">independent</a> view — as a transaction between parties rather than a set of entries in two disconnected ledgers. She claims that this bookkeeping ‘in the open’ is the thing that could align macroeconomic models more closely with the reality of interdependent individuals. And while she acknowledges that this could have serious consequences for privacy and autonomy if done wrong, she’s also thrilled about the immense potential if done right.</p><p>At this point, my mind begins to drift back home — could this be useful at the micro level too? If global markets are inefficient because we lack information and power, could Valueflows make more local flows visible, helping us make better decisions in the places where our choices matter? If we could all see unmet needs and unused resources around us, perhaps new businesses would emerge to close those gaps. This would in turn bring the feedback loops between our actions and their consequences closer to home, giving us even more information for wise decision-making.</p><p>Dr Ussher’s vision goes beyond mere commerce. With Valueflows, individuals, households, corporates, and governments are not the only agents that make choices and are held accountable; trees, rivers, animals, even the atmosphere could be represented as agents, with rights, duties and decisions via carefully designed smart contracts. As we build an accounting ecosystem of agents, resources and processes with a rich body of shared data, we will be able to see more clearly how our individual — and collective — decisions impact our planet and each other.</p><p>With this vision, she <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanneUssher/status/1585647820253454337">hints</a> at a much broader concept of the popular term ‘metaverse’. Rather than mere escapism underwritten by advertising money, Valueflows could equip it to become a tool for creating ‘digital twins’ of agents (human and non-human) and resources (artificial and natural, concrete and abstract) and giving them legitimacy in our economics systems.</p><blockquote><p>For my own pedagogical purposes I define the Metaverse as a digital twin of the real world. We have been in a Metaverse of sorts for decades. The Metaverse can be much more than a 1:1 mapping, just as the real world can be more than a 1:1 mapping with the Metaverse.</p>— Leanne Ussher (@LeanneUssher) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanneUssher/status/1585647820253454337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>Given that legal and financial systems are already digital, mapping and controlling our behaviour, she asks whether it’s really such a jump to empower a tree with its own digital presence in an economic metaverse — and endow it with its own agency. This is what excites her most about Valueflows, because it carries the promise of including all entities that we regard as important, holding all participants accountable, and designing features to rebalance inequities in market power, rights, and duties. By giving the biosphere rights, we can internalise externalities. This is nearer than you might think — legal systems are already recognising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/29/sweet-city-the-costa-rica-suburb-that-gave-citizenship-to-bees-plants-and-trees-aoe">bees</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200319-the-new-zealand-river-that-became-a-legal-person">rivers</a> in this way.</p><p>Recently Dr Ussher was supporting a cohort of students at Simon’s Rock Bard College with exercises involving coordination of student tasks in the campus garden and collecting kitchen waste for composting, or designing a new accounting protocol to reduce Australian deforestation and biodiversity loss.</p><p>In these exercises, the goal was to use a Holochain app called <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/rea-playspace/">REA Playspace</a>, a canvas that allows them to create models of an economic network. Spread out like this, poorly managed resources (things we might call ‘externalities’) and unserved needs are plainly visible. This can spark spontaneous insights into ways to improve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy">circularity</a> of resource flows, design feedback loops that promote biodiversity, even create business opportunities along the way.</p><p>Dr Ussher still plans to use hREA in real on-campus pilot projects. As they progress, she hopes that their reach will quietly, slowly expand to include more local economic activity. Like leaven in the dough, the idea of <a href="https://metacurrency.org/about/">deep wealth</a> could eventually permeate and transform the way we do accounting, and how we hold each other accountable.</p>Using REA Playspace, along with photographic and explanatory embellishments, to map out an economic network involving forests, koalas, loggers, shippers, and toilet paper producers. This map exposes the stark failures in design of the current system, asking us the question, “how can we improve this?” NY Textile Lab: Putting designers at the front of the supply network <p>Laura Sansone is a textile designer and Adjunct Professor of Sustainable Textile Design at Parsons School of Design in Manhattan, NY. When she moved to the Hudson Valley, about an hour north of New York City, she became good friends with the orchardist who leased her new property. She saw him selling his produce at a farmer’s market in NYC one weekend, so they got to talking about local food systems. She started to wonder — why do we care so much about local food systems but barely talk about local textiles? After all, the local food movement was all about understanding and improving the impact of the way we eat, so why don’t we have a similar relationship with what we wear? Her intimacy with the textile and fashion industry, which <a href="https://sustainablefashionbyraya.com/2021/09/27/the-cost-of-fashion/">harms us</a> and our <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-fashion-industry-environmental-impact/">planet</a>, told her that it could stand to learn a lot from the local food movement.</p><p>Sansone came to realise that relocalising clothing production is a good deal more challenging; there are a lot more people between a sheep and your sweater than there are between a tomato plant and tonight’s dinner. As a textile designer, she found herself at the very end of a network of producers, processors, and distributors who had already made their own decisions about what materials she could work with.</p><p>So she put herself at the front of the supply chain. As a designer, she reasoned, she would have the power to make impactful choices if she could be involved in the whole process. Starting small, she aggregated wool from several small local farmers, transported it in a borrowed pickup truck, and brought it to the few remaining wool processing facilities in the New York bioregion — one of which was just a farmer with a handful of washing machines in her garage to wash the animal fibers.</p><p>This wasn’t meant to turn into a business; it was just supposed to prove that Sansone’s idea for a local textile economy could work. However, she soon found herself selling her yarn to other designers, and eventually creating a line of <a href="https://www.newyorktextilelab.com/shop-1">finished products</a> for sale.</p><blockquote>But Sansone didn’t want to become the distributor she was trying to eliminate.</blockquote><p>Now, at the centre of <a href="https://www.newyorktextilelab.com/">NY Textile Lab</a>, a small but growing collaborative network of producers, processors, and designers, she and her partner Evan Schwartz need something more than an address book and a pile of spreadsheets.</p><p>Sansone and Schwartz were attracted to hREA because it’s expressive enough to model the complexity of the rich web of relationships they’re weaving. They intend to record details about the raw materials and the processes they went through, such as transport miles and climate-beneficial verifications, so customers can see exactly what went into their garments. They also want individual designers to be able to merge their buying power, simplifying procurement and reducing costs for everyone.</p><p>With this complexity comes a lot of administration, so they’re looking forward to using hREA to automate most of that. As a generic toolkit that uses a simple ontology for building all sorts of economic applications, it can be used for bookkeeping, inventory, supply chain management, certification tracking, enterprise resource planning, alternative currencies, and even sharing of production process recipes.</p><p>Listening to Schwartz explain their vision, I wonder what the value proposition is for designers. It sounds like they might struggle to understand why they would want to be more transparent, choosing to give up the competitive edge that <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/china/trade-secrets/1138780/how-to-protect-core-secrets-in-the-supply-chain">supply chain trade secrets</a> give them. He answers my concerns before I even voice them: This isn’t meant for the Ralph Laurens and Patagonias out there. They already have their supply chains in place, and they’re already working to answer customers’ demand for more visibly ethical sourcing.</p><p>This is meant for small designers and light industry, in order to grow a more horizontal economic model — the recent design school grad who’s starting her brand with a production run of only 20 sweaters, the small farmer only raising a few dozen animals, the ‘mini mill’ that is currently serving ‘handcrafters’. These people currently don’t have the power to compete in the same way; the landscape of potential suppliers is challenging to navigate, and as individuals they don’t have the ability to meet minimum order quantities, nor the purchasing power to make their production economical. The patterns Sansone and Schwartz are building are giving these smaller designers the ability to enter the market — as well as giving sustainable livelihoods to local farmers and regional processors.</p>In this flow diagram, designers operate with vulnerable transparency, exposing their supply chain intelligence as open-source production ‘recipes’. They collaborate on both their buying power and their learnings. This provides an interdependence that makes small-scale production more efficient and boosts everyone’s success.<p>Listening more deeply, I realise that they’re actually building an open-source economic model for the textile industry — and local markets in general. In the logic of this economy, everyone succeeds when supply chain relationships and other intellectual property are shared. And Sansone and Schwartz plan to share their templates as they evolve, enabling other local production economies to spring up across the world.</p><p>And more than that — they’re building an economy that functions ecologically. Ecosystems don’t usually create chains, because chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Instead, ecosystems create webs — complex patterns of relationship with multiple interdependencies and redundancies. Schwartz claims that this is the way to build supply systems that are resilient in the face of disruptions. And <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/ongoing-impact-covid-19-global-supply-chains/">goodness knows</a> we could use a bit more of that.</p>Which supply system looks more resilient — the chain or the network? Sensorica: Applying open-source practices to material production <p>NY Textile Lab isn’t the only one building an economy that understands the ecosystem it belongs to. For the last eleven years <a href="https://www.sensorica.co/">Sensorica</a>, producers of electronic hardware, has been operating as what’s known as an <a href="http://ovn.world/index.php?title=What_is_an_open_value_network%3F">open value network</a>, or OVN. Rather than a hierarchically organised company, an OVN is a decentralised network of economic agents, each of them free to do their own thing but linked to each other by collaborative relationships.</p><p>Tiberius Brastaviceanu, the co-founder of Sensorica, tells me that they borrow ideas from self-organising systems such as insect colonies. Most importantly, their network operates on a few simple rules that produce complex — and ultimately meaningful — behaviour.</p><p>The first rule is this: you can do whatever you like, but whatever you do, make it <a href="http://ovn.world/index.php?title=Transparency">visible</a>. Announce it and document it. If you’ve got a 3D printer, make it available. If you’ve come up with a design for a more efficient <a href="https://www.sensorica.co/products/ventilator">heat recovery ventilator</a>, share the source files along with your research process. That lets others build on your offerings and increase the total value in the system.</p><p>Biologists who study insect colonies came up with a word for this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy">stigmergy</a>, or ‘leaving signals in your environment for others to act on’. This appears to be the chief principle that makes self-organising systems work. Although it may seem chaotic, the end result is not. I mean, just look at what these bees created without a boss. (It’s actually a <a href="https://busybeekeeping.com/do-bees-have-a-leader/">myth</a> that the queen is in charge.)</p>A group of individuals, unified by a few simple rules, can create highly organised structures. Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@biancablah?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Bianca Ackermann</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/beehive?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>Brastaviceanu echoes Dr Ussher’s concerns about the privacy and autonomy issues that crop up when we aggregate so much of our data like this. But he believes that Holochain resists this risk by embedding an ethos of ‘data commons’ — a democratisation of knowledge, through a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">peer-to-peer database</a>, that prevents big players from <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blog-holochain-org-capture-resistance-from-the-ground-up/">capturing</a> that knowledge and controlling access to it.</p><p>There are other rules that draw inspiration from nature, such as the right to raise a red flag if you see someone doing or proposing something that could harm the network.</p><p>But one rule comes directly from traditional economics. All relationships are underwritten by something called a <a href="http://ovn.world/index.php?title=Benefits_distribution_algorithm">benefit redistribution algorithm</a>, an agreement that defines how benefits will be distributed in a venture. For example, when your product is exchanged for money, the proceeds get distributed, not just to you but also to the equipment operators, designers, and parts suppliers in the OVN that sit upstream of the product. Before that point, all those contributors are shareholders; after that point, they all get their dividends. You can think of it like a <a href="https://sensoricablog.blogspot.com/2014/02/placement-based-approach-to-value.html">stock</a>, but for an individual sale rather than an entire company.</p><p>You’d be justified in thinking that this sounds like a lot of data to keep track of. That’s why Sensorica is a key supporter of hREA, which was explicitly designed to keep track of complex agreements and resource flows involving multiple forms of resources.</p><p>In fact, Brastaviceanu explains that the design of Valueflows is based directly on learnings from the first version of their software, called Network Resource Planning or NRP. Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen of Mikorizal Software <a href="http://mikorizal.org/software.html">created</a> it from scratch, because traditional enterprise resource planning (ERP) and accounting software focuses on a single company, not a network of actors. Now Foster and Haugen are stewarding the creation of an ecosystem of Valueflows-based tools, many (though <a href="https://www.valueflo.ws/appendix/usedfor/">not all</a>) of which are built on hREA.</p><p>Because it uses Holochain, hREA is doing to NRP’s software architecture what NRP did to ERP’s economic assumptions: it breaks down barriers and connects actors together. There is no server in a Holochain app; each user simply connects to other users’ machines to share data and make transactions. And when two networks want to start interacting with each other — as in the case of Sensorica collaborating with a copywriting community in Brazil — the barrier is low, because each participant has full access to the data in the spaces they belong to. This lays the foundation for highly interoperable applications.</p><p>Brastaviceanu tells me that one of the things about Holochain that excites him the most is the capacity for groups to create their own applications by connecting smaller components into a greater whole. This is exemplified by a <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">groupware application ‘container’</a> called We, which already has a few simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOXBb2LLQVA">components</a> and expects to add many more (including ones for hREA and <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/social-sensemaker/">reputation intelligence</a>) in the future.</p><p>Brastaviceanu believes that cooperative producer networks will only succeed in the global marketplace if they have the tools to capitalise on and grow their ‘collaborative advantage’. He sees open-source software like hREA and We as critical tools to help make that dream become reality.</p> Conclusion <p>Reflecting on these three stories, the overarching theme I see is that our narrow focus on self-interest has blinded us to the massive possibilities available to us when we start cooperating — not accidentally as puppets of Smith's invisible hand, but with intention. The fact is, we all end up better when we choose to work together. I know that sounds like something you learned in kindergarten. But it seems we unlearn this as we grow up, and it's time to relearn it.</p><p>These three projects, along with a handful of others in places like Sweden and Colombia, are courageously building economic experiments based on what they learned in kindergarten, and it’s working. And hREA, having reached its first <a href="https://github.com/h-REA/hREA/releases/tag/happ-0.1.0-beta">major milestone release</a>, is getting prepared to power the economic intelligence behind all of these projects. It's working and ready for developers to hack on, as seen in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teiGQtQdThM">demo video.</a></p><p>Some of these projects are already sturdy saplings while others are still seeds. But I see in them all a promise of something different for our world — economies that unify local production with global concerns, that apply the cooperative logic and transparency of open-source to business, that re-internalise precious externalities, and that honour diverse forms of capital.</p><p>And I long for that ‘something different’. In fact, I think <a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AccountingForPlanetarySurvival_def.pdf">our survival depends on it</a>.</p>

<p>Once driven by early adopters like fintechs and tech enthusiasts, open banking is increasingly becoming embedded into the global financial landscape online and through apps from players across the ecosystem. And it is only expected to grow. From 2021 to 2026, the number of open banking users is expected to increase&nbsp;<a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/open-banking-market-research-report">nearly eightfold</a>. And instant payment flows enabled by open banking are expected to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/instant-payments">increase by 30 times</a>.</p>



<p>Open banking allows for all boats to rise — including merchants, fintech innovators, large and small financial service providers and, most importantly, consumers and small businesses.</p>



<p>Jess Turner, Executive Vice President, Open Banking and API at Mastercard talks about the choice, innovation and inclusion in open banking that is lifting up opportunities across the entire ecosystem.

				  The SuperNova Awards recognize organizations, teams and individuals who successfully apply emerging and disruptive technologies for their organizations. Indicio wins for work with SITA, government of Aruba.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio was presented with a <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2022">SuperNova Award</a> during a gala dinner on Wednesday evening at <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/">Constellation Research’s </a>Connected Enterprise event hosted at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, California. The prestigious award, now in its twelfth year, recognized Indicio for being a leader in adopting disruptive technology in the area of Digital Safety, Governance and Privacy. Indicio CEO <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/node/23370/vote/application/view/943">Heather Dahl </a>accepted the award on behalf of Indicio.</p>
<p>The SuperNova reflected Indicio’s ground-breaking work to create <a href="https://indicio.tech/all-aboard-a-new-era-of-travel-with-the-digital-travel-credential/">seamless travel solutions</a> using open source decentralized identity technology. <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Working with SITA</a>, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport industry, and the government of Aruba, Indicio began by tackling the challenge of reopening Aruba, a tourism dependent economy, to air travel during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Using verifiable credentials supported by decentralized identifiers and Indicio’s global blockchain network, visitors were able to receive tamper-proof digital credentials containing their health data from a Health Information Exchange or a test lab — in this case, proof of a Covid-19 test or vaccination — and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTp8-MqL-Kw">share that information</a> through a mobile device app with full consent in a privacy-preserving way to enter the island and access event and hospitality spaces.</p>
<p>The solution avoided the need for direct integrations between health providers and airlines or airports or government departments — or having to use third-party management of personal information. The privacy-by-design nature of the solution made data privacy compliance simple: travelers held their own data and shared it by consent. As the <a href="https://youtu.be/VU05Brpjtc4">project progressed,</a> travelers were able to present their health data with their travel documents and be cleared for travel before they arrived at the airport.</p>
<p></p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://www.constellationr.com/users/steve-wilson">Steve Wilson</a>, VP and Principal Analyst at Constellation Research, focusing on digital identity and privacy. </p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				   
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>While the solution was built on open source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> codebases, it involved Indicio creating many customized components. These were donated by SITA to Linux Foundation Public Health to create the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project</a>, a complete open source system for public health authorities to share health data in a privacy preserving way.</p>
<p>The success of this project has now led Indicio and SITA to create the first verifiable credential based on the <a href="https://icao.int/">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO)’s protocol and standards for a <a href="https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/PublishingImages/Pages/Publications/Guiding%20core%20principles%20for%20the%20development%20of%20a%20Digital%20Travel%20Credential%20%20%28DTC%29.PDF">Digital Travel Credential</a> (DTC). This will transform the experience of travel by dramatically simplifying check in and border control while providing assurance of identity in a privacy preserving way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is fantastic recognition for the team at Indicio, who have put in a tremendous amount of effort to build this technology,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “It also recognizes SITA and the government of Aruba for their vision of privacy-preserving digital travel — a vision that can&nbsp; be summarized in one, compelling view of what the airport of the near future looks like: no lines, no queues. And it recognizes Indicio’s&nbsp; Network Consortium, customers, and collaborators, all of whom are driving digital transformation through development and adoption of&nbsp; open source verifiable credential technology.”</p>
<p></p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>“This is a technology that revives Web 2.0 — rescues it from the chronic problems of fraud and verification that are paralyzing business and the public sector,” said Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio. “And it provides an indispensable&nbsp; verification and privacy layer for building&nbsp; Web3 applications and infrastructure. We can’t move forward without a reliable way to verify who we are engaging with online and the ability to trust the provenance and integrity of data. Open source decentralized identity technology solves these problems and&nbsp; gets us to the next level without having to rebuild everything that we already have. Speaking for the engineering team at Indicio, we are&nbsp; immensely grateful and honored to receive this award from Constellation Research.”</p>

 Give members DID and reputation, stimulate enthusiasm, and exploit potentialities <p>In this issue, we will be reviewing the second OWN Insights Twitter Spaces, together with the development of DAOs, and how we can tap the potential of infinite possibility.</p>This article will talk about the core discussion points of this Twitter&nbsp;Spaces<p>The Definition of&nbsp;DAO</p><p>What is a DAO? The simplest way to understand it is as a “corporation” managed jointly by all the participants, in a way that the DAO should be a flat structure where everyone has the right to share their ideas while contributing to and benefiting the DAO (both financially and spiritually).</p><p>Different from traditional companies, DAOs should be completely transparent and decentralized, to establish trust with members. In other words, members can know the development direction, the decisions, financial status, capital flow, etc. of DAOs anytime and anywhere, and have the right to make decisions and manage&nbsp;them.</p><p>Underpinning this is the smart contract, which allows members to make decisions on DAO transactions by voting, while the smart contract executes based on the voting&nbsp;results.</p> Motivation and Contribution <p>The smooth operation of a DAO is inseparable from the contribution of its members, so for DAOs, a reasonable incentive mechanism will help their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Currently, the incentive strategy adopted by most DAOs is reward monetization, by giving members financial benefits to push them to participate in various DAO transactions, such as issuing specific tokens or being whitelisted into an&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Undeniably, practical benefits can actively promote the upward development of the entire DAO at the start and attract more people to participate in the governance and running of the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>However, in the later stage, many members often find that their contributions are not exactly in line with the actual benefits, and the difficulty in balancing the power of discourse also causes tension between members. For example, old members may find themselves earning less than new members because they hold fewer tokens than new&nbsp;members.</p><p>At the same time, the decreasing sense of interest and satisfaction brought by economic gains can lead to a decrease in enthusiasm for contribution from the original DAO members, which will be followed by the continuous decline of work efficiency and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>So it’s time for us to think about “balance”:</p><p>• How to define a good contributor</p><p>• What ideas/suggestions should be prioritized</p><p>In other words, how can we give a DAO member more “fair” rights to increase their motivation?</p> Definition of “Contribution Degree” <p>Some DAOs are introducing, or have already introduced, NFTs, which are more like the SBTs of Vitalik Buterin, serving as an identifier to represent members’ voting rights, protecting governance shares, and allocating DAO benefits to each contributor based on&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>However, as a DAO governance tool, this system can only help a DAO quickly identify the contribution degree according to the NFT. However, it does not define the contribution degree clearly. On what basis should the DAO assign these different levels of&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>Perhaps we need to give a definition of contribution degree:</p><p>• The number of “tickets” can only partially affect the contribution. Because “tickets” can be purchased in large quantities through the secondary market, it has little significance for the positive development of a DAO, and it is easy for a DAO to fall into capital&nbsp;control.</p><p>• On-chain behavior needs to be given higher weight. This refers to participating in various DAO activities, such as voting, interacting with the DAO’s smart contract, posting about the DAO on-chain, etc.</p><p>Especially for the latter, the data will intuitively and transparently show the degree and enthusiasm of a member’s contribution, and can more fairly assign the member’s “status” and “level” in the&nbsp;DAO.</p> DID and Reputation <p>With such a definition, it is impossible for a DAO to pull out the on-chain behavior data and digital assets of all members every other cycle, and calculate their contribution in the long run. Therefore, a digital/decentralized identity (DID) that can be dynamically counted and visually marked becomes an indispensable tool for DAO management.</p>ont.id<p>At present, part of DID can be combined with such data to generate accurate reputation value and achieve the function of display. This is what Ontology’s ONT ID aims to&nbsp;achieve.</p><p>From the perspective of Ontology, DID will become an essential tool in the development of DAOs. Based on DID, the on-chain behavior of each member will become transparent and unified, which will promote better management of DAOs. For example, users who must hold a certain NFT can join the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>At the same time, as the data recorded in a member’s DID becomes more and more abundant, the dimension of reputation construction will be constantly improved. At this point, through scientific mathematical modeling, the data of DAO participation can be synthesized into an accurate reputation value, which becomes an accurate identification of the contribution degree. Since the record of DID is real-time, it represents the immediacy of contribution/reputation value and reduces the statistical pressure on the&nbsp;DAO.</p>Orange Protocol, an Ontology ecosystem project, is building a reputation system for some DAOs to help them better manage and motivate&nbsp;members.<p>For DAOs, integrating a reputable DID system will bring them more automated contribution identification and member management. Meanwhile, the accuracy of reputation value will realize more equitable empowerment, including management rights, discourse rights, earnings, and so on, so as to improve the enthusiasm of members and solve the later slowdown caused by the decline of economic earnings.</p><p>Based on this, DAOs will stimulate more potential of the members and glow with new vitality.</p><p>The full recording of the second OWN Insights Twitter Spaces series is available at <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1570698365293436929">https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1570698365293436929</a></p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-twitter-spaces-review-balancing-contributions-and-revitalizing-the-dao-78a23a69265d">OWN Insights Twitter Spaces Review: Balancing Contributions and Revitalizing the DAO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Data Farming DF8 Completed, DF9 Started, Reward Function&nbsp;Tuned  Stakers can claim DF8 rewards. DF9 runs Oct 27–Nov 3, 2022. DF Beta is 50K $OCEAN/week. Rewards payouts are tuned to&nbsp;DCV.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes the growth of data consumption volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN for stakers who allocate liquidity to curate data asset with high data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users must lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via our <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">Data Farming&nbsp;portal</a>.</p><p>DF Round 8 (DF8) is DF/VE Alpha week 4. DF8 counting started 12:01am Thu Oct 20, 2022, and ended 12:01am Oct 27, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. Stakers can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF9 is DF Beta week 1. Counting started 12:01am Oct 27,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, and details on DF9 parameters (including important updates).</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As a staker, here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  Rewards are distributed on Ethereum mainnet. Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF9 Parameters <p>DF9 is the first week of DF Beta. Whereas DF/VE Alpha’s aim was to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers, DF Beta’s aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.</p><p>As stated in previous DF posts: with each weekly cycle, the DF core team may tune the Reward Function or make other changes based on learnings.</p><p>DF9 has three&nbsp;changes:</p>  Increase in total weekly&nbsp;budget  For active rewards, a new budget constraint based on&nbsp;DCV  For active rewards, reward function tuned to bias to&nbsp;DCV  <p>The next three subsections explore each in&nbsp;turn.</p> 3.1 Total Budget Increased to 50K $OCEAN /&nbsp;week <p>In DF8 — the previous DF round and the last week of DF/VE Alpha — the budget for the week was 10K $OCEAN. In fact, that was the budget for each week of&nbsp;DF1-DF8.</p><p>With DF9, we enter the first week of DF Beta. The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">DF launch</a> and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">DF resume</a> articles committed to budget between 10K $OCEAN to 100K $OCEAN for each week of DF&nbsp;Beta.</p><p>For DF9 — the first week of DF Beta — the budget will be 50K $OCEAN. This is a 5x increase in rewards compared to DF/VE Alpha. As before, 50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (25K $OCEAN), and 50% to active rewards (25K&nbsp;$OCEAN).</p> 3.3 New Active Budget Constraint based on&nbsp;DCV <p>DF9 introduces a constraint that bounds active rewards budget each week, as a function of data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>DF8 active rewards budget was: active_budget = 50% * 10K = 5000 $OCEAN. This was subject to each staker having a 125% APY constraint. Due to the constraint, less than $5K OCEAN may have been rewarded. That is: usable_active_budget &lt;= 5000&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p><p>For DF9, active rewards budget is active_budget = 50% * 50K = 25000 $OCEAN. This remains subject to each staker having a 125% APY constraint. We introduce a second constraint:</p> usable_active_budget = min(active_budget, DCV_multiplier * DCV_total) <p>Where DCV_multiplier = 100% for DF9, then decreasing linearly each week, to a final value of 3% in 20 weeks (DF28). After that, it stays at&nbsp;3%.</p><p>Example 1 for DF9. Given: active_budget = 25000. Since it’s DF9, DCV_multiplier = 1.0. Let’s say that total data consume volume was DCV_total = 17333 OCEAN. Then, usable_active_budget = min(active_budget, DCV_multiplier * DCV_total) = min(25000, 1.0 * 17333) = 17333 $OCEAN&nbsp;. So, 17,333 $OCEAN will get paid out in active rewards. This is less than the budget of 25,000 $OCEAN, because there wasn’t enough&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>Example 2. Let’s start with example 1, except DCV_total = 32000 OCEAN. Then, usable_active_budget = min(25000, 1.0 * 32000) = 25000 $OCEAN&nbsp;. That is, the full budget of 25,000 $OCEAN because DCV was high&nbsp;enough.</p><p>The 3% lower bound for DCV_multiplier addresses the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">wash consume</a> issue. There’s a 3% <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/fees#ocean-community-fee">Ocean Community order fee</a>. Therefore when DCV_multiplier hits 3%, wash consume becomes unprofitable.</p><p>Ocean core team reserves the right to update the parameters of this new constraint, based on observing behavior.</p> 3.3 Reward Function changed: first reward pro-rata to DCV of&nbsp;assets <p>Active rewards are governed by the reward function&nbsp;(RF).</p><p>In DF8 — the previous DF round — OCEAN was rewarded pro-rata on stake * DCV. This means: for assets A &amp; B with equal DCV, and B had 10x more total stake, then stakers in B would get 10x more&nbsp;reward.</p><p>In DF9, assets are rewarded pro-rata on DCV to each asset first, then within each asset, pro-rata on relative stake in the asset to stakers. This means: for assets A &amp; B with equal DCV, and B had 9x more total stake, then stakers in A &amp; B get equal reward. The Appendix has&nbsp;details.</p>How the reward function changed from DF8 → DF9. Area is relative amount of reward to different stakers. Asset A (orange) &amp; asset B (blue) have equal DCV. Asset B has 10x more stake than asset A. For each asset, one staker has 9x more stake than the other. Left is DF8, which rewards pro-rata on stake * DCV. Right is DF9, which rewards pro-rata on DCV to assets first, then pro-rata to stake within an&nbsp;asset. 3.4 Data assets that qualify for&nbsp;DF <p>This is unchanged. However, it’s worth repeating given the new OCEAN budget bound based on DCV, which in turn relates to wash consume and the 3%&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Data assets that have veOCEAN allocated towards them get DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The data asset may be of any type — dataset (for static URIs) or algorithm for Compute-to-Data. The data asset may be fixed price or free price. If fixed price, any token of exchange is alright (OCEAN, H2O, USDC,&nbsp;..).</p><p>To qualify for DF, a data asset must also&nbsp;:</p>  Have been created by Ocean smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> by OPF to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks">production networks</a>  Priced data assets have a % consume fee of ≥ 3%. Free data assets are eligible too, where gas fee is treated as “price” for measuring DCV.  Visible on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Can’t be in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">purgatory</a>   3.5 Other DF9 Parameters <p>These parameters are unchanged as well, but helpful to&nbsp;repeat.</p><p>In DF9, of the OCEAN available, 50% is for passive rewards, and 50% for active. Passive rewards go to users who hold veOCEAN (locked OCEAN) during DF9. Additional active rewards go to users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>All other DF9 parameters are the same as given in the launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>”.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>DF8 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF9 begins Oct 27. It ends Nov 3 at&nbsp;12:01am.</p><p>DF9 is the first week of DF Beta. Reward budget have increased 5x, and the active rewards calculations have changed to bias more to&nbsp;DCV.</p> 5. Appendix: Details of Changes to Reward&nbsp;Function  5.1 Summary <p>Section 3 described changes to the reward function:</p>  In DF8, OCEAN was rewarded pro-rata on stake *&nbsp;DCV.  In DF9, assets are rewarded pro-rata on DCV to each asset first, then within each asset, pro-rata on relative stake in the asset to&nbsp;stakers.   5.2 Reward Function&nbsp;Math <p>Let’s compare the math. Here’s the DF8 reward function:</p> RF_ij = (stake_ij/(Σij stake_ij)) * (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j) <p>Here’s the DF9 reward function:</p> RF_ij = (stake_ij/(Σi stake_ij)) * (DCV_j/(Σj DCV_j) <p>Where:</p>  RF_ij= relative reward to staker i for allocating to asset j. Absolute reward = reward_ij = RF_ij / (Σij RF_ij) * OCEAN_budget  stake_ij= veOCEAN of staker i allocated to asset&nbsp;j  DCV_ij=data consume volume of asset&nbsp;j  Σij stake_ij = the sum of stake_ij across all i and j. Other Σ are&nbsp;similar  <p>The only difference in the equations are the second term: DF8(Σij stake_ij) versus DF9(Σi stake_ij). DF8 sums across i and j, whereas DF9 just across j. This means that DF8 normalizes stake_ij across stakes in all assets, wheres DF9 normalizes across stakes of just the same&nbsp;asset.</p><p>This single change accomplishes the goal to “award pro-rata to DCV&nbsp;first”.</p> 5.3 Worked&nbsp;example <p>Here’s a worked example, for two assets (A, B) and four stakers (1, 2, 3, 4). To help readability, we use small / non-realistic numbers, and ignore the APY ≤ 125% and DCV active budget constraints.</p><p>Problem setup:</p>  DCV. Asset A and B each have DCV of 0.5 OCEAN. That is: DCV_A = 0.5, DCV_B = 0.5&nbsp;$OCEAN  Stake. In asset A, staker 1 has 1 veOCEAN, and staker 2 has 9. In asset B, staker 3 has 10 veOCEAN, and staker 4 has 90. That is: stake_1A = 1, stake_2A = 9, stake_3B = 10, stake_4B = 90&nbsp;veOCEAN  OCEAN_budget= 5000 $OCEAN (active&nbsp;portion)  <p>With DF8 formula, relative rewards&nbsp;are:</p>  Staker 1: RF_1A = (stake_1A /(Σij stake_ij)) * (DCV_A /(Σj DCV_j)= (1/110)*(0.5/1) = 0.0045454  Staker 2: (9/110)*(0.5/1) = 0.0409091  Staker 3: (10/110)*(0.5/1) = 0.0454545  Staker 4: (90/110)*(0.5/1) = 0.4090909  <p>With DF8 formula, absolute rewards&nbsp;are:</p>  Staker 1: reward_1A = RF_1A / (Σij RF_ij) * OCEAN_budget = 0.0045454 / (0.00454 + 0.04091 + 0.04545 + 0.40909) * 5000 = 45.45&nbsp;$OCEAN  Staker 2: reward_2A= 0.0409091 / 0.5 * 5000 = 409.09&nbsp;$OCEAN  Staker 3: reward_3B= 0.0454545 / 0.5 * 5000 = 454.54&nbsp;$OCEAN  Staker 4: reward_4B= 0.4090909/ 0.5 * 5000 = 4090.91&nbsp;$OCEAN  Double-check: total reward = 45.45 + 409.09 + 454.54 + 4090.91 = 5000 $OCEAN&nbsp;✓  <p>With DF9 formula, relative rewards&nbsp;are:</p>  Staker 1: RF_1A = (stake_1A/(Σi stake_ij)) * (DCV_A/(Σj DCV_j)= (1/10)*(0.5/1) =&nbsp;0.05  Staker 2: (9/10)*(0.5/1) =&nbsp;0.45  Staker 3: (10/100)*(0.5/1) =&nbsp;0.05  Staker 4: (90/100)*(0.5/1) =&nbsp;0.45  <p>With DF9 formula, absolute rewards&nbsp;are:</p>  Staker 1: reward_1A = RF_1A / (Σij RF_ij) * OCEAN_budget = 0.05 / (0.05 + 0.45 + 0.05 + 0.45) * 5000 = 250&nbsp;$OCEAN  Staker 2: reward_2A= 0.45 / 1.0 * 5000 = 2250&nbsp;$OCEAN  Staker 3: reward_3B = 0.05 / 1.0 * 5000 = 250&nbsp;$OCEAN  Staker 4: reward_4B= 0.45 / 1.0 * 5000 = 2250&nbsp;$OCEAN  Double-check: total reward = 250 + 2250 + 250 + 2250 = 5000 $OCEAN&nbsp;✓  <p>The treemap above “How the reward function changed from DF8 → DF9” was constructed using the numbers of this worked&nbsp;example.</p> Further Reading <p>The post<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Ocean Data Farming Series</a> collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>, or<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a>.

<p>In the last post, we classified the blockchains and investigated each type’s characteristics. In this post, we will discuss the applications of blockchain in real life. There are many real-life examples of blockchains, such as remittance, loans, and currency exchange. However, in this post, we want to discuss blockchain’s identity management process in detail. Blockchain can have more strengths in identity management systems than other applications. The integrity and decentralization of blockchain enable Self-Sovereign Identity Management, where users have sovereignty over their identities. Therefore, in this post, we will discuss how blockchain can be used in identity management systems and the advantages of using blockchain.</p> 1. Centralized identity management Fig 1. Centralized identity management system<p>The most traditional identity management method is Centralized Identity Management. Centralized identity management is a system in which a service provider (SP: Service Provider) that provides services has and manages all user identity information. For example, when registering as a member of a specific site, the user transmits personal information such as social security number, address, and mobile phone number. The above information is stored in the service provider’s server. The user must retrieve their identity information from the service provider’s server to use a specific service provider. It is far from self-sovereign identity management in that the user’s identity information is exposed to the service provider, and the storage and management of the identity information are subordinated to the service provider. Also, it is inefficient because the same identity information must be stored separately for each service provider. Assume that a user registers as a member of portal site A. To use service A, the user provides identity information to company A. The above identity information is stored in the server of A. When the user uses service A, the identity information obtained from the server is used for authentication. The above structure has the disadvantage of providing identity information again when the user uses a service other than A because the user information is ultimately stored in the service A server. That is, service B cannot be used through the identity information provided to service A. In addition, the identity information for using the service A is ultimately stored in the server of A. If there is an error in the server of A, the user may not be able to use the service despite providing the identity information. For example, a fire broke out in a data center of a company called Kakao in Korea recently. As a result, users could not use Kakao’s services for several days. Therefore, Federated Identity Management was proposed to alleviate the above shortcomings.</p> 2. Federated identity management Fig 2. Federated identity management system<p>The federated identity management system does not guarantee a fully self-sovereign identity for users, but it is meaningful in that it separates the service provider and the identity provider. In the federated identity management system, the service provider does not store and manage the identity after it is provided but requests identifying information from the identity-providing service with a specific trust relationship whenever the user accesses the service. Of course, complete self-sovereign identity is not guaranteed in that the user entrusts their identity to the identity-providing service. However, it is more efficient than the centralized model that stores identity information for each service provider. The Social media login system is the most representative example of a federated identity management system. Using other services that have a trust relationship with Google through identity information stored in Google is an example of a federated identity management system.</p> 3. Self-sovereign identity management <p>As mentioned earlier, the federated identity management system cannot guarantee complete self-identity sovereignty. However, with the recent rise of blockchain, various research and development on self-sovereign identity management are in progress. Because blockchain is a decentralized, verifiable data store, it can be used as an identity provider or a tool for identity verification. Expressly, because one’s identity is not entrusted to a central authority (decentralization), the reliability of data recorded on the blockchain can be guaranteed (data integrity), and the data recorded on the blockchain cannot be lost. Self-sovereign identity management was made possible. A standard for a distributed identity management system has recently been established using these characteristics of the blockchain. As a representative, let us deal with the distributed identity management system proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>Fig 3. Claim&nbsp;example<p>Identity information has the following form. ‘A (Subject) satisfies the attribute a.’ The above information unit is called a claim. Looking at the example in Fig 3., the information “Pat is a graduate of Example University” can be said to be an example of a claim. However, since a claim is a kind of claim, the above information cannot be used as it is for the service provider. For example, when Pat is in high school, the above information should not be used. Therefore, it is necessary to give credibility to the claim. A set of credible claims is called a verifiable credential. Specifically, when the signature of the trusted authority is added to the claim, it can be seen as authenticated information, not just a claim. A verifiable credential consists of the following:</p>Fig 4. Verifiable credentialFig 5. Verifiable credential structure<p>As shown in Fig. 5, verifiable credentials are credential metadata that summarizes what information the credential is revealing, claims that are identity information to be asserted, and proofs that prove the authenticity of the claims&nbsp;(Proof).</p><p>The credential information reveals that “Pat is a graduate of Example University” and has been certified by Example University. However, the above credentials cannot guarantee that one has used the above information. Someone can use Pat’s information after being authenticated by a trusted authority. A verifiable presentation has been proposed to prevent&nbsp;this.</p>Fig 6. Verifiable presentation<p>A verifiable presentation is a collection of multiple verifiable credentials and the user’s signature. Since the user’s signature has been added, the above information may be proved to be used by the user himself. Accordingly, by providing a verifiable presentation to the service provider, the service provider may check the identity information.</p><p>A public verification key is required to verify the proof (signature) of the verifiable presentation. A blockchain may be used to store this public verification key. The verification key that can verify the above information is stored for each subject in the blockchain. Since the blockchain is a public database, anyone can verify the identity information provided by the user/trust agency with the public verification key of each&nbsp;subject.</p>Fig 7. Verifiable credential data&nbsp;model<p>Fig 7. can be seen as a figure showing the above process. A user can receive a credential from a trusted authority (Issuer) and compose their presentation by combining the credentials issued from multiple trusted organizations. The service provider can verify the representation provided by using the public verification key of the trusted authority/user recorded in the blockchain. Decentralized ID (DID) has been proposed to manage the above public verification key more efficiently. DID allows each subject to store the public verification key and public information required for data verification in the blockchain. The specific structure is as&nbsp;follows.</p>Fig 8. DID structure<p>Each subject has its own DID, which is used as an index to check the actual public key information. DID document, a set of actual public verification values, can be accessed through DID, and DID document can be accessed in the form of a URL through the DID URL. Through these DID structures and verifiable credential data models, one can manage self-sovereign identity in which one can have sovereignty over one’s identity, and various services can also be constructed.</p><p>For example, Metadium provides APIs for using the above verifiable credentials, verifiable presentation, DID, and built services using the above APIs. Mykeepin service, an integrated authentication service using DID, is provided, and a wallet for using it is also&nbsp;offered.</p><p>Before the advent of the blockchain, all data was managed by a central administrator, a server. Therefore, in managing identity information, it was inevitably subordinated by the central manager. However, with the emergence of a blockchain that can collect data in a decentralized environment and ensures data integrity (without data modification and risk of loss), users can manage identity information without entrusting their identity information to a specific company’s server. In other words, the blockchain can be seen as meaningful in realizing self-identity sovereignty because it can return the individual’s identity sovereignty to the individual.</p> References <p>[1] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/understanding-distributed-identity-management-systems-c543daef499f">Understanding Distributed Identity Management Systems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations">Verifiable Presentations</a> (VPs) are an under-defined part of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) ecosystem. This is a problem because presentations are a critical part of making a viable, working, useful credential ecosystem. Imagine graduating from a university and not being able to receive your degree in the mail. Or being asked for a copy of your driver’s license and not being able to provide it. A credential is valuable because it can be sent (i.e., “presented”) from one party to another. Leaving verifiable presentations under-defined is a huge risk for the continued success of&nbsp;VCs.</p> The Problem With Presentations <p>Despite being mentioned 118 times in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#">W3C VC spec</a>, VPs are generally under-explained in the specification. In particular, we have little information about differences between VPs. For example, take a look at this <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview">diagram in the specification</a>:</p><p>VPs seem somewhat ambiguous in this picture. For example, the holder “Acquires, stores, [and] presents” VCs, but how do they acquire the VCs in the first place? According to this diagram, it looks like they are “issued credentials,” but is issuance the same thing as a VP? The arrow for “Issue Credentials” is exactly the same as “Send Presentation,” leading us to believe these activities are similar, but how are they similar? We can’t adequately answer these questions by looking at the above picture and the specification doesn’t provide a ton of help&nbsp;either.</p><p>We can come up with more complicated arrangements of issuers, holders, and verifiers too, which complicates our mental model of VPs. For example, is there a holder that only presents to other holders? Are there verifiers that present to other verifiers? These questions are probably outside the scope of the W3C specification but are nonetheless important for understanding (and building) VC ecosystems.</p> Presentation Personas <p>The goal of this piece is to fill these gaps in our comprehension of VPs. To that end, I’ve constructed three VP personas that zoom in on different motivations for creating presentations: Certifiers, Consolidators, and Submitters.</p><p>Certifiers: As a certifier, I’m an issuer and want to be able to issue a VC about a holder and send it to them or another&nbsp;party.</p>  Certifiers care about enabling VC features like expiration dates and revocation.  Certifiers are often “roots of trust.” The value of a VC is derived from the credibility of the certifier.  Includes any organization that is making claims about entities.  E.g., <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS-1</a>, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/resources/organic-certifying-agents">organic certifiers</a>  <p>Consolidators: As a consolidator, I’m a holder and want to be able to receive/send VCs about another&nbsp;holder.</p>  Consolidators care about where VPs are coming from and where they’re going&nbsp;to.  Consolidators care about the status of the VCs they’re receiving and sending (e.g., revocation status &amp; expiration date).  Includes any organization that is collecting claims about entities.  E.g., Subsidiaries/sub-organizations, brokers  <p>Submitters: As a submitter, I’m a holder and want to be able to present VCs about myself or another holder to a verifier.</p>  Submitters are similar to consolidators in that they’re both holders, but submitters are specifically responsible for VPs to verifiers.  The VC subject(s) can be about the submitter, but not necessarily so.  Submitters care about the status of the VCs they’re submitting (e.g., revocation status &amp; expiration date)  Includes any organization that is asserting claims about entities.  E.g., Certified organic farms, university graduates, brokers   Caveats <p>There are a few caveats about these personas worth mentioning. First, this breakdown is not exhaustive. As the VC and VP ecosystem grows and changes I fully expect to find new interactions and scenarios that demand individual attention. In fact, there is an edge case that I’ve purposefully left out: self-certifiers. This persona both issues a VC about themselves and sends it directly to a verifier, but the credibility of self-certified claims is suspect, so my working hypothesis is that this persona will not be super critical for many use-cases.</p><p>Second, while I am differentiating between VP personas, I am not arguing that the underlying technology differs (or should differ) between each type of VP. A kitchen knife can be used to chop an onion or open a box. The kitchen knife is still a kitchen knife. While there may be room to argue that we should use different kinds of knives for cutting onions and opening boxes, that line of reasoning is outside the scope of this piece. I’m working under the assumption that there is one kind of VP, as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">defined in the W3C spec</a>, that is being used for different purposes.</p><p>Third, these personas are not mutually exclusive. For example, a single party can be a certifier and a consolidator, or a consolidator and a submitter, but my working hypothesis is that these roles are often played one at a&nbsp;time.</p> Key Takeaways <p>Now that I’ve talked about Certifiers, Consolidators, and Submitters, you’re probably wondering how this breakdown helps&nbsp;us.</p><p>From a product development perspective these personas represent different types of users with different needs and pain-points. For example, a Submitter might need different tools to do their job than a Consolidator or a Certifier. Building a one-size-fits-all VC platform risks accommodating everyone and no one. While the technology underpinning these activities might be the same, their purpose is not. That’s a critical distinction that should inform how we build amazing and easy-to-use VC products.</p><p>Alternatively, this persona breakdown makes us reflect on how we use the language of “Verifiable Presentations.” A VP made by a Submitter is done for different reasons than a VP made by a Certifier, just as chopping an onion has a different aim than opening a box, even though I’ve used a kitchen knife to do both. In other words, the term “presentation” risks falling into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation">fallacy of equivocation</a>. “Presentation” is said in a different sense depending on which persona we’re talking about. We should strive to eliminate this equivocation when we can. The personas I’ve outlined above should help us achieve that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>VPs are a complex and important yet under-developed part of our VC ecosystem. We should strive to continuously improve the specificity of our mental models of VPs as VCs evolve and grow as a standard. It’s imperative that we do so if we want VC technology to flourish.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-s-lerner/">Adam Lerner</a>, Technical Product Manager Transmute</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/verifiable-presentation-personas-certifiers-consolidators-submitters-b38a281eb92f">Verifiable Presentation Personas: Certifiers, Consolidators, &amp; Submitters</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Identity plays a critical role in supply chains. Stakeholders place value on unambiguous identifiers for governments, organizations, people, devices, and assets.

<p>Identity plays a critical role in supply chains. Stakeholders place value on unambiguous identifiers for governments, organizations, people, devices, and assets. As supply chains grow more complex, we mitigate risks by codifying the relationships between these stakeholders and the actions they have taken over time into identifiers using shared terms to assess&nbsp;value.</p><p>We will explore the relationship between identity terms and supply chain using the purchase of organic strawberries as an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Introduction to Identity: A Strawberry Story</p><p>Identity in daily practice is shorthand for every action we&nbsp;take.</p><p>Bob buys fruit at the grocery&nbsp;store.</p><p>Each element in that sentence combines identifiers, claims, knowledge, logic, and likely several credentials to provide key stakeholders with the confidence they need to ensure a stable and trustworthy supply chain. Using organic strawberries as an example, a crop that grossed almost <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Organics/organics_1_006%20_006.pdf">US $321 million in sales in 2019</a>, how those terms are defined and applied demonstrate the tangible value of identity in the supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Identifiers <p>What is the difference between an identity and an identifier?</p><p>Identifiers are labels for identities, or a way to recognize and establish identity.</p><p>In the context of supply chains, prudent stakeholders establish identifiers to avoid harm that might come from confusion over identity and protect value that is derived from certainty regarding identity and provenance. In practice, we mostly use identifiers as a way to describe separate entities and their interactions.</p><p>When we write policy, we mean for it to apply to identities, but when we convert that policy to software, it can end up applying only to identifiers. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US government placed <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/russia-belarus">stringent export controls on Russia</a>. That policy is written using the English language identifier for Russia, but it is meant to enforce all language identifiers for Russia, including Россия. Software designed to implement the policy effectively should account for all identifiers associated with the restricted identity.</p><p>In the sentence about Bob’s shopping trip, there are multiple identifiers that can be added or altered that change nothing for the subjects of the sentence.</p><p>Robert buys strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart.</p><p>In this way, identity is an abstraction used to communicate sameness, a way to say that two or more things are in fact the same&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Person = Robert,&nbsp;Bob</p><p>Goods = fruit, strawberries</p><p>Vendor = grocery store,&nbsp;S-Mart</p><blockquote>Zooko’s Triangle and&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>Names as identifiers highlights one of the most challenging aspects of applying identifiers to supply chains, or any network protocol, often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko’s triangle</a>, an identity trilemma that maintains no single name can achieve more than two of: human-meaningful, secure, and decentralized.</blockquote><blockquote>In supply chain use cases, this triangle has often been addressed by trading decentralization for human readability, typically through the use of registries managed by trusted entities, for&nbsp;example:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis">GS1 EPCIS</a> — Relies on a standards process for describing supply chain activity.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a> — Relies on email addresses and a centralized database.</blockquote><blockquote>Identifier registries solve for global uniqueness and discoverability by sacrificing privacy and decentralization, but there are many use cases where this trade off makes a lot of sense, for&nbsp;example:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers">IANA Root&nbsp;Servers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_number">DEA Numbers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory&nbsp;Database</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM/ECF">Case Management/Electronic Case&nbsp;Files</a></blockquote> Claims Help Us&nbsp;Choose <p>Identifiers and claims are meaningless without each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Knowing who said something is just as important as what they said, or about whom they said&nbsp;it.</p><p>Most often, we encounter two kinds of&nbsp;claims:</p> Self Attested <p>Self attested claims are when an identity claims something about itself or something it controls. When you “agree to terms of service”, you are claiming to have read and understood the terms of service. The consequences of self attested claims are generally individualized, and the more valuable claims in the supply chain are made by reputable third&nbsp;parties.</p> Third Party&nbsp;Attested <p>Third Party Attestations are claims about a subject (identity) made by a different identity. In some US states to acquire a driver’s license, you need to present a physician’s signature to approve your medical authorization to drive because the state does not trust you to make these claims by yourself. Third party attestations are a common building block for establishing trust, and removing conflicts of interest.</p><p>One of the most common types of claims is a claim about the relationship between identifiers. Email verification to complete actions like signing up for a newsletter or establishing a new social media account helps the newsletter service links two of your personal identifiers together around your identity.</p><p>Third party attestations solve for Zooko’s triangle where we must associate a secure globally unique identifier with a human readable identifier. Leveraging a third party attestation for this allows us to get the benefits of multiple identifier formats at the cost of trusting the identity provider to make claims of equivalence.</p><p>Supply chain stakeholders can request third party attestations like an independent audit of a manufacturing or food producing facility; a third party security review of a cryptography library; or an independent review of a company’s financials before it can be bought or&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Bob buys organic strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart</p><p>In this example, the claim is that the strawberries are organic. All strawberries carry the same identifier, but Bob prefers the strawberries that claim to be&nbsp;organic.</p> Logic Applied to Identifiers and&nbsp;Claims <p>“<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/logic">Logic is a particular way of thinking, especially one that is reasonable and based on good judgment</a>.”</p><p>Claims that leverage identifiers and logic, are better than claims that don’t. Not every identifier-claim pairing can be taken at face value because they don’t all map to logical assumptions.</p>  If there is a conflict of interest to misreport a value, it’s not logical to accept self attested claims regarding that&nbsp;value.  If the identifier for a subject might not be unique enough, how will we know which identity is making the&nbsp;claim.  <p>By taking care to design claims that leverage identifiers and their critical properties as noted by Zooko, we can remove ambiguity, reduce the chances of human errors that arise from confusion and poor communication, and increase the ability to process claims using automated systems that can exploit&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Bob buys organic strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart.</p><p>Because claims can quickly become too complex to verify, it can be helpful to use logic to navigate a claim’s construction. If we apply logic to the claim that the strawberries are organic, we can immediately identify questions that verify or increase our confidence in the claim, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Where do the strawberries come&nbsp;from?  Is the organic claim made by the producer (labeled on the packaging) or S-Mart (unlabeled)?  Does S-Mart have a history of selling organic&nbsp;produce?  Does the product carry the USDA certified organic&nbsp;label?   Knowledge as&nbsp;Context <p>Knowledge comprises all the information about an identity, including identifiers, claims, and the results of applied&nbsp;logic.</p><p>It’s important to agree to common representations for knowledge so that claims can be understood with context. Shared vocabularies and ontologies can help remove ambiguity and reduce the possible complexity of claims, which in turn can unlock more efficient knowledge processing.</p><p>In the context of supply chains, we require knowledge about the details of each transaction in order to proceed safely and profitably:</p>  A container with a weight of 667 with no units can’t be safely loaded onto a&nbsp;ship.  An outstanding invoice of 100.50 with no currency can’t help us answer questions about how much in USD we&nbsp;owe.  <p>Instead of processing all invoices and containers in all possible currencies and physical units, supply chain stakeholders share knowledge by agreeing to a subset defined in a specific document. By rejecting data that does not meet those agreed-upon knowledge requirements, they can improve the quality of the data that is processed, and save on expensive and possibly dangerous normalization computations.</p><p>Not every supply chain system can use knowledge management to limit claims. For example, when processing real world data in many languages, you cannot just ignore claims in other languages. If you are dealing with historical data, there could be documents which you must process which may have complied with regulations at the time, but which are not compliant with current regulations.</p><p>Just as claims can change over time, so too can knowledge management systems.</p><p>Bob’s knowledge about his organic strawberry purchase could be augmented by S-Mart claims to source their strawberries from a local farm; a comparison between the cost of conventional versus organic strawberries at S-Mart; or an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/us/hepatitis-a-us-canada-strawberries.html">outbreak of hepatitis</a> caused by strawberries.</p> Credentials for Efficiency and Protection <p>When a claim is made by an identifier (issuer), in such a way that it can be attributed to the issuer’s identity, and is protected from being tampered with, some call it a credential, certificate or&nbsp;license.</p><p>Credentials about products are only meaningful when you trust the identity making the claim. If you are importing or exporting products that might have a national security, environmental or social impact, you probably need a special credential from a government to engage in that activity. When the stakes are that high, the most valuable credential comes from a reputable, mutually agreed upon third&nbsp;party.</p><p>If you learn you are interacting with an identity which has lost their license several times in the past few years, you search for a new vendor or evaluate if the price of the goods or service is worth the risk to your business.</p><p>Supply chain credentialing in the form of bills of lading, certificates of origin, or letters of credit is used to protect honest parties and their merchandise from being confused with dishonest parties or entities that are engaged in unethical practices, such as environmental destruction, or forced&nbsp;labor.</p><p>The best credential Bob can look for in the United States is the USDA organic sticker on his strawberries. But it’s not just a helpful credential for Bob. Producers who violate the USDA’s organic terms face up to <a href="https://attra.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nop_organiccertification.pdf?">$11,000 per violation and a revocation of the producer’s organic certificate</a>.</p><p>To incentivize the credentialing process for producers, obtaining USDA certification opens doors to participating in an <a href="https://attra.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nop_organiccertification.pdf?">organic trade agreement</a> where Canada, the EU, Japan, and Taiwan also recognize the USDA’s organic certification.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Last week, I had an opportunity to visit Oracle CloudWorld, the company’s new flagship conference for customers and partners, which is also the reincarnation of the familiar OpenWorld after the three-year break caused by the Covid pandemic. With the new title and location - the event has moved from San Francisco to Las Vegas - everything I felt after stepping into the venue was somehow different and yet the same. On the one hand, I was glad to meet the same crowd and fellow analysts, as well as see many Oracle employees in person after years of just Zoom sessions. On the other – the whole world has changed profoundly because of the recent events, and we all have a different outlook at the current and future business drivers of our industry.</p>
<p>Naturally, this was reflected in the conference’s program as well, starting with the keynotes. Somewhat surprisingly, there was little focus on specific product announcements in the presentations given by Safra Catz, the Oracle’s CEO, and Larry Ellison himself. The former primarily focused on empowering customers to accelerate their digital transformation, which in the current troubling times might be the key not just to success but survival for every organization. From banking and the tech sector to bakers and racing teams – an impressive selection of success stories were presented. To be honest, I’m always more interested in customer stories that involve drama, sudden twists and overcoming unexpected problems. Apparently, Oracle customers have none of those – everything just works faster and costs less.</p>
<p>In his keynote, Ellison has presented his vision of how Oracle is planning to revolutionize healthcare (with help from the recently acquired Cerner, a leading supplier of healthcare information technology). Clearly proud of the COVID tracking solution Oracle created using its APEX low-code development platform, he envisions a platform that makes all medical records for every patient available in every US hospital, making every treatment quicker and safer. To be honest, as a German citizen, I was immediately more concerned about privacy implications of such platforms, but attendees were clearly impressed, if somewhat skeptical whether such an endeavor is even feasible. It will certainly face more than just technological challenges.</p>
<p>Speaking of technology – Oracle, of course, remains a leading database vendor, and announcing Oracle Database 23c, the next long-term support release of the company’s flagship product, was one of the highlights. With more than 300 new features, describing it in detail is definitely out of scope for this blog post, but my favorite announcement was JSON Relational Duality – a revolutionary technology that finally combines the advantages of relational and document databases instead of settling for compromises.</p>
<p>Now data can still be stored in relational format and thus be available for scalable transactional and analytical workloads, but at the same time be accessed and manipulated as JSON documents. This will not just make developers and data analysts happy at the same time.&nbsp;It can also dramatically reduce complexity and improve flexibility of modern applications by eliminating object-relational mappings, streamlining data access via various protocols and APIs and give more weight to the notion of a “converged database”. With additional features like in-database microservice support, stored procedures in JavaScript (and support for Python coming next), and a built-in SQL firewall, the Oracle database will be even more convenient for developers but not at the expense of data security.</p>
<p>It's worth noting however that the company no longer focuses on just one database to rule them all. We have already covered the rapid developments of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/new-heatwave-is-coming">MySQL HeatWave</a>, Oracle’s cloud MySQL service with built-in acceleration for analytical workloads and machine learning. At the CloudWorld, HeatWave Lakehouse was announced, which supports managing relational and object store data at a 400 TB scale while delivering consistent query performance across this data, thanks to the improved ML-based optimization. In a way, Oracle continues turning MySQL into another converged database that’s familiar to millions of developers around the world and is now available and optimized for multiple clouds.</p>
<p>In fact, support for multiple clouds or even <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/multi-cloud-weve-been-waiting-for">redefining the very notion of multi-cloud</a> was perhaps the biggest topic at the CloudWorld. Again, we have already covered the recent efforts Oracle is putting into establishing strategic partnerships with other public cloud providers or at least making their services available in other clouds to ensure that customers can design their multi-cloud solutions with more choices available and fewer troubles to worry about, such as high latency or egress fees.</p>
<p>But even Oracle’s own cloud is evolving as well. It continues to grow its global presence with 40 current and 7 more regions planned. Oracle is also increasing flexibility for customers to consume its cloud services just the way they need. Building a dedicated cloud region for a large enterprise customer has been possible for some time already, but now it has become more accessible, with dedicated regions built directly in customers’ existing data centers.</p>
<p>And with the recently announced <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/post/announcing-oracle-alloy">Oracle Alloy</a>, the company now offers a complete infrastructure platform that enables Oracle partners to become cloud providers themselves – offering a full set of cloud services under their own management and branding, customizing capabilities according to different industry and compliance requirements. In more sophisticated scenarios, partners can bring their own hardware or even develop their own services using Oracle’s tools.</p>
<p>Thus, Oracle’s cloud is no longer limited to a specific set of datacenters – it is expanding in multiple directions, interconnecting with other public clouds, branching into dedicated and private cloud deployments or reaching businesses via its partner network. And still, customers can expect to have consistent, convenient, and secure access to the same services they need. And yes, those services may also be faster and cheaper than those offered by some competitors.</p>

<p>The Launchpad is a regular series highlighting updates to the GlobaliD product ecosystem.</p><p>Fresh off the heels of our <a href="https://www.global.id/digital-id-wallet/">revamped ID Wallet</a>, we’re thrilled to announce the brand new GlobaliD&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>A digital identity is only as good as what you can do with it. At GlobaliD, our vision from day one has been to provide anyone, anywhere with not only a digital identity but also a digital wallet. Historically speaking, trust and value have always gone hand in hand. People generally don’t transact with others unless there’s a sense of trust. Similarly, you won’t be able to open a bank account unless the bank knows who you are — unless the bank trusts&nbsp;you.</p><p>But the traditional system isn’t very efficient at managing that process, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex">excluding 1.7 billion people from basic financial services</a>.</p><p>With today’s release, we’re one step closer toward getting those people connected to the global&nbsp;economy.</p> Identity +&nbsp;Wallet <p>A non-custodial wallet is essentially a wallet that you have complete control over. It’s not too different from having cash in your actual wallet. That’s your money you can access whenever you want. It’s right&nbsp;there.</p><p>Compare that to a custodial service such as your bank account. It’s still technically your money, but it’s managed by a third party. It’s relatively easy to access your money, but you’ll have to go through your bank to do it — whether online, at the ATM, or with an in-person teller.</p><p>With a non-custodial wallet, you hold the master key to your&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Back in June, we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/building-a-more-inclusive-and-equitable-future-745f897a2c2b">announced our transition from a custodial wallet solution to a non-custodial one</a>. The reasoning was and still is straightforward. The primary limitation to custodial offerings is access, given that they operate in a tightly regulated space. For instance, our previous custodial implementation of the GlobaliD Wallet was restricted in a handful of states due to local regulations. A non-custodial solution allows us to enable more users around the world to have the full GlobaliD experience.</p><p>This also marks one of the first times a digital identity is attached to a non-custodial wallet solution.</p><p>Today, non-custodial wallets operate in a regulatory gray zone since they aren’t tied to an identity, which ultimately limits their real world usability. By baking in privacy-preserving digital identity, GlobaliD’s non-custodial solution has everything it needs to become fully compliant in the context of existing regulatory frameworks.</p><p>What that means is the GlobaliD Wallet has the potential to serve your most common banking use cases such as storing funds, getting paid, and, of course, shopping online — all while giving you full ownership and control of your identity, your data, and your&nbsp;funds.</p><p>The new GlobaliD Wallet is also your bridge to the next chapter of the internet — what people are calling web3. This initial version is currently built on Solana, but Ethereum support is on the way — stay tuned. The eventual goal is support for all the major blockchains, all in one place. That means you’ll be able to seamlessly transfer funds between the traditional banking system as well as the metaverse.</p><p>Finally, your identity is also defined, in part, by what you own — including NFTs. Last month, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/ticketmaster-nft-expansion-flow-dapper-labs/">Ticketmaster announced that it was going all-in on NFTs</a>. There’s also projects experimenting with NFTs as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-soulbound-tokens-the-non-transferrable-nft-explained/">another form of identity credential</a>. From <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/video/first-mover-on-cdtv-clips/hellebore-founder-explains-how-nfts-change-gaming-prediction-markets/">gaming</a> to <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/nyfw-nfts-unlock-invites-products">fashion</a>, you’ll be able to hold all those NFTs alongside your Bored Ape — if you’re into that kind of thing — right in your GlobaliD&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>With this release, we’ve taken a giant leap toward fulfilling that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Here are all the things you can already do with your new GlobaliD&nbsp;Wallet:</p> New features and improvements   The non-custodial wallet can be found in the Wallet tab of the GlobaliD app. When you open the app, you can quickly navigate to your GlobaliD Wallet by selecting Wallet at the bottom of the screen. Any assets you add to your GlobaliD Wallet will be readily available at your fingertips.  Support for USDC, SOL, and Solana NFTs — with more coming soon. Upon launch you will be able to hold, send, and receive USDC, Solana and Solana NFTs in your GlobaliD. We will expand support for Ethereum and other digital assets in future&nbsp;updates.  Store, view, and send Solana NFTs and NFT collections. You can house all of your Solana NFTs and NFT collections in the new GlobaliD Wallet. In the NFT tab of the wallet, you can easily navigate through your digital&nbsp;tokens.  Send SOL, USDC, and NFTs directly to GlobaliD users or wallet addresses. You can conveniently send tokens by typing in the name of another GlobaliD user, or just by entering a receiver’s wallet address. Receivers could also generate and share a QR code via GlobaliD which they can use to collect payments.  See a transaction log of all of your activity in the GlobaliD Wallet. You can review all of your activity in the GlobaliD Wallet’s transaction log. Additionally, a Transaction ID that links to a Solscan URL is generated for all Solana transactions.  Data minimization and a path toward financial inclusion. The new non-custodial wallet includes GlobaliD’s platform-wide onboarding requirements. Users who have yet to complete onboarding will need to declare some basic identity information in order to access the wallet. These requirements set the foundation for a fully compliant non-custodial wallet that has the potential to broaden access to regulated financial services. It also opens the door to compliant crypto services and regulated DeFi. We’ll share our vision for a fully compliant digital wallet that you own and control in upcoming editions of Launchpad.  <p>Visit the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/globalid-portable-identity/id1439340119">App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.globalid">Google Play Store</a> to download the latest version of the GlobaliD app&nbsp;today.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, <a href="https://www.global.id/">visit our website</a> or follow us on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/_globalid">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a>.

<p>While NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework is probably the most well-known, there are other cybersecurity frameworks your organization should be aware of.</p>
<p>What is a cybersecurity framework? A cybersecurity framework is a way to reduce the risk of cybersecurity incidents by creating guidelines, standards, protocols and best practices on how employees should go about their job while using the internet.</p>
 What Is a Cybersecurity Framework? 
<p>A cybersecurity framework is a set of practices, policies, and considerations organizations might take to better support their cybersecurity efforts. Cybersecurity has, by and large, moved away from checklist-based compliance standards where a governing body dictated specific technologies that required constant and often ineffective updating to stay ahead of threats.</p>
<p>Instead, frameworks provide more generalized strategies and guidance on cybersecurity, focusing on implementing a security-first posture for administrative, technical, and physical security.</p>
<p>Frameworks often share similar traits, including the following:</p>
 
 Best Practices: Cybersecurity frameworks will focus on how an organization can shore up security in a broad sense. These best practices will cover the critical security areas and how the organization should address them. 
 
<p>These areas usually include Identity and Access Management (IAM), authentication, encryption and privacy, security and physical spaces, training, education, and governance.</p>
 
 Control Catalogs: Frameworks rarely define specific standards, algorithms, or technologies, emphasizing best practices built around the latest security technologies. However, these frameworks will either explicitly point to supplementary control catalogs or have supporting catalogs created for them by standards-creating bodies. 
 
<p>The reason for these general approaches is to help frameworks stay flexible and relevant in the face of a rapidly evolving security landscape. Since they focus on best practices and a culture of security, any attempt to ground a framework in a specific technology could render them difficult to implement, if not immediately irrelevant.</p>
 
 Risk Management: More frameworks are turning to risk management as a foundation for security. Assessing risk forces organizations to take inventory of their vulnerable systems and to understand those systems in a business and industry context. You’ll often find cybersecurity frameworks including or referencing guidelines for risk management. 
 
<p>The strength of a cybersecurity framework is its applicability to modern threats and security contexts, and such a framework benefits from speaking to good security practices rather than chasing the latest technology.</p>
 What Is the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)? 
<p>One more open and established framework is the aptly named Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). Published and maintained by the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/nist-cybersecurity-compliance/">National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>, CSF is a broad initiative to promote good cybersecurity health for federal agencies and their vendors.</p>
<p>However, because NIST standards are open to public scrutiny and consumption, the CSF is also well-suited for any business looking to drive good cybersecurity from the country’s top computer scientists and engineers.</p>
 The Five Categories of the Cybersecurity Framework 
<p>The CSF divides cybersecurity into five overarching categories:</p>
 
 Identify: An organization should have the capacity to identify and inventory all affected infrastructure (networks, devices, servers, data, etc.) as well as the potential vulnerabilities in that inventory. The idea here is to promote a comprehensive understanding of system security rather than the piecemeal implementation of security measures. 
 Protect: An organization must be able to protect resources identified as relevant to security. This includes utilizing perimeter security, antimalware, identity and authentication, sufficient cryptography, training and education programs, backup and recovery strategies, and ongoing monitoring and logging for mitigation and auditing purposes. 
 Detect: An organization must be able to detect unauthorized access to the system through network connections or physical devices. 
 Respond: An organization must be able to respond to unauthorized access to protected resources with a combination of security mitigation efforts, backup recovery measures, auditing and forensic investigation capabilities, and more generalized resilience strategies (in cases of emergency system failure or natural disasters). 
 Recover: In cases of attack or disaster, a company must have measures to quickly restore system functionality while mitigating security vulnerabilities and closing gaps that led to the attack. Furthermore, the organization must have policies to dictate how they communicate these security issues with their relevant stakeholders. 
 
<p>While the NIST Cybersecurity Framework doesn’t outline specific technologies organizations should use, it is closely tied to several other NIST publications. Organizations adopting the CSF can therefore leverage the expertise of the NIST system to bolster their security.</p>
 What Are Some Other Cybersecurity Frameworks? 
<p>While NIST is a significant factor in the realm of security frameworks, it’s not the only one. Many industry-specific frameworks exist to address the specific needs of relevant organizations, with slightly different approaches depending on the market.</p>
<p>Some well-known frameworks include:</p>
 
 International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001: The International Organization for Standardization releases technical specifications across many categories, including cybersecurity. 
 
<p>The ISO 27001 standard details how an organization can create and maintain an Information Security Management System (ISMS), a comprehensive approach to security. ISO standards are internationally known and respected, but a private organization requires organizations to pay for the latest revisions and audits.</p>
 
 Service Organization Control (SOC) 2: The SOC 2 standard, maintained by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), is an in-depth framework for financial institutions geared toward helping them implement security, privacy, and accessibility controls for personal customers and financial data. 
 
<p>While there are several types of SOC 2 reports (called Trust Service Criteria), the only required report for an audit is the security report.</p>
 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides a security framework for healthcare providers and their business associates (vendors and third-party providers). 
 
<p>This framework, maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services in conjunction with NIST, addresses the proper practices a provider must have when handling patient health and payment information (called Protected Health Information, or PHI).</p>
 
 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): This framework, specific to the European Union, defines the rights of data subjects and consumers regarding their data’s privacy and security. It defines best practices and requirements for companies handling consumer data, including how they may or may not process, store, or sell that information.

 What is Linked&nbsp;Data? <p>Linked Data provides meaning to existing data, allowing systems to integrate without additional human interpretation.</p><p>How Linked Data turns Messages into&nbsp;Data</p><p>A well-designed system — one that is developer-friendly with an intuitive integration process — still requires a significant amount of interpretation to map itself to another organization. Even though the terms used should overlap, the subtle differences in names or definitions creates an integration challenge.</p><p>Linked Data addresses these differences, avoiding costly and error-prone manual interpretation.</p><p>“The term Linked Data is used to describe a recommended best practice for exposing, sharing, and connecting information on the Web using standards, such as URLs, to identify things and their properties. When information is presented as Linked Data, other related information can be easily discovered and new information can be easily linked to it. Linked Data is extensible in a decentralized way, greatly reducing barriers to large scale integration.” — <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-integrity-spec/">W3C Data Integrity/Linked Data Signatures</a></p> How Transmute uses Linked Data — JSON-LD <p>An Application Programming Interface (“API”) is a way to let one system programmatically communicate with another system. Most modern APIs are based on exchanging messages encoded in a developer-friendly syntax called JavaScript Object Notation (“JSON”).</p><p>“JSON-LD” overlays raw JSON data with Linked Data, providing context to understand the data without additional interpretation. JSON-LD adds Linked Data elements to existing API messages without altering any of the existing JSON itself. This means that Linked Data and all its value can be added without making changes to the original&nbsp;system.</p><p>Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform and open source tools are all based on Linked Data. We express Linked Data as Verifiable Credentials which can be continuously verified in a decentralized way, or a “Trust-Less Architecture.”</p><p>Transmute holds editor roles on essential open source Linked Data projects including:</p>  <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/017_EDI-API_Linked-data-vocab.pdf">UN/CEFACT semantic vocabulary</a>  <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/">W3C Traceability Vocabulary</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers Specification</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">Verifiable Credentials v2.0 Specification</a>   Linked Data Enables Integration — But Wait, There’s&nbsp;More! <p>Proactively embracing Linked Data provides a major business benefit in systems integration. Linked Data removes the cost and risk of interpreting what a counterpart system is attempting to communicate.</p><p>The benefits of Linked Data go beyond easing the burden of integration, though. <a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">Linked Data provides the raw material for establishing Knowledge Graphs</a>, which can reveal hidden value deep within the data and unlock the ability for a business to make accurate data-driven decisions.

			  Alexis Kaupp is a Front-end Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hello there! My name is Alexis, I was born in Nancy, a small town in the north-east of France (where the Place Stanislas is, one of the most beautiful places in the world), where I also did most of my studies. I have always been fascinated by computers and technology, I remember my dad going back home with a loud and heavy Packard Bell PC loaded with Windows 95, it all started from here!</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Actually, a lot of things! I traveled a lot thanks to music. It allowed me to have an open-minded overall vision of life! Just before joining Tokeny I was working for a big corporate IT company which wasn’t a good fit for me as I wanted to work on innovation more than anything else. I decided to leave this company and join Tokeny when someone from the team who is a former co-worker invited me. And what can I say? I knew it was a match made in heaven in the first interview!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Honestly? We can’t get bored, there’s always something new to learn, a new challenge to face, it’s a fulfilling experience!<br>
The global vision of Tokeny, the teammates, the projects, everything here makes me happy and productive on a daily basis.<br>
I can’t thank everyone enough at Tokeny, it feels great to be part of this team</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Have good times and learn as many new things as possible! It relates to the two main things I’m really passionate about in life, which are technologies and making music. I’m making music for almost 20 years now, formerly in a band, I’ve learned a lot about life touring with a band, dealing with people, discovering many cultures and also this: Never settle down in your comfort zone, always try to push your boundaries, even if you fail, at the end you learned something, there’s no success without failures.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>It’s really utopian, but war is meaningless, world hunger, healthcare, fossil energies etc… all of that should disappear and everybody should live a happy life, we’re just passengers, there’s no need to hurt each other. I believe in Karma, if you make something good in your life, you’ll receive good back.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid to ask questions, let’s chat, nobody is left behind!</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>I believe in Tokenization, it will become mainstream as cryptocurrencies and NFTs are right now. We provide good and avant-gardist services! There is of course a lot of work until it’s become the present, but we are getting closer and closer every day!</p>

<p>Orbit Enterprise Platform is a No Code Self Sovereign Identity platform that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of verifiable credentials that are held and owned by end users in digital wallets.</p>
<p>Recently, we have implemented a new feature within a proof request, where verifiers can ask for the holder to provide self-attested attributes. These are quite useful for low integrity/risk use cases, where a self-attestation meets a verifier’s policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: as an organization, when I onboard a vendor, I want to verify their verifiable business credentials, but also their banking information (self-attested) to set them up for payments in our accounts payable system.</p>
<p>See here how this can be done within a Presentation Proposal workflow:</p>
