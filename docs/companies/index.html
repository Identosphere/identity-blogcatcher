  <p>Have you been involved with acquiring a software product for your company? If you have, you know that finding and purchasing a solution that meets your specific enterprise needs can be a challenging process. We understand the difficulty that buyers face when trying to match vendor capabilities with business requirements. After reviewing multiple vendor solutions, product web pages, and data sheets, they all start to sound the same. And videos often focus more on the muzak and narration than on educating the viewer on a specific point. Free trial accounts provide rudimentary access to the product that does not give the user the ability to explore more complex use cases.</p>

  The EU’s new MiCA regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer losses, representing a major shift towards increased protection and transparency in the&nbsp;sector.  MiCA regulation introduces significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges while promising enhanced user protection, potentially boosting confidence and cryptocurrency adoption.  The MiCA regulation could set a global precedent for cryptocurrency regulation, emphasizing the delicate balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation in the rapidly advancing field of cryptocurrencies.  <p>Europe’s ascent as the “World’s biggest cryptocurrency economy” is underscored by several telling statistics. In 2020 alone, the continent <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/09/29/europe-is-now-the-world-s-cryptocurrency-capital#:~:text=Europe%20is%20now%20the%20world's%20biggest%20cryptocurrency%20economy%2C%20with%20the,blockchain%20data%20firm%20Chainalysis%20found.">received over 870 billion Euros in crypto</a>. Moreover, the Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions accounted for a quarter of the global cryptocurrency activity.</p><p>Significantly, between July 2020 and June 2021, transfers from large institutional investors mushroomed from 1.2 billion Euros to 39.6 billion Euros, highlighting the escalating crypto activities in the region and setting the stage for imminent regulatory interventions.</p><p>In response to this burgeoning crypto economy and a series of high-profile incidents leading to significant customer losses, the European Union has enacted a sweeping set of regulations. The newly introduced Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p><p>This fundamental shift in the handling of digital assets is aimed at providing a protective shield for investors. By imposing higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity on exchanges, the rules promise to enhance protection and reliability for customers.</p><p>Beyond Europe, these pioneering regulations could act as a blueprint for the global crypto industry, stimulating broader acceptance of such rules while presenting significant compliance challenges for crypto exchanges.</p><p>As the EU navigates this new terrain, the balancing act between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation could shape the future of the crypto industry worldwide.</p> EU’s Landmark Crypto&nbsp;Rules <p>On 16th May 2023, the European Union adopted a regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), initiating a continent-level legal framework for the crypto industry for the first time. The regulatory framework would apply to crypto assets, asset issuers, and crypto-asset service providers.</p><p>The provisions on assets issuers and e-money tokens will apply from 12 months after entry into force, expected to be spring 2024. Other provisions of MiCA will apply from 18 months after entry into force (i.e., in the second half of&nbsp;2024).</p> Significance of the&nbsp;Rules <p>The rules will hold providers liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. All 27 EU member states need to comply with these rules from 2024&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Under these new rules, providers mean utility token issuers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens and stablecoins, providers of trading venues, and wallet services.</p><p>The aim behind introducing the regulations is to safeguard investor assets, maintain stability in the system, and allow the sector to become more attractive for its trustworthiness and innovation.</p> A Brief History of the EU Cryptocurrency Regulations <p>The attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies do not start with the introduction of MiCA. While the EU presented the MiCA proposal in September 2020, regulatory attempts toward crypto have been prevalent since&nbsp;2013.</p>  2013: The first official statements and analysis on virtual currencies came from the European Banking Authority.  2014: The EBA identified more than seventy risks arising from virtual currencies for all possible sorts of market participants. The EBA also suggested measures to deal with governance, capital requirements, and segregation of client accounts.  2016: The European Central Bank analyzed virtual currency schemes and acknowledged the potential advantages of virtual currencies despite an overall negative assessment.  2017: The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued a report on Distributed Ledger Technology and its application to Securities markets.  Early 2018: The European Parliament commissioned two reports. One was on virtual currencies and Central banks’ monetary policy. The second was on the fight against the illicit use of cryptocurrencies.  Late 2018: The Financial Stability Board released a paper on the crypto assets market and its financial stability implications.  2019: The International Monetary Fund singled out supervisory and regulatory elements to assist policymakers.  2020: It was only on 24th September that the European Commission introduced the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) proposal as part of a larger digital finance&nbsp;package.  2021: On 24th November 2021, the council adopted its negotiating mandate on&nbsp;MiCA.  2022: On 31st March, the tripartite co-legislative discussions started. The discussions ended with a provisional agreement struck on June 30th,&nbsp;2022.  2024: By July 2024, stablecoin-related provisions will come into&nbsp;effect.  2025: By this year, the remaining provisions of MiCA, other than those related to the issuance of asset-referenced tokens and e-money tokens, are anticipated to come into&nbsp;effect.  <p>The rules discussed in this article are seen as the formal adoption of the regulation.</p> What led to These new Regulations? <p>The need for crypto regulations, chronicled in the timeline above, has always been there in the Europe market. Yet, a few incidents in the global crypto market made it all the more necessary and relevant.</p><p>One of the most prominent of these incidents was the collapse of FTX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Not only did it impact the European crypto market, but it also sent shockwaves at a global level as the founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s fortune depleted from nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/18/how-did-crypto-firm-ftx-collapse">US$16 bn to zero</a> within&nbsp;days.</p><p>Another incident that made people aware of the potential risks of volatility in the crypto market was the collapse of stablecoin Terra. Within a week in 2022, the stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna collapsed, wiping out as high as nearly half a trillion USD from the crypto&nbsp;markets.</p> The New Regulations Details <p>One has to remember that nearly all of these funds lost in the incidents cited above were customer assets, either in the form of investments or deposits. In a bid to prevent such losses, the new rules hold crypto-asset service providers liable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Crypto Exchange Liable for Customer&nbsp;Losses <p>The rules want the issuers of asset-referenced tokens to have an adequate custody policy for their reserve assets to prevent loss and preserve the value of the&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The crypto-asset service providers should also be held liable for losses incurred from incidents relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Such incidents might include cyber attacks, theft, or malfunctions.</p><p>Service providers, issuers of asset-referenced tokens, and e-money tokens will also be held liable for the information they have offered in a crypto-asset white&nbsp;paper.</p> In Focus: Traceability of Crypto Assets and Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Apart from holding exchanges liable for customer losses, other key components of the regulation deal with the traceability of crypto assets, consumer protection, etc. For instance, the rules want to ensure that crypto assets stay traceable.</p><p>The council also wants its rules to create adequate arrangements for “enhanced consumer protection” and “safeguards against market manipulation and financial crime.”</p><p>The EU also wants crypto providers to share their energy consumption details. Moreover, all providers will need to have a license to issue, trade, and safeguard crypto assets, tokenized assets, and stablecoins.</p> Crypto Licensing and Non-compliance Penalties <p>Crypto service providers operating without a license will have to go through inclusion in an ESMA (European Securities and Market Authority) public registry. In this registry, these unlicensed providers will document their non-compliance.</p> Implications for Exchanges <p>The most radical step is that exchanges will be held liable for losing investors’ crypto assets. Also, in ensuring traceability, the exchanges need to ensure that they have a mechanism to trace crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>MiCA traceability requirement is not a new concept, however, as it is similar to how banks keep a trace of money transfers.</p><p>But it cannot be denied that traceability in crypto assets is a double-edged sword. While it enhances security and regulatory compliance, it also raises critical concerns about user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Although exchanges have no option but to implement traceability, as MiCA makes it mandatory, they must ensure meticulous data governance and robust encryption methods to protect user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Transparency about these practices is crucial, with users having the right to know what data is collected, its use, and protective measures in place. It is paramount to strike a balance between security, regulation, and privacy in this ever-evolving cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In case of suspicious transactions, exchanges should ensure they have appropriate blocking mechanisms in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Besides these, the exchanges will also have to declare their energy consumption details and apply for operating licenses.</p> Potential Crypto Exchange Challenges <p>Putting up a robust compliance process could always be challenging. The exchanges will have to ensure zero scopes of technological vulnerability. Additionally, they need to ensure that operations are at par with what has been committed in the whitepapers.</p> Compliance Strategies for Crypto Exchanges <p>To cope with several compliant requirements enforced under MiCA, exchanges have no options but to make operational adjustments. For instance, the rules necessitate enhanced monitoring of exchanges’ source and destination addresses.</p><p>Adhering to FATF regulations could no doubt contribute to a robust and streamlined compliance process. However, exchanges will require a Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule requirements while protecting their customers’ user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>More on Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Shyft Veriscope — The Critical Infrastructure Underpinning FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> Implications for Customers <p>The rules do not apply to P2P transfers. However, transactions above 1,000 Euros from self-hosted wallets come under their purview as and when they connect to wallets hosted by crypto asset service providers.</p> Crypto Consumer Protection <p>Authorities insist that these rules seek to reduce opportunities for intrusion into the system. Hence, hacks, breaches, and data security concerns — all could be reduced if these sets of rules are properly followed.</p> Impact on Crypto Consumer Confidence and&nbsp;Behavior <p>Enhanced consumer protection and transparency in the system would increase the sector’s attractiveness. It will improve credibility and trust, potentially resulting in improved traction and adoption of crypto in the&nbsp;country.</p> Impact on the Global Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Regulation of crypto asset exchanges would involve collecting and transferring data between different jurisdictions.</p><p>In many cases, one party would be a jurisdiction outside Europe. However, successfully completing the transaction would require exchanges in that jurisdiction to stay compliant with European regulations.</p> Global Influence of EU Crypto Regulations <p>With the EU getting its house in order, other parts of the world, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, will have to keep up with the EU regulations.</p><p>Other countries in the European region, such as Switzerland and the UK, known for their happening local crypto scene, will be impacted as well, despite not being a member of the 27-nation bloc.</p> Switzerland <p>In Switzerland’s case, given the intricate web of business relationships with the EU, Swiss crypto companies must check if MiCA or another EU rule, MiFID II, affects them, especially when dealing with certain tokens like securities.</p><p>Also, MiCA brings unique rules for “stablecoins,” requiring issuers to have an EU-based office and a special&nbsp;license.</p><p>These changes demand Swiss crypto businesses to quickly understand MiCA’s impact and determine which services they can offer from Switzerland to EU countries and what tokens need a special document, the “crypto asset whitepaper,” to be recognized in the&nbsp;EU.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p>The UK has decided on a phased regulatory approach. It might start with stablecoins and then continue with unbacked crypto assets. This strategy is set to interplay with the European Union’s Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Even though the UK is no longer an EU member, the ripple effects of MiCA regulations can’t be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>With MiCA creating a unified framework for crypto assets across the EU, UK-based companies offering crypto services in the EU will need to adapt. Compliance with MiCA, regardless of the UK’s local regulations, will become essential for firms looking to operate within the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>On the flip side, the far-reaching and comprehensive nature of MiCA may influence the UK’s phased regulatory approach. It could also serve as a potential blueprint for UK regulators, particularly when moving towards unbacked crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Asia <p>The new framework could potentially reconfigure cross-border digital asset transactions involving EU, Middle East, and Asian entities. Given the substantial number of Asian and Middle Eastern businesses and individuals engaged in crypto-related activities within the EU, the MiCA regulations could potentially impact asset flows, particularly those dealing with certain crypto assets subject to more stringent MiCA requirements.</p><p>Moreover, the increased regulatory oversight under MiCA may instigate a realignment of crypto asset flows, potentially diverting some towards jurisdictions with less stringent regulations. Crypto businesses or investors looking for a more flexible regulatory environment might consider migrating their operations or investments to territories with more lax&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The Middle East and parts of Asia, which have been comparatively less stringent in their approach to crypto regulation, could become attractive destinations for such shifts. However, this could also lead to a double-edged sword scenario where the increase in crypto activities could prompt these regions to establish more robust regulatory frameworks, echoing the rigorous standards of the EU’s&nbsp;MiCA.</p> United States <p>Major US crypto businesses, like Genesis, Gemini, and Bittrex, have had legal troubles, making others in the industry worry about the future. Big player Coinbase is now asking for clear rules for crypto companies, pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make a decision.</p><p>In contrast, the EU has been working hard to create rules that protect customers and promote new ideas in the crypto industry. Their rulebook, MiCA, provides clear instructions for companies working with crypto. This not only helps protect people using these services but also builds trust in crypto businesses. It even encourages more use of the technologies behind crypto, like blockchain.</p><p>Other countries, including the US, may look to MiCA as an example when making their rules. While the US is currently dealing with different rules from different bodies, it could learn from the EU’s clear and practical approach. It’s crucial for the US to find a balanced and flexible way to manage crypto, promoting new ideas while ensuring companies follow the&nbsp;rules.</p> The Potential Impact of MiCA Regulations on DeFi Protocols <p>The new MiCA regulations have sparked questions within the crypto community, particularly about their impact on DeFi protocols. The language of the regulations is complex, causing some debate about whether they even apply to DeFi. Some reports suggest they&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Despite this, it’s wise for funds looking to invest in decentralized finance and DeFi protocols to prepare for compliance. Even if certain decentralized activities seem unaffected by the rules, the broad scope of the regulations could still touch various aspects of DeFi operations.</p> Frequently Asked Questions: Fast Check on Everything MiCA  Q1: What is the new MiCA regulation introduced by the&nbsp;EU? <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is a new set of rules introduced by the European Union to regulate crypto assets, their issuers, and service providers. A vital component of this regulation is that it holds cryptocurrency exchanges directly accountable for customer&nbsp;losses.</p> Q2: Why has the EU introduced this regulation now? <p>The introduction of this regulation comes in response to the growing prevalence and influence of cryptocurrencies within the European economy, as well as several high-profile incidents that have led to significant customer losses. The intent is to protect investors and provide a more stable and trustworthy framework for the operation of the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> Q3: What are the implications of these regulations for crypto exchanges? <p>Crypto exchanges will now be held to higher standards of transparency, data security, and operational integrity. They will be directly accountable for any customer losses, which means they will need to ensure robust security measures and operational protocols are in&nbsp;place.</p> Q4: How will these regulations impact customers? <p>Customers stand to benefit from enhanced protection and greater reliability in the crypto sector. These regulations aim to reduce the risk of losses due to incidents like hacks, breaches, and data security concerns.</p> Q5: Do these regulations have any implications outside of the&nbsp;EU? <p>Yes, these regulations could potentially shape the global crypto industry. They could act as a blueprint for other significant players like the United States and the United Kingdom, stimulating broader acceptance of such&nbsp;rules.</p> Q6: What challenges can crypto exchanges expect as a result of these regulations? <p>Compliance with these regulations will be a significant challenge for crypto exchanges. They will need to ensure they have zero technological vulnerabilities and that their operations are in line with commitments made in their whitepapers. They will also need to apply for operating licenses and declare their energy consumption details.</p> Q7: How will these regulations impact the future of the crypto industry? <p>The regulations represent a significant step in the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. By striking a balance between protecting investor interests and fostering innovation, these rules could shape the future trajectory of the crypto industry not just in the EU but worldwide.</p> Looking Ahead: The Future of EU and Global Crypto Regulation <p>As the landscape of cryptocurrency continues to evolve, the trajectory of these new regulations remains to be fully discerned. If judiciously implemented and navigated with an understanding of their subtleties, these rules could potentially set a regulatory precedent for the rest of the world to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>The task ahead for the EU is multifold: it must diligently safeguard investor interests and curb potential misuse of funds. At the same time, it carries the responsibility to ensure that regulatory frameworks do not stifle innovation but instead foster growth in this rapidly advancing, technology-driven field of cryptocurrencies. The delicate balance between regulation and innovation will define the future of the crypto industry not just in Europe but globally.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency-5c0778bb11c1">MiCA Paving the Way: From Liability to Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Philipp Krüger gave a presentation on WNFS, or Webnative File System, at IPFS Thing 2023 in Brussels, Belgium. In his presentation, he gave a comprehensive yet approachable breakdown of how we constructed our versioned and encrypted file system built on top of IPFS.</p><p>When Fission set out to create an encrypted file system that would respect user agency, it needed to meet three criteria: </p>  Users would be able to take their data with them anywhere and control who had access to it  It would be available both online and offline, ensuring access no matter the user's level of connectivity  It could be shared on different devices and types of apps (for example, you could share your data on a music app on your mobile phone and a photo app on your desktop)  <p>Developers are used to running a server to hold user data when publishing an app online. During the prototyping process, dummy data is often stored in the browser. We realized that if we made the browser capable of running production data, it would ensure the data was local-first and private (because the data would never have to leave the device itself).</p> Our Frenemy, The Browser <p>So we began working with the browser to make this a reality. The first step was working with the WebCrypto API, which makes non-extractable key pairs possible. In addition, we wanted to ensure revocability, so we created asymmetric key pairs per app/device. </p> Access Control <p>Once decrypted, data is readable in the hostile browser environment. Therefore, we needed to give not just access control but fine-grained access control. We go by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">Principle of Least Authority (POLA)</a> to ensure the user only shares what they want to share.</p><p>To do this, we encrypt all of the files. However, all those keys can be difficult to manage, so we use the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">skip ratchet</a> (our CTO Brooklyn's invention!) to organize them. This also gives us temporal and snapshot access control. </p>Source: Philipp KrügerSource: Philipp Krüger Data Persistence and Key Recovery <p>The browser may delete local storage, so data persistence and key recovery are two important considerations. </p><p>We use IPFS to persist encrypted data outside of the browser. IPFS also has a garbage collection feature, so to be absolutely sure that data is not deleted, the user may want to store their data on a machine they keep online (i.e., their own personal node) or utilize a pinning service. Fission does not run a pinning service, but we currently persist all user file systems for free.</p><p>Key recovery can be handled by linking a device with more reliable permanent storage for your secret keys (this can be done using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE</a> protocol). Another option is to download a recovery kit from the dashboard app (or, in the future, from any app that supports something like it).</p> Concurrent Writes <p>A file system should have concurrent writes so editing can occur offline and multiple authorized users can edit without issue. We achieve this using a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p><p>But what if two valid writes need to be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? WNFS will merge them both by creating a directory that has both changes while also linking back to the previous data (using CRDTs) so nothing gets deleted. Then we leave it up to each app developer to determine how they want to query the history in the API and figure out how to do app-specific merges.</p>Source: Philipp Krüger Privacy &amp; Security <p>Previously we explained that it is important for users to have fine-grained access control because it supports user agency and resolves the issue of decrypted data in the browser. </p><p>When the user does share data with someone else, whether it's an individual or an app, this action should reveal as little metadata as possible. That's why we verify valid writes without read access (using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>), scramble the file hierarchy, create a flat namespace (using the CRDT structure), and split files into chunks so no one can distinguish file size.</p> Getting Started <p>The Rust 🦀 implementation of WNFS (<a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">rs-wnfs</a>) is available now.</p><p>You can also join our <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">working group</a> and attend the monthly community calls or view the <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmaps/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmaps%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">project's roadmap</a> to track our progress, get involved, and learn about upcoming features.</p>

               <p>Consumer trends and why fashion industries are changing their brand position</p>
<p>There’s been a huge shift in the way consumers demand Transparency when it comes to ethical sourced and sustainable fashion. It’s fascinating to see that more people are paving the way to more openness and demanding more eco-friendly manufactured clothing. Fast and wasteful fashion is no more! </p>
<p>When increasingly more people are changing the way they consume and behave, the fashion industry has to advance as well. Therefore we see a shift in how production is changing back to locally produced goods, true sustainability, more focus on fairly paid workers and distributed companies. </p>
 
 
 
 
 
          <p>The devastating impact on our environment </p>
<p>The use of toxic dyes, pesticides, the tremendous waste of natural resources, farming, harvesting, processing, manufacturing and the transportation for mass production all over the world is really having a devastating impact. The extravagant usage and waste of water that is needed for production is completely irresponsible.</p>
<p>The UNISOT SaaS solution can therefore be used to prove and provide honest information, that guarantees that the company is preventing waste and unethical practices, thus enabling customers to make even more sustainable and environmentally friendly choices.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         <p>Digital Twins in Blockchain, Web3 and Federated Learning in Fashion </p>
<p>Due to the intrinsic nature of public blockchain technology supply chains will become more transparent. This brings about a whole new level of incentives for companies and how they will do business.</p>
<p>With public blockchain technology we can create a link between the physical object and a digital one: a digital twin is created. This link is used to create a Digital Product Passport to state the origin of the actual product; blocking any attempts of counterfeit or diversion. Each action in the supply chain is recorded and due to the distributed nature of public blockchain technology no stored data can be altered, destroyed or diverted. Furthermore, UNISOT’s Digital Twins functionality enables Digital Threads and full product life cycle feedback.</p>
<p>All kinds of exciting technologies are slipping into fashion industry, and garment companies are progressively changing into tech companies. &nbsp;UNISOT applications combined with IoT technologies, Web3 and Federated Learning can make a big change in how the Fashion Industry goes forward – in real time – for each node in the supply chain.</p>
 Let´s change the fashion industry together!

Key points: 
<br> 
<br> 
  
  Most fentanyl trafficked into the United States is manufactured using precursors imported from Chinese suppliers.<br><br>  
  Elliptic researchers received offers from more than 90 China-based companies to supply fentanyl precursors, 90% of which accepted cryptocurrency payments. Many mentioned that they have shipped the same chemicals to Mexico.<br><br>  
  Many of these businesses were also willing to supply fentanyl itself, despite this being banned in China since 2019.<br><br>  
  Elliptic’s blockchain analysis shows that the cryptocurrency wallets used by these companies have received thousands of payments, totaling just over $27 million, and that the number of transactions has increased by 450% year-on-year. $27 million would purchase enough precursor to produce fentanyl pills with a street value of approximately $54 billion.<br><br>  
  Analysis of blockchain transactions also shows that a known fentanyl trafficker paid tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin to one of these suppliers.&nbsp;<br><br>  
  
Fentanyl overdoses are now the leading cause of death for those aged 18-45 in the United States. Cheaper to produce than heroin and 50 times more potent, this synthetic opioid has fueled an epidemic over the past decade, as well as becoming a huge source of profits for international drug cartels. 
<br> 
<p><br>For many years, China was the main source of illicit fentanyl. But in 2019 following intense diplomatic pressure from the US, the Chinese government regulated the drug – effectively banning its export.</p> 
<p>However, far from stemming the tide, illicit fentanyl imports into the US have soared. That’s because Mexican drug cartels have stepped in to fill the void and seize the market – manufacturing their own fentanyl using precursors (chemical ingredients) imported from China.&nbsp;<br><br>The US government has placed increasing emphasis on disrupting the financial activity of fentanyl traffickers and their supply networks. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-strengthened-approach-to-crack-down-on-illicit-fentanyl-supply-chains/">fact sheet</a> published on April 11th, the White House indicated that it intends to “expand its efforts to disrupt the illicit financial activities that fund these criminals by increasing accountability measures, including financial sanctions”.&nbsp;<br><br>Three days later, on April 14th, the US Department of the Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1413">sanctioned</a> several individuals and businesses in China for supplying precursor chemicals to drug cartels in Mexico for the production of fentanyl intended for the US market. The sanctions also listed cryptocurrency wallets used by these businesses to receive payments.&nbsp;<br><br>The Elliptic research team identified more than 90 China-based chemical companies that were willing to supply fentanyl precursors, and that are offering cryptocurrency as a payment method.</p> 
<p>Our researchers received offers to supply large quantities of one particular fentanyl precursor. This chemical is not used in the manufacture of any other products, and is a controlled substance in most countries. However, it remains unregulated in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every day, people encounter multiple obstacles while traveling to their intended destinations. Sitting in traffic, waiting for the bus to arrive 15 minutes later than scheduled, driving around for 30 minutes to find a parking spot—the modern world is full of inconveniences due to underlying inefficiencies in our transportation systems.</p>



<p>However, stalled cars and harried people waiting for public transportation aren’t just an individual nuisance. A less-than-optimal transportation infrastructure affects the economy, hastens environmental impact and lowers the overall quality of living. Making transportation work quicker and for more people keeps city planners up at night.</p>



<p>The good news is that new technologies and approaches to transportation management systems allow us to start addressing these inconveniences and make other downstream transportation improvements. The solution is smart transportation.</p>



<p>The rise of interconnected technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), electric vehicles, geolocation and mobile technology have made it possible to orchestrate how people and goods flow from one place to another, especially in densely-packed urban areas.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/smart-cities-digital-solutions-for-a-more-livable-future">Several global cities</a>, including London, Paris, Amsterdam and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/business/ibm-takes-smarter-cities-concept-to-rio-de-janeiro.html">Rio De Janeiro</a>, have invested in smart transportation as a key component of their smart-city initiatives. There are now universities that study smart transportation use cases (e.g., <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cee/prospective/graduate-degree/masters/ms-concentrations/smart-transportation-mobility.html">Carnegie Mellon</a>, <a href="https://c2smart.engineering.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, <a href="https://catalog.njit.edu/graduate/newark-college-engineering/civil-environmental/intelligent-transportation-systems-cert/">NJIT</a> and many more). The whole world, it seems, is fixated on solving transportation issues and increasing mobility because it produces so many benefits for citizens and the economy.</p>



 The rise of smart cities 



<p>Many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/22/songdo-south-korea-world-first-smart-city-in-pictures">cities</a> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uncovering-the-early-history-of-big-data-in-1974-los-an-1712551686">claim</a> <a href="https://citymonitor.ai/community/how-london-became-first-smart-city-back-1854-2447">to be</a> the first “smart city” in the world. While one can debate what exactly turns a mere city into a smart one, there’s no denying that the rise of the Internet and mobile technology has generated widespread interest in building the next generation of smart cities.</p>



<p>Every time a city improves upon its existing structures to incorporate more data-driven or connected technologies, it becomes more intelligent. Examples of smart-city enhancements beyond smart transportation include sensors to monitor air quality and temperature fluctuations, IoT technology in public buildings to conserve energy and data-driven waste pick-up management. But the crown jewel of any smart city is how smart transportation can revolutionize how cities operate and how people move within them.</p>



 A smart transportation overview 



<p>Also known as smart mobility, the rise of ubiquitous data collection and automation has led local governments to embrace smart transportation. It is made possible by the fact that virtually every citizen and commuter has a smartphone that can transmit and receive messages and data.</p>



<p>In addition, it’s never been easier and cheaper to create public Wi-Fi networks, creating many new opportunities for governments can implement smart transportation initiatives.</p>



<p>Smart transportation usually includes public-private partnerships that can positively affect several issues with transportation, such as pollution deriving from car emissions, congestion and the importance of public transportation to the needy and elderly.</p>



<p>Several smart transportation solutions have existed for some time—for example, a city department of transportation providing real-time arrival data of buses and trains, electronic toll collection, bike sharing, dynamic pricing on cars entering the city and public transportation smart cards. But several disparate technologies do not make an intelligent transportation system. It requires a comprehensive strategy and multiple smart technologies working in tandem.</p>



<p>Smart transportation helps better allocate resources so cities can do more with less and avoid unnecessary energy consumption and resource costs.</p>



<p>Cities and states prioritizing smart transportation provide a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/public-sector/transportation-equity.html">more inclusive and equitable</a> living experience for all of their citizens.</p>



 Smart transportation benefits governments and citizens alike 



<p>The following are some examples of smart transportation and how they can benefit a city:</p>



 Parking 



<p>Every driver has had the experience of searching for parking for 30 minutes or more, convinced that every open spot is filled right before they get to it. It’s a vexing problem that has an obvious solution: adding sensors to parking spots. That way, drivers can find an open spot ahead of time and use their smartphones and/or dashboard consoles to go directly to the spot, instead of aimlessly wandering.</p>



 Intelligent transportation networks 



<p>Many local and national transportation departments are now broadcasting real-time mass transit schedule updates and maintenance interruptions through centralized control systems. Citizens and commuters can access this information on their smartphones, tablets and computers through applications, social media or browsers, but that should just be table stakes.</p>



<p>The next generation of smart transportation systems will be able to communicate when parts on trains or buses are likely to fail, allowing operators to take fleet vehicles out of service to fix them before they break down with passengers on board. Investing in transportation networks also includes the building of high-speed rails that can transport more people from destination to destination, ameliorating traffic and the environmental impact of individuals driving cars.</p>



 Better traffic management 



<p>Traffic congestion results from many separate issues, such as vehicle accidents, rigid traffic grids, poor weather, population growth and substandard infrastructure. While each has a fix (of varying levels of complexity), smart transportation can address them all:</p>



 
 Vehicle accidents: Connected vehicles with sensors can prevent accidents from occurring, often before the driver even knows something bad is about to happen. 



 Traffic control: Historically, traffic lights changed based on pre-determined time windows regardless of any unforeseen impacts. While the time windows for traffic signals to change may differ during different times of day (e.g., to account for rush hour on a busy street), they rarely change based on the specific flow of traffic. In the rare major metropolitan areas where traffic light times can change based on that data, it’s usually done manually by human intervention. The future of traffic management involves smart traffic lights connected to real-time traffic flow data that incorporates <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> that can change lights at intersections based on thousands of variables. 



 Real-time information on road conditions and accidents: Like traffic, road conditions can create bottlenecks in travel patterns. While map applications accessible on smartphones increasingly provide real-time updates on traffic conditions, they’re often provided by citizen reporting. Public-private partnerships can boost this information by investing in <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/5-tech-tools-governments-can-use-to-alleviate-traffic-troubles.html">vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)</a> and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology so that every car provides information automatically, identifying issues before they create traffic jams. 
 



 Smart public transportation 



<p>How many job seekers have lost out on the job of their dreams because of backed-up or stalled trains? How quickly do printed schedules on the bus stop become irrelevant every day? In every city, thousands to millions of people depend on public transportation daily; they are lifelines to the elderly, frontline workers and people with disabilities. It makes a world of difference when cities can connect those critical vehicles to a smart grid to ensure that citizens have real-time information about when bus services and other forms of public transit will pick them up and take them where they need to go.</p>



 Support for electric vehicles 



<p>Leaders who want to make their cities hospitable and attract electric car drivers must install electric charging stations in high-traffic areas, where drivers can stop for a bit and walk around or get some food while the car charges. Not only does that provide a service to the driver, but it also helps area businesses capture some new business. The important thing to remember about smart transportation is you’re also building for the future. While autonomous vehicles are not ready for mass deployment yet, many expect they will become a reality in the future. So any meaningful smart transportation plans have plans for future proofing as vehicle technologies expand how we can move around without human intervention.</p>



 IBM Maximo is helping advance the journey to smart transportation 



<p>Virtually every major city has incorporated some smart transportation technologies into their overall offering to citizens and commuters, but now is the time to establish a holistic smart transportation strategy that helps people get to their destination quicker, more safely and with less environmental impact. As the hybrid work movement enables more employees to work in a city of their choosing, the local governments that offer a truly smart city with a comprehensive smart transportation system will be able to attract more residents at the expense of those cities that fail to adapt.</p>



<p>The good news is that solutions now exist to help governments create a more comprehensive smart transportation framework that uses a full suite of solutions for operations, maintenance, monitoring, quality and reliability. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo</a> helps metro services serving 4.7 billion riders, 73% of the busiest airports and 75% of the largest automotive companies transform the intelligence of their systems to improve customer satisfaction and increase efficiency.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> is a fully managed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing">serverless</a> platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, microservices, event-driven functions or batch jobs. Code Engine even builds container images for you from your source code.</p>



<p>All these workloads can seamlessly work together because they are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure. The Code Engine experience is designed so that you could focus on writing code and not worry about the infrastructure that is needed to host it.</p>



 Prerequisites 



 
 Appropriate permissions to use the IBM Cloud Code Engine service. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-iam">See here for how to manage these.</a> 



 An application running on IBM Cloud Code Engine. You can deploy the test application from <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-getting-started#app-hello">here</a>. 



 Access to modify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> of a public domain/hostname. If you own a domain or purchased one, you will most likely have access to manage DNS for that domain. In the example, we have used <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis">IBM Cloud Internet Services</a> that support CNAME flattening feature to enable us to use root domain. 



 A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#SSL_1.0,_2.0,_and_3.0">SSL</a> certificate signed by a public certificate authority. 
 



<p>In this example, the test application is deployed on IBM Cloud Code Engine. The original hostname looks something similar to this https://application-27.zx67dfvbl7l.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/. We’ll expose this application using two custom domains:</p>



 
 https://example.org 



 https://codeengine.example.org 
 



 Step-by-step instructions 



<p>Refer this <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-domain-mappings">document</a> and the below steps to create the TLS certificates for both domains and use them to expose this test application. You can use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt CA</a> as an example to request TLS certificates for these custom domains. However, you can also use a TLS certificate from any of the public certificate authorities.</p>



<p>We’ll follow these steps to accomplish our goals:</p>



 
 Generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request">CSR</a> for TLS certificate and get it signed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">CA</a>. 



 Add your domain to Code Engine application UI. 



 Create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME</a> record in DNS for your domain name. 
 



 1. Generate CSR for TLS certificate and get it signed from CA 



 
  
<p>To generate a valid signed TLS certificate from Let’s Encrypt CA, you can use the Certbot client to generate the CSR and get it signed from CA. First, you need to install the Certbot using <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&amp;os=ubuntufocal">these instructions</a>.</p>



<p>Use the following command to start the process for the certificate generation:</p>



 <code>certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email contact@example.org --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --domain codeengine.example.org

certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email contact@example.org --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --domain example.org</code> 
  



<p>Then, it should ask you for the domain ownership verification step:</p>



 <code>root@jumpbox:~# certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email contact@example.org --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos --domain codeengine.example.org
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
Requesting a certificate for codeengine.example.org

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.codeengine.example.org

with the following value:

Fq2wbN9mUSfnWZkGXyaEgVaOm-_9RB4cv4zJEp44Sbg

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.codeengine.example.org.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Press Enter to Continue</code> 



<p>Let’s add the verification TXT records for both domains in the DNS as per the below:</p>



 <code>codeengine.example.org	TXT	Fq2wbN9mUSfnWZkGXyaEgVaOm-_9RB4cv4zJEp44Sbg

example.org		TXT	DfjSDFFDbN9vccdSDnjnkSNSNKx-_9vccdSDnZvccdSDn</code> 



<p>Now, you need to create a TXT record with the above value in your domain’s DNS servers. The DNS servers for your domain might have been provided by your domain registrar or these can be hosted somewhere else. After you add this DNS record, you can verify it using <code>dig</code> or <code>nslookup</code>:</p>



 <code>% dig txt _acme-challenge.codeengine.example.org. +short
"Fq2wbN9mUSfnWZkGXyaEgVaOm-_9RB4cv4zJEp44Sbg"</code> 



<p>After you press Enter or Return, you should see something like the following:</p>



 <code>Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:        /etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2023-07-20.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:
 * Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
 * Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
</code> 



<p>You got two files:</p>



 <code><code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/fullchain.pem</code></code> 



 
 This is your TLS certificate with full root-ca chain certificates. The contents should be something like this: 
 



 <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFNDCCBBygAwIBAgISBOLyU
------
------
------
cRQJMEhg76fsO3txE+FiYruq9RUWhiF1myv4Q6W+CyBFC
Dfvp7OOGAN6dEOM4+qR9sdjoSYKEBpsr6GtPAQw4dy753ec5
-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code> 



<p><code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/codeengine.example.org/privkey.pem</code></p>



 
 This is the private key for your TLS certificate. The content of the private key file should be something like the following: 
 



 <code>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvwIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEF
------
------
------
BAZQ4dZS/TXFRMQcgNL3nWGk42YSOYAjqJNceX6rQMSoxDiCdb6e+
+pT6jcKsENz88M3dpNQNi1OSUQ==
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</code> 



 2. Add your domain to Code Engine application UI 



<p>Since you have TLS certificate and key available, you can now proceed to add the custom domain to the IBM Cloud Code Engine application from the IBM Cloud console.</p>



 
 Go <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects/">here</a> and follow Projects &gt; Your project name &gt; Applications &gt; Application name &gt; Domain mappings tab 



 Select the application for which you want to use a custom domain. 



 Select Domain mappings from the top bar menu. 



 Here, you need to click on the blue button named Create under the section titled Custom domain mappings. 



 A new setup wizard should open like the screenshot above. You need to paste the contents from the file fullchain.pem in the text box titled Certificate chain and file privkey.pem to the text box titled Private key. 



 Under the section titled Domain name and target application, type the actual custom domain hostname:
 
 Domain name: Type “example.org” in this editable text field. 



 CNAME Target: Pref-filled text should be there, which we need to create a CNAME record for this domain name. 
 
 
 



 <code>example.org			CNAME	custom.zx67dfvbl7l.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud

codeengine.example.org	CNAME	custom. zx67dfvbl7l.us-south.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
</code> 



 3. Create a CNAME record in DNS for your domain name 
 



<p>This is an important step. Let’s create a CNAME record in your domain’s DNS servers pointing to the value from the CNAME target box.</p>



<p>After you have created the CNAME record, proceed by selecting the Create button to finish creating the custom domain name mapping. This should take few minutes to be fully activated in the system.</p>



<p>If you want to use your root domain (example.org) instead of a subdomain like codeengine.example.org, you may want to use the CNAME flattening feature of IBM Cloud Internet Services. For more details refer to the links below.</p>

 <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started">Getting started with IBM Cloud Internet Services</a> 
 



<p>If everything goes fine, you should be able to access your application using your custom domain:</p>



 <code>% curl -k https://example.org 
Hello World from:
. ___  __  ____  ____
./ __)/  \(    \(  __)
( (__(  O )) D ( ) _)

<p>GDPR and VASPs: Lessons Learned from Meta’s Historic Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>In light of the recent historic 1.2 billion euro fine levied against Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) worldwide should take heed. The unprecedented penalty, the highest ever under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), sends a strong message about the EU’s commitment to data protection and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Facebook’s Record Fine Sends a Strong Signal to VASPs: EU Regulations and Compliance are Crucial</p></blockquote><p>Reason Behind Facebook’s Fine&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meta’s predicament stemmed from its systemic transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) since 16 July 2020. The GDPR requires an adequate level of protection for data transferred outside the EU, and Meta’s data handling practices were deemed non-compliant, leading to the severe fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key Aspects of GDPR&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GDPR is a comprehensive legislation aimed at protecting the data and privacy of EU citizens. Key principles that organizations should adhere to include:&nbsp;</p>



  Data Minimization: Processing only the necessary amount of data for a specific purpose.&nbsp; 



 Purpose Limitation: Ensuring that data is only used for a clearly stated and legitimate purpose.&nbsp; 



 Accuracy: Maintaining up-to-date and correct data, and promptly correcting or deleting any inaccuracies.&nbsp; 
   Storage Limitation: Storing data for no longer than necessary and in a way that permits identification of data subjects.&nbsp; 
 <p>Beyond MiCA: Other Regulatory Considerations for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the recent MiCA regulation is an important consideration for VASPs planning to operate in the EU, it isn’t the only regulatory framework they need to abide by. GDPR compliance is equally crucial, and overlooking this can lead to serious penalties, as seen in Meta’s case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR Essentials for VASPs&nbsp;</p>



<p>To stay compliant with GDPR, VASPs should:&nbsp;</p>



  Understand and apply GDPR principles in their data handling practices.&nbsp; 



 Keep track of where and how they store and transfer data.&nbsp; 



 Implement security measures to protect data.&nbsp; 
   Be transparent with users about data collection, use, and storage.&nbsp; 



 Choosing the Right Partners for GDPR Compliance&nbsp; 
 <p>A critical part of maintaining GDPR compliance is choosing the right partners. When it comes to data protection and storage, partnering with companies that understand the complexities of GDPR and have a robust data security infrastructure is essential. Coinfirm, an EU-based firm, ticks all these boxes. Coinfirm’s servers are located within the EU, ensuring GDPR compliance and providing VASPs with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinfirm, Your Partner in Compliance&nbsp;</p>



<p>The substantial fine against Meta serves as a warning signal to VASPs: data protection isn’t just a legal requirement, it’s an integral part of responsible business practices. While the regulatory landscape may seem daunting, Coinfirm is here to help. As a GDPR-compliant partner, Coinfirm is not only equipped to provide clear, actionable<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics services, but also to guide VASPs through the complexities of operating within the EU. With Coinfirm, VASPs can confidently navigate the intricacies of GDPR, safeguarding their operations while respecting user privacy.&nbsp;</p>

All transactions in the chain are immutable so they cannot be tampered with and are distributed to all nodes in the distributed ledger. However, DCI does not require blockchain or other DLTs to function - more on that later. Now let’s break all this down a bit further.&nbsp;</p>

This detailed information can help lenders calculate income faster and more precisely to improve loan quality, simplify the mortgage process and, most importantly, expand access to credit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Over the last year, we’ve consistently rolled out innovations to ensure our digital tools are improving speed and efficiency, reducing risk and, ultimately, helping us serve our mission by reaching more qualified borrowers. Today’s innovation further automates income assessment by using historical direct deposit pay patterns and current gross income from recent paystubs, which can help more families achieve homeownership.”</p>
Kevin Kauffman, Single-Family Vice President of Seller Engagement at Freddie Mac.</blockquote>



<p>This new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023. Finicity, a Mastercard Company, is the initial service provider supporting Freddie Mac’s AIM for income using direct deposits plus paystub.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 9th May to 21st&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of crypto regulatory news from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Crypto regulatory developments are often a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, as we saw during and the last two weeks were no exception.</p><p>The EU cleared the path with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), marking a significant stride in cryptocurrency regulations. Meanwhile, South Korea has been emboldened to take decisive actions amidst political scandals, stepping up their crypto regulation game.</p><p>In the United States, the landscape continues to evolve, shaped by rigorous debates over the clarity of digital asset rules and who holds the reins over “stablecoins.”</p><p>So without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Crypto Regulation Rundown: The Balance Between Safety and Innovation Across EU, US, and South&nbsp;Korea <p>The European Union (EU) is making major strides, unanimously approving a new law known as the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). With MiCA, the EU aims to offer clear guidelines for people in the crypto market, providing a safety net for everyone involved.</p><p>But it’s not all rosy. The demands from crypto wallet providers and exchanges are high and might put a damper on new and creative&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Meanwhile, over in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking heat. The issue? They aren’t being clear about their digital asset rules. Leading the protest is the United States Chamber of Commerce and Coinbase, a giant in the crypto world. They worry that this ambiguity could hurt the digital economy and hinder its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>On the other side of the globe, South Korea is taking decisive action. Prompted by some scandals involving cryptocurrencies, they’ve put their stamp of approval on a new crypto regulation bill. This sudden move showcases the urgency for a legal framework around digital asset trading. The heart of this bill is about making things clearer and more responsible in South Korea’s expanding crypto&nbsp;scene.</p><p>Back to the United States, a fascinating debate unfolds around “stablecoins.” The bone of contention here is who should be in control: the states or the federal government? Both sides have distinct views, but there’s a shared understanding that stablecoins are part of our future. And most agree that the U.S. should make the rules so businesses don’t move&nbsp;away.</p><p>Across the globe, the chorus is growing for clear, easy-to-follow rules in the world of cryptocurrency. We need protections for those in the digital asset market, but it’s also vital to encourage fresh ideas and industry growth. How well these new rules can strike this balance will be the key to their&nbsp;success.</p> Decoding the EU’s New Crypto Rules: Mica’s Impact and&nbsp;Insights <p>The European Union (EU) has taken a significant step towards comprehensive cryptocurrency regulation with the unanimous approval of the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation.</p><p>This development comes after the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, comprised of finance ministers from all EU member states, voted in favor of the MiCA bill and amendments to related regulations and directives.</p><p>Earlier in April, the European Parliament endorsed an unprecedented set of regulations for the crypto industry, adding weight to the MiCA legislation.</p><p>With an overwhelming majority of the members voting in favor, this initiative’s primary aim is to protect consumers from potential risks linked with crypto assets and ensure providers can be held accountable for any loss of investors’ assets. This regulatory effort signifies an important shift in the EU’s approach to crypto asset management and the broader financial industry’s future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/InbarPreiss/status/1658453533463592962?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>In line with the MiCA approval, the European Parliament greenlighted two additional pieces of legislation, further contributing to the detailed regulatory framework. These supplementary rules aim to regulate the information accompanying fund transfers and certain crypto assets, emphasizing transparency and accountability across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>One key provision of the MiCA regulation is that crypto platforms are now obliged to provide clear and comprehensive information regarding the risks associated with their services.</p><p>Though this is a win for consumers’ trust, the stringent licensing prerequisites for crypto wallet providers and exchanges could impact the pace of innovation and competition.</p><p>Another impactful aspect is the requirement for stablecoin issuers to hold substantial reserves. This protective measure can safeguard the market from potential shocks but also introduces a cap on the daily transactions of larger stablecoins, which could influence their&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The overall picture painted by these legislative measures is of a cautious yet forward-thinking EU seeking a balanced approach to harnessing the benefits of crypto assets while mitigating associated risks.</p> South Korea Takes Lead in Cryptocurrency Regulations Amid&nbsp;Scandal <p>South Korea’s National Policy Committee took a bold step forward by approving a landmark cryptocurrency regulation bill, the first of its kind in the nation’s&nbsp;history.</p><p>This action is a direct response to a controversy involving a high-profile opposition lawmaker, who has been accused of heavy cryptocurrency speculation. Now consolidated from 19 similar drafts, the bill is headed for the Legislation and Judiciary Committee, where it will face a thorough&nbsp;review.</p><p>According to legislators, this bill aims to protect digital asset investors, thwart unfair cryptocurrency trading, and establish a reliable framework for trading stablecoins. And in a significant move, it empowers the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s premier financial regulator, to oversee cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Although the current bill is primarily centered around investor protection and fair trade, a separate bill focused on the intricacies of initial coin offerings, public disclosures, and market regulations is still under committee review.</p><p>Fueling the swift bipartisan support for the cryptocurrency regulation bill is the scandal involving Representative Kim Nam-kuk, who allegedly dabbled in sizeable speculative investments in various cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The disclosure of his extensive digital asset holdings has sparked a call for increased transparency, compelling both political parties to draft legislation that mandates lawmakers and public officials to disclose their cryptocurrency assets.</p><p>This shift in policy brings South Korea closer to the regulatory standards of the US and EU, where comparable disclosure laws were established in 2018 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>The legislation will undoubtedly profoundly impact the South Korean cryptocurrency ecosystem, offering a host of benefits and presenting certain challenges. Investors stand to gain from improved protection measures, thus fostering a safer environment in the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>The law also takes aim at unfair trading practices and establishes a robust structure for trading stablecoins, which could increase public confidence in and participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>However, stricter regulatory oversight may hinder the pace of innovation and deter potential new entrants to the crypto market. On top of that, the new legislation also could infringe on the privacy of lawmakers and public officials who will be obligated to disclose their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-the-regulated-road-ahead">The Shyft Perspective — Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate: the Regulated Road&nbsp;Ahead</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658156397253603334?s=20">Why Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1658850243381796868?s=20">What is Shyft&nbsp;Network?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1659578665284321280?s=20">Key Elements of Shyft&nbsp;Network</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Site-to-site <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">Virtual Private Network</a> (VPN) has been used to connect distributed networks for decades. This post describes how to use a <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn">VPC VPN Gateway</a> to connect an on-premises (enterprise) network to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpc">IBM Cloud VPC</a> in a transit hub-and-spoke architecture:</p>



VPN Gateway connectivity to a VPC transit hub and spoke.



<p>Each spoke can be operated by a different business unit or team. The team can allow enterprise access to VPC resources like Virtual Service Instances running applications or <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc_rh_tutorial">VPC RedHat OpenShift IBM Cloud clusters</a>. Private enterprise access to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpe-supported-services">VPE-enabled services</a>, like databases, is also possible through the VPN gateway. With this method, you can enjoy the ease of use and elasticity of cloud resources and pay for just what you need by accessing the resources securely over VPN.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-transit1">Centralize communication through a VPC Transit Hub and Spoke architecture</a> tutorial was published a few months ago. The companion <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/vpc-transit">GitHub repository</a> was modified to optionally support a <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-overview">policy-mode VPC VPN gateway</a> to replace the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/direct-link">IBM Direct Link</a> simulation.</p>



 Multi-zone region (MZR) design 



<p>The transit hub design integrates with IBM multi-zone regions (MZRs), and the VPN Gateways are zone-specific. After some careful study, the zonal architecture shown below was implemented. It shows only two zones but can be expanded to three:</p>



VPN Gateway zonal connectivity.



<p>Notes:</p>



 
 A VPN Gateway is connected to each zone. Enterprise CIDR blocks are connected to a specific cloud zone VPN Gateway. Notice the enterprise CIDR block is narrow:192.168.0.0/24. The cloud CIDR block is broad, covering the entire cloud (all VPCs and all zones): 10.0.0.0/8. 



 A VPC Address Prefix representing the enterprise zone is added to the transit VPC. See how <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-transit1#vpc-transit-vpc-address-prefixes">phantom address prefix</a> allow the spokes to route traffic to the enterprise in the tutorial. 



 A VPC ingress route table is added to the transit VPC as described in this <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-policy-based-ingress-routing-integration-example">example</a>. It will automatically route all ingress traffic from the spokes heading to the enterprise through the VPN gateway appliances. 
 



<p>Follow the steps in the companion <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/vpc-transit">GitHub repository</a> in the TLDR section. When editing the <code>config_tf/terraform.tfvars file</code>, make sure the following variables are configured:</p>



<p><code>config_tf/terraform.tfvars</code>:</p>



 <code>enterprise_phantom_address_prefixes_in_transit = true
vpn = true
firewall = false</code> 



<p>Also consider setting make_redis = true to allow provisioning Redis instances for the transit and spoke with associated <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe">Virtual Private Endpoint Gateway</a> connections. If configured, even the private Redis instance in the spoke can be accessed from the enterprise. The details of private DNS configuration and forwarding are covered in <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vpc-transit2#vpc-transit2-VPE">this section of part 2 of the tutorial</a>.</p>



<p>When all of the layers have been applied, run the tests (see special notes in the GitHub repository README.md on configuring Python if needed). All the tests should pass:</p>



 <code>python install -r requirements.txt
pytest</code> 



 A note on enterprise-to-transit cross-zone routing 



<p>The initial design worked well for enterprise &lt;&gt; spokes. The enterprise &lt;&gt; transit within the same zone also worked. But additional configuration is required to resolve enterprise &lt;&gt; transit cross-zone routing failures:</p>



VPN Gateway cross-zone routing.



<p>Without the additional cross-zone VPN Gateway Connections, there were no return VPC route table entries in the default route table in the transit VPC to the cross-zone enterprise (see the red line). The VPN Gateway Connections automatically add routes to the default route table in the transit VPC but only in the zones containing the VPN Gateway. In the diagram above, the worker 10.2.0.4 had no route to return to 192.168.0.4.</p>



<p>The extra cross-zone connections for the transit VPC zones resolved this issue, as shown by the blue line.</p>



 Conclusions 



<p>Site-to-site VPN might be just the technology you need to connect your enterprise to the IBM Cloud VPC in a multi-zone region. Using the steps described in this post, you can minimize the number of VPN Gateways required to fully connect the enterprise to the cloud. Enjoy the private connectivity to VPC resources like Virtual Server Instances and resources from the catalog that can be accessed through a Virtual Private Endpoint Gateway.</p>

<p>IBM is pleased to announce the availability of WebSphere Liberty InstantOn coming at the end of June 2023. With this new offering, you can start cloud-native Java applications up to 10x faster.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-liberty">IBM WebSphere Liberty</a> is a next-generation application runtime that accelerates the delivery of cloud-native applications. Whether you’re running microservices in a serverless environment or a traditional always-on application, Liberty requires less infrastructure, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-51239">saving costs by up to 40%</a>, and provides the flexibility your organization needs to deploy on any cloud in a trusted, secure and open environment. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-51239">Liberty increases developer productivity by up 50%</a>, empowering application teams to continuously deliver code that delights end users.&nbsp;</p>



 What is InstantOn? 



<p>InstantOn, a new feature within <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-liberty">IBM WebSphere Liberty</a>, enables you to take full advantage of cloud infrastructure with fast and dynamic start-up—without inheriting compromises commonly found when compiling your code to native images. InstantOn will allow you to easily adopt serverless practices while enabling you to do the following:</p>



 
 Respond faster to ever-changing workload demands. 



 Improve sustainability and reduce costs by dynamically adjusting infrastructure to demand. 



 Facilitate innovation through modern application architectures and serverless. 
 



 Why serverless? 



<p>Businesses today need a significant return on investment and require constant control of costs. In an on-premises data center, this has traditionally meant estimating peak demand and deploying sufficient infrastructure to meet that demand. If your business is seasonal or has significant daily fluctuations, then you have long periods where the infrastructure is hardly used. It’s still drawing power and it still requires maintenance (and eventual replacement), but it’s not delivering value to your customers or your business. These kinds of workloads are what serverless was designed for.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless">Serverless</a> is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.</p>



<p>Historically, application startup time has not been a primary focus for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/java">Java</a>; instead, it has been optimized for high throughput. The reasoning goes that if your applications are running for a long time, throughput is king. This has led to the suggestion that slow startup makes Java unsuitable for serverless workloads.</p>



<p>Some Java runtimes have chosen to throw away the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/jvm-vs-jre-vs-jdk">Java Virtual Machine</a> (JVM, the technology that provides great throughput and memory management) and compile Java to native code. This delivers faster startup but at the expense of throughput. It also subsets the Java language, so your code and libraries must be designed for native compilation. Lastly, native compilation is slow, so development is still done on a JVM. Using a JVM in development and a native image in production increases the risk of problems not being detected until applications are in production.</p>



<p>Serverlesstypically costs a bit more, so it’s important your applications are efficient—meaning low memory use and high throughput. These are characteristics WebSphere Liberty has excelled at for many years. However, serverless brings a spotlight to another performance characteristic: &nbsp;time to first response. With serverless, you no longer have instances idling waiting for work, so when demand increases, you need new instances to be able to respond to requests very quickly.</p>



 How does WebSphere Liberty InstantOn work? 



<p>Websphere Liberty InstantOn takes a novel approach. With InstantOn, during application build, you can take a checkpoint of your running Java application process and then restore that checkpoint in production. The restore is extremely fast (in the low 100s of milliseconds) making it ideal for serverless.</p>



<p>Since InstantOn is a checkpoint of your existing application, its behavior after restore is identical, including the same great throughput performance. This process enables organizations to adopt serverless for new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native applications</a> and provides the opportunity to bring serverless to existing enterprise applications.</p>



<p>“This is an interesting technology for companies that want serverless flexibility but don’t want to be locked into cloud functions.” — Johan Janssen, Co-Founder, <a href="https://www.flowfactor.be/">FlowFactor</a></p>



 Key features and benefits 



 
 Start an application up to 10 times faster, enabling applications to rapidly scale to meet demand. 



 Works for all Java applications, new and old. Easily adopt serverless without rewriting your applications. 



 No compromise to throughput performance. 
 







 Summary 



<p>WebSphere Liberty InstantOn is the ideal feature to take advantage of serverless frameworks for your Java workloads. InstantOn is suitable for organizations of all sizes and industries looking to conveniently embrace serverless for both new and existing applications.</p>



<p>You can easily adopt InstantOn through your existing Liberty entitlements or explore <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-hybrid-edition">WebSphere Hybrid Edition</a> to drive cloud-native development and application modernization.</p>

 Remaining OCEAN tokens will be minted. OCEAN will be fully decentralized and unpausable. It will vest to community over&nbsp;decades <p>Overview article [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/control-over-the-ocean-contract-to-be-revoked-soon-overview-6c5b15be2db">here</a>], technical article [this&nbsp;post].</p> 1. Summary <p>The OCEAN token contract has 1.41B tokens capped supply. By the end of May 2023, the Ocean core team will mint the remaining 56.518% in the supply. A multisig wallet holds this newly minted OCEAN; Ocean core team members are a minority. All of the newly minted OCEAN is for the community; most will be transferred to smart contracts that vest OCEAN over decades to fund Ocean Data Farming (DF). DF incentivizes for growth of Data Consume Volume in the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>With this minting done, we are then able to further reduce the OCEAN risk surface by renouncing ownership of the OCEAN token contract. This will make it un-pausable, and fully decentralized &amp; censorship-resistant.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 is an overview of system-level design and implementation phases. Section 3 elaborates on the implementation phases, with emphasis on OCEAN-related actions. The core team has completed the first two phases; the third and fourth is underway. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. Introduction  2.1 High-Level Overview <p>The image below shows the Ocean system-level design with an emphasis on DF funding flows. It overlays DF Main implementation phases.</p>Ocean system design + DF main implementation<p>The Ocean system-level design follows the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>. The green circle in the image is the heart of this loop: teams in Ocean ecosystem do *work* to drive traction to the Ocean ecosystem in terms of DCV [0], protocol revenue, and OCEAN. Protocol revenue loops back to burn OCEAN and to further fund teams. Ocean Data Farming (DF) is the main approach to incentivize / fund the&nbsp;teams.</p><p>The image overlays the five implementation phases of DF Main implementation, shown in colors of the rainbow, red → orange → yellow → green → blue: (A) Vesting &amp; Splitter Contracts, (B) Recycling Multisig, (C ) Actions around OCEAN contract, (D) Security Audit, (E) Remaining Deployments.</p><p>Aside: The implementation phases A-E are orthogonal to DF Main 1–4. Phases A-E are about implementation work, whereas DF Main 1–4 are about OCEAN vesting schedule. We aim to complete all implementation phases A-E during DF Main&nbsp;1.</p> 2.2 Overview: System-Level Design <p>In the system-level design, Ocean Data Farming is the main approach to incentivize / fund the&nbsp;teams.</p><p>For Data Farming, OCEAN flows from top to bottom as&nbsp;follows:</p>  From the initial OCEAN contract (top left), to the 51% multisig [one-time]  From 51% multisig to vesting wallets Vesting 0, Vesting A, Vesting B, Vesting C, Vesting D [one-time]  From vesting wallets to Splitter contract [weekly, over decades]. More precisely, Vesting 0 and Vesting A vest for DF Main 1 [12 mos]; Vesting B for DF Main 2 [6 mos]; Vesting C for DF Main 3 [6 mos]; Vesting D for DF Main 4 [decades].  From Splitter contract to DF addresses DF passive, DF active, and DF future [weekly, over decades].  From DF addresses to Ocean core team, Ocean ecosystem teams.  Work from these teams drives traction in the Data Ecosystem to output protocol revenue, which goes to Community Multisig Wallet, then Rev-Splitter then (i) buyback &amp; burn and (ii) Splitter contract.   2.3 Overview: DF Main Implementation <p>(This section is adapted from “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">DF Main is Here</a>” blog post. We repeat it in order to expand on&nbsp;it.)</p><p>Ratchet Principle. As DF Main involves a huge amount of OCEAN, we take extra precautions and follow the principle <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">“ratchet up value-at-risk over time”</a>. What this means: rather than sending all this OCEAN directly to the vesting contracts, we “buy time” to more thoroughly verify the&nbsp;system</p><p>Implementation over time. We can ratchet up value at risk as we deploy more components, and put OCEAN into them. Here’s the order of operations.</p>  Deploy canary, wire it up. First we will deploy a “canary” vesting contract for DF Main 1, funded with just 1000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Verification. This allows us to test the system live, in production yet with a small amount of funds at risk. At the same time, we will initiate a bug bounty program and security audit for all these components.  Weekly rewards keep rolling. OCEAN payouts for DF29, DF30, etc will be as scheduled for DF main. A tiny amount will come from the “canary” vesting contract, and the rest will be topped up manually by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.  Deploy the rest. Once the verification is complete, then we will deploy the remaining contracts and move the remaining OCEAN accordingly.  <p>Final outcome. In completing the implementation work above, OCEAN vesting will be fully automated and on-chain. Then we will tackle decentralizing DF-main reward calculations, leveraging advances in decentralized compute infrastructure. This will serve the Ocean ecosystem well in the decades that follow, with more transparency, stability, and composability.</p><p>We now elaborate on each of the implementation phases&nbsp;A-E.</p> 3. DF Main Implementation Phases  3.1 Implementation Phase A: Vesting &amp; Splitter contracts <p>This phase implements the red🟥 phase in the image. This phase is complete.</p><p>First, we developed the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol">VestingWalletLinear</a> contract, which inputs tokens and releases those to a target address according to linear vesting schedule (constant every week). We developed the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/VestingWalletHalving.sol">VestingWalletHalving</a> contract, which vests according to a Bitcoin-style exponential schedule. Finally, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/vw-cli/blob/main/contracts/Splitter.sol">Splitter</a> contract, which splits any inbound income to multiple output addresses. We moved those contracts to the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Ocean contracts repo</a>.</p><p>Then, we did the work to “Deploy canary, wire it&nbsp;up.”</p>  We deployed a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting 0 Wallet. We deployed the Splitter contract. All deployments go to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.  We funded it with 1000 OCEAN. It will vest until the end of DF Main 1, with an equal amount every&nbsp;week.  We wired it together with the rest of DF stack, including Gelato for Web3 automation.  It now dispenses through components to DF passive &amp; active rewards addresses. Weekly payouts draw from this plus the main DF payment multisig; the latter being far&nbsp;larger.   3.2 Implementation Phase B: Recycling Multisig <p>This phase implements the orange🟧 phase in the image. This phase is complete.</p><p>Here, we simply deployed the recycling multisig wallet. This multisig — and the others — uses <a href="https://safe.global/">Safe</a> (nee Gnosis Safe). The Appendix has multisig&nbsp;details.</p> 3.3 Implementation Phase C: Actions around OCEAN&nbsp;contract <p>This phase implements the yellow🟨 phase in the image. This phase is in progress.</p><p>The OCEAN token contract has 1.41B tokens capped supply. 796,900,859 OCEAN (56.518%) hasn’t been minted yet. It is earmarked for the Ocean community, as&nbsp;follows.</p>  719,100,000 OCEAN (51%) has always been earmarked for community incentives. Of this amount, 503,370,000 OCEAN (70% of the 51%) is for Data Farming with vesting over decades, held by the respective vesting wallets. 215,730,000 OCEAN (30% of the 51%) is for future community incentives projects, held by the 51% multisig&nbsp;wallet.  77,800,859 OCEAN (5.518%) is other community-earmarked OCEAN that hadn’t yet been minted. This will be managed from the the <a href="https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xD5e6219A79C5CC61b9074331D1B05a6f35c5a48a">OceanDAO community wallet</a> (also multisig).  <p>We (Ocean core team) will the following steps to mint remaining OCEAN for the community, and renounce ownership of the OCEAN token contract, by the end of May&nbsp;2023.</p>  On OCEAN contract, call mint() of 719,100,000 OCEAN (51% of OCEAN supply), sending funds to 51% multisig&nbsp;wallet.  On OCEAN contract, call mint() of 77,800,859 OCEAN, sending funds to OceanDAO community wallet.  On OCEAN contract, transfer the pauser role to 0x00..00.  On OCEAN contract, call renounceOwnership()&nbsp;.  <p>In doing this, the OCEAN token contract will fully decentralized and censorship-resistant. It can no longer be&nbsp;paused.</p><p>Then, the 51% multisig and OceanDAO wallets hold the newly minted&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.4 Implementation Phase D: Security audit&nbsp;etc <p>This phase implements the green🟩 phase in the image. This phase is in progress.</p><p>The work for phase D&nbsp;is:</p>  Security audit. Line up security auditors. Get the audit results. Fix smart contracts as&nbsp;needed.  Bug bounty. Add Vesting contracts &amp; related to Ocean’s long-running <a href="http://df%20%26%20vesting/">Immunefi bug&nbsp;bounty</a>.   3.5 Implementation Phase E: Remaining deployments (once security&nbsp;ok) <p>This phase implements the blue🟦 phase in the image. This phase will be performed once phase D is complete, and we’re comfortable with the stability of DF &amp; Vesting, from bug bounty and otherwise.</p><p>Whereas implementation Phase A deployed &amp; funded Vesting Wallet 0 as a “canary”, in this phase we deploy &amp; fund remaining vesting wallets: Vesting A, B, C,&nbsp;D.</p><p>The work for phase E&nbsp;is:</p>  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting A wallet, for DF Main 1. Wire it up side-by-side with Vesting 0 wallet, via Gelato. Fund it with OCEAN. How much to fund: 150,000 OCEAN / week; this depends on # remaining weeks in DF Main 1. (Up to 7,800,000 OCEAN, if it ran for all of DF Main&nbsp;1).  Wait 1+ months to ensure that Vesting A is ok.&nbsp;Then…  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting B wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 2. Send it 7,800,000 OCEAN, such that it dispenses 300,000 OCEAN / week over 52/2&nbsp;weeks.  Deploy a VestingWalletLinear contract as the Vesting C wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 3. Send it 15,600,000 OCEAN, such that it dispenses 600,000 OCEAN / week over 52/2&nbsp;weeks.  Deploy a VestingWalletHalving contract as the Vesting D wallet, vesting over 6 months starting at DF Main 4. Send it 472,170,000 OCEAN [1], which dispenses &gt;1.1M OCEAN / week to start, then decays over time according to its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">halving-based schedule</a>.   4. AMA <p>To field questions by the community, the Ocean core team will hold an AMA about the OCEAN actions, on May 25 at 12.30 UTC. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">@oceanprotocol on Twitter</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> 5. Conclusion <p>The Ocean core team will mint the remaining 56.518% OCEAN tokens and transfer them to a multisig where the core team is a minority.</p><p>All of the newly minted OCEAN is for the community, for Data Farming and more. Most of it vests over&nbsp;decades.</p><p>OCEAN token contract will be un-pausable, fully decentralized &amp; censorship-resistant.</p><p>The core team continues to execute on DF Main implementation phases and related OCEAN actions.

 Remaining OCEAN tokens will be minted. OCEAN will be fully decentralized and unpausable. It will vest to community over&nbsp;decades <p>Overview article [this post], technical article&nbsp;[<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/control-over-the-ocean-contract-to-be-revoked-soon-technical-77cb8923171">here</a>].</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is ready to take the next step in our evolution. Our utmost priority is to nurture the Ocean community and protect holders of the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN token</a>. Just as one cautiously feels their way barefoot across a stone riverbed, we have always worked to take the interests of token holders as our priority — taking cautious steps&nbsp;forward.</p> 2. Need for a Native OCEAN&nbsp;Token <p>In the Ocean whitepaper, we envisioned that a Data Economy could be kicked off through the use of programs and incentives that allow people to join the community and contribute meaningfully. Crypto-tokens represent a novel innovation in giving people a small slice of an emerging protocol. Crypto-tokens also can help to align activities amongst a globally dispersed group of people who want to move an idea forward. When used appropriately, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">tokens can help to sustain and drive the growth of protocols</a>.</p> 3. Tokens Nurture the Ocean Community <p>Over the past six years, we have had many programs such as <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Shipyard</a>, <a href="https://oceanambassadors.community/">Ambassadors</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO Grants</a>, and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/challenges">Data Challenges</a> to encourage people to explore the value of data and to try out new business ideas. We learned that many of the programs require significant coordination and overhead to weed out scammers and reward true contributors who are aligned with the mission and values of&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>The objective is to encourage independent, non-correlated activities at scale that are the sign of healthy, sustainable protocol communities. Our goal has always been to set up long-term incentive mechanisms that can outlast the involvement of the founding team and serve the interests of the Ocean community.</p><p>We realized that the most responsible way to encourage participation in the network with the least amount of administrative overhead was to tie incentives to the publishing of data assets and algorithms, and real consumption of assets within the Ocean ecosystem. The blockchain doesn’t lie and the truest form of proof is when people put their tokens behind their convictions. The result of this is Data&nbsp;Farming.</p> 4. Data Farming as a Long-Term Sustainable Incentive Program <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">Data Farming</a> incentivizes both active and passive participation in the Ocean ecosystem. Token holders earn OCEAN passively for <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/veocean">locking</a> up their tokens for a fixed time period. Once their OCEAN is locked, they can then actively <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/datafarming">stake</a> the derivative veOCEAN token on data assets, to help signal quality and earn Data Farming rewards. The Data Farming program is being automated so that the administrative overhead is minimal and manageable as adoption of Ocean technology scales.</p><p>With Data Farming in place and road tested for almost one year, a core piece of the incentive puzzle is now in place. Over the next few years, we will improve and secure the mechanism but after nine months of testing Data Farming and the previous years of gingerly testing out incentive programs, we’re now confident that we can finally mint the remaining OCEAN in the token contract to a multi-signature wallet and revoke any pause or destruct capabilities on the OCEAN token contract. By revoking all rights, OCEAN token holders can rest assured that their holdings are completely safe and will live indefinitely on the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>Find out more&nbsp;here.</p> 5. Crypto as a General-Purpose Technology <p>Our hypothesis is that crypto is a general-purpose technology. Crypto is a 14-year-old general purpose technology kicked off in 2009 with Bitcoin and if our hypothesis is correct, the journey to integrate it into society likely requires another 20&nbsp;years.</p><p>In 2005, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Transformations-General-Purpose-Technologies/dp/019929089X">Dr. Lipsey et al</a> posed the idea that all human progress can be attributed to 30 odd technologies that drive innovation and new products. Generally, these technology innovations are so disruptive and wide-reaching, that it takes at least 30 years to weave itself into the fabric of society and become ubiquitous.</p><p>As a comparison, work on the Internet began in the 1960s but it was only in 1989 when Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web that the internet could begin its rapid rise to ubiquity as a consumer and business essential. Counting forward 30 years from 1989, we land at 2019. Most people can agree that by 2019, the Internet was ubiquitous and inseparable from our modern&nbsp;society.</p><p>For Ocean, the interplay between crypto, data and AI is obvious now with the release of ChatGPT, Bard and other large language models (LLMs), and the rate of innovation could happen faster than expected.</p><p>Our core hypothesis at the founding of Ocean was that, in a world where AI agents are economic agents, the means of exchanging value would be over blockchains, smart contracts and crypto&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>AI agents will use web2 services once web2 services integrate with web3 to allow native blockchain based identity and profiles — and delivery of value will be notarized and orchestrated on blockchains, along with the payments.</p><p>These are the reasons why we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/909793166416662528">launched</a> Ocean Protocol. To give an incentive structure for AI, data and blockchains to work together beside human agents. This is also the reason why we have a long-term, Bitcoin-like emission schedule of OCEAN to encourage the adoption of Ocean technology over time — because these fundamental business and mindset changes take&nbsp;time.</p> 6. Allocation of OCEAN&nbsp;Tokens <p>The <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">Ocean token contract</a> has a maximum cap of 1.41 billion&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>In 2019, 613.1 million OCEAN was minted with the majority of tokens distributed to token acquirors, the Ocean community via grants and Ocean Protocol Foundation for administrative expenses. The single mint in 2019 represented 43.5% of the total allowable token supply, leaving 797 million OCEAN or 56.5% of the token supply remaining to be&nbsp;minted.</p><p>As of May 2023, 100% of the OCEAN token supply will be minted with the proceeds being deposited into oceanDAO multisignature wallets with seven signees. The signees are made up of core Ocean team members, Ocean community members and founders of other web3 projects, with the core team members being in the minority of signees. The final allocation of all 1.41 billion OCEAN is shown in Diagram 1&nbsp;below:</p>Diagram 1: Allocation of Ocean&nbsp;Tokens<p>When 100% of OCEAN is minted, 807 million OCEAN representing 57.2% of the total supply remains to be distributed for Data Farming and incentive programs according to a multi-decade emission schedule. There is also funding for existing community programs and administrative expenses.</p>Diagram 2: As indicated by the dotted line, 57.2% (807 million) Ocean Tokens remain undistributed as of 5/2023. The rest of the OCEAN tokens have been distributed. 7. Inflation Rate of the OCEAN Token&nbsp;Supply <p>There will be no major injection of OCEAN into the circulating supply at this stage. The number of tokens disbursed will be gradually ratcheted up in lockstep with adoption, so the inflation rate in the OCEAN token supply will be at a level to attract new participants while protecting existing&nbsp;holders.</p><p>The main source of token inflation moving forward occurs as part of the oceanDAO Data Farming program. The emission schedule is modelled on Bitcoin and serves as a long-term, multi-decade program to incentivize passive and active participation in the Ocean ecosystem. Most importantly, Data Farming is designed to be automated with little or no intervention from the core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The Data Farming program has been running for nine (9) months and we have given ourselves an additional 2 years to test and harden Data Farming. If the adoption requires more time or the incentive mechanisms need more time to mature, less OCEAN will be disbursed.</p><p>Assuming the mechanisms work as designed and adoption of Ocean Protocol tools proceeds as planned, the maximum disbursement of Ocean to the curators and network starts in late-2025 and continues for 4 years (Diagram 3). At peak emissions in Year 2, the inflation rate would be 8% — 52 million OCEAN emitted into a total liquid supply of approximately 650 million OCEAN. At the first halvening at Year 6 (Week 330), the emission rate falls to 500,000 OCEAN per week and the resulting the inflation rate drops to&nbsp;3%.</p>Diagram 3: Data Farming Emission&nbsp;Schedule<p>You can find out more about Data Farming and the emission schedule&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#707e">here</a>.</p><p>We believe that crypto-adoption will continue but between now and 2025, there are broader macro-economic headwinds due to existing global disruptions, the ongoing banking crisis and unsustainable national debt loads. In 2 Years, the adoption of AI and web3 technologies could be ripe and align with the ratcheting up of OCEAN token emissions to capitalize on the long-term trend.</p> 8. Valuation of the OCEAN Token Ecosystem <p>With the current circulating supply of OCEAN at 605 million, the value of the network is $200 million assuming today’s price of $0.33/OCEAN.</p><p>With the minting of the remaining 56.5% of the supply to reach maximum cap, the fully diluted value of the Ocean network is $465 million. Meanwhile, the OCEAN token contract is fully decentralized, censorship-resistant and can no longer be paused or destroyed.</p><p>The Ocean core team will notify the main coin portals CoinMarketCap and Coingecko and provide quarterly updates to the token supply so that community members can rely on&nbsp;them.</p><p>AMA. To field questions by the community, the Ocean core team will hold an AMA about the OCEAN actions, on May 25 at 12.30 UTC. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">@oceanprotocol on Twitter</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> 9. Upwards and&nbsp;Onwards <p>Trent and Masha McConaghy <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ascribe-for-nft-archaeologists-17ca5481d206">posed the question</a> 10 years ago on whether digital art could truly be owned, traded and transparently tracked. This exploration led directly to Ocean Protocol - a realization that AI, data and blockchains were naturally suited to unlock immense value and human potential.</p><p>No one can predict the future, but if the past is any indicator, many of our initial hypothesis’ were proven correct with the rise of NFTs, decentralized markets for tokens and an explosion of AI + data startups.</p><p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN token</a> is a fundamental part of the Ocean ecosystem. With this minting of OCEAN tokens and the revocation of all control over the OCEAN token contract, it’s now up to all Ocean community members (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051#">including the core team</a>) to imbue value in the token through real technology advances and real adoption one data scientist and user at a&nbsp;time.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Ping Identity is excited to see our customers, partners, and other IAM leaders at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/events/identiverse.html">Identiverse 2023</a> in Las Vegas from May 26th to June 2nd.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>So, what does the Entertainment Capital of the World and Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) have in common? Las Vegas casinos and CIAM programs both aim to balance security and convenience by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Delivering delightful customer experiences while managing risk</p>
 
 <p>Verifying the identity of customers and authorizing transactions</p>
 
 <p>Profiling and progressively getting to know customers to understand preferences, connect them to services they desire, and provide benefits</p>
 
 <p>Guiding customers on a journey from unknown to loyal</p>
 
 <p>Evaluating behavior to separate the bad actors from the good</p>
 
 <p>Protecting against fraud, counterfeiting, and impersonation</p>
 
 <p>Supporting omnichannel experiences across physical locations (casinos) and digital properties (gambling apps)</p>
 
 <p>Ensuring resiliency across operations</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's digital-first world, we must strongly identify, authenticate, and authorize users in order to boost security and protect our customers. This is true whether you’re an online business or a casino on the strip. Hackers and fraudsters, like casino cheaters, are constantly changing tactics to steal money. We must aggressively and purposefully consider new solutions and different approaches to stay one step ahead and prevent fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To combat threats, more companies are offering multi-factor authentication (MFA) options to safeguard users. And their customers are noticing! Surveys indicate consumers put more trust in brands that offer additional security measures. To meet this expectation, businesses should build consumer adaptive MFA into digital services and leverage it as an eventual springboard to passwordless. Or, if possible, companies should leapfrog right to passwordless for new and existing customers. We need to use tools like MFA to slow down suspicious users when risk is high and, conversely, speed up trusted customers when risk is low, striking the elusive balance between security and convenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "playing with house money" basically means gambling without risk of loss. This is not the case with most digital relationships today. Casinos employ experts to&nbsp; simultaneously profile and surveil their customers to separate good actors from suspected bad actors. Similarly, the latest threat detection tools can evaluate risk signals in real time throughout the user session to determine trust and ensure valid users can transact quickly and easily. That way, your business won’t have to gamble on possible fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the threats that Vegas casinos face are as vast and varied as the digital threats facing businesses today. We all must focus on securing people, businesses, and transactions without sacrificing experience to grow loyalty and revenue. It’s the only way to give our customers extraordinary experiences that keep them coming back for more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his keynote speech on the opening day of Identiverse titled <a href="https://identiverse.com/idv23/session/1361523/">Identity Under Attack</a>, Andre Durand, Ping’s Founder &amp; CEO, will discuss how AI is changing cybersecurity. We also invite you to join us at the Founders Party at On the Record inside of Park MGM on June 1st from 7:00–11:00 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, don’t miss an opportunity to give back at Identiverse with our latest Ping4Good initiative! Summer may have just started, but local charities are gearing up to support families in need by providing them with classroom materials. That’s why Ping Identity is partnering with A Precious Child to provide 3rd-5th grade students school supplies, and all attendees at Identiverse can help! Just stop by the Ping Identity Booth (Booth 1303) to build a bag for kids in need.</p>

<p>When it comes to Zero Trust, the conversation has moved from being a nebulous term several years ago to a well-understood framework with a true north that has broad acceptance across the cybersecurity industry.</p>
<p>That said, confusion abounds among C-suite executives and boards. If you walked around the exhibition at the 2023 RSA Conference, you could hear from a networking specialist that Zero Trust is all about IP, and then from an identity vendor that it’s all about credentials. Defining Zero Trust narrowly runs the risk of creating a false sense of security – if you just secure the network or the credentials, you’re done with the Zero Trust journey.</p>
<p>That’s why the recent release of the latest <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/zero-trust-maturity-model">CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> in April 2023 provided a much-needed reference point for government agencies as well as enterprises on how to develop Zero Trust strategies. Zero Trust is broader than any one vendor’s solution. It is an approach that can govern user identity and access management (IAM), and access and security of devices, networks, application workloads, and data, with a risk-based access control model that can be implemented across an organization’s entire user base and IT stack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model Pillars</p>
<p>When we talk to our customers, we talk about Zero Trust foundations. Regardless of which vendors you choose, Zero Trust is a journey, one that you can track along the maturity model. This includes making sure you’re securing the network and credentials – for humans, machines, and applications. In today’s post-perimeter environment, it means implementing dynamic authentication that is verified rather than assumed and secures your data assets with encryption and key management best practices, and ensuring development code is signed and approved.</p>
<p>In fact, that last item is a great case in point when it comes to these potential Zero Trust blind spots that arise when you don’t think holistically. When developing applications, code is brought in via APIs, libraries, and repositories and analysis shows us that as much of 70% of an organization’s code is assembled rather than written. An application deployed within an organization and the software bill of materials that make them up aren’t always thought of when it comes to Zero Trust planning, but they absolutely should be. How you certify code that comes from outside your organization and the risk profile you apply to it should be part of that framework.</p>
<p>Ultimately the shift in thinking boils down to moving from the idea of trust to verification. So instead of trusted identities and applications we have verified identities and applications. The second part of that shift is the delta, the change over time, which means we don’t just verify once, but continuously. This is change that can be measured over time, geography, and access entitlement and that is aligned with the risk profile for any given user, machine, or application.</p>
<p>This approach is a reflection of the Zero Trust maturity model, which has gained significant attention from cybersecurity professionals and organizations alike. For most organizations, the current state of Zero Trust maturity is still in its early stages.</p>
<p>We recognize that implementing a Zero Trust security model requires a significant investment of time and resources. It involves assessing the current state of security controls and infrastructure, identifying gaps and weaknesses, and developing a plan to address those gaps. While many have a long way to go before they can claim to have a fully mature Zero Trust security posture, there are excellent resources available to help map out that journey, as well as partners like Entrust that can offer the guidance and broad portfolio needed to get there.</p>

<p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been on a mission from day one to provide every individual with a digital identity that they own and control. Last year, we took that one step further, giving users the ability to own and control their money with the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/launchpad-the-all-new-globalid-wallet-768cd26357c0">release of our non-custodial wallet</a>.</p><p>It’s also why, today, we’re announcing that we’re transitioning to the Universal Namespace. This will allow users to own and control a unique name associated with their digital identity through an independent third-party namespace rather than one managed by GlobaliD.</p><p>A namespace is simply a set of unique names that are tied to different types of things so they can be easily identified. In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System or DNS namespace tied domain names to relevant IP addresses so that people could easily find the websites they were looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>The concept of a namespace is key to the mainstreaming of digital <br>identity — just as it was for the mainstreaming of the internet. The early internet was a fragmented mess. The only way to find anything was through hard-to-memorize IP addresses. With the arrival of DNS, we could now visit wikipedia.com rather than 80.190.205.15.</p><p>In a sense, the DNS namespace made the internet more&nbsp;human.</p><p>The same goes for digital identity, which is even more complex than simply visiting a website. Someone you want to interact with may have many public keys, URLs, or platform accounts you need to keep track of. Now, all you need is their unique&nbsp;name.</p><p>At GlobaliD, we’ve been thinking deeply about namespaces over the last few years — we <a href="https://medium.com/@_globalid/globalid-white-paper-the-namespace-for-identity-6b755afbe42f">published our first white paper on the subject</a> in the beginning of 2019. As an early mover in the digital identity space, we’ve often had to come up with original concepts and terms in order to help develop and push the industry&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s also been the case when it came to a namespace for identity. As such, we originally built a namespace in-house. But the long term vision was always for the namespace to be managed independently outside of GlobaliD. That’s something we laid out in our white paper. Ultimately, we believe the namespace should be a public&nbsp;good.</p><p>We now have the opportunity to make that vision a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this is a big step toward interoperability with other digital identity platforms. For instance, GlobaliD may support additional namespaces in the future, giving users a choice over their service provider. Regardless of which namespace you choose, your unique name will always be attached to a verifiable credential that you&nbsp;control.</p><p>In all, this is an incredibly exciting evolution for GlobaliD’s digital identity offering.</p><p>The transition will require one additional step for you, the user, but we truly believe that the end destination — where individuals control their name, their identity, and their money — is worth the&nbsp;effort.</p><p>The simplest way for this transition to work is for existing users to re-onboard with GlobaliD and claim a new name through the Universal Namespace.</p><p>This transition does mean that users will lose their existing identity history on the platform once they re-onboard with a new name. That includes things like chat history, vouches, and verifications.</p><p>This wasn’t an easy decision to make and we’re incredibly empathetic to our early adopters, but ultimately, it became clear that this was the best path forward, one most aligned with our values and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>For GlobaliD, this clean slate is also an opportunity for us to provide major upgrades to our messaging and wallet platforms as well as a bevy of new features that will arrive with our next generation digital identity platforms, which will be released in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>In the meantime, users will still be able to access their wallets via their private key, but they will no longer be able to access it through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>For now, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> (/uns) to reserve your unique name. Make sure you sign in with the same phone number you’ll use with GlobaliD so that we can link your name to your GlobaliD identity.</p><p>You should also keep an eye out for notifications from the current GlobaliD app that will include prompts and instructions which will help you throughout the re-onboarding process.</p><p>In all, we’ve got plenty in store for all of you in&nbsp;2023.</p> Q&amp;A   Will I be able to keep any part of my current digital identity?<br>No, you will lose access to all of the data that was associated with your old name including chat history, groups you joined, and funds in your wallet. However, you can transfer funds out of your wallet now before the transition takes place, or you can use your keys to move your entire wallet to another non-custodial client. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our support team for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery&nbsp;key.  Will I be able to keep my old username?<br>No. The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a new service which will manage GlobaliD names moving forward. All existing users of GlobaliD will re-onboard with UNS by claiming a name on this separate, independent namespace. Because UNS has been managed independently of GlobaliD, some names have already been reserved and owners of GlobaliD names may not have their names available on UNS. If your old name is available in UNS, then you can claim it and re-onboard using that&nbsp;name.  Will the Universal Namespace reserve my existing name?<br>No. You need to reserve your new name on your own. You will be able to do this within the updated GlobaliD app upon release, but you do not have to wait. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website.  What if I have money or assets in my GlobaliD Wallet?<br>You will need to transfer funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet by May 30, 2023 in order to maintain access to your money. Alternatively, you can export your wallet recovery phrase to host your wallet with another app. A new wallet tied to your username will be made available to you upon release of the updated GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  What is the Universal Namespace?<br>The Universal Namespace (UNS) is a discoverability platform that enables people to securely connect their online accounts and data with a unique name. With UNS, users can determine how they are found online by building a public profile that connects all of their digital identities to one universal name they own and control — making it easier for them to be discovered across different ecosystems. UNS is managed independently of GlobaliD and provides name services to multiple providers, in addition to GlobaliD. You can obtain a name by signing up with your phone number on the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace website</a>.  Can I export any of my data before it is deleted?<br>Yes. If you are locked out of your wallet before you have a chance to migrate it, you can reach out to our <a href="mailto:support@global.id">support team</a> for help exporting your non-custodial wallet recovery key. Otherwise, go to your Wallet tab and tap on the key icon in the upper right-hand corner to get your wallet recovery phrase. You can also contact our support team if you would like us to export your chat history. All other data such as your credentials, verifications, and public bio information will be&nbsp;lost.  What is the deadline to reserve my new username and transfer funds from my wallet?<br>We will release the updated GlobaliD app within the next few weeks and notify you when it is available so that you can re-onboard. However, you do not have to wait for this release in order to claim your new name. You can go ahead and reserve your new name now by visiting the <a href="https://www.universalname.space/">Universal Namespace</a> website. You can also go ahead and transfer the funds from your current GlobaliD Wallet to a new wallet in order to maintain access to your&nbsp;money.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-universal-namespace-3bbe51b2701c">Introducing the Universal Namespace</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It has been a year and a half since we rolled out the throttling-aware container CPU sizing feature for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a>, and it has captured quite some attention, for good reason. As illustrated in our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/kubernetes-cpu-throttling-the-silent-killer-of-response-time/">first blog post</a>, setting the wrong CPU limit is silently killing your application performance and literally working as designed.</p>



<p>Turbonomic visualizes throttling metrics and, more importantly, takes throttling into consideration when recommending CPU limit sizing. Not only can we expose this silent performance killer, Turbonomic will prescribe the CPU limit value to minimize its impact on your containerized application performance.</p>



<p>In this new post, we are going to talk about a significant improvement in the way that we measure the level of throttling. Prior to this improvement, our throttling indicator was calculated based on the percentage of throttled periods. With such a measurement, throttling was underestimated for applications with a low CPU limit and overestimated for those with a high CPU limit. That resulted in sizing up high-limit applications too aggressively as we tuned our decision-making toward low-limit applications to minimize throttling and guarantee their performance.</p>



<p>In this recent improvement, we measure throttling based on the percentage of time throttled. In this post, we will show you how this new measurement works and why it will correct both the underestimation and the overestimation mentioned above:</p>

 Brief revisit of CPU throttling 



<p>If you watch this <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/1_33cvlzes">demo video</a>, you can see a similar illustration of throttling. There it is a single-threaded container app with a CPU limit of 0.4 core (or 400m). The 400m limit in Linux is translated to a cgroup CPU quota of 40ms per 100ms, which is the default quota enforcement period in Linux that Kubernetes adopts. That means that the app can only use 40ms of CPU time in each 100ms period before it is throttled for 60ms. This repeats four times for a 200ms task (like the one shown below) and finally gets completed in the fifth period without being throttled. Overall, the 200ms task takes <code>100 * 4 + 40 = 440ms</code> to complete, more than twice the actual needed CPU time:</p>







<p>Linux provides the following metrics related to throttling, which cAdvisor monitors and feeds to Kubernetes:</p>



Linux MetriccAdvisor MetricValue (in the above example)Explanationnr_periods<code>container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total</code>5This is the number of runnable periods. In the example, there are five.nr_throttled<code>container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total</code>4It is throttled for only four out of the five runnable periods. In the fifth period, the request is completed, so it is no longer throttled.throttled_time<code>container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total</code>720msFor the first four periods, it runs for 40ms and is throttled for 60ms. Therefore, the total throttled time is 60ms * 4 = 240ms. Scroll to view full table  



 



 The old/biased way: Period-based throttling measurement 



<p>As mentioned at the beginning, we used to measure the throttling level as the percentage of runnable periods that are throttled. In the above example, that would be <code>4 / 5 = 80%</code>.</p>



<p>There is a significant bias with this measurement. Consider a second container application that has a CPU limit of 800m, as shown below. A task with 400ms processing time will run 80ms and then be throttled for 20ms in each of the first four enforcement periods of 100ms. It will then be completed in the fifth period. With the current way of measuring the throttling level, it will arrive at the same percentage: 80%. But clearly, this second app suffers far less than the first app. It is throttled for only <code>20ms * 4 = 80ms</code> total—just a fraction of the 400ms CPU run time. The currently measured 80% throttling level is way too high to reflect the true situation of this app.</p>



<p>We needed a better way to measure throttling, and we created it:</p>







 The new/unbiased way: Time-based throttling measurement 



<p>With the new way, we measure the level of throttling as the percentage of time throttled versus the total time between using the CPU and being throttled. Here are the new measurements of the above two apps:</p>



ApplicationThrottled TimeTotal Runnable TimePercentage Time ThrottledFirst240ms200ms + 240ms = 440ms240ms / 440ms = 55%Second80ms400ms + 80ms = 480ms80ms / 480ms = 17% Scroll to view full table  



<p>These two numbers—55% and 17%—make more sense than the original 80%. Not only they are two different numbers differentiating the two application scenarios, but their respective values also more appropriately reflect the true impact of throttling, as you could perhaps visualize from the two graphs. Intuitively, the new measurement can be interpreted as how much the overall task time can be improved/reduced by getting rid of throttling. For the first app, we can reduce the overall task time by 240ms (55% of the total). For the second app, it’s merely 17% if we get rid of throttling—not as significant as the first app.</p>



 Benchmarking results 



<p>Below, you’ll see some data to compare the throttling measurements computed using the throttling periods versus the timed-based version.</p>



<p>For a container with low CPU limits, the time-based measurement shows much higher throttling percentages compared to the older version that uses only throttling periods, as expected.</p>



<p>As the CPU limits go up, the time-based measurements again accurately reflect lower throttling percentages. Conversely, the older version shows a much higher throttling percentage, which can result in an aggressive resize-up in spite of the CPU limit being high enough.</p>

 Release 



<p>This new measurement of throttling has been available since IBM Turbonomic release 8.7.5. Furthermore, in release 8.8.2, we also allow users to customize the max throttling tolerance for each individual application or group of applications, as we fully recognize different applications have different needs in terms of tolerating throttling. For example, response-time-sensitive applications like web-services applications may have lower tolerance while batch applications like big machine learning jobs may have much higher tolerance. Now, users can configure the desired level as they want.</p>

<p>Many organizations are turning to passwordless authentication solutions to secure their systems and remove vulnerabilities from identity management.</p>
<p>Discover magic link authentication—a secure, passwordless login method that simplifies user access and enhances security through unique URLs.</p>
 What Is Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> method that allows users to log in to a website or application using a unique, one-time-use URL sent to their registered email address.</p>
<p>When users want to sign in, they enter their email address, and the system generates a “magic link,” which is then emailed to them. The user clicks on the link and is automatically logged into the website or application.</p>
<p>Magic links, like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/one-time-password/">one-time passwords</a>, are often time-sensitive, expiring after a certain period or once they have been clicked. This helps enhance security and reduces the chances of unauthorized access. Using magic links simplifies the login process but relies on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Work? 
<p>Magic link authentication uses a “magic link,” or one-time-use URL sent to a user’s registered email address. This link facilitates specialized and time-based authentication that doesn’t rely on passwords.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:</p>
 
 User Access: Users who want to log in to a website or application enter their email address and request a magic link. 
 Link Generation: The system checks if the provided email address is associated with a registered user. If so, the system generates a unique and time-sensitive link that contains a token specific to that user and session. 
 Delivery: The system sends an email containing the magic link to the user’s registered email address, assuming only the user has access. 
 Token Validation: When the user clicks the link, the website or application receives the token via the user’s web browser and validates it across several criteria, including user credentials, time (has it expired?) or use (has it already been validated?). 
 Authentication: If the token is valid and corresponds to the correct user, the system logs the user in, granting them access to their account without requiring a traditional username and password. 
 Token Expiration: If the magic link is used for authentication or if a predetermined time passes, the token is invalidated. Any future attempts to use the link will result in rejection. 
 
<p>Some magic link authentication systems will use SMS alongside or in place of email. However, these are rare in widely-adopted consumer platforms (although they might be more realistically implemented in enterprise systems).</p>
 Are There Drawbacks to Using Magic Link Authentication? 
<p>This process seems relatively straightforward and, ideally, secure. It removes the necessity of using passwords which, as we’ve talked about in previous articles, removing passwords can significantly reduce an organization’s attack surface.</p>
<p>While magic link authentication offers several benefits, there are also some potential drawbacks to consider:</p>
 
 Dependency on Email: Magic link authentication relies on the user’s email account, which can be an issue if the email service is down or the user loses access to their email account. It also requires users to access their email whenever they want to log in, which might only sometimes be convenient. SMS can provide an alternative to circumvent this issue. 
 Vulnerability to Phishing Attacks: If users become more comfortable clicking links in emails, they may mistake phishing attacks for authentication emails. Therefore, it’s also critical that organizations offer training and education around technology. 
 Context-Specific Security: Magic link authentication might not be ideal for specific situations, such as when a high level of security is required or when compliance and regulations call for a specific approach to authentication. Magic links also do not support identity verification independently and can open up issues when such proof is required. 
 Delays: Users might experience a delay in the authentication process since they have to wait for the magic link to be delivered to their email inbox. The email containing the magic link may also be misidentified as spam and end up in the spam folder, complicating the login process. 
 Token Management: The server-side implementation of magic link authentication requires proper management of tokens, including generating, storing, and verifying them securely. This adds complexity to the system and could introduce vulnerabilities if not done correctly. 
 
<p>While magic link authentication has advantages, these drawbacks should be considered when deciding whether it’s the best choice for a particular website or application.</p>
 How Does Magic Link Authentication Support Passwordless Login? 
<p>Magic links support passwordless authentication by providing a secure and convenient alternative to traditional username and password combinations. Instead of relying on passwords, users authenticate themselves using unique, one-time-use URLs sent to their registered email addresses. Here’s how magic links enable passwordless authentication:</p>
 
 Simplicity: Magic links eliminate the need for users to remember, manage, and enter passwords, making the authentication process more straightforward and user-friendly. 
 Security: Since magic links are time-sensitive and generated on-demand, they offer a secure authentication method. They expire after being used or after a predetermined period, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. By not requiring users to enter passwords, magic links also help mitigate the risks associated with weak passwords, credential leaks, or password reuse. 
 Improved User Experience: Magic link authentication streamlines the login process, making it faster and more efficient. Additionally, if the user has access to their email via a mobile device (or they use SMS-based authentication), they can essentially authenticate themselves wherever they are. 
 Reduced Reliance on Passwords: Magic links reduce the dependence on passwords, which can be problematic due to forgotten or reused passwords and the need for regular password updates. Passwordless authentication through magic links can also reduce the burden on users and IT support. 
 
<p>With magic links, passwordless authentication offers a more convenient and potentially more secure method for users to access their accounts without relying on traditional passwords. However, it is essential to remember that this method depends on the user’s email account, which could be a potential point of vulnerability in case of phishing attacks or email service issues.</p>

<p>As more enterprises move to hybrid cloud environments, hybrid cloud security has become imperative to business growth. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/hybrid-cloud-business-value">According to a 2021 study by the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV),</a> 80% of executives expected their organizations to operate more than 10 distinct clouds by 2023, up from eight in 2020. “The scale of most enterprise hybrid cloud deployments is so vast and penetrates so deeply that the need for an all-in security culture is absolute,” says Shue-Jane Thompson, managing partner at IBM Consulting. “And it should emphasize the business case for security.”</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Read IBM’s “Cost of a data breach 2022” report</a>



<p>Security is fast becoming a conversation about empowerment versus just protection. The IBV study “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/security-cyber-economy">Prosper in the cyber economy</a>” found that 66% of business executives view cybersecurity primarily as a revenue enabler. This requires shifting from a defensive strategy, built on detection and response, to a mature security posture that emphasizes operational efficiency, financial performance and competitiveness. Instead of thinking about security as a traditional expenditure for your organization, approach it as something that can become a value proposition for partners and end customers.</p>



<blockquote>“Customers are buying security as a program. They believe security is not just bought as a small portion of the system or the application they are building.”</blockquote>



<p>Thompson points to companies that leverage security as a revenue source by charging a premium for highly secured services or products. “More and more, security is becoming a standalone procurement,” she says. “Customers are buying security as a program. They believe security is not just bought as a small portion of the system or the application they are building. They believe security must be managed and controlled across the total asset.”</p>



<p>Moving from a defensive stance to an offensive strategy starts with understanding trends in the security landscape. A wider adoption of hybrid cloud naturally presents important concerns due to the vast web of interconnectivity between public and private cloud platforms. Many cloud-based environments rely on Linux for their operations, and in 2022, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence/">IBM Security X-Force reported dramatic increases in Linux malware</a>. Threat actors are also blending malware with legitimate traffic on cloud-based messaging and storage platforms and targeting Docker containers, which are often used in platform-as-a-service cloud solutions.</p>



<p>“The biggest challenge for security is the complexity, the scale and the velocity at which it needs to operate. Organizations need a heterogeneous security policy that they can also bring down to market level,” Thompson says. International organizations, for example, need security strategies that can satisfy the regulations of every country in which they operate, meet specific customer demands and stay ahead of business-specific threats, whether from broad DoS attacks or sophisticated, targeted phishing. The proliferation of hybrid cloud environments means organizations now have a larger attack surface. Cybercrime will continue to rise, and attacks on these environments are costly and tough to detect. According to IBM’s “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a data breach 2022” report</a>, it takes an average of 252 days for an organization to identify and contain a breach that occurred in a hybrid cloud environment, and the average cost is USD 3.8 million compared to USD 4.24 million for private cloud breaches and USD 5.02 million for breaches in public clouds.</p>



<blockquote>Individual accountability is crucial in hybrid cloud environments, especially as ransomware spikes, with an attack occurring every 11 seconds.</blockquote>



<p>Adding more controls or point solutions is not enough for organizations that want to tap the business benefits of a “security first” mindset. Organizations need orchestration, continuous threat management and resiliency. Two primary enablers: educated employees and sophisticated security solutions. Per data <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/en-gb/resources/2022-data-breach-investigations-report-dbir.pdf">from a 2022 Verizon report</a>, as many as 8 in 10 security breaches are caused by human error. As Thompson says, “How will you be able to help humans make better decisions? That’s where the transformation in culture becomes important.” Here’s what these transformations can look like in organizations that want to embrace a security-first mindset as a business differentiator.</p>



 The human factor: from passive participation to personal accountability 



<p>Individual accountability and proactive security enhancements at every level are crucial in hybrid cloud environments, especially as ransomware spikes, with an attack occurring every 11 seconds. As organizations integrate cybersecurity strategies into business objectives, Thompson says every individual must see themself as being on the front lines of upholding stronger security practices, whether that means raising community awareness or training colleagues.</p>



<blockquote>“Chasing after compliance regulations and spending all your energy to check off boxes is not the best way to use your cyber talent.”</blockquote>



<p>A more mature security posture also requires a more robust cyber workforce. The threat landscape is more drastic than ever, with cyberattacks targeting everything from customer data to power grids. &nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM Security’s X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2023</a>, there was an 100% increase in hijacking attempts per month in 2022 compared to 2021. Yet, the demand for cybersecurity professionals outpaces what the labor market can fulfill. According to this <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study">Cybersecurity Workforce Study</a>, there is a global cybersecurity workforce gap of 3.4 million people. To help prepare more workers for those vital roles, organizations need to invest in cybersecurity upskilling and AI and automation tools.</p>



<p>IBM, for example, is training more than <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/time-prioritize-cybersecurity-now-arvind-krishna/">150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next three years</a> through a range of programs, such as SkillsBuild. Meanwhile, AI, machine learning and automation can process huge amounts of complex security data to predict or detect threats. “Organizations spend a large number of resources trying to deal with compliance issues,” Thompson says. “Chasing after compliance regulations and spending all your energy to check off boxes is not the best way to use your cyber talent.” AI automation tools can facilitate more efficient evaluation and review procedures, perform sensitive data discoveries and support monitoring. “If organizations invest in smart automation, they can then move resources and assets to invest in more proactive defensive mechanisms,” Thompson says.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/security">Manage risk with IBM cybersecurity solutions</a>



<blockquote>“You need total transparency on how your assets, workflows, data flows and users—plus partners in your ecosystem—are functioning.”</blockquote>



 The tech factor: from vertical silos to horizontal integration 



<p>On the technology side, the goal is “having a single pane of glass across the hybrid cloud environment,” Thompson says. “You need total transparency on how your assets, workflows, data flows and users—plus partners in your ecosystem—are functioning.”</p>



<p>Smart and networked devices are becoming ubiquitous, yet existing security models are often designed only to protect the endpoint and the data center with technologies like firewalls. That “walled garden” security model must change to one that orchestrates security technology throughout the business (and ideally, through to ecosystem partners) to ensure protection across all devices and touchpoints. Finally, your technology should detect and contain attacks with effective <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/digital-assets/soar/six-steps-for-incident-response/">organization-wide incident responses</a>.</p>



<p>This unified approach creates “a fabric of protection” that envelops the organization, Thompson says, and becomes a value proposition. That level of coordination will be even more vital for certain industries. For example, a growing portion of the USD 1 trillion hybrid cloud market opportunity comprises the financial markets industry, which has strict data ownership and handling requirements built around security and regulation compliance.</p>



<p>The emerging security challenges are considerable, and data security is an ongoing battle. But the solutions are attainable, and the company’s bottom line is the first beneficiary. “Security is a team sport,” Thompson says, “and we’re all on that team.”</p>

<p><br>
Note: Inspiration for this blog post was taken from a conversation I had with Tim Bouma about the role of digital wallets</p>
<p></p>
 An Analogy for better understanding interoperability requirements for Issuers, Verifiers and Holder Wallets 
<p>As I prepare for an upcoming trip from Canada to Europe, I’m reminded of the different power standards between continents. As usual, I will be carrying my laptop and phone, with their chargers, along with an essential universal travel adapter to keep them powered up while I’m there.</p>
<p>This is how it will all work so that I can seamlessly use my devices while I’m abroad:</p>
<p>The European electrical socket, my source of power while abroad, varies in shape, voltage, and frequency compared to what I’m used to back home in Canada. It’s the origin of the electrical energy I need to charge my devices.</p>
 <p>Various electrical sockets</p> 
<p>My universal travel adapter is the unsung hero of my tech travel kit. It’s designed to connect with the European electrical socket and accept the incoming voltage and frequency, which differ from Canadian standards (European outlets often have two round pins, while Canadian plugs typically have two flat parallel pins with a grounding pin).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don’t have to worry! My universal travel adapter will allow my devices to consume electricity from the power sockets.</p>
<p>Switching gears for a minute..</p>
<p>At Northern Block, we’ve been recently experimenting with various credential profiles and credential exchange protocols. We’ve come to understand that different use cases necessitate distinct standards and technological choices. This work has led us to think deeply about the interoperability between different parties involved in credential exchanges.</p>
<p>As a company, we have a strong background in the Hyperledger Aries and <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/anoncreds-anonymous-credentials-with-stephen-curran/">AnonCreds</a> world, a topic on which we’ve shared some writings (<a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/learnings-from-aries-indy-and-various-verifiable-credential-implementations/">here</a> and <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity/aip-2-interoperability/">here</a>). We have also contributed towards multiple open source Aries RFCs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, through collaboration with some partners of ours in the digital identity community, we’ve been broadening our scope of support. This includes exchanging various credential profiles by supporting new specifications like <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/open-id-4-vc-openid-for-verifiable-credentials/">OpenID4VC</a>, both for issuances and presentations. We are at varying stages in our implementations of both these protocols. Further in collaboration with our partner, Canadian Bank Note, we’ve been recently working on demonstrating interoperability between DIDComm-based RFCs and the Mobile Driver’s Licence standard. We’ve written about the motivation and reasoning behind our mDL interoperability work with them <a href="https://northernblock.io/announcement/unifying-mdls-and-verifiable-credentials/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now..</p>
<p>Keeping all this in mind, let’s use the example of electrical sockets, my devices, and universal travel adapter as a comparison to understand how different parts interact in digital credential exchanges. This comparison also helps us understand what interoperability means for everyone involved.<br>
<br><br></p>
 
Issuers 
<p></p>
<p>In this analogy, the European electrical socket is akin to an issuer of digital credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issuers generate and provide signed data that they’re authorized to issue, which can come in various formats, just like different voltages from power sources.</p>
<p>Issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format without being forced to adhere to a specific standard, similar to the electrical socket in a specific country, which provides power according to its local standards without needing to conform to the formats used elsewhere. One issuer may pick AnonCreds and another may pick JSON-LD to issue a similar credential.</p>
<p>Each issuer’s specific use case plays a significant role in the choice of technology. For instance, a transportation ministry issuing mobile driving licences would have different needs and considerations than an issuer of organizational-related claims. Each issuer’s primary intended use case shapes their unique needs (e.g., importance of authenticity, confidentiality, privacy, security) and requirements, and thus, they select the technology and format that best aligns with these needs. Similar to the way my electrical socket in Canada follows its own standard, issuers will issue credentials in their chosen format, based on their main use case, without being forced to conform to a uniform standard.</p>
<p>The issuer’s role is considered more streamlined because they can maintain a consistent issuance method and format that doesn’t need to adapt to the formats used by other issuers. This is much like how an electrical socket in a specific country, such as Canada, maintains its own consistent shape, voltage, and frequency standards, without needing to adapt to the differing standards of sockets in other countries, like those in Europe.<br>
<br><br></p>
 
Verifiers 
<p></p>
<p>Next, my devices – my laptop and phone – represent the verifier in the digital credentialing scenario. They need the credentials in a form that they can understand and accept, much like how they need power through a specific power adapter.</p>
<p>The verifier, based on its business and other requirements, decides what type credential format the holder needs to provide to them – they place restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restrictions are independent from how the issuer issued a credential. Similar to how devices like laptops or phones require specific types of electrical input from a power socket. For example, different devices or chargers require different voltages and currents. The power source or the power socket doesn’t determine the power requirements of the device. Rather, the device itself dictates what kind of power it needs, independent of the supply available from the socket.</p>
<p>When the wallet can provide the credential that fits the verifier’s requirements, it’s like my devices perfectly fitting into an electrical socket with a universal adapter. Everything works seamlessly.</p>
<p>However, if the wallet can’t meet the restrictions, the verifier must decide if it should adjust its requirements. This is similar to the scenario where my phone or laptop plug doesn’t fit the socket. Here, I would need to adjust or use a different adapter.</p>
<p>When credential proofs are presented by the holder, the verifier checks if they conform to its restrictions. It’s like how my laptop and phone check if the power from the socket is the right voltage and type for them to operate safely. If not, they won’t work properly and could even get damaged. Similarly, a verifier ensures the presented credentials meet their criteria for a secure and valid transaction.<br>
<br><br></p>
 
Holders/Wallets 
<p></p>
<p>If we assume issuers will typically pick one issuance method for their credentials, and verifiers may place restrictions for what they deem acceptable to be presented based on their context, then there needs to be something that facilitates this interoperability, or conversion.</p>
<p>The role of my universal travel adapter mirrors that of the digital identity wallet in this scenario. Just as the adapter transforms any incoming power into a form my devices can use, the digital wallet receives these varying credentials from the issuer, manages them, and converts into acceptable formats when requested, ensuring that none of the original credential’s attributes or values are lost in the conversion process.</p>
<p>The holder’s wallet has the most complex role in this ecosystem. It needs to be able to receive, store, and manage credentials from multiple issuers, each potentially using a different credential format, likened to the role of my universal travel adapter, converting ‘power’ from various formats into a form that the device can use.</p>
<p>This allows the holder to present these credentials to verifiers in a format they can understand and accept, much like how my universal travel adapter enables me to plug my Canadian devices into European sockets, converting the European power standards into a format my devices can safely use and accept. The adapter ensures compatibility between different power grids and devices without the user needing to know the specifics. This is similar to how a wallet operates.</p>
<p>The wallet is essential for maintaining the separation between the issuer and the verifier. It eliminates the need for coordination between every issuer and verifier, even if they use different technologies or standards. The issuer might use any format, and the verifier may require any format, but the wallet provides the interoperability that allows the verifier to distance itself from the issuer, thus preserving privacy.<br>
<br><br></p>
 If The Analogy Is True, Then What? 
<p>I do think the analogy of a universal plug adapter aptly depicts the role of the holder’s wallet in the exchange of digital credentials. Much like the adapter, which ensures compatibility between diverse power grids and devices, a wallet manages credentials of varying formats, serving as a vital bridge between the issuer and the verifier.</p>
<p>Just like a plug adapter’s role, the wallet allows for seamless interoperability, shielding the verifier from the specifics of the issuer’s credential format. This operational separation, facilitated by wallets, grants scalability to the system, removing the need for direct coordination between all issuers and verifiers, regardless of the technologies or standards they employ.</p>
<p>However, such conversion isn’t a straightforward process..</p>
<p> Research is required to understand and safeguard the credential’s attributes and values during the transformation. For example, if a credential loses its privacy-preserving features during conversion, we need to clearly communicate this potential loss to the user.</p>
<p>Moreover, the complexity of transformation depends on the credential format. Some formats, like AnonCreds, Selective Disclosure JSON Web Tokens (SD-JWT), and MSO (ISO/IEC 18013-5), offer more enriched data structures than others such as JSON-LD.</p>
<p>For instance, AnonCreds and SD-JWT are rich formats where every element can be individually signed, facilitating selective disclosures. However, this feature also makes them heavier to process. In contrast, converting a rich format into a simpler one like JSON-LD doesn’t pose an issue, as there’s no loss of information. But a reverse conversion is more difficult because not every claim is signed by the issuer in JSON-LD format.</p>
<p>I hope this further underscores the need for in-depth research to understand the dynamics of different credential formats and to develop robust interoperability frameworks. </p>
<p>While we allow the standards to evolve naturally, we must focus on ensuring these frameworks can accommodate and seamlessly convert between all these formats without compromising the credential’s integrity or the issuer’s integrity.</p>
<p>Interoperability is the key here, and that’s where the research should be directed. We should let the standards evolve as they are, but there must be an effort to develop interoperability frameworks.</p>
<p>We can take inspiration from the hardware industry, where plug and play really works. We need to make our systems truly interoperable, just like hardware devices.</p>
<p>Proposed Call to Actions</p>
 
 Advance Interoperability Research: Interoperability, or the ability of different systems or components to work together, is a key concern in the realm of digital credentials. Currently, there are multiple protocols and formats, such as DIDComm, OpenID4VC protocols, and MDL formats. The need for research in this area is to understand how these different formats can interact and be converted without loss of integrity, information or functionality. This would allow for smoother interactions between holders and verifiers, regardless of their chosen credential format. 
 Improve Wallet Versatility: Digital wallets play a crucial role as they need to support and manage credentials in multiple formats. Just as a universal travel adapter can accept plugs from different countries and convert the power into a usable form, the digital wallet needs to be versatile enough to accept, convert, and manage various credential formats. This is a challenging aspect that requires ongoing research and development. 
 Analyze Credential Format Conversion: As different credential formats might prioritize different aspects (e.g., privacy, security, usability), it’s essential to understand what might be lost or gained during the conversion process. This involves deep technical analysis and understanding of the different credential protocols.

<p>Employee Access Management is the use of identity and access management (IAM) to provide employees with secure access to organisational systems and resources. It is also known as Workforce Access Management. These employee access management systems ensure that the right people have (only) the necessary access to the tools and resources needed to complete their jobs. Access levels are usually based on job roles or management levels within the company.</p>
 Importance of Employee Access Management 
<p>Secure and effective employee access management is critical to safeguarding internal and sensitive organisational information. It helps to mitigate information security risks, protect data and ensure regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>With the significant increase in hybrid and remote working since the pandemic, employee access management systems can enable employees to work from anywhere while still accessing applications securely. When remote employees access systems without an appropriate access management system, it risks leaving vulnerabilities within the system for hackers to find and take advantage of. This leads to data breaches, which has severe financial consequences and causes damage to the organisation’s reputation.</p>
<p>The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other regulations meant that companies needed to re-assess data access internally. When all employees have access to sensitive information, including where it is not necessary to their role, it increases the risk of (accidental or purposeful) misuse of data. Implementing employee access management systems that allow access to sensitive information on an individual basis, or based on attributes like job roles, helps to reduce this risk. This is known as the Principle of Least Privilege.</p>
<p>Jenny Radcliffe, aka The People Hacker, joined the Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast to discuss social engineering and the importance of protecting your organisation. In the episode, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/social-engineering-jenny-radcliffe/" title="Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer">Educate your staff or get hacked. Stories from a Social Engineer</a>, Jenny discusses how hackers find and exploit vulnerabilities within organisations’ systems, and how identity products can improve the barriers to this happening. However, Jenny also touches on the importance on User Experience (UX) within these systems. Proper UX will ensure that while the software improves security, it should also not be too complicated, or make tasks more difficult.</p>
 Understanding Employee Access Management Requirements 
<p>When investing in access management systems, the software must support all the requirements of the organisation. An evaluation of your access needs can help to build a clear picture of your solution requirements. Factors to consider include:</p>
 
 Access requirements: user management, remote working, single sign-on. 
 Increased security: authentication needs, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), authorisation. 
 Improved productivity: reduced friction for remote workers, self-service credentials. 
 
<p>These are just a few factors that may affect your solution requirements. Learn more about these system options on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/workforce-access-management/" title="Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page">Workforce Identity &amp; Access Management page</a>.</p>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems provide a centralised platform to manage access, authenticate users, and support connection to identity standards applications. Additional authentication, such as MFA, adds an extra layer of security by requesting that employees provide additional verification factors beyond passwords. Privileged access management (PAM) tools enable organisations to monitor and control privileged accounts, minimising the risk of insider threats.</p>
 Balancing Security and Usability 
<p>A key factor when looking to implement employee access management is getting the ideal balance between security and user experience. Strict access controls help to withstand external risks and comply with regulations, but if your employee access management solution is overly complex it can hinder productivity. Finding a user friendly and seamless solution that offers timely support for issues is fundamental for finding the balance between security and usability.</p>
<p>IAM software that is developed to also provide services for external users – aka Customer IAM (CIAM) – ensure such features are particularly user friendly and can cater for all remote working access scenarios as well.</p>
<p>This is where Ubisecure can help, with our Employee Access Management solutions tailored to suit your company’s access requirements. While placing importance on robust security, we also understand the need for user friendly solutions, simplifying complex identity and access requirements for workforce, B2C and B2B interactions. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="Contact us">Contact us</a> to find out more about Employee Access Management.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>When I recorded this podcast with Wenjing, I was initially hesitant to delve too deeply into the current state of generative AI. The pace at which this field is evolving is astounding, with significant advancements appearing nearly every week. Even in the past couple of weeks since we recorded this podcast, numerous new products have been released. A notable example is Google’s generative AI chat product, Google Bard, which is rapidly gaining recognition as a strong competitor to ChatGPT.</p>
<blockquote><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;describes algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos.</p></blockquote>
<p>For that reason, in our conversation I aimed to focus on more overarching “evergreen” topics that would remain relevant despite the rapid progression of these Generative AI products. I wanted this discussion to retain its value not only for this week but for time to come.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this conversation was first sparked by my personal experience with these AI tools. Further, at the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) in April, I attended a session hosted by Wenjing on “Digital Trust in the Age of AI.” This session triggered many thoughts for me about the impact of AI on digital identity and trust, as well as the intersection between advancements in digital trust and the benefits and potential risks of AI. We both decided it would be interesting to have a longer discussion in a podcast format!</p>
<p>We began our conversation with the parable of the blind men and the elephant. In this story, a group of blind men encounter an elephant for the first time. Each touches a different part of the elephant and describes it based on their limited, individual experience. This leads to disagreements about the elephant’s true nature, illustrating how a singular perspective can limit one’s understanding of a larger concept.</p>
 <p>Image taken from Sophia Tepe’s “The Blind Men and the Elephant” blog post on Medium.</p> 
<p>This parable is relevant when considering artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a complex, multifaceted field. Individuals often form opinions on it based on their personal experiences and knowledge, potentially resulting in a limited or skewed understanding, much like the blind men’s perception of the elephant.</p>
<p>For this, it is important that we have more nuanced discussions about the perceived positives and negatives of such a disruptive new technology.</p>
<p>Some of the topics discussed between Wenjing and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Exponential Data Growth and AI Systems: Discussion centered around how the volume of data, particularly from AI systems like GPT-4, is exponentially increasing. As AI starts generating more content, this could create a feedback loop leading to astronomical levels of content. 
 Interaction with LLM as Protocol: The question arose whether the pre-trained Language Model (LLM) could be equated to a protocol and if individuals might interact directly with the LLM in the future. 
 Digital Identity and Trust in the Age of AI and Deepfakes: Concerns were discussed regarding the rise of AI and deepfakes, particularly their implications for digital identity and trust. The challenges of bi-directional authentication and the potential risk to content-based authentication methods were highlighted. 
 Future of Digital Trust Protocols and Authentication: The potential of AI to generate content was related to the future of digital trust protocols. The necessity of digital signatures for authentication was suggested as a possible direction for the future. 
 Reframing Identity: A broader understanding of identity was proposed, questioning whether a reframing of identity could influence our understanding of concepts like authentication. 
 Trust in AI Bots vs. Humans: Personal observations on the level of trust in AI bots vs. humans were shared, suggesting a quicker formation of trust with bots. The implications for future human-bot relationships were considered. 
 Potential Risks and Benefits of Technological Advancements: The discussion acknowledged both potential risks and substantial benefits of technological advancements. A greater level of trust in bots due to perceived lesser risk was noted, along with a significant move towards open source models in the digital trust space. 
 Open-source Model for LLMs and Other Systems: The pros and cons of adopting an open-source model for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other complex systems were questioned.

 With a gaming regulatory framework that has more similarities with Europe than other Canadian provinces, is the Ontario market the natural step for European operators to expand to? 



 



<p>Ever since April 2022, when Ontario opened the iGaming market to private gaming operators, the province’s regulatory framework has been highly lauded and well-regarded in the international gaming community. </p>



<p>Managed by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/">the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>, there is no limit to the number of private gaming operators that can compete in the province.</p>



<p>There are currently <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">45 regulated operators</a> in Ontario that comply with Ontario’s high standards of game integrity and player&nbsp;protections. The&nbsp;AGCO&nbsp;has approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the&nbsp;province in the last year alone.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">study conducted in March 2023</a>, over 85% of respondents who had gambled in Ontario in 2023 had done so via regulated sites. This is an impressive majority, especially considering that around 70% of all online gambling was done so via unregulated sites before the launch of the open market.</p>



<blockquote><p>Since its launch in April 2022, Ontario’s igaming market has displaced the existing unregulated market and made Ontario an internationally recognized leader in this industry. We are truly proud of this strong, responsible, competitive online gaming model.</p>Doug Downey, Attorney General of Ontario.</blockquote>



<p>One of the most pivotal steps in Ontario’s journey toward being a profitable and attractive gaming market came when the pivotal C-218 bill was passed by Ontario lawmakers in 2021. C-218 allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting, this adds increased flexibility and opportunity for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizeable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.</p>



<p>Ontario was quick to act following the passing of C-218, putting out detailed guidelines for operators interested in entering the market, while also working alongside a range of industry leaders to establish responsible regulations.</p>



<p>For more information, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">‘How to become compliant in Ontario’s iGaming market’ blog.</a></p>



 Advantages for gambling operators doing business in Ontario: 



  Relatively unrestricted marketing opportunities<br>  Young untapped market<br>  Gateway to the rest of Canada<br>  Only province in Canada to have legalized both sports betting and online casinos, which is rare in North America<br>  No cap on the number of licences given to operators, allowing for healthy competition<br>   iGaming sites are not tethered to land based sites<br>  Tax rate is very competitive (around 20%)<br>  Operators can operate out of Malta, UK and other countries  



 Outlook on Ontario’s online gambling market.  



<p><a href="https://vixio.com/blog/a-new-era-for-online-gambling-in-canada/">VIXIO Gambling Compliance forecasts</a> have predicted that Ontario’s gambling market will see rapid growth in the short term, with a forecasted revenue of $1.5 billion by 2026. These numbers put the province as one of the largest online gambling markets in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While impressive growth is forecast, that’s not the only benefit for operators. Ontario’s market also features a very competitive annual tax rate of just 20% – one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another key positives to Ontario gaming sector, is its European-like approach to gambling regulations. Unlike some other markets, operators will not be required to cease offshore activities in other Canadian provinces, once registered in Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How Ontario’s standards are raising the regulatory bar. 



<p>Ontario’s iGaming market is also raising the bar when it comes to regulatory standards. Due to an extensive list of rules and regulations, it is considered a complex market to enter, and features a core focus on customer protection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>iGaming Ontario and the AGCO have set out a wide range of rules and regulations that need to be followed to enter the market. This goes way beyond standard <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> standards. All users and operators also required to adhere to the Proceeds of Crime  and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering-terrorist-financing-act-pcmltfa/">PCMLTFA</a>), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-transactions-reports-centre-canada-fintrac/">FINTRAC</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guidelines include requiring operators to report suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and provide a robust KYC process with an onboarding stage that includes checking official documents, recent photos, as well as liveness. Read the full details of AGCO’s <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The future of Ontario’s iGaming market looks very promising. Not only from a revenue standpoint, but also with regard to its high level of customer protection and regulations. If the market proves to succeed as it is forecast, it shows that stepping up security and customer protection efforts in order to become regulated, is definitely worth the effort. This is especially important in modern times, with regulators all over the globe pushing for stricter gambling rules and regulations. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     Why Ontario’s iGaming model will be an industry game changer

 What’s next for the Canadian iGaming market? 



<p>Due to the success of the Ontario model, it’s highly likely the future of Canada’s iGaming market will see more provinces open up their market to private gaming operators. In fact, it’s probable that finance ministers are already looking at Ontario, and its increased revenue streams from the regulated gaming sector, and considering how it could launch its own regulatory regime for the iGaming market. The good news for operators that are registered and regulated in Ontario is that when other provinces finally open up their market, regulations are likely to be quite similar, which will give them a headstart on regulation processes.</p>



 How European gaming operators can enter Ontario’s iGaming market. 



<p>All operators are required to register directly through the AGCO, which will provide their services through a commercial partnership with iGO. This means gaming companies work as private operators on behalf of Ontario’s governing body. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enter the market, operators must go through an official registration process, which begins with submitting an application through the <a href="https://www.agco.ca/iagco-information">iAGCO</a> portal. Operators must submit gaming-related goods and services, gaming website information, and branding details. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also comprehensive entity and personal disclosure stages,  where the registrant, as well as associated individuals like parent companies and individuals holding key management or operational roles, need to submit details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, more to it than just going through that initial application process. In the long run, operators will need to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">be fully compliant with Ontario’s evolving rules and regulations</a>. <br>&nbsp;</p>



 IDnow’s role in easing entry into Ontario’s iGaming market. 



<p>Entering Ontario’s iGaming market will prove a challenge for any operator. The range and complexity of iGaming requirements mean operators must navigate a regulatory maze to reach compliance. (Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Becoming Compliant in Ontario’s iGaming Market</a>)</p>



<p>Player onboarding requirements include:</p>



  Players must be 19+, physically based in Ontario<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Person (PEP) </a>checks need to be passed<br>  Personal information, including occupation must be collected<br>  Third-party providers are needed for onboarding for initial checks<br>  



<p>One key issue operators may face is a substandard non-compliant onboarding process. iGO’s clear AML and KYC requirements, which even exceed FINTRAC standards, and require detailed verification, tracking, and data storage systems. </p>



<p>This is where IDnow steps in with our verification solutions.</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">&nbsp;identity verification services for gaming&nbsp;</a>work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including gaming. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience. </p>



<p>Our proprietary AI-powered fraud technology can verify users’ identities in minutes, while remaining fully AML-compliant. All users need is a mobile phone, and we guide them through the rest, including Ontario’s and FINTRAC standards, with official document, selfie, and liveness verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Current research and surveys conducted through Project Polaris, the BIS showed a large majority of central banks require offline payments with retail CBDC as a necessity to adopt digital currencies as national legal tender.

<p>Welcome to the Bluesky beta app! This is a user guide that answers some common questions.</p>
<p>For general questions about the Bluesky company, please visit our FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about the protocol Bluesky is built on (the AT Protocol), please refer to our <a href="https://atproto.com/">protocol documentation</a> or our <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/faq">protocol FAQ</a>.</p>
 Data Privacy 
<p>What is public and what is private on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Bluesky is a public social network. Think of your posts as blog posts – anyone on the web can see them, even those without an invite code. An invite code simply grants access to the service we’re running that lets you publish a post yourself. (Developers familiar with the API can view all posts regardless of whether they have an account themselves.)</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
 
 Posts and likes are public. 
 Blocks are public, and blocklists (coming soon) are also public. Subscriptions to blocklists are public. 
 Mutes are private, but mutelists are public lists. Your mutelist subscriptions are private. 
 Invites and invite trees are private. 
 
<p>Why are my posts, likes, and blocks public?</p>
<p>The AT Protocol, which Bluesky is built on, is designed to support public conversations. To make public conversations portable across all sorts of platforms, your data is stored in data repositories that anyone can view. This means that regardless of which server you choose to join, you’ll still be able to see posts across the whole network, and if you choose to change servers, you can easily take all of your data with you. This is what causes the user experience of Bluesky, a federated protocol, to be similar to all the other social media apps you have used before.</p>
<p>Can I set my profile to be private?</p>
<p>Currently, there are no private profiles on Bluesky.</p>
<p>What happens when I delete a post?</p>
<p>After you delete a post, it will be immediately removed from the user-facing app. Any images attached to your post will be immediately deleted in our data storage too.</p>
<p>However, it takes a bit longer for the text content of a post to be fully deleted in storage. The text content is stored in a non-readable form, but it is possible to query the data via the API. We will periodically perform back-end deletes to entirely wipe this data.</p>
<p>Can I get a copy of all of my data?</p>
<p>Yes — the AT Protocol keeps user data in a<a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car"> content-addressed archive</a>. This archive can be used to migrate account data across servers. For developers, you can use <a href="https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-sync#comatprotosyncgetcheckout">this method</a> to export a copy of your repository. For non-devs, the tooling is still being built to make it easy.</p>
<p>You can read our privacy policy <a href="https://bsky.app/support/privacy">here</a>.</p>
 Moderation 
<p>What does muting do?</p>
<p>Muting prevents you from seeing any notifications or top-level posts from an account. If they reply to a thread, you’ll see a section that says “Post from an account you muted” with an option to show the post. The account will not know that they have been muted.</p>
<p>What does blocking do?</p>
<p>Blocking prevents interaction. When you block an account, both you and the other account will no longer be able to see or interact with each other’s posts.</p>
<p>How do I flag abuse?</p>
<p>You can report posts by clicking on the three-dot menu. You can also report an entire account by visiting their profile and clicking the three-dot menu there.</p>
<p>Where can I read more about your plans for moderation?</p>
<p>We wrote about our approach to composable moderation <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">here</a> and we’ll continue to publish more in the near future.</p>
 Invite codes 
<p>I don’t have access to Bluesky yet. How can I get an invite code?</p>
<p>We regularly send out invites to our waitlist, which you can sign up for <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I have an invite code, how can I access Bluesky?</p>
<p>When you get an invite code, you can download Bluesky from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a>. You can also use our web app at <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>When do I get invite codes? Do they expire?</p>
<p>Most accounts receive invite codes after they’ve been on Bluesky for a while — currently, it’s once every two weeks. These codes do not expire, unless we perform a security upgrade on all codes. In that case, a security upgrade will change each invite code’s combination of letters, but it will not affect the number of codes that you have.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from that account and other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
<p>Why does Bluesky use an invite code system?</p>
<p>Invites helps us control growth of our beta as we finish building the tooling for moderation and curation. It also gives us visibility into the growing social graph. We will likely continue to use invite codes as we increase access to the app. At that time, each account will receive many more invite codes to hand out.</p>
<p>The code we use to distribute invites is open source and can be used by other server admins to grow their own communities over time as well.</p>
<p>How does the Bluesky server use the invite tree?</p>
<p>We reference the invite tree to track behavior on the social graph. For example, if we take action to moderate an account, we may revoke invite codes from other accounts in the same invite tree.</p>
 Security 
<p>How can I reset my password?</p>
<p>Click “Forgot” on the sign-in screen. You will receive an email with a reset code.</p>
<p>What if I didn’t get a password reset email?</p>
<p>If you didn’t receive a password reset email, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a>.</p>
<p>Will you implement two-factor authentication (2FA)?</p>
<p>Yes, implementing 2FA is on our short-term roadmap.</p>
 Bluesky, the AT Protocol, and Federation 
<p>What’s the difference between Bluesky and the AT Protocol?</p>
<p>Bluesky, the public benefit company, is developing two products: the <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>, and the microblogging app Bluesky. Bluesky, the app, is meant to demonstrate the features of the underlying protocol. The AT Protocol is built to support an entire ecosystem of social apps that extends beyond microblogging.</p>
<p>You can read more about the differences between Bluesky and the AT Protocol in our general FAQ <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/faq">here</a>.</p>
<p>How does federation affect me, as a user of the Bluesky app?</p>
<p>We’re prioritizing user experience and want to make Bluesky as user-friendly as possible. Regardless of which server you join, you’ll be able to see posts from people on other servers and take your data with you if you choose to move servers.</p>
<p>Is Bluesky built on a blockchain? Does it use cryptocurrency?</p>
<p>No, and no.</p>
 Miscellaneous 
<p>How can I submit feedback?</p>
<p>On the mobile app, open the left side menu and click “Feedback.” On the web app, there is a link to “Send feedback” on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>You can also email <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a> with support requests. Please do not use this email to request an invite. Instead, sign up for the waitlist <a href="https://bsky.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is a post on Bluesky called?</p>
<p>The official term is “post.”</p>
<p>How can I find friends or mutuals from other social networks?</p>
<p>Third-party developers maintain tools such as <a href="https://fedifinder.glitch.me/#t">Fedifinder</a> to find friends from other social networks.</p>
<p>Is there a dark mode?</p>
<p>Yes. You can change the display settings by clicking the crescent moon icon in your left side menu on mobile or on the right side of the desktop app. (It’s located next to the feedback button.)</p>
<p>How can I set up my domain as my handle?</p>
<p>Please refer to our tutorial <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
<p>The answers here are subject to change. We’ll update this guide regularly as we continue to release more features. Thank you for joining our beta!</p>

<p>Passkey support, our third passwordless developer option, has arrived for ODD SDK.</p> What are Passkeys? <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn API</a>, or Passkeys, is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. We'll dive more into passkeys, how they work, and how they differ from other passwordless options in this blog post, but first, let's review why developers should consider building passwordless apps.</p> The Benefits of Going Passwordless <p>There are several benefits to going passwordless for both users and developers.</p><p>1) Improved Security - This is a biggy! Machine learning is getting better at cracking passwords, and phishing attempts have gotten more sophisticated. Even the savviest users can fall prey to professional hackers. Data leaks jeopardize the exposed passwords and any accounts where users have re-used that password. App creators must have tight security when creating databases to store user passwords - the GDPR risks are enough to keep anyone up at night.</p><p>Passkeys cannot be guessed, and they are end-to-end encrypted. Phishing apps or websites created to steal users' keys won't work (unlike blockchain wallet keys) because these keys are inextricably linked to the user's device and verified by a special token (which we'll expand on in this post shortly).</p><p>2) Better User Experience - Unless a user has a subscription to a password manager (and even those can get <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/lastpass-breaches-cast-doubt-on-password-manager-safety/">compromised</a>), they have to either write down or memorize all their passwords. When they inevitably forget their password, they must go through an account recovery process that can be frustrating when the user is short on time.</p> Fission's Passwordless Options <p>App developers using <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD SDK</a> currently have two passwordless options - WebCrypto API and WalletAuth. </p><p>WebCrypto API gives the browser fairly low-level cryptographic building blocks, which include encryption and signatures. A user's private key is stored in their browser, and no one, not even the user, can extricate it. If they created their account on their laptop and want to access it on their mobile phone, they have to link their devices to do so (this is a simple process using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE protocol</a>, also part of ODD SDK). </p><p>The upsides of WebCrypto API - it's highly secure and user-friendly. There are many tools built into it for developers to use. The downside - developers need to know what they want to build ahead of time. It's like getting a box of LEGO but no directions.</p><p>WalletAuth allows developers to integrate the Metamask browser extension wallet for user sign-in. When users connect to an ODD SDK app, they can access on-chain data as usual, as well as encrypted off-chain data storage features.</p><p>The upside - it's great for Web3 dapps and Web3 users who are comfortable with blockchain wallets and want to seamlessly work with both on and off-chain data. The downside - users who are not Web3 savvy will be very intimidated by this type of login option.</p> Under the Hood <p>At the beginning of this article, we learned that WebAuthn is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. Instead of using a username and password, the user authenticates with a key stored on their device and signs some unique data with that key. </p><p>The unique data is divided into two parts: Client Data and Authenticator Data. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dictdef-collectedclientdata">Client Data</a> includes contextual information about the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-relying-party">WebAuthn Relying Party</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#client">WebAuthn Client</a>. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-authenticator-data">Authenticator Data</a> includes contextual information that derives its trustworthiness from the WebAuthn Relying Party's assessment of the security of the authenticator. </p><p>In other words, the unique data seeks to understand the relationship between the app (or specifically, the WebAuthn Relying Party who created the app) and the user (specifically, the user agent - i.e. the browser or mobile app they are using) and determines whether the app can securely verify the user. On both sides, there is a layer of abstraction to ensure privacy and trustworthiness.</p><p>After the user signs the unique data, they embed that signature and unique data into a Public Key Credential. It uses the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/">FIDO standard</a> and is a container just like JWT that formats the public key, signature, and unique data in a specific way according to the spec. </p> Passkeys in Action <p>Fission engineer Hugo Dias has spent months diving deep into the passkeys spec, learning what works across browsers and operating systems. As a result, he's put together a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">passkeys library</a> that developers can use to add passkeys support to their ODD apps. </p><p>Hugo has created two demos to demonstrate passkey syncing and sharing.</p><p>This first video shows passkeys syncing across devices with Google Password Manager. Using the Android emulator, we visit <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> (the version on Hugo's personal domain <code>hugodias.me</code>) and create a new user with a passkey-based login.</p><p>The user is now logged in on Android and can upload and access files.</p><p>Switching to Google Password Manager, we see that the passkey for <code>hugodias.me</code> has been saved and synced.</p><p>We can now switch to a desktop browser, visit the same app, and get a prompt to use a saved passkey. A pin is used to unlock.</p><p>Once logged in, we can see that the picture uploaded on mobile is accessible on a desktop web browser, synced through user WNFS files.</p><p>This second video demonstrates navigating to <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> using the Android Mobile emulator. <code>hugo-sharing</code> is logged in.</p><p>The website is a progressive web app that is installable on Android, so “Install app” is chosen from the Android Chrome browser menu.</p><p>Once installed, the ODD logo appears on the home screen. After launching, we see that <code>hugo-sharing</code> is still logged in, as it uses the same context as the website version.</p><p>Switching to the Google Photos app, the Android share function is used. Selecting the installed ODD app uploads the photo into the user’s WNFS.</p><p>The share button again uses Android native share functionality, and we can share from the installed ODD PWA app over to WhatsApp (or any other Android app). </p><p>View the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys/tree/main/examples/odd-passkeys-preact">GitHub source notes</a> for more information on these features.</p><p>You can start developing with passkeys in ODD SDK today.

 Summary 
<p>Because of the increasing popularity of digital spaces, people have slowly started to migrate towards cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s no longer uncommon for people to have an online presence, regardless of age, gender, or social status. We now have digital identities, digital meeting rooms, digital jobs, and digital entertainment. As long as there is access to the internet and people have the necessary gadgets, they will most certainly aim to create an online presence for themselves.</p>
<p>Cyberspace, also known as the metaverse, is like a parallel universe of our physical world, but with additional advantages: speed, efficiency, and flexibility. And, even though at the moment it has not reached its full potential, cyberspace can open doors to countless opportunities for knowledge and growth.</p>
<p>In spite of these amazing benefits, though, we must wonder: how well do we truly understand the concept of metaverse and the risks associated with it?</p>
<p>Cyberspace is a place filled with challenges as much as it is filled with potential and benefits. And, as individuals aiming to be part of such a complex and immersive digital space, it’s vital that we continuously educate ourselves on this topic.</p>
<p>This article strives to encompass as much vital information as possible about the fascinating world of metaverse, with all the good and the bad. Additionally, we will elaborate on SelfKey’s proposed decentralized solutions which aim to ensure the privacy and security of your digital identity as you operate in the online world.</p>

 An introduction to Metaverse 
 Metaverse and humanity 
<p>In order to operate in the digital space, individuals have to exist in. Therefore, the introduction of digital identities was something which came naturally with people’s need to belong on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every person has had an online account, somewhere, or has been listed in some digital system. This was done either by the user themselves, or by other individuals in order to keep track of records more easily. The digital realm, therefore, has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is something which almost every person seeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, advancements in modern technology have unveiled the exciting possibility of interacting with virtual objects and spaces. Venturing into the metaverse has the potential to unlock doors to new realms of knowledge. It may ignite the imagination and provide opportunities to explore aspects of the world that may otherwise be physically out of reach.</p>
<p>All in all, the metaverse may change the way we, as society, interact and educate ourselves. With all of this in mind, SelfKey strives to develop digital identity solutions that may enhance security and privacy as individuals begin to explore cyberspace.</p>
 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention. Although it is currently limited in scope, it has the potential to encompass endless possibilities in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, cyberspace can serve as a parallel existence alongside the physical world, or it can strive to provide a fully immersive virtual environment. This leaves room for many opportunities for individuals to explore and share knowledge in the metaverse.</p>
 The Benefits of Metaverse 
<p>At its core, the metaverse has tremendous potential to revolutionize various aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its capacity to serve as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, it may completely revolutionize the way we work, study, and socialize. It could facilitate many activities, such as virtual reality gaming, education, business meetings, social networking, and even virtual tourism.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the metaverse is the possibility for users to create and design avatars. This aligns with SelfKey’s idea of <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">customizable avatars</a>, which may enable individuals to design avatars in any ways they please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These avatars may enable interaction with other individuals or virtual objects in the metaverse. Furthermore, they may facilitate the creation of digital spaces that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual stores, events, and even entire cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and adoption of the metaverse may offer many potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Improved Connectivity&nbsp; 
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
 Increased Accessibility 
 Virtual Education 
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
 Streamlined Efficiency 
 
<p>Below, we will further elaborate on these advantages.</p>
 Improved Connectivity 
<p>Cyberspace allows for real-time communication and collaboration between individuals from anywhere around the world. Because physical distance is no longer an issue, individuals are able to build connections and easily collaborate on projects.&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
<p>The metaverse may offer amazing opportunities for people to engage in virtual tourism. This means that individuals may delve into virtual recreations of amazing locations from the real, physical world. Additionally, they may be able to experience completely new, fascinating fictional realms which they’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p>
 Increased Accessibility 
<p>Through the power of digital tools and endless creativity, the metaverse may become accessible from anywhere around the world. As long as there are stable internet connections, and with the proper devices, anyone could be part of this immersive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is particularly important, as it may facilitate participation for individuals with disabilities or mobility constraints.&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Education 
<p>The internet has provided access to information which surely must’ve made learning much more accessible than ever before. However, cyberspace can bring education to the next level by allowing the creation of immersive, virtual classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, individuals may be able to build realistic, interactive learning environments. This could prove to be incredibly helpful in terms of accessibility and education for young people all around the world.</p>
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
<p>By utilizing the potential of cyberspace, individuals may be able to experience unique scenarios and activities which may not be practical or possible in the physical world. For instance, they could participate in fantasy-based virtual reality games and simulations.&nbsp;</p>
 Streamlined Efficiency 
<p>The metaverse holds potential to streamline and enhance various business and organizational processes. This includes anything from meetings, training, and customer service, and it could facilitate debugging and solving particular technical issues much faster.</p>
<p>All in all, cyberspace represents a transformative landscape with far-reaching implications. It could potentially reshape the way we interact, learn, and engage with the world around us, and beyond. In spite of all these wonderful benefits, though, there are downsides to the metaverse which are worth mentioning.</p>
 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Metaverse Experience 
<p>Given the multitude of benefits cyberspace offers, it comes as no surprise that malicious actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, SelfKey proposes several decentralized solutions which may enhance security and prevent identity theft and other privacy concerns. These methods put a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The end goal is to empower individuals to confidently navigate the digital world.</p>
 SelfKey iD 
<p>An innovative online identity verification method, <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> was designed with the aim to safeguard user privacy and security. By utilizing ZK filters and AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, it strives to prevent unauthorized access to personal online accounts and systems by bots or identity thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">ZK filters</a> is to limit the amount of personal information shared when individuals interact with and engage with other individuals in digital spaces. If the shared data is limited, it may be insufficient for bad players to compromise. And this may enhance overall security and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> is utilized with the aim to deter identity thieves from accessing a user’s online accounts with the latter’s stolen digital information. Thanks to AI’s ability to detect duplicates or fake, AI-generated images, SelfKey iD may be able to combat and prevent these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may be able to enjoy the wonders of metaverse with confidence. Even more, they may ensure the privacy and security of their online persona.</p>
 SelfKey's Customizable NFTs 
<p>In the pursuit of a safer and decentralized future, SelfKey recognizes the importance of individuality. To this end, SelfKey may offer the means for individuals to embrace their uniqueness and make a mark in the metaverse through customization.</p>
<p>Through SelfKey's Customizable NFTs, also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">Normies</a>, users can attach these digital assets to their SelfKey iD. And this may allow them to express their originality and gain access to exclusive features.</p>
<p>Normies are composed of Base NFTs and Wearables, offering users countless combinations and possibilities for customization. This provides users with an ideal opportunity to create digital representations that truly reflect their own identities.</p>
 SelfKey's ENS subdomains 
<p>Last, but not least, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-ens-mass-adoption-of-self-sovereignty-on-blockchain/">SelfKey's ENS subdomains</a> strive to offer equal opportunities for individuals to own and personalize their domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of these subdomains aims to make them affordable for everyone. And to possibly ensure that each person has the opportunity to be the owner of their own digital presence.</p>
<p>By implementing these online identity security solutions, and aiming to create a secure digital environment, SelfKey is striving to contribute to a much safer digital future. The potential of cyberspace and modern technology is immense, and it’s worth being used for the good of the people.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Every day, technology reaches new heights, unlocking doors to unimaginable opportunities. However, like any innovation, there are those who will exploit it for their own gain, regardless of the harm caused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the right tools and knowledge, we may be able to prevent such occurrences.</p>
<p>The metaverse holds the power to revolutionize society and provide virtual access to knowledge like never before. But, it is essential to be aware of the accompanying risks. This way, we may navigate these remarkable digital realms safely.</p>
<p>SelfKey’s primary focus revolves around security and privacy. And every individual deserves these fundamental rights. People shouldn't have to risk their privacy and security in the pursuit of convenience or the use of modern-day technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By prioritizing security and privacy, SelfKey strives to empower individuals to embrace technology without sacrificing the safety of their digital identity.</p>

<p>Private clouds, public clouds, SaaS, on-premises and edge—as organizations leverage a more distributed, robust cloud-based strategy, they can also face more significant management and compliance challenges. This shift to the cloud may have, in many ways, left the traditional enterprise network stranded—no longer transporting the bulk of the enterprise network traffic, which now floats between the clouds and over the public internet.</p>



<p>The probable result of this widely dispersed, distributed world? Application performance is no longer guaranteed, security could be affected and the skills needed for one cloud are not always easily transferable or available in another.</p>



<p>At the same time, for many companies, their applications are their business. Regardless of the cloud provider or where users sit, these applications require dependable, secured connectivity. That’s why it’s time for a new approach, driven by the applications themselves.</p>



 The new network paradigm: Application-centric connectivity 



<p>Yesterday, we launched <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hybrid-cloud-mesh">IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh</a>, a multicloud networking solution. When it is generally available later this year, this new SaaS product is designed to allow organizations to establish simple and secured application-centric connectivity. This is engineered for network managers to seamlessly manage and scale network applications across a wide variety of public and private clouds, edge and on-premises.</p>



<p>This application-first approach is the next important networking paradigm. It’s also an evolution from the current “fat pipes” method (which doesn’t differentiate between applications) to one that aligns the network to the needs of the business, its users, and its developers, their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ci-cd-pipeline">CI/CD pipeline</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps cycles</a>. When it’s time to configure new cloud networks and connect applications, our approach is designed to turn weeks into hours and move from manual to automated processes, with robust visibility into performance and minimized risk of IAM misconfigurations.</p>



 What this means for your networks 



<p>Given the complexity of today’s networking environments, we purposely designed Hybrid Cloud Mesh around four basic attributes:</p>



 
 Simple: You’ll find a streamlined deployment process that enables automated workflows and simple network configuration that can be managed via CLI or an intuitive UI. 



 Secured: Critical for today’s business, you’ll find <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a>, along with segmentation and micro-segmentation. 



 Scalable: Scalable to large enterprise environments, you also have the ability to scale resources based on demand. 



 Seamless: Designed to reduce the barriers between clouds and teams, you can manage services across clouds, with on-demand, intent-driven application-centric connectivity. 
 



 Components of Hybrid Cloud Mesh 



<p>Two main architecture components are key to how the product is designed to work.</p>



 
 Gateways, which act as virtual routers and connectors. These are centrally managed through Mesh Manager and deployed both in the cloud and on customer premises. 



 The Mesh Manager provides the centralized management and control plane for Hybrid Cloud Mesh through a SaaS portal. 
 



<p>Both Gateways and the Mesh Manager are designed to communicate through a set of open, secured APIs and interfaces.</p>



<p>Hybrid Cloud Mesh is engineered to complement existing SD-WANs, service mesh and multicloud networking solutions. You’ll also find crucial benefits that can include the following:</p>



 
 Auto-discovery of cloud infrastructure and applications using the Gateways described above, deployed next to applications both in the cloud and on customer premises. 



 A single centralized management and control plane for your multicloud deployments and sites through Mesh Manager. 



 Addressing silos between CloudOps and DevOps through automated workflows and a shared overlay, enabling rapid application deployment and optimization. 



 A “network follows the application” paradigm that establishes application-level connectivity to streamline application migration to the cloud and moves the network wherever the application is placed. 



 Zero-trust architecture that seamlessly enables end-to-end encryption across the network from application component to application component. 



 Application network optimization with granular visibility and control of application-level connectivity. This is done by streamlining telemetry, root cause analysis and reconfiguration. It provides an intuitive overlay to help address performance issues and generate traffic engineering recommendations.

<p>The global decentralized identity market was valued at $285 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $6.82 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 88.7% during the forecast period, according to a new report by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/10/27/2543009/0/en/Global-Decentralized-Identity-Market-Size-Projected-to-Reach-US-6-822-million-by-2027-Report-by-MarketsandMarkets.html">MarketsandMarkets™.</a> This exponential growth is due to increased security breaches, identity-related fraud incidents, the inefficiency of existing identity management practices, and the lack of end-user control over identity usage.</p>
<p>In today’s highly connected and digital world, secure customer interactions have become a top concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. With the increasing use of digital services, the need for secure and reliable identity verification processes has become more pressing. This is where decentralized identity and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes come into play.</p>
<p>What does decentralized identity mean?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is a system of identity management based on decentralized and distributed technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks. This system, in theory, will provide a digital identity that is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or corporation. Instead, it is managed by the individual who owns it. This allows the individual to then share only the necessary aspects of their identity to validate themselves in order to interact with different organizations and services online; once the transaction is completed, they can retract their personal identity information if they wish to. Decentralized identity is not yet globally viable, but there are many organizations and governments working to make it real.</p>
<p>What does Know Your Customer (KYC) mean?</p>
<p>KYC is a process used by financial institutions and other organizations to verify the identity of their clients. This is done to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations, as well as to protect against fraud and other financial crimes.</p>
<p>The traditional KYC process involves collecting and storing large amounts of personal information about clients, including their name, date of birth, address, and government-issued ID. This information is often stored in centralized databases that can be attacked by bad actors, making it vulnerable to data breaches and other security threats.</p>
<p>Decentralized KYC processes have the potential to revolutionize the way personal information is managed and verified. By using decentralized identity, individuals can store their identity information in a secure digital wallet that is owned and controlled by them, sharing only parts of their identity as and when needed.</p>
<p>How does decentralized identity benefit organizations?</p>
<p>By adopting decentralized identity, organizations can achieve:</p>
 
 Enhanced security<br>
One of the most significant benefits is enhanced security. Identity systems store identity data on a blockchain, which is a tamper-proof and secure distributed ledger. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means that identity data is not stored in a central location, which reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft. This is a significant benefit for organizations that store sensitive personal information, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies. 
 
 
 Streamlined identity verification processes<br>
In traditional identity verification systems, individuals often have to repeat the same verification process with multiple organizations. This is time-consuming and can be frustrating. With the adoption of decentralized identity, individuals can share verified identity information with multiple organizations without having to repeat the verification process. This not only saves time, but also reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies in identity information. 
 
 
 Reduced costs<br>
With decentralized identity, organizations no longer need to store, manage, and verify identity data themselves. From a cost perspective, this can be particularly beneficial for smaller organizations that do not have the resources to build and maintain their own identity verification systems and also reduce the costs associated with fraud prevention and compliance, as it provides a secure way to authenticate identities. 
 
 
 Improved user experience: seamless onboarding<br>
Instead of having to fill out long and complicated forms, users can quickly and easily share their decentralized identity with a business, which speeds up account opening. This can improve the overall customer experience and reduce the likelihood of users abandoning the onboarding process. 
 
<p>To summarize, decentralized identity and KYC are two important concepts that are changing the way we think about online identity and security. By allowing individuals to control and manage their own digital identities, and by decentralizing the KYC process, we can create a more secure, transparent, and efficient online ecosystem. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they hold great promise for the future of digital identity and security.</p>

<p>Are you wondering what it’s like to facilitate a remote design sprint? Are you searching for ways to make your sprint work? If yes, then this post is for you! If not, no problem; you can still enjoy the tales of a designer going through his first remote design sprint&nbsp;😀</p><p>I’m a Senior Product Designer at Onfido, an identity verification provider. We used a design sprint format to validate an idea that wasn’t part of our quarterly objectives. Going through the sprint process aligned stakeholders on the overall goal and made everyone part of the solution.</p><p>As you might know already, the design sprint process <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint">is well documented</a>, and you can find plenty of resources across the World Wide Web. So I decided that I would add up to the pile myself! I listed the most useful resources at the end. Suppose you’re searching for good material to prepare for your sprint. Hopefully, you find the following bits of advice and learnings useful for yourself.</p>Screenshot of the completed Miro board&nbsp;:D Preparation is&nbsp;key   Make it easy for yourself to facilitate. Prep in advance for every voting activity, timer, board, etc. You should be able to arrive at the activity and know the steps to follow just by seeing the board. I used this template made by Jake Knapp and Stéph Cruchon 👉 <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/">https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/</a>. I did modify it to include process information like timing and number of votes per&nbsp;person.  Remote means you’ll be on Zoom (video call) all day. PLAN LOTS OF BREAKS! I think it goes without saying, but a 10–15min break can save so much mental space and keep focus and attention from your sprint team. It can also give people space to answer some Slack messages, emails, you know&nbsp;… manage their “real work”. One every hour, give or take, is what we implemented and felt&nbsp;nice.  Keep the book near you! Or any activity reference on your computer. You don’t need to know everything because you will forget them anyway. Before each session, I would skim through the reference to refresh my memory. That helped me be more knowledgeable of the task and be able to give directives easily.  When the facilitator forgets the only material&nbsp;needed…<p>Quick fun fact: I only asked one thing for the team to prepare. Have A4 white paper and a black pen for the Sketching day. 15min before the sketching exercise, I realise… I don’t have A4 paper myself 🤦 So I ran to buy a block of 360 A4 paper… (sorry for the “ill”, I was “race walking” and typing on my phone). Told you you’re going to forget&nbsp;things!</p> Being adaptable is priceless   Problems will surely arise, and you need to be ok dealing with them. A debate that goes for too long, an unplanned drop-out, an unavailable expert/user,&nbsp;… the list goes on. Whatever you plan will be put to the test. Knowing things will change allows you to remove the pressure of perfection. Keep in mind that the sprint must go&nbsp;on!  It is fine to have a break in the middle of an activity to check things (I learned that from trying to be a dungeon master 😉). If you don’t know something, take a 5min break and check your reference or find a solution to the problem. No shame in saying, “Sorry, I don’t know how to proceed right now; let’s have a small break so that I can review the process.” Another solution is to ask your group! How would they prefer to solve the issue? How would they change the activity? What information do they need?&nbsp;…  <p>Not so-quick fact: On Wednesday, you decide many things, from the solution to the flow of the prototype itself. And be sure that your team members will try to modify the decision you made 30 minutes, 1 hour ago. During the storyboarding activity, our group was stuck on “what ifs” and “why not change that”, deep inside conversations about very specific and technical subjects. I was boiling inside as the decisions weren’t happening! Seeing that we were not going anywhere, I put a hard stop on conversations and gave a 10min break for everyone. It allowed me to take a breather, think and regain the lead of the conversation. Sometimes cutting short helps you move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Time pressure is a stress you will experience. The best advice I can give is: “If you are in a hurry, then slow down.” (unsure where this quote comes from, either from a German or Chinese proverb if you ask&nbsp;Google)</p> The importance of the team you&nbsp;choose   As important as picking an impactful challenge, you need the right people in your team. A person who cares about the issue will show engagement and motivation. These are powerful drivers to have a successful sprint. Team members will stay focused, engage in conversations, and overall put energy into doing things&nbsp;well.  Perspective diversity should come with relevant team members. I’m glad that everyone in the sprint shared and learned something! Humans are curious by nature, so having different points of view will generate engagement through learning and rewards through&nbsp;sharing.  Having people with specific skills can help you design a feasible solution. Luckily we had 2–3 engineers in our team that helped us create a close-to-reality prototype! An interactive, half-coded prototype through Framer suited our use case. You shouldn’t base your choice on this,&nbsp;though.   Engage the team when you&nbsp;can   Within exercises, give them roles or ask them to do some tasks. <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide">The bible for remote design sprint</a> referenced below advises it. That was also the first feedback I received on the first day: “When you organise post-its or move things from one board to another, you can ask the group to help. You don’t have to do it by yourself! It’ll save time.” And they were right! I decided to involve them more in the day-to-day logistics. Involving them lowered my stress level and slightly improved their attention and engagement in the activity.  Make each person in the team shine during the week. Everyone has a skill or personality trait that can make the week easier or the work better! An engineer solving a problem? Give them a shout-out at the end of the day. Does a Product Manager have the best voice and temper for testing? Allow them to interview. A very knowledgeable team member? Give them 30min to expose their knowledge.  Let them shine even outside of activities! I used Chat GPT to create “inspirational sentences” for every day of the week. One in the morning within an automated Slack message and one at the end of the day in the meeting. This person in our group started to ask for a sentence written in a specific style (like pirate or medieval), which resulted in some excellent impressions and stylistic reading of these quotes. I started to ask them what style did they want each day as well as leaving this person have a little show. That was a great moment between the team and perfect to end each day on a positive&nbsp;note!  <p>Thursday’s end-of-the-day 🤖 chat GPT quote in an evangelist priest&nbsp;style:</p>ChatGPT conversation to create an inspirational sentence for my design sprint team on Thursday after finishing a prototype in one afternoon. TIPS: don’t use the word “quote” if you want something like this. Otherwise, it will get you a quote from someone, not “create&nbsp;one”.<blockquote>Hallelujah, my brothers and sisters! Let us gather ‘round and bear witness to the miracle that is about to unfold before us. For in this very afternoon, through our unwavering faith and tireless labor, we shall bring forth a prototype that shall reign supreme and conquer all doubters! So let us join our hearts and minds together, and let the power of our convictions guide our hands as we march towards glory!&nbsp;Amen!”</blockquote><p>Was our solution the perfect one? No. Did the week help us validate our idea? Mostly. Did we all learn something? Absolutely! This is a reminder that a design sprint is not a process in which you will end up with a fully ready-to-build product. Insights and learnings are the primary output. These will inform a product decision; iterating or building. In our case, we learned that our direction was good, but we needed to refine the solution&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Overall facilitating a design sprint is an excellent exercise for designers. The one we did was a one-off “bubble week” for me. By that, I meant facilitating a design sprint for a team I didn’t work in. This allowed a focus on the process and facilitation aspect of product&nbsp;design.</p><p>Ultimately you practice leading exercises, people and projects using lots of communication skills. Product design is about working with different people, so these skills are useful! I encourage everyone to try a design sprint; it’s a great experience! And obviously, have fun with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thanks for reading&nbsp;🙂</p><p>Sharing is caring!

In this role, my main duties include: developing social media and marketing strategies to drive engagement and increase followers; creating content and campaigns; analyzing social listening and monitoring data; and conducting internal and external communications, including but not limited to media, KOLs, partners, exchanges, and event organizers.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains is the fact that it has remained focused on Decentralized Identities (DID) and building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 for the past five years. We employ an exceptional tech team and a devoted marketing and business development team, who are dedicated to our overall&nbsp;vision.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Ontology offers individuals new opportunities, bringing awareness to DID and giving users back control in order to manage their own personal data and online identities.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>While I have reached many notable milestones throughout my time at Ontology, the most prominent is building our global community from 3 languages to over 30+ languages worldwide. Additionally, the creation of the Harbinger program is an important moment in my career to date. Essentially, it is a network of passionate blockchain and Web3 lovers and contributors. Launched in 2020, it has played a major part in helping us build a strong global community presence.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I’m most excited for more applications for DID and users owning and having complete control over their own data and identities.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the future, I anticipate that Ontology will be leading Web3 when it comes to DID. For Web3 more generally, I expect to see mass adoption of Web3 technologies. Just like we witnessed with Web2 and the rapid growth of smartphones and social media, individuals will realize that it’s essential to adopt this technology and understand what it can&nbsp;offer.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-head-of-social-media-christina-lu-7db02fe1cad0">Meet the Team: Head of Social Media, Christina Lu</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The estimated global crypto ownership rate is around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-data/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20we%20estimated,420%20million%20crypto%20users%20worldwide.">4.2%</a>, with more than 420 million crypto users worldwide. Although Hong Kong falls beyond the global average with an ownership percentage of 2.35%, more than 175,000 people own cryptocurrency there.</p><p>With the new regulations are set to come into place in June 2023. Industry experts, analysts, large investors, individual participants, and crypto enthusiasts — all are busy assessing potential challenges and opportunities that lie on this regulated road&nbsp;ahead.</p> Understanding the new&nbsp;climate <p>The new regulations come with the final guidelines for crypto exchanges looking to launch in Hong Kong this&nbsp;May.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://wp.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/20230427_Synopsis-CEO-at-Bloomberg-APAC-Policy-Series-English.pdf">regulatory synopsis</a> issued on 27th April 2023 by Ms. Julia Leung, the CEO of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, the SFC is “working with global counterparts to set baseline standards to regulate centralized virtual asset exchanges for adoption in major markets.”</p><p>The commission held public consultations on crypto exchange regulations last year to determine the best way for retail investors to access cryptocurrencies. It also wanted to test the feasibility of offering crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the geography. Indicating considerable buzz for the framework to come into place, the SFC received over 150 responses from the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The new regulations are also considered a milestone as they would let investors trade in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from June 1st this&nbsp;year.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Current crypto situation <p>The new regulations will considerably impact the crypto climate in Hong Kong, presenting a significant market opportunity for the crypto industry. According to Chainanalysis, cryptocurrency values received by internet addresses in Hong Kong were around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/hong-kongs-crypto-push-sets-up-race-bottom-2022-11-22/">US$70 billion</a> in the first half of 2022&nbsp;alone.</p> The New Regulations <p>The new regulations come under the legislative purview of the ‘Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Bill&nbsp;2022.”</p><p>According to its stated <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">objectives</a>, the bill wants to amend the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinances (AMLO) to establish a licensing system for Virtual Asset Service Providers and apply the customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements under Schedule 2 to AMLO to&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Once the new regulations come into effect, crypto-related service providers will require an SFC license to operate in Hong Kong. And to obtain a license, they would have to furnish a detailed plan for combating money laundering risks and protecting their investors from such breaches and intrusions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1656109508668653570?s=20">Image Source</a><p>In a broader sense, the new regulations would help set standards and benchmarks for crypto regulations in Hong Kong, a region actively pursuing the goal of becoming a crypto hub — not only in Asia but at a global scale — for some time&nbsp;now.</p><p>Numbers suggest that over<a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/"> 80</a> foreign and Mainland China companies have already expressed interest in setting up their Web3 company through this licensing mechanism. The interest indicates positivity towards norms that advocate system regularization and protection of investor rights and interests.</p> Comparison With Previous Regulatory Frameworks <p>Many new regulations often come at the cost of destabilizing the traditional system, but that is not the case with the Hong Kong crypto licensing rules, as it would subject providers to the same AML and counter-terrorist financing legislation that traditional financial institutions follow. Hence, one can expect a seamless or at least considerably less friction in the transformative process when it becomes effective from June 1st&nbsp;onwards.</p> Implications for Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Although the new regime is set to come into effect from June 2023, at least <a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/">23 businesses</a>, out of the 80 that expressed interest, according to Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury Christopher Hui, are already setting up their presence in Hong Kong. And these 23 not only include crypto exchanges but Web3 security companies, blockchain payment providers, blockchain infrastructure builders, and&nbsp;more.</p> Adaptation strategies of local exchanges <p>Adapting to the imminent regulatory shifts and challenges could be easy for local exchanges by fulfilling the core demand: exhibiting the capability to perform due diligence on their customers and meet Hong Kong’s AML and anti-terrorist financing standards. Only then would it become easier to receive a&nbsp;license!</p> Potential challenges and opportunities <p>The potential challenge may arise from something common to most of the transformative processes worldwide: arranging provisions for compliance and setting up a robust mechanism for conducting adequate due diligence. It involves upskilling the existing compliance team. The team needs to become aware and set up the system following what has been asked&nbsp;for.</p><p>What awaits providers at the end of the compliance and diligence tunnel are enhanced trust from consumers, increased transparency in the system, and the scope of a pumped-up audience&nbsp;base.</p><p>The Hong Kong authorities are also coming out with increased support for virtual asset service providers willing to pass through this regime. For instance, Hong Kong has allocated <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">HK$50 million</a> in its annual budget spending to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Comparative analysis with other jurisdictions <p>Similar to Hong Kong, a lot of adjacent and global jurisdictions are also proactively taking up the job of regulating virtual assets and the Web3 economy. And crypto entrepreneurs believe that when compared to Singapore and South Korea, Hong Kong’s new crypto regulations would be much similar to Singapore’s approach. Both are focused on protecting investors, institutional and retail&nbsp;alike.</p> Global and Asian Crypto&nbsp;Climate <p>Like Singapore and South Korea, being part of the Asia continent helps Hong Kong become a participant in the most thriving crypto market globally. Out of more than 420 million estimated crypto owners worldwide, more than 260 million are from the Asian market&nbsp;itself.</p> Key trends in global cryptocurrency adoption <p>It has to be kept in mind that Asia is also the most populous geographic region among continents in the world. However, other continents are also picking up speed in terms of gaining adoption and traction.</p><p>The number of owners in North America is more than 54 million, followed by Africa (38 million+), South America (33 million+), Europe (31 million+), and Oceania (15 million+).</p><p>In Asia, while regions like Singapore and Hong Kong are keen to encourage growth in the Web3 ecosystem, some countries like South Korea want to tread cautiously. Hong Kong, on the other hand, is moving forward in a structured way. The current exchange licensing system will be followed by stablecoin regulations in&nbsp;2024.</p> Influence of international regulations <p>Along with its Asian counterparts, there are many countries or regions which are considering introducing similar regulatory systems.</p><p>For instance, the European Parliament has already approved the first set of comprehensive rules to regulate cryptocurrency markets, known as MiCA or Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.</p><p>Dubai has also set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as a unique body regulating Virtual assets across&nbsp;Dubai.</p><p>All these international regulatory institutions are expected to duly influence the crypto market in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU Parliament Greenflags MiCA — Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape</a></p> History of Cryptocurrency in Hong&nbsp;Kong <p>Hong Kong, for some time now, has been looked at as one of the most preferred crypto destinations in the world. In fact, the <a href="https://forexsuggest.com/worldwide-crypto-readiness-report/">Worldwide Crypto Readiness Report</a> termed Hong Kong as the most crypto-ready location in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In 2022, Hong Kong topped the charts in all categories, including the number of blockchain startups per 100,000 people and the number of crypto ATMs proportional to the population. The region was ahead of some of the most thriving global economies, including the US and Switzerland.</p><p>Over the years, multiple local crypto companies have emerged in the region, such as Kikitrade, Saxo Crypto Products, MYETHSHOP, CoinUnited.io, and other cryptocurrency trading and educational platforms, hubs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Regulatory Framework and Government Initiatives <p>We have already discussed the form and potential use cases of the upcoming crypto licensing mechanism in Hong Kong. It is also to be noted that the region’s AMLO aligns with the global recommendations of FATF. It requires VASPs across countries to adhere to an anti-money laundering benchmark in countering fraud, breaches, and financing terrorism regulations.</p><p>The Securities and Futures Commission is the primary body looking after the execution of the imminent licensing regime in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <p>Founded in 1989, the Commission’s job is to work as an independent statutory body to regulate Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets. Its principal responsibilities are to maintain and promote fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency, and orderliness in the securities and futures industry.</p> Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) <p>One of the most crucial legislations that the SFC is bothered with in regulating the crypto industry is the <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">AMLO</a>. In the Hong Kong special administrative region, the legislation comes with an ordinance. The ordinance amends the laws to apply customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to virtual asset service providers.</p> Government support and initiatives <p>While regulations are set in place, the Hong Kong government is also keen to keep its support window open for the holistic growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Cyberport came up with Web3@Cyberport in the early half of the 2023–24 financial year. According to the <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">official budget document</a>, HK$50 million was allocated to expedite the Web3 ecosystem development by “organizing major international seminars” and promoting “cross-sectoral business cooperation.”</p> Collaboration with Mainland&nbsp;China <p>When it comes to calibrating the region’s crypto strategies with that of Mainland China, Xiao Feng, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Crypto exchange HashKey, believes that the Hong Kong government’s emphasis is on practicing different laws from mainland China under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.</p> Market Opportunities and Key&nbsp;Players <p>The<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/List-of-licensed-virtual-asset-trading-platforms"> SFC list</a> of licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong includes OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited. Invariably the list of such exchanges is set to grow in the coming days, with local exchanges coming up in accordance with the regime and increasing their market share and accelerating growth.</p><p>Brands like Hex Trust, fully licensed, insured digital asset custodians, are also active in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>NUTS Finance is a blockchain development lab active in Hong Kong that focuses on building secure, composable, open-source technology to enable decentralized finance services. DTTD, another Hong Kong-based service, makes managing NFTs across multiple crypto wallets easy. Xversem, a Hong Kong-located service, aims at building effective Bitcoin wallets for Web3. Hong Kong-based Pictta is a mobile-first, gasless, and social-enabled NFT marketplace.</p><p>Such examples are many, and the bouquet of such service &amp; product companies is bound to grow in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Risks <p>It is evident that implementing the licensing mechanism will come with its share of challenges and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Any new regulation introduced in an existing market is bound to create friction in the system. Companies will have to exhibit to the regulators and their consumers that they can do due diligence and protect the investor from potential hacks, attacks, breaches, laundering, and other possible mismanagement of funds. At the same time, they will have to comply with global benchmarks for protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Necessarily, it would have to be a consistent effort, demanding a fixed cost to be incurred by businesses every quarter. There are chances that occasional volatility in an emergent market like crypto will take a toll on the company’s bottom line. It is essential to have efficient fund management practices in place so that companies do not lack in their compliance and diligence efforts.</p><p>The People’s Republic of China’s <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-digital-yuan-its-environment-design-and-implications">Digital Yuan</a> promised to achieve a “relatively high degree of financial inclusion” and aid in developing “various large-scale financial platforms” that reduce the cost of providing financial services. Its presence could also play a decisive role in shaping the future of crypto services in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Future Outlook and&nbsp;Trends <p>Despite all these potential challenges, Hong Kong is looking toward a brighter future in crypto services. Blockchain and DeFi are high-potential areas with a lot to offer to people who still lack access to traditional finance&nbsp;avenues.</p><p>Merging of blockchain and crypto services to the traditional finance functions of lending and borrowing, underwriting, etc., have already started. One only needs to be careful of promises made to promote the new economic order that Web3 has the power to introduce through the decentralization route.</p> Final Note <p>The imminent regulations and licensing regimes in Hong Kong present both risks and opportunities to the crypto investor and user communities.</p><p>While regulatory compliance may lower the speed of innovation and pump up costs, the investors stand to gain from a more protective atmosphere in general. There is also the scope for businesses to enjoy long-term premiums by offering enhanced trust and transparency.</p><p>Every stakeholder must stay updated on the shifts and changes happening in the regime. It always helps steer ahead in an evolving market with less friction and optimal cost-efficiency.</p> Mickey and the Hong Kong Crypto&nbsp;Quest  Additional Resources <p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-d47fcbd59076">The Shyft Perspective: Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			  Lautaro Giambroni is Product Owner&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hi there! I’m Lautaro Giambroni, a Product Owner at Tokeny. I’m 27 years old and was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I earned my engineering degree there and later pursued a master’s degree in financial markets in Spain.<br>
<br>
From a young age, I’ve been interested in how technology and digital products shape the world and improve people’s lives. It’s a passion that has driven me to continue my career in this field, and in recent years, I’ve been closely following the exciting developments in the blockchain space.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked in various companies related to the financial and banking sector. As a UX designer, product manager, and innovation consultant, I gained experience and insights into the industry. However, I couldn’t help but notice the outdated structures and practices that seemed to hinder innovation in the sector.<br>
<br>
Seeking to make a real impact, I came across Tokeny. What really stood out to me was the innovative approach to leveraging blockchain technology to transform financial operations in companies, as well as their commitment to bringing the benefits of blockchain to society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working here is an awesome experience. The best part is the team I get to work with, who are not only highly skilled but also share the same passion to make finance easy-to-access and efficient for everyone via our leading tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work we do is demanding, but it’s also highly rewarding. Our product is growing at a fast pace, and keeping up with the disruptive innovations in the DeFi industry can be a challenge. However, seeing the team’s hard work come to fruition after a release makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Being part of a company that is driving real change in the industry is something I’m grateful for every day. The tech industry is an exciting place to be, and being part of a team that is leading the way is truly amazing.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are two things that really ignite my passion: meeting new cultures and learning new skills. I’ve had the opportunity to live in different countries, and that experience has fueled my desire to explore new places, try new foods, and meet people from all walks of life. In addition to that, I’m always looking to learn new skills. Whether it’s taking up a new hobby or improving my professional background, I’m eager to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. Lately, I’ve been getting into surfing, and I started practicing analogic photography.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it’s important to stay curious and keep pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Life is all about growth and learning, and I’m passionate about embracing that journey and seeing where it takes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Over the past decade, my home country has faced one of the worst financial crises in its recent history, marked by high unemployment rates, inflation, and a lack of economic stability. This has caused many young people, including myself, to leave in search of a better future. It’s a difficult reality that I would love to see change.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that decentralized finance could have an impact. Especially in a country where the monetary policy has been mismanaged, and lack of transparency has led to a loss of trust in local currency. Ultimately, my dream is to contribute to creating better conditions for the people in my home country.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>As a future Tokeny employee, you will have the opportunity to learn and grow as a professional in a dynamic and innovative environment. We work hard to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of tokenization, and we’re constantly looking for new ways to innovate and make a difference.<br>
<br>
So, my advice to any prospective employee is simple: join the team and be prepared to work hard, learn a lot, and make a real difference in the world of tokenization. We will be excited to have you on board!<br>
</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me the most about Tokeny’s future is the tremendous potential for growth in the tokenization market. Over the past few years, we’ve seen significant growth in this space, and it’s estimated that the market will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Being part of a company at the forefront of this market is truly amazing. Our platform is designed to empower firms seeking to digitize their operations and benefit from the latest advancements in technology.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Decentralized Identities in all their facets have been a hot topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 (EIC)</a>, which ran in Berlin last week. Just a few days before, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/12/linkedin-and-microsoft-entra-introduce-a-new-way-to-verify-your-workplace/">announced</a> their support for Verified Workplace in LinkedIn using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a>.</p>
<p>Verifying the workplace</p>
<p>What Microsoft announced is focused on a particular use case, the verification of workplaces of LinkedIn members. It builds on multi-step verification.</p>
<p>The entry level is workplace email verification. There is little friction in that. Organizations can verify the work mail of their employees based on a lightweight WebApp adding to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID service, which again requires a Microsoft Entra Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Factually, this allows issuing verified credentials/IDs based on Azure AD or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Microsoft also will provide, together with its partner Clear, a government identity verification and binding to this. This adds another level of proof.</p>
<p>The third step then is a wallet for professionals that, in the first phase, can accept verified credentials. Enterprises can issue credentials to their employees that can be shared with LinkedIn or to Microsoft Authenticator for verification beyond LinkedIn. This thus integrates both the Microsoft Authenticator and LinkedIn – relying parties that are talking to the Authenticator also can talk to LinkedIn and the Authenticator can be used for extended verification scenarios.</p>
<p>Microsoft is basing this on the (still emerging set of) standards around decentralized identity, making it interoperable.</p>
<p>The first step into practice and towards critical mass</p>
<p>While the announcement is focused on a specific use case, it is an important step forward towards the ubiquitous use of decentralized identities:</p>
 
 It demonstrates a concrete, practical application of decentralized identities. 
 It builds on standards for interoperability. 
 It is supported by a growing partner ecosystem. 
 It neatly integrates with Microsoft Entra (including Azure Active Directory), LinkedIn, etc., and can be integrated with further solutions. 
 It provides concrete value to the users. 
 It helps in creating a critical mass of users. 
 
<p>At the EIC, I’ve illustrated my talk about decentralized identity in the enterprise with the employee and partner onboarding use case, where a verified government ID is used for initial onboarding and proofs of employment and job title/role are used for partner onboarding. In the public preview, Microsoft is demonstrating such a use case in combination with Entitlement Management, a feature within Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing broader adoption of the Decentralized Identity model across the globe. Approaches such as the one announced by Microsoft can help it happen earlier.</p>

 A Step-by-Step Guide! <p>Embarking on your DeFi journey with Ontology just got easier! With the power of iZUMi Finance, you can now swap your ONG for ONT in a few simple steps. This guide will walk you through the process, helping you navigate the decentralized exchange (DEX) like a pro. So, whether you’re a seasoned DeFi enthusiast or a newcomer to the space, let’s get started and master the art of swapping!</p> Three steps on how to turn ONG into ONT via the&nbsp;DEX:  Step 1: Transfer ONG (Ontology) to ONG (ORC20) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a>, connect non-EVM wallet and EVM wallet. You should see your wallet address displayed once&nbsp;done.    Click the ONG Transfer button as shown in the figure&nbsp;below.  Choose Non-EVM from the Wallet column (Your native address will be recognized automatically then) and fill in the EVM address (To which ORC-20 ONG will be&nbsp;sent)  Click “Transfer” when everything is good, make sure you have enough ONG for the gas fee (0.05 ONG each transaction).   Step 2: Use iziSwap to swap ONG (ORC-20) to WONT&nbsp;(ORC-20)   Go to: <a href="https://izumi.finance/trade/swap">https://izumi.finance/trade/swap</a>, locate in the top right corner and click the “Connect Wallet” button to connect metamask wallet. Also, switch to “Ontology” in your wallet’s network settings.  Time to swap “ONG” into “WONT”. The top token or “from” placeholder depicts the token you own (ONG in this scenario), while the second token or “to” placeholder represents the token you receive (WONT in this scenario) after the successful swap.  Double check the amount you want to swap and make sure you prepare enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.5 ONG for each transaction).  Click swap and confirm the transaction. If the transaction is successful, a message will appear in the bottom right corner of the&nbsp;page.   Step 3: Bridge WONT (ORC20) to ONT (Ontology) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a> again.This time we should use Token&nbsp;Bridge.  Let’s choose “WONT” in the assets list and ensure the asset will be bridged from ORC-20 into Ontology&nbsp;native.  Double check the amount and make sure you have enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.15 ONG normally).  Click Swap and confirm the transaction. You ONT will be available in a short&nbsp;time.   About iZUMi&nbsp;Finance <p><a href="https://izumi.finance/home">iZUMi Finance</a> is a DeFi protocol providing one-stop Liquidity as a Service (LaaS), dedicated to building a top DEX and providing liquidity service on ZK-rollups and multi-chains. iZUMi Finance has two products, iZiSwap and LiquidBox. iZiSwap is the first and top on-chain Order Book DEX driven by iZUMi’s innovative DL-AMM and peer-to-pool Order Book design, providing CEX experience to DEX users on Layer 2.

<p><a href="http://www.entrust.com/vmc">Entrust Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to create a more immersive and personalized email experience by displaying their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside emails. This helps them elevate their brand and stand out in their prospects’ crowded inbox. Because VMCs are linked with DMARC technology, they also potentially reduce email spoofing.</p>
<p>Entrust started working on VMCs in June 2017. Entrust is proud to have issued the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2019/verified-mark-certificates#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20the%20first%20certification,for%20organizations%20that%20support%20VMCs.">world’s first VMC</a> (in Sept 2019), <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2020/07/why-googles-verified-mark-certificates-pilot-matters/">performed a pilot with Gmail (in July 2020)</a>, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20proud%20to%20announce,national%20IT%20agency%2C%20Statens%20IT.">issued the world’s first Government Mark Certificate (in March 2023)</a>. Entrust has also partnered with Red Sift to offer organizations an integrated BIMI solution to enhance their email security and boost their brand recognition in the inbox.</p>
<p>Now, Gmail has included an additional benefit to email senders and users in the Gmail desktop web browser UI – a new checkmark icon that proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot. This new checkmark is only available when DMARC and VMC are both implemented.</p>
<p>This first image shows how the new checkmark icon will appear in the Gmail application “detail message” view.&nbsp; The checkmark is shown in white against a blue badge, to the right of the VMC logo and the sender’s display name:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new tool tip that displays the following confirmation text when a user hovers over the checkmark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you see, the tool tip message confirms that the email sender has verified that it owns its email domain and logo as specified in the VMC.</p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/05/expanding-gmail-security-BIMI.html?m=0">Gmail is actively rolling out this VMC checkmark icon now</a>, so all desktop web browser Gmail users should see these new icons soon. Gmail has not yet announced how this might appear in mobile environments but Entrust expects there will be coordination of Gmail UIs across their other environments.</p>
<p>This checkmark icon is a good visual cue for recipients to identify verified email senders. Entrust strongly supports this new VMC enhancement and believes it will be embraced by email senders and users.</p>

<p>Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA), is a security measure used to verify a person’s identity by asking them to provide specific information that only they should know.<br>
How Does Knowledge-Based Authentication Work?<br>
The idea is that these questions serve as a block for other individuals who should not know the user’s private information but which the user has immediate knowledge of (and does not have to memorize).</p>
<p>KBA questions can be generated in two primary approaches: static and dynamic.</p>
<p>Static KBA<br>
Static approaches involve selecting a set of predetermined questions that users can choose from when setting up their KBA. These questions are often personal, referring to highly personalized experiences or preferences that would be difficult for an attacker to guess without directly knowing the user.</p>
<p>Examples of static KBA questions include:</p>
 
 What is your mother’s maiden name? 
 What was the name of your first pet? 
 In what city were you born? 
 What is your favorite book? 
 
<p>These questions are typically selected during user onboarding. Later, when the user accesses the account, they are asked to provide the answers to those same questions.</p>
<p>Dynamic KBA<br>
Dynamic approaches, as a form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/adaptive-authentication/">adaptive authentication</a>, will generate questions based on information from various data sources tied to the user, such as public records, credit reports, or social media profiles. The system uses algorithms to select relevant, personalized questions only the user should know. Examples of dynamic KBA questions include:</p>
 
 Which of the following addresses have you lived at in the past? 
 What was the name of your elementary school? 
 Which of these phone numbers have you previously used? 
 What bank/financial institution/auto lender do you have a loan/bank account/credit account with? 
 
<p>The generation process for dynamic KBA questions typically involves data aggregation and analysis to create a set of potential questions.</p>
<p>Both static and dynamic KBA have their pros and cons, with static KBA being more straightforward to implement but potentially less secure due to the limited set of questions. Dynamic KBA is more secure since it generates personalized questions based on the user’s unique background. Still, it requires access to reliable data sources and can be more complex to implement.</p>
 How Effective Is Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>KBA can provide a reasonable level of security in cases where it is used with other authentication methods. As a standalone method, however, it has some limitations.<br>
Some of the critical issues with KBA include:</p>
 
 Guessable Answers: Answers to static KBA questions may be easy to guess or research using publicly available information, such as social media profiles, online directories, or leaked data from breaches. This makes KBA more susceptible to attacks by determined adversaries. 
 Data Breaches: If an organization suffers a data breach, the answers to KBA questions may be compromised, rendering the KBA process ineffective for affected users. 
 Knowledge and Memory: Users might need to remember their answers, leading to account lockouts and frustration. Additionally, users might give easy-to-guess or common answers that are easier to guess. 
 Social Engineering: Attackers can use techniques like phishing or pretexting, to trick users into revealing the answers to their KBA questions. 
 
<p>Due to these limitations, KBA is generally considered less secure than other authentication methods like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) or biometrics. While it can still serve as an additional layer of security, organizations are increasingly adopting more advanced and secure authentication methods to protect user accounts and sensitive information better.</p>
 Is Knowledge-Based Authentication Used in Multi-Factor Authentication? 
<p>MFA requires users to present multiple factors to verify their identity before granting access to a system, application, or resource.</p>
<p>These factors are typically classified into three categories:</p>
 
 Knowledge: This factor includes information that only the user should know, such as passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or answers to knowledge-based authentication (KBA) questions. 
 Possession: This factor involves something the user physically possesses, such as a hardware token, a one-time password (OTP) sent to a registered mobile device, or a software token generated by an authenticator app. 
 Inherence: This factor refers to biometric characteristics unique to the user, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, or iris/retina scans. 
 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication can fit into the knowledge category. But, broadly, KBA isn’t a replacement for passwords or PINs. However, and more appropriately, KBA can provide another, easy-to-implement layer on top of MFA.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a user attempts to access their credit report, the provider can ask for a password and a one-time password sent via email. Then, when the user logs in, the provider can use dynamic KBA to ask questions related to the credit report, adding another layer of security to an incredibly sensitive document.</p>
 What Are Some Alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication? 
<p>Several alternatives to Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) provide more secure and reliable methods for verifying a user’s identity. Some popular alternatives include:</p>
 
 Token-Based Authentication: One-time passwords are unique, time-sensitive codes generated by a dedicated hardware token, mobile device, or software application. The user must enter the OTP in addition to their standard password to authenticate their identity. Since OTPs expire after a short period or upon use, they offer a more secure alternative to KBA. 
 Device Authentication: Verification systems can use push notifications or apps to allow users the ability to authenticate via their device, typically a mobile device. While these devices can be compromised, they will, at minimum, greatly reduce the attack surface that could impact those users. 
 Biometrics: Biometric authentication relies on unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">behavioral biometrics</a>, or facial scans, to verify a user’s identity. Biometric authentication is more secure than KBA because it is based on features unique to the individual, making it difficult for attackers to spoof. 
 
<p>These alternatives offer varying levels of security, usability, and implementation complexity, depending on the specific use case and the organization’s requirements. Many organizations opt for a combination of these methods to provide a more robust and secure authentication process.</p>
 Ground Your Security in Identity-Based Authentication with 1Kosmos 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication is a useful companion to other forms of identity verification but only a small part of it. Implementing such solutions can help add layers of security but don’t serve as a replacement for solid security techniques like identity verification, biometrics, and passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides these critical fundamentals through the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>This is the story of how we built an open source company that specializes in developing the identity, data, and compute protocols for the future of the Internet.</p>Poutine Meetup in Berlin<p>Fission’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@boris">Boris Mann</a>, has been on the Internet for a long time. As one of the first 1,000 bloggers in the world, Boris loved being able to publish content online but recognized the challenges to making self-publishing possible for everyone. Running a server under your desk at home, installing software on the command line, and generally having the necessary technical know-how is neither realistic nor equitable.</p><p>Discovering the Drupal open source content management system and its worldwide network of contributors was an eye-opener: here was software and more importantly community working on making it possible for anyone to publish online. Boris became an active contributor, including helping to organize events that grow from 40 people to 1000s of Drupalcon attendees, and helping to form the Drupal Association.</p><p>At the same time, large proprietary software companies, like Microsoft, were working hard to retain their market position. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">They viewed open source software as a dangerous competitor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">adopted internal policies</a> to thwart the advancement of FOSS. </p><p>Boris continues to advocate for and share open source code, data, and community principles. Building better together, so that people can have more control and agency of technology for better communication and collaboration online and off. </p> <p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, started studying music composition at the University of Calgary and doing graphic design projects on the side. She picked up Photoshop and Illustrator and eventually dropped out of music school and moved to Vancouver. About five years later, while doing graphic design professionally at a friend's startup, she was given a book on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and asked if she could learn a bit of web development. By the end of the year, Brooklyn had taught herself over 20 programming languages.</p><p>Brooklyn became deeply involved in the local meetup scene, running multiple communities across many topics. She became involved in international functional programming and distributed systems conferences after she ported the Haskell standard library to Elixir. (It later tuned out that functional data structures are a great fit for IPLD).</p><p>Eventually, Brooklyn decided she wanted to return to startups, and was hired by a company based out of San Francisco. She and her Vancouver co-worker rented a desk from Boris's <a href="https://fullstack.ca/">co-working space</a>, which is how they met!</p><p>Brooklyn went on to do consulting work for Facebook, Uber, Kickstarter, and many others. After writing the same boilerplate for the nth time and fighting with k8s, she started to feel that there must be a better way. She began early designs of things that would eventually find their way into Fission.</p><p>After a couple of years away travelling as a digital nomad, she she returned to Vancouver in 2017. She joined Boris as principal engineer at a company working on Ethereum-based, legally compliant infrastructure. Brooklyn then focused on writing a formally verifiable smart contract language that was also human-readable (so that a lawyer could review the code).</p>April 2019, RUN EVM event in Berlin<p>Excited by the potential of a backend as a service, aka the "world computer" of Ethereum, Boris and Brooklyn together founded a company called SPADE ("Special Projects and Decentralized Engineering") and received an important grant from the ConsenSys Tachyon program to work on Ethereum Status Codes, which were later renamed FISSION Codes. They were one of only two companies to receive an open-source grant (the other being WalletConnect).</p><p>While building FISSION Codes, both Boris and Brooklyn started to recognize that the real challenge for both Web2 and Web3 was the increasing complexity of putting together full stack applications – plus the devops needs of running such apps. Except now, these problems were compounded by complex security needs and a more fervent demand for user control and agency. Users had been burned by Web2 exploitation and were becoming more discerning and knowledgeable about how their privacy was being compromised.</p><p>While the Web3 of blockchain, decentralized web, and p2p components were new and everyone was learning, all of the same challenges of needing to gain all of the increasingly complex skills of full stack app development and deployment were there.</p><p>After spending time on core Ethereum development &amp; community building, our cofounders asked themselves:</p><p>What if some of the emerging concepts of &nbsp;Web3 – advances in distributed systems, cryptography, and self verifiable data structures – could make it dramatically easier for front end developers to build apps, without having to become full stack developers and devops experts.</p><p>And so Fission the company was born: building an edge stack with identity, data, and compute components that enables front-end developers to build local-first apps while respecting user privacy and agency. </p>The 2019 Diffusion Hackathon grand winners, Marco and Eugene, were gifted a 4L jug of maple syrup for using the first version of the Fission service in their winning entry<p>In a Web2 stack, to put an app online, you need to run a server to hold user data. All of this data is visible to the people that run the service, and the incentives are typically to lock the users' data into the service. Never mind scaling and devops server management.</p><p>In prototyping, front end developers use dummy data in the browser without having to worry about setting up a server.</p><p>What if they could make that much simpler prototype development capable of running the production data? It would make development much easier for developers, and data wouldn't have to leave the device! By default, it would have to respect user agency. </p><p>Fission (as it is now known) became a member of the <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs Network</a> and started to build on top of the IPFS protocol. This direction would lead to the inventions of UCAN (decentralized user auth) and WNFS (user file system on top of IPFS with encrypted private data).</p><p>Today <a href="https://odd.dev/">our front end developer SDK</a> has evolved its storage solution into an overall data solution. We are working on a far-edge database called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Rhizome</a> to be added to the mix. We continue to iterate and collaborate with others on UCAN and other decentralized identity tools and have done an initial release of the final piece of our edge stack: content-addressed computation on IPFS with the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipvm-computation-ipfs/">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM</a>) specification.</p><p>Our commitment to community building and open-source development is unwavering, and we look forward to continuing to grow and collaborate within this robust and exciting ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is a guest blog by <a href="https://medium.com/u/49286d46d497">Abu Majid</a>, Storyteller at Story x&nbsp;Design</p><p>As a multimedia producer at Nairobi-based Story x Design, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating on four Caribou Digital research projects since October 2020. When Caribou Digital reached out in February 2022 asking to expand our participatory video storytelling methodology to meet the needs of digital platform workers living with disabilities, we had the opportunity to rethink our processes, from training, to filming, to the accessibility of our final&nbsp;edits.</p><p>An <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">earlier blog</a> by Story x Design Director Miranda Grant outlines our original participatory storytelling methods and offers tips for those interested in this filmmaking process. This blog reflects on our experience of collaborating with persons living with disabilities to create short documentaries about their lives and how we adapted our methods to fit their needs. We recount our design process, learnings, successes, and contingencies to barriers encountered.</p><p>This research, co-led by <a href="https://inable.org/">InAble</a> and Caribou Digital and in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, aims to understand the experiences and challenges of young people living with disabilities and engaging on platforms for work. With the support of InAble and Caribou Digital, we designed open-ended questionnaires to elicit authentic reflections on the challenges faced and strategies employed by platform workers living with disabilities. Our agile approach allowed us to stay nimble, learn from participants, and adjust as required throughout the&nbsp;process.</p> Three key adjustments to our&nbsp;process   Adapting the project design to ensure access for all. In order to make our collaboration with persons living with disabilities beneficial to them, we tweaked some of our supporting tools (i.e., film practice manuals, questionnaires, film prompts) for ease of use to all participants.  Working with interpreters and aides to accommodate multiple abilities. With the great support of a sign language interpreter and individual aides, we were able to help each participant identify and express the stories most important to them through a mix of in-person and one-on-one narrative and technical skills training. This hybrid mentoring approach helped participants gain confidence in their abilities to self-direct their own&nbsp;stories.  Diversifying post-production. Our versatile post-production, leveraging WhatsApp video / voice calls / voice notes and regular carrier calls, but also importantly in-person training, enabled us to stay in close touch with the participants who faced different types of challenges creating their&nbsp;content.   Adapting the project&nbsp;design  1. Adapting resources <p>Our participatory self-shot video diaries approach was developed in 2020 as a countermeasure to the COVID-19 lockdown. The framework requires the deployment of equipment and intensive multimedia skills training to all participants, where success depends on participants’ comprehension and willingness to contribute on their own time. So this process can be time and resource intensive. However, even after the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted, we decided to carry on with the self-shot video approach as participants expressed their eagerness to tell their own stories and willingness to take up the role of self-directing.</p><p>As per our usual process, we distributed a small smartphone production kit to each participant. But made a few adjustments to accommodate those who took&nbsp;part.</p><p>The phones were preloaded with:</p>  Six instructional videos on the downloadable VLC phone application. These instructional videos were embedded with a voiceover (VO) feature that defined and detailed basic film terms and techniques. The VO not only navigated participants with visual impairment through the content but also offered relatable examples for all to try. See a sample Story x Design instructional video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3m6aJBzAs">here</a>.  A readable softcopy instructional manual for the native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">TalkBack</a> assistive application for both the visually and hearing impaired.  An audio instructional manual for the visually impaired participants and their&nbsp;aides.  Hardcopy instructional manuals for&nbsp;all.  A softcopy questionnaire and prompt document readable with TalkBack apps for all participants.   2. Working with aides during skills training and&nbsp;filming <p>We gathered with five of the six participants and their aides in a conference room in Thika Town, 44 kilometers from Nairobi City, a central location for all in attendance.</p><p>Together with participants and aides, we explored the self-shot video diaries format, examining proper camera orientation, sound capture, lighting, framing, and many more good film practices. Ongoing virtual mentorship provided participants with the support necessary to overcome technical and creative challenges over the course of production.</p><p>The close collaboration with interpreters and aides was key to enabling transparent communication with participants, in particular about the use of participants’ images and published videos. With clearly drafted agreement and image release forms, participants with their aides as witnesses, read, understood and after being satisfied, signed onto contributing to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Participants and aides were compensated for their work on this project. Participants received ongoing payments to purchase internet bundles for uploading large media files throughout production, as well as a one-time payment on project completion. Aides were provided with per diems for their efforts in supporting filming.</p> 3. Diversifying post-production <p>A key addition to this project was Monica Onyango, a sign language interpreter who helped translate footage submitted by the participants with hearing impairment. This enabled the post-production team to transcribe and edit subtitles to build a story that honored the contributors.</p><p>In one case where one of the visually impaired participants could not manage to find help in filming and sending more footage, we successfully sought her consent to use her voice notes as voice overs to missing segments in her story. This was in line with our desire to create a safe, accommodating space that offered an equal platform for expression.</p> Challenges and contingencies <p>We recognized that there would be challenges that we had not faced before. Although the six participants all come from one country and one time zone, and had experience navigating digital platforms, none had experience self-directing for video or taking part in a collaborative multimedia project of this&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Beyond the usual challenges in supporting the production of self-directed videos, here are some specific challenges people with disabilities faced.</p>  The need for in-person support. In addition to an initial in-person training, participants required one-on-one mentorship and refresher sessions throughout the duration of the project. When internet connections failed, team members needed to visit participants with visual impairment in person for troubleshooting and automatic upload restoration. Similarly, when capturing B-roll proved too challenging for participants, we traveled to support, while taking great care to follow participants’ self-direction and maintain the participatory project&nbsp;design.  The availability of aides. Even with per diems on offer, most aides were unavailable on occasion, particularly because most aides selected by participants were fellow students, and others had full-time jobs. Consequently, production was often halted as the visually impaired participants waited for&nbsp;help.  The authenticity of participants’ stories. We wanted to highlight participants’ authentic techniques of navigating the digital world to find work and understand their challenges. However, we refrained from asking questions beyond what participants revealed, allowing them to authentically share their successes and obstacles, instead of only emphasizing their disabilities.   Self-determination <p>The most gratifying measure of achievement for all of us is the fact that the expressions of all participants were not dictated, directed, or curtailed. At each stage of the project, participants had full control of their stories and authority on what to feature in their final&nbsp;videos.</p><p>All contributors stated that they felt liberated and supported throughout the projects, which made even the most difficult moments feel like blips in the project’s timeline.</p><p>To those looking to produce user-generated content in collaboration with people from all walks of life, we hope these learnings serve you well. There are many measures to evaluate a film, documentary, or piece of text, but no number can ever be placed on the impact of people feeling seen, listened to, and&nbsp;moved.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy5_ghJMy-gG50twQMN6TYKC3">Watch The Youth With Disabilities Digital Platform Experience videos&nbsp;here.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/persons-living-with-disabilities-self-directing-their-own-stories-93e2f5d4e8c">Persons Living With Disabilities Self-Directing Their Own Stories</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As part of my hosting duties on the Entrust Engage podcast, I’ve had the pleasure of speaking to some outstanding guests on a variety of topics from the science behind quantum computers themselves, to impacts post-quantum will have on digital security. In the latest episode, I was pleased to get a perspective I hadn’t yet – that of an analyst – when I was joined by guest speaker, Forrester Principal Analyst Sandy Carielli. As we set up the discussion for the episode, here are some of the insights she provided on the state of post-quantum preparedness:</p>
<p>Samantha Mabey: Where do you currently feel like organizations are with looking at PQ and kicking off preparations to prepare against and mitigate the threat?</p>
<p>Sandy Carielli: Organizations are in the early stages of PQ preparation. The financial services and public sectors are the farthest ahead in this area, not surprising given the sensitivity of the data that traverses their systems. The Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Practices Act signed by President Biden at the end of last year speaks to the attention that government is placing on PQ, and the recently unveiled National Cybersecurity Strategy also stresses the importance of planning for the transition to post-quantum cryptography. However, even those industries paying close attention to PQ are at the early stages – aside from a few pilots and proofs of concept, organizations are primarily at the planning stage, with some kicking off cryptographic inventories.</p>
<p>SM: What do you foresee being some of the greatest challenges that organizations will face in preparing for the migration to post-quantum cyrptography?</p>
<p>SC: Cryptographic migration is never easy – previous migrations, such as from SHA-1 to SHA-256, have taken years. Even increasing the key size, such as moving from 1024 to 2048-bit RSA, doesn’t happen overnight. The migration from RSA or ECC to a post-quantum algorithm will be even more complicated – given how deeply embedded cryptographic functions are in code and devices, rip and replace is rarely simple. For software and systems that organizations develop themselves, development teams will need to replace existing cryptographic code with new libraries, but standard implementations of the NIST selected algorithms aren’t widespread. Then there’s the supply chain issue – organizations will rely on their partners and vendors to update cryptographic implementations in their own products before the organization can fully migrate to PQ.</p>
<p>SM: While there is a consensus that the threat (of a quantum computer being able to break traditional public key cryptography in use today) is possibly a decade away, there is a more immediate threat known as “harvest now, decrypt later”. Do you feel like there is a lack of awareness of this threat and that it further justifies that the need to prepare for PQ now?</p>
<p>SC: The “harvest now, decrypt later” threat is understood in pockets, such as government and financial services, and these are the areas where that threat is critical – customers’ bank account numbers and citizens’ government identification numbers are not likely to change in ten or twenty years. This is why these sectors have started to prepare and must continue to do so – they realize that they will need to have migrated to PQ long before a quantum computer is able to break traditional public key cryptography, and that attackers won’t be able to decrypt any PQ-encrypted data that they harvest. Outside of that, security leaders are not as aware of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat – leaders must realize that any harvested data protected with RSA or ECC could be vulnerable later, including account information, intellectual property, and personal information (which an attacker could use as blackmail material). Broader awareness of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat would help organizations support PQ preparation strategies.</p>

 The world of finance is rapidly evolving and at the heart of this transformation is the emergence of digital currencies. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), in particular, have been a topic of increasing interest among global central banks. Coinfirm, as a leader in blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions, closely follows these developments. Today, we delve into the latest updates from the European Central Bank (ECB) on their ongoing project – the digital euro. 



 The Digital Euro: Prioritizing the Euro Area 



<p>According to a recent presentation from the ECB, the primary focus of the digital euro project is to serve the needs of the euro area. The ECB plans to gradually introduce different use cases for the digital euro, aiming to make it accessible to everyone within the euro area before expanding to users outside this zone. This phased approach is designed to prevent the project from becoming overly complex while ensuring it meets the needs of its primary users.</p>



 Exploring International Opportunities 



<p>The ECB recognizes the significant potential of an international dimension for the digital euro. It aims to enable access to and use of the digital euro outside the euro area without requiring currency conversion. Furthermore, the bank acknowledges the need for interoperability to facilitate cross-currency payments. The ECB’s foresight in considering these broader opportunities is a promising indicator of the digital euro’s future utility.</p>



 A Rising Tide of CBDC Projects 



<p>The ECB isn’t alone in this digital currency exploration. In fact, a recent report by the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) shows a substantial rise in CBDC projects around the world. The ECB is actively supporting international CBDC initiatives, collaborating with the BIS,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/g7/"> G7,</a> and<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/international-monetary-fund-imf/"> International Monetary Fund (IMF) </a>among others. This collective effort by central banks worldwide underscores the significance of CBDCs in the future of finance.</p>



 The International Use Cases of the Digital Euro 



<p>When it comes to the use of the digital euro outside the euro area, the ECB is considering several scenarios. These include cross-border payments in digital euro, payments in digital euro outside the euro area, and use by visitors. The rules for geographical access will be determined by legislation, and if permitted, access could be extended to consumers and merchants in the European Economic Area and selected non-EU countries.</p>



 Interoperability of Digital Euro with Other CBDCs 



<p>One of the key factors in the success of the digital euro will be its interoperability with other CBDCs. The ECB has proposed two models to facilitate this: the interlinking model, which allows transactions without participation in each system, and the single system model, which involves a single system across multiple currencies.</p>



 Wholesale Central Bank Money Settlement: A New Initiative 



<p>The ECB is looking to contribute to digital innovation while ensuring that central bank money remains a monetary anchor. To this end, it has announced a new initiative on wholesale central bank money settlement. A new Eurosystem task force has been established to explore new technologies that could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>As an organization deeply entrenched in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>and digital currency space, Coinfirm recognizes the potential of CBDCs to revolutionize financial systems globally. We are excited to see how the ECB’s exploration of the digital euro progresses and will continue to provide our expertise and solutions in AML and blockchain analytics to support this evolution.</p>

<p>During this development cycle we have focused our lens on Sweden in particular, specifically with the continued support for Swedish BankID. Additionally, we have performed expected security and life-cycle management development. For full details, please head over to review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Swedish BankID 
<p>Throughout the Nordics, the ability to strongly identify oneself is considered to be second nature. The countries have invested substantial time over the last twenty years ensuring that each citizen and resident can perform many of their day-to-day tasks online. To carry this out, one needs to have a strongly authenticated digital identification method.</p>
<p>Within Sweden, this is predominantly <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/privat/skaffa-bankid">BankID.</a> Since our original support of BankID via CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) back in the summer of 2018, things have changed. We have reviewed the BankID Relying Party Guidelines (v3.7) and developed an authentication adaptor to enable you to directly configure BankID within the Identity Platform. This means both two device flow, and the more commonly used single device flow, are supported. Now your users can strongly authenticate your web page or mobile app directly on their mobile device.</p>
 Focus Sweden 
<p>Full support for BankID coupled with our existing support for <a href="https://frejaeid.com/en/home/">Freja eID</a> and <a href="https://www.svipe.com/">Svipe</a> means that you can empower your users to authenticate with the most common services in Sweden. It’s well known that Ubisecure has a long history of supporting the Finnish population with a full suite of authentication options, from banking (TUPAS, which is now the FTN), through social logins (O365, Google and Apple), as well as specialised authenticators. &nbsp;Our latest release demonstrates our commitment towards Sweden, and we continue to develop the Identity Platform with a pan-European focus. We will be carrying out additional work over the next year to develop animated QR codes, required in 2024 by BankID. If there is an authenticator you need, that we are not yet offering, please contact Support or your account team and let us know. We work alongside our customers to ensure our Identity Platform evolves in line with your needs and expectations.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>Ongoing security maintenance is, of course, paramount. As we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security. During this release cycle, we have focused on updating Wildfly (to Wildfly 26). We have also updated OpenLDAP to 2.5.14, and Redis support to 6.2.8. Support of Linux Redhat 8 has also been tested. We always encourage you to upgrade to the latest possible release of our software as it provides the most secure and feature-rich Identity Platform possible. As always, you can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>In the short term, we are continuing work towards ongoing improvements that will be available in the next month, when we release updates for both SSO (SSO 9.2.1) and CustomerID (CID 6.2.1). Over the summer, we are continuing the maintenance cycle as usual. Continuing into the autumn and winter, we will be continuing our research into risk-based authentication development and other aspects of strong authentication.</p>

 It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve card-not-present (CNP) transactions. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.

<p>It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve <a href="https://moneyzine.com/personal-finance-resources/credit-card-fraud-statistics/">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a>. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.</p>  
 What is PSD2 SCA?  
<p>The revised Payment Services Directive, more generally known as&nbsp; PSD2, is a regulation that has been implemented in Europe, covering countries in the EEA, Monaco and the UK. Its main goals are to improve customer choice among payment providers, protect customer safety, and combat payment fraud. One key aspect of PSD2 is its obligation for all companies that provide payment services, including banks, financial institutions or other payment service providers (PSPs), to use Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The PSD2 SCA requirements oblige relevant companies to enhance customer security around payments by deploying <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for relevant transactions. MFA means that the customer must verify their identity by providing two or more factors of authentication. The guidelines on PSD2 SCA also note that authentication must be performed in a manner that protects customer data.&nbsp;</p> 
 Who Needs to Comply with PSD2 SCA?&nbsp;  
<p>Who falls under the umbrella of PSD2 SCA compliance? Well, it's not just the traditional players in the banking industry. Thanks to PSD2, new players like Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) and Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) have entered the scene. PISPs act as intermediaries between customers' banks (or where their money is) and sellers of goods or services. AISPs, upon user permission, consolidate all user financial information (such as deposits, loans, and direct debits) in one place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your company falls into these categories, you need to adhere to the PSD2 SCA requirements when <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">providing the following services</a>:</p> 
  
  Payment initiation services (these inform a seller that the customer has proceeded through an online purchase)  
  Account access (when a user, or a third-party service provider, asks their bank to inform them of their financial situation)  
  Card-based instructions (when a customer asks their bank or PSP to pay someone from their account)  
  
<p>If the payment or information instruction is initiated and processed in the regulation’s area, it must follow PSD2 SCA guidelines. For US companies, this could apply, for example, if they have a European-based entity or are looking to provide the specific services mentioned to EU citizens.</p> 
<p>Organizations are required to decline transactions that do not meet SCA requirements. There are exemptions for small transactions (less than €30), where the financial institution can prove it is a low-risk transaction or where the customer has whitelisted the service provider, such as for a direct debit of a phone or electricity bill.</p> 
 How to Implement PSD2 SCA  
<p>To comply with the PSD2 SCA requirements, organizations must ensure that their customer authentication meets the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1761863/314bd4d5-ccad-47f8-bb11-84933e863944/Final%20draft%20RTS%20on%20SCA%20and%20CSC%20under%20PSD2%20%28EBA-RTS-2017-02%29.pdf">regulatory technical standards</a> (RTS) set out for PSD2 SCA. This involves implementing MFA for relevant transactions and adhering to&nbsp; other specifications detailed in the RTS. These include:</p> 
  
  Dynamic linking of remote payments (creating a unique code specifying payee and amount to reduce fraud) should be based on technologies such as digital signatures or cryptographically underpinned validity assertions using keys.&nbsp;  
  Special advice should be given about the length or complexity of knowledge factors and the algorithms underpinning possession and inherence factors.&nbsp;  
  The application of PSD2 SCA should strike a balance between enhanced security for relevant payments and user-friendliness and accessibility.&nbsp;  
  Payments and PSD2 SCA elements must have separation. For example, if a smart device is used to make a payment and also counts as a factor of authentication, there must be a clear process to differentiate them.&nbsp;  
  
 Benefits of PSD2 SCA  
<p>Beyond regulatory compliance, PSD2 SCA brings other significant benefits to financial institutions and their customers, including improved customer security, fraud reduction, and a better user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improved Customer Security  
<p>First and foremost, PSD2 SCA enhances customer security by raising the bar for authentication. With MFA in place, it becomes much harder for attackers to impersonate users and carry out fraudulent activities. While there are still issues around <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/passwordless-vs-mfa">allowing knowledge factors (namely passwords) in MFA</a> as they can be easily phished or brute forced, mandating MFA is a major step towards a more secure online world for consumers.</p> 
 Reduced Fraud  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">Fraud committed through account takeover</a>, which uses a victim’s card or bank details to purchase items, can create significant distrust between the customer and the firm involved, even if neither party was at fault. Reducing payment fraud fosters greater trust in online transactions, making customers more comfortable with making purchases and boosting revenue opportunities for service providers.</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>The PSD2 SCA regulation recognizes the importance of maintaining a user-friendly process. Nobody wants frustrated customers <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/customer-authentication-tips-for-safer-shopping">abandoning their shopping carts</a> due to cumbersome authentication requirements or forgotten passwords. The specification for being accessible and user-friendly means companies complying with PSD2 SCA should consider how their authentication stream impacts the user and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">how it can be as frictionless as possible.</a></p> 
 What’s Next?  
<p>Earlier this year, the European Commission presented a study on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f6f80336-a3aa-11ed-b508-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-280122910">application and impact of PSD2</a>. The study follows a period of <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations/finance-2022-psd2-review_en">open consultations into revisions of PSD2</a> legislation. It is widely expected that a PSD3 framework will be announced, but its timing and the extent of the revisions have not yet been made public.</p> 
 Comply With PSD2 SCA and Improve Customer Experience With HYPR  
<p>The PSD2 regulates financial transactions in the EU and other countries such as the UK and Norway. Its strong customer authentication (SCA) requirement obliges financial institutions, banks and payment service providers to maintain strict MFA authentication procedures for operations such as payments over €30 or requests for account information. The PSD2 SCA requirements aim to improve online consumer trust by reducing fraud and account takeover attacks, yet without a significant trade-off of user experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless solution for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-customer-authentication">customer authentication</a> allows firms to fully comply with the PSD2 SCA and transaction signing directives, including cryptographic signing of every transaction and unique dynamic linking. With HYPR, you can ensure SCA regulatory compliance while removing friction from your customer authentication process.

<p></p> 
<p>In today's modern work environment, effective management of user identities and access is crucial for securing enterprise applications, systems, and data. As organizations increasingly deploy cloud-based services and resources, managing access has become complex and necessary. As a helpdesk engineer, it’s my responsibility to manage and track access requests from end users. To streamline this process and ensure secure access, I recently deployed an approval-as-code tool, which automates the approval process for access requests and integrates with our existing tools. This will enhance our ability to manage access and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access to critical systems and data.</p> 
 Access Management Challenges  
<p>Traditionally, I provide users with predefined default access based on their roles and responsibilities. Some admin users are provided with full access to core resources on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately, these accounts are potential targets for security breaches.&nbsp; Experian, Uber and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, and many others, were all breached due to hackers, such as the Lapsus$ group, exploiting admin access.</p> 
<p>In some emergency situations, users are provided with elevated access to be able to resolve a critical issue or incident. These requests are largely handled in either tickets or Slack threads. In other words done “by hand”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some of the challenges I face:</p> 
  
  Inefficiency: Manually managing access can be an inefficient process and mistakes can be made if access is not removed.  
  Compliance challenges: It can be difficult to demonstrate that access controls are being enforced when some users have perpetual admin access.  
  Scaling: As the organization grows and the number of users and resources increases, it becomes more difficult to manage access for a large number of users across many systems. Creating access policies can get complex.  
  
 What Is Approval-As-Code?  
<p>At HYPR, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an already adopted practice to automate and standardize the process of deploying and managing our IT resources. We recently came across a tool that advertises “approval-as-code,” which extends the same principles as Infrastructure as code. With approval-as-code, we can automate and codify approval workflows for elevated access.</p> 
<p>The tool in question is called SYM by a company called <a href="https://symops.com/">SYMOps</a>. Sym allows you to build approval workflows that can be initiated and approved within Slack to dedicated resources defined within the tool.&nbsp; This provides just-in-time access in a manner which is audited and tracked. The current approval flow we have in place:</p> 
  
  End users request access within Slack and are asked  
   
   Which resource they need access to  
   Justification (ticket, incident or reason)  
   Duration of access  
   
  Request is routed to a dedicated Slack channel  
  Designated approvers can either approve or deny the request  
  If approved, the user is provided access to the resource for the duration selected  
  Once the time for the duration expires, access is removed and the user is notified within Slack.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Being that SYM is approval-as-code, we use our current code review process and I can collaborate with my team when building the workflows. The tool itself is managed with Terraform code so you can deploy resources and update the workflows. The approval logic is all defined in Python code so I am able to create custom policies that meet our needs but also help us scale.</p> 
 Deployment&nbsp;  
<p>Now I am not a strong or even an average coder, but the examples and support provided by the SYM team has been invaluable in helping my team and I get this tool off the ground running. No question was too basic or complex for their team as they helped me craft this tool which is now critical for our daily operations.</p> 
<p>SYMops offers multiple out-of-the-box integrations with their Python libraries. With the custom logic, we are taking advantage of the PagerDuty integration. This integration on request checks if the user is on-call in PagerDuty, to assist with&nbsp; “break-glass” access after hours in response to an incident or a page. Here is an example of the code that defines this logic which is also in the examples SYMOps provides:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>https://github.com/symopsio/examples/tree/main/basic/pagerduty_on_call</p> 
 Greater Security, Greater Convenience&nbsp;  
<p>By implementing a tool like SYM on top of our HYPR Passwordless stack, we can improve the speed, tracking and security of our applications, systems and data. Being that the tool is built within Slack allows our organization to easily adopt this process and not impede any critical work or velocity of our teams. Having the elevated access being gated by the approval workflows helps us ensure that there are sufficient guardrails for access controls in place and they are enforced.</p>

 Recap of recent IDnow ‘The State of Micromobility Regulations 2023’ webinar. 



 



<p>Our April webinar, which explored <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">the current state of micromobility regulations</a>, could not have happened at a more interesting time for the industry, following the recent Paris escooter ban.</p>



<p>Moderated by Oliver Bruce, Co-Host of The Micromobility Conference &amp; Podcast, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Usman Abid, Senior Product Manager at Tier, Martin Lefrancq, New Mobility Policy Advisor at Brussels Mobility, Felix Aumair, Head of Customer Success at GoUrban, along with our very own Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow.</p>



 What happens in Paris, stays in Paris? 



<p>With the escooter ban fresh in people’s minds, it was natural for the group to start by sharing their opinions on how it would likely impact the wider micromobility landscape in the rest of Europe.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it was a mixed bag of opinions, with some participants pointing out that it would likely heap additional pressure on mobility operators, who would be forced to play the waiting game while other cities decide whether to follow suit with a ban or not.</p>



<p>Despite the recent happenings in Paris, Michael said that there was no time to waste, and operators should seize the opportunity to enter the growing micromobility industry, “Now is a good chance to invest more and have a bigger focus on these kinds of topics to improve and develop micromobility services in the future.’’</p>



 The relationship between technology and regulations. 



<p>Later in the webinar, Felix and Michael discussed what measures and technology micromobility providers could implement to improve user compliance with regulations and ensure responsible use of their services.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is where IDnow supports many companies – not only in mobility – to give more responsibility to the user because there needs to be rules in place, certain behaviors, certain qualifications to make use of certain services, especially in the mobility sector. But since regulations develop and change, it’s important that providers have flexible solutions.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



 Shaping the future of a safer, more sustainable mobility future. 



<p>Later in the webinar, discussions shifted from regulations to the role that micromobility could play in addressing urban congestion, and how this can be better communicated to policymakers and the public.</p>



<p>Martin mentioned how there have been huge changes over the years regarding sustainable urban mobility in Brussels.</p>



<p>“Micromobility is forecasted to help reduce carbon emissions in our cities by 30-50% by 2030,’’ said Usman.</p>



<p>Before the webinar ended with a Q+A session with the audience, the panel covered the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">key trends and developments</a> that will shape the regulatory landscape in the coming years.</p>



<p>Predictions ranged from the importance of free-floating, dedicated parking zones to why micromobility needs to have a consistent regulatory framework that is only part of a broader ecosystem. Michael said that the very future of cities was dependant on the success of micromobility, citing the need for collaboration between key stakeholders (users, city governance, operators and regulators) to ensure regulations offer a safer and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">balanced mobility experience</a> for everyone.</p>

 Ontario’s iGaming market has witnessed rapid growth since opening to private gaming operators in 2022. With an industry-envied regulatory framework, now is the time to enter the lucrative market. 



 



<p>It’s been a little over a year since Ontario decided to permit private gaming operators the chance to offer online gaming services in April 2022. </p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada differs depending on local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction; Ontario is no different in that regard. Where Ontario does differ from other Canadian provinces is that they are the only province that doesn’t require residents to use government-owned lottery and gaming corporations’ platforms.</p>



<p>Since opening the market to private gaming operators, <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">45 Ontario operators</a> have taken steps to comply with Ontario’s high standards of game integrity and player&nbsp;protections. The&nbsp;AGCO&nbsp;has also approved over 5,000 certified games for use in the&nbsp;province in the last year alone. </p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.agco.ca/blog/lottery-and-gaming/apr-2023/one-year-anniversary-ontario-internet-gaming-market-new-study-shows">study conducted in March 2023</a>, over 85% of participants had gambled via regulated Ontario gambling platforms. This is an impressive majority, especially considering that around 70% of all online gambling was done so via unregulated sites before the launch of the open market.</p>



<p>For more information on why Ontario is a natural market for European operators to expand in, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/?preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=70959">‘iGaming Ontario – a promising market for European operators?’ blog</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>A key objective in this first year has been to move Ontario players from playing on unregulated sites to the regulated market, so that they would benefit from high standards of operator and game integrity, fairness and player protections including responsible gambling safeguards.</p>Tom Mungham, Registrar and&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of the&nbsp;AGCO</blockquote>



 Key iGaming regulations in Ontario. 



<p>One of the most pivotal steps in Ontario’s journey toward becoming a profitable and desirable gaming market came in 2021, when the C-218 bill was passed by Ontario lawmakers. </p>



<p>C-218 allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting, this adds increased flexibility and opportunity for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizeable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;<br><br>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a> was created – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/"> Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>.&nbsp;Applications with iGaming Ontario and AGCO can run concurrently.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators</a>, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, as long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is consumer protection, which is defined on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">iGO’s website</a> as the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity<br>  Prevent underage access<br>  Ensure private operators comply with applicable laws, including compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) rules and regulations, and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>The <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> contains information on Ontario’s different iGaming rules and regulations. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO.</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering-terrorist-financing-act-pcmltfa/">PCMLTFA</a>), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-transactions-reports-centre-canada-fintrac/">FINTRAC</a>). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photo or selfies, and liveness to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 5 steps to becoming a regulated gaming operator in Ontario. 



<p>1. Apply for registration with the AGCO (Execute letter of agreement with iGaming Ontario)</p>



<p>2. Set up regulatory reporting with AGCO. Provide Technology Complicance Confirmation to AGCO (AML &amp; FInancial Information Submissions)</p>



<p>3. Obtain registration from AGCO</p>



<p>4. Application processes can be completed within a few weeks, if applications are well prepared, then iGO and AGCO are very responsive&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. The most difficult part of the application process is the risk assessment stage</p>



 Becoming compliant with Ontario’s iGaming regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">KYC program requirements</a>, which could require operators to do complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.</p>



<p>Player onboarding requirements include:</p>



  Players must be 19+, physically based in Ontario<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Person (PEP) </a>checks need to be passed<br>  Personal information, including occupation must be collected<br>  Third-party providers are needed for onboarding for initial checks  



<p>One solution to meeting compliance and regulatory challenges is by working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> – an AI-powered verification tool that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>

<p></p><p>The concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.</p><p>Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years. Here are a few ways they are being used today.</p> Employment Verification<a title="Direct link to Employment Verification">​</a> <p>LinkedIn recently announced a new free <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23679998/linkedin-verification-badge-system-clear-microsoft-entra">verified badge feature</a> that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. “The system is backed by decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company…” </p><p>LinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee's DID (subject) with their employer's DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.</p><p></p><p>As for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.</p>  info  <p>DIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.</p>   Digital Driver's Licenses<a title="Direct link to Digital Driver's Licenses">​</a> <p>The DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/california-moves-to-test-new-digital-drivers-licenses">digital driver's licenses</a> and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver's license apps are cryptographically secure and can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents. These apps are backed with the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and DIDs. This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.</p> COVID Digital Health Apps<a title="Direct link to COVID Digital Health Apps">​</a> <p>IBM used VCs as a key component in its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/resources/digital-health-pass-blockchain-explained/">Digital Health Pass</a> solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.</p><p>When an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. </p><p>There are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. </p><p>Overall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Social Media<a title="Direct link to Social Media">​</a> <p>Even social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">AT Protocol</a>, a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social). Unbeknownst to most users, these domain names are associated with a DID for the user.</p><p></p><p>These persistent DIDs enable users to migrate their account data to any other applications that utilize the AT Protocol - therefore giving users more control and ownership over their content.</p> Future of Decentralized Identity<a title="Direct link to Future of Decentralized Identity">​</a> <p>These companies are embracing the use of decentralized technology for identity management and verification at a massive scale. As this technology continues to mature, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of DIDs in various industries.</p><p>Want to learn more about DIDs and VCs? Check out our <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">guide on DIDs</a>, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials">blog post on VCs</a>, and tutorial to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did">create your own DID</a>.</p>

<p>Secure remote access is a method that lets authorized users access a private network as if they were on-premises with that network.</p>
<p>This includes accessing systems, resources, and data the user could access where they logged in on the private system.</p>
<p>While remote access was relatively common in business sectors for the past decade, the onset of COVID and work-from-home situations expanded this kind of technology even further. Now, remote access is used for everyday work, managing remote systems, or performing IT support for end users.</p>
<p>Key components of secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Authentication: Users must provide valid credentials through various methods, including usernames and passwords, biometrics, or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication-best-practices/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>. 
 Access Control: Administrators can implement access control policies to restrict user access to specific resources, applications, or systems based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Encryption: Data transmitted between the remote user and the target system is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. This is often done through protocols like Secure Shell/Transport Security Layer (SSH/TLS) that support strong encryption and tunneling. 
 System Security: Servers, network devices, and endpoint devices must remain secure. Otherwise, they will compromise the integrity of the overall access solution. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Using a Secure Remote Access Solution? 
<p>Secure remote access offers several benefits for businesses, organizations, and individuals, including:</p>
 
 Security: First and foremost, secure remote access allows users to connect to sensitive systems and data wherever they are. The value of this kind of remote access in a modern, decentralized world cannot be understated. 
 Compliance: Secure remote access can play a major role in compliance efforts. Most frameworks and regulations have some requirements on how users access systems–requirements that include authentication, authorization, and encryption. Secure remote access checks these boxes. 
 Flexibility: Secure remote access allows employees to work more flexibly, accommodating various schedules and time zones. This means more productivity, more variation in where your company can hire, simplified collaboration between remote teams, and reduced office space and equipment costs. 
 Scalability: Secure remote access can quickly scale to accommodate the growth of an organization, particularly its workforce, allowing new users and resources to be added with minimal effort. 
 Centralized Security and Operations: IT administrators can manage remote devices, install updates, and troubleshoot issues remotely and en masse, ensuring that all systems get the same level of attention. 
 
<p>By providing secure access to resources and systems from remote locations, secure remote access offers numerous advantages in terms of productivity, cost savings, flexibility, and security.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Remote Secure Access? 
<p>There are several types of remote secure access solutions available to accommodate the varying needs of organizations and individuals. Some popular solutions include:</p>
 
 Virtual Private Network (VPN): VPNs are secured and persistent connections (private networks) that can extend to users such that they have full access to secure system resources. These networks work through a combination of technologies, including all those listed previously. 
 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that functions like a VPN but allows the user to access a single system rather than an entire network. 
 Secure Shell/Transport Layer Security (SSH/TLS): SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure remote access through “tunneling.” TLS is the protocol that supersedes SSH. 
 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a technology that provides remote access to virtual desktops hosted on a centralized server. Users can access their virtual desktops from any device with an internet connection. 
 Remote Support Software: There exist additional tools that IT support services can use by requiring end users to install a client app that can facilitate secure system sharing between the two. These solutions have also become somewhat popular in instances of digital fraud. 
 Cloud-Based Solutions: Cloud-based remote access solutions leverage cloud infrastructure to provide secure remote access. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) WorkSpaces and Google Cloud’s Compute Engine. 
 
<p>Each remote secure access solution has its unique features and uses cases. Organizations should carefully assess their needs and requirements before selecting the appropriate solution to ensure security, scalability, and ease of use.</p>
 Are Their Problems Using Secure Remote Access? 
<p>Although secure remote access solutions provide numerous benefits, they also introduce some risks and challenges that organizations must address to ensure the security of their networks and data.</p>
<p>Some of the risks associated with secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Unauthorized Access: If an attacker gains access to a remote user’s credentials or devices, they may be able to access sensitive resources and systems. Since the solution assumes the user is legitimate, they will have full access to any system the user would have access to. 
 Endpoint Security: Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of remote access, this is typically user security. An unsecured laptop or mobile device can open up a vulnerability in the network that admins cannot plan for. 
 Insider Threats: Much like endpoint security, insider threats are hard to fight since they are, for all intents and purposes, legitimate users. An insider with remote access can gain control of sensitive resources. 
 Data Leakage: Data transmitted over insecure networks or stored on remote devices can be intercepted, stolen, or manipulated by malicious actors. This can lead to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and damage to the organization’s reputation. 
 Compliance: Organizations must ensure that their remote access solutions comply with relevant regulations and industry standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA. 
 
<p>Organizations should implement robust security measures to mitigate these risks. One such approach is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-best-practices/">zero-trust architecture</a> that can address typical attacks as well as user-based vulnerabilities.</p>
 1Kosmos Is Transforming Secure Remote Access 
<p>Many organizations will use some combination of MFA and access control to handle secure remote access. 1Kosmos is changing this approach by providing identity-based <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-iam/">authentication and access management</a> tied to biometrics and compliant identity verification.</p>

  Determining the authenticity of online individuals can be a challenging task, as there's no guarantee that they are who they claim to be. This uncertainty can result in people unintentionally exposing their personal information to malicious actors who could exploit it to create fabricated or AI-generated digital identities.

SelfKey proposes a decentralized solution that may effectively combat data

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI staking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world.

 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI staking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Staking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI staking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be staked on with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By staking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI staking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By staking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have staked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, staking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens, as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI staking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By staking on their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Staking 
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI staking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information. To ensure the privacy and security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI staking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By staking on their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

 Recap of IDnow’s recent ‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar. 



 



<p>To coincide with crypto’s busy few days in April, when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> was finally <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">given the green light</a> by the European Parliament, we hosted a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/identity-verification-kyc-aml-requirements/">‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar</a>, exploring the likely ramifications of the regulatory framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by Jennifer Hanley Giersch at ALL AML GmbH, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank, and Peter Müller, Financial Crime Officer at UBS, along with our very own Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs and Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Watch highlights below:</p>



 



 

 



 MiCA: KYC and AML’s most important development for 2023? 



<p>The session strarted with predictions from the group as to what is likely to be the main driving force for developments in the KYC and AML space. Unsurprisingly, considering it was finally ratified by the EU in April, Rayissa touched upon the potential of MiCA.</p>



<p>“To harmonize regulations across an ecosystem is an ambitious project. The unification and transparency that is supposed to come out of MiCA is really important. One of those crucial steps is to enable KYC to do its job and foster trust in this ecosystem,” said Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>Jason agreed, explaining how MiCA would provide important guidelines that crypto exchanges and crypto entities would need to follow to ensure they do not run afoul of money laundering risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great development for the industry because with clarity brings the ability for obliged entities to do the right thing, and implement the right technologies, controls, and internal processes to meet MiCA’s requirements,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed during the session, including the larger upcoming European Commission’s legislative proposal known as the AML/CFT package.</p>



 When together is not always better.  



<p>While there was a general consensus that the combined EU approach to regulatory requirements and policy was a positive thing, Nico did warn that this is not always the case.&nbsp;He said that while a common financial market policy in the banking sector exists in the European Union, there is no common policy that translates into a common implementation of AML/ CFT rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This means that practices are divergent across countries, and this is to the benefit of those that don’t want to comply with the legislation, because the system from a European perspective is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank</blockquote>



<p>Nico went on to use the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20is%20a%20process%20that,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">Know Your Customer (KYC) process</a> as an example, and said that although there are common rules for the onboarding of clients, when it comes to effective controls, each member state does it differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed in the lively session, from the impact of regulations on unhosted wallets and decentralized ecosystems, to ways of changing the perception of crypto as an increasing risk for sources of wealth, the topic of KYC and MiCA was never far away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we are going to have a successful crypto hub – wherever that is, then we need to instil certain rules and regulations that enable a functioning and healthy ecosystem, and KYC will be integral part in facilitating this,” added Rayissa.</p>

  <p>In the last 10 years machine learning has become ubiquitous and touches all lives in ways that was unimaginable before. The machines can make decisions that required considerable human effort at a much faster speed and reduced cost with a little human oversight. As a result, machines don’t just have a higher than before influence in shaping our lives but are also under increased scrutiny by both regulators as well as user rights advocates.<br> The adage “with great power comes great responsibility” has long been used – from French revolution to superhero comics. It has never been truer as the great power that machine learning wields is now in the hands of almost anyone making a software product. It ranges from giving people access to the funds that can alter their lifepath, medical diagnosis that can increase their life expectancy or reduce it dramatically to their social media feed that cannot just provide them the content that keeps them engaged, but also polarise their beliefs by feeding them information that reinforces their existing notions.<br> With the growing influence of AI technologies and the corresponding scrutiny, the way AI development happens is beginning to change. The full data science lifecycle needs to incorporate the elements of responsible AI and the professionals who know how to design and implement these will be the ones that employers will look for.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/responsable-and-ethical-ai-eic2023"></a>

  <p>There are several sessions at this year’s EIC looking at the roles of policies in IAM, for modernizing and efficiency gains in IGA, for authentication and fraud detection, and for authorization. In his keynote, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will take a broader perspective and look at why the future of IAM and cybersecurity must and will be policy-based. This involves policies in IGA, policies in cybersecurity, hierarchies of policies, policies for application developers and IaaS administrators, policies in Zero Trust, overcoming static entitlements, policies in the context of DID (decentralized identities), and other topics. He also will discuss what needs to be done where, such as Policy Governance, Data Governance, and Policy Lifecycle Management, and why the shift to policy-based approaches requires a multi-speed approach, with policies in new digital services coming faster than policies for modernizing legacy IAM.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-of-iam-cybersecurity-is-policy-based-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Vertical risk management and complete identity governance can only be achieved through integration of critical platforms with other systems and applications in use and by either integrating existing point-solutions or reducing their number altogether. Integration of the identity-platform with SAP is one of those major challenges for many organizations today.</p>
<p>One Identity’s approach to this challenge is through a unifying, standard integration into SAP as well as other systems and applications to establish a common GRC framework and security concept. Which includes preventing isolated environments. To establish SAP-internal governance and minimize risk within the platforms privilege landscape most organizations use specialized embedded tools like ECS (Easy Content Solution) from IBS-Schreiber Solution. Integrating the identity management platform with the SAP rule-set administration allows SAP Rule sets to be applied directly, run SoD-analysis fast and efficiently and extend them to other systems and applications, such as MS AD, AAD. The potential value of this approach is significant as it allows a preventive risk-assessment throughout the whole SAP-stack.</p>
<p>This integrative approach also extends to the SAP Firefighter concept for it to be applied to the rulesets and extend these into other systems. The objective is clear: Simplify risk assessment and management, establish a unified identity administration framework and as baseline - reduce cost.</p>
<p>In short – it lays the foundation and framework for solid Governance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/sap-governance-enterprise-environment-integration-eic2023"></a>

  <p>For many years public concern about technological risk has focused on the misuse of personal data, with GDPR, most hated and loved at the same time as one of the results. With the huge success of LLMs and generative AIs such as ChatGPT,&nbsp; artificial intelligence soon will be omnipresent&nbsp; in products and processes, which will shift regulator´s attention to the potential for bad or biased decisions by algorithms. Just imagine the consequences of a false medical diagnose, or of a correct diagnose created by an AI and then not accepted by the doctor. Not to mention all the other fields where bad AI can be harmful, such as autonomous cars or algorithms deciding on your future credibility. Inevitably, many governments will feel regulation is essential to protect consumers from that risk.</p>
<p>In this panel discussion we will try to jointly create a list of those risks that we need to regulate the sooner the better and try to create an idea on how this future regulation will impact the way we use AI in our bsuiness and private lives.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-governance-regulation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Companies are facing increasingly complex security threats. Many are struggling to assess their own security risks due to an inability to address potential issues as they arise, due to the breakneck pace at which issues are disclosed, and teams' ability to address said issues as they accumulate and because the huge number of security tools in use create diagnostic&nbsp;fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vulnerability management programs rarely ever match the overall scale of the organization, boosting the number of potential points of exposure. What's more, besides vulnerabilities, attackers are increasingly&nbsp;leveraging&nbsp;exposures such as misconfigurations and stolen credentials to gain access to companies' core business. Because of this, attack paths to critical assets are often overlooked or identified too late.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at vast numbers of isolated issues, XM Cyber aggregates them into an attack graph to proactively identify hidden attack paths and weaknesses in both the cloud and on-premises. XM Cyber helps organizations efficiently address the issues that can have the greatest impact on organizational&nbsp;risk. Then teams can eliminate attack paths at critical junctures, i.e., choke points, in order to achieve ultra-efficient risk remediation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/continuous-exposure-management-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Still developing CIAM in-house? Discover the realities of serving 50 million customers using Hosted Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) as a service (SaaS) from a vendor.</p>
<p>Customer Identity and Access Management is one of the most critical platform components. How big of a risk would it be for the large enterprise to delegate it to the vendor solution? And how much risk would it be to not do it? <br> <br> In 2019 our Eastern Europe business was struggling with Accounts Takeovers where botnets of 1 million IPs total size were involved in massive credential stuffing attacks. And we decided to replace all our legacy auth with a vendor solution. <br> <br> In this session we will go through the key moments of such transition and the key learnings from the past 4 years. We won’t miss the aspect of value proposition, customer experience, real cost and return on such an investment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ciam-as-a-service-europe-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Decentralized identity has made its waves in the EU with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) and in the US with various funded projects. A vast market in south-east Asia stays untapped. We have enabled our partner organization ZADA to build a decentralized identity ecosystem that connects various southeast Asian countries with numerous cases like 'Decentralized Vaccination TravelPass', 'Employment IDs', and 'Government issued Educational Credentials'. The journey of a decentralized identity platform from ideation to MVP and to a scalable production system can bring tremendous insights. We were able to successfully enable the public sector in Myanmar to engage with self-sovereign identity and bring value to its citizens by issuing over more than a quarter million digital credentials. Monetization of these credentials was an essential factor for us. These self-sovereign identity credentials varied in use cases and were verified by Singapore immigration, Public sector hospitals, the Education Ministry of Myanmar, the Health Ministry of Myanmar, and various other private sector vendors. Our journey covers various use cases in EdTech, HealthTech, IAM, and KYC. Explored right, these cases can help us dive into how enterprises can engage with the southeast Asian identity market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-ecosystem-southeast-asia-eic2023"></a>

This especially is true looking forward to mandates for the adoption of zero trust frameworks in which digital credentials will be issued and then used for identification and operational purposes. GLEIF is committed to making concrete and lasting improvements to the process of identity verification by leveraging the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in digital tools. GLEIF has made the LEI verifiable by creating the vLEI (verifiable LEI) with digital credentials that deliver decentralized identification and verification for organizations as well as the persons who represent their organizations either in official or functional roles. GLEIF has made much progress on developing the governance, credentials and infrastructure since introducing the vLEI in 2020 and will share an updated at this progress in this session.</p>

In this session, we will explore the insights that can be gained through the analysis of global DID data. At Danube Tech GmbH, we have developed version trackers that monitor various DID methods, such as did:indy, did:ebsi, did:ion and others, collecting and storing data on DID transactions in our database for analysis. During this session, we will present the results of our latest analyses, including trends in DID transactions over time, distributions across different verification methods, and errors found in DIDs and DID documents. This information can be valuable for businesses looking to understand and utilize DIDs in their operations, as well as for individuals seeking to use DIDs for their own digital identity management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-decentralized-identifier-data-eic2023"></a>

  <p>This session will share how the concept of a Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) has evolved since 155 identity experts proposed it in 2021. It summarizes a recent paper by the non-profits that guide the GAIN vision.<br> <br> GAIN remains a call for collaboration toward globally interoperable identity assurance at-scale - a purpose that underpins the goals of governments, intergovernmental agencies, and private industry. It has inspired multiple working groups and continues to unite six non-profits - even (and especially) as the technical and policy landscape evolves to include emerging standards (e.g. MDLs, DIDs, VCs) and regulation (e.g. eIDAS 2.0).<br> <br> This talk reflects on GAIN's relevance in today’s landscape and shares progress. It includes a deep dive into the technical community group at the OpenID Foundation, which has built a prototype that demonstrates cross-network trust and high-assurance identity data exchange. It now turns its attention to digital wallets, verifiable credentials, legal entity identifiers, and government-issued IDs.<br> <br> It also reviews forward-thinking policy work by the Open Identity Exchange, which paves the way for Smart Digital IDs. Their Global Policy Metadata Framework proposes the standard publication of policy characteristics. In this world, policy metadata is shared between each trust framework through trusted wallets.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/gain-2023-and-beyond-eic2023"></a>

In the digital world&nbsp;the consumer is The Invisible Man - more difficult to interact and connect with but wanting a simple, effortless digital experience with impeccable security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore how identity is the link between both worlds and is the centre of every great customer experience.

  <p>The European Union’s regulation on Digital Identity, eIDAS, is currently being overhauled to adopt decentralized identity principles. The goal is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials, from eIDs to diplomas to payment instruments. Decentralized identity principles aim at giving freedom of choice and control to the end-user. Ensuring security and interoperability, however, will be challenging — especially in the enormous scale in terms of users and use cases the EU is aiming at. The choices made in eIDAS will have a huge impact on digital identity in the EU and beyond.</p>
<p>The so-called “Architecture and Reference Framework” (ARF) defines the technical underpinnings of eIDAS v2. Many experts from the member states and the Commission have been working on this framework over the last year, trying to select the best combination of technologies and standards out of the enormous number available in the market today. This talk will introduce the ARF and explain what architectural patterns and technical standards are adopted and how the challenges mentioned above are addressed in order to leverage on the vision of the eIDAS v2 regulation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eu-goes-decentralized-eic2023"></a>

<p>At IPFS Thing 2023, Engineer Blaine Cook presented his work on the Name Name System, a tool that could improve the discoverability of IPFS-hosted content.</p> What's in a Name? <p>Let's start with the basics. First, let's define what a name is and isn't. A name is public, globally unique, and verifiable. </p>  Public - viewable by everyone  Globally unique - cannot be duplicated  Verifiable - possible to prove control of the name using a DID. Examples of verifiable names include DNS hosts and domains, email addresses, social media handles, public keys, HTTP URLs, SSNs, and more.  <blockquote>"A DID is not a name, but all NNS names have at least one valid DID."</blockquote> What is NNS? <p>It is a way to map names to data securely.</p> How Does it Work? <p>Step 1: Select a did:method</p><p>This could be did:ens, did:DNS did:twitter, etc.</p><p>Step 2: Fetch the TXT record for your did:method and find the public key</p><p>Step 3: Input the name and DID data in the NNS form</p>  Name (the name you are assigning to the content)  Issuer (the DID)  Fact Type (DNS link, Mastodon server, etc.)  Fact Value (the pointer to that fact type)  <p>Step 4: Generate a UCAN out of that data</p>  DID for Private Key  UCAN  Signature  <p>Step 5: Store in NNS DHT (shown in Blaine's demo in the recording)</p><p>Step 6: Fetch the record(s) for the name from the DHT and use the data in the UCAN</p><p>Since a name is tied to a specific DID, and the DID is self-validating, there is no way to manipulate a name you don't have control over. We enable authentication (DID) and authorization (UCAN) in a distributed P2P system and create a DHT by storing the UCAN in NNS, thus opening up many exciting possibilities. &nbsp;</p> What Problems Does NNS Help Solve? <p>Discoverability - NNS helps users find other users' public keys without knowing the DID method they used to generate them. It also allows the user to find where another user shares content tied to that DID. </p><p>Encrypted Chat - NNS can be a mechanism for enabling encrypted communication</p><p>IPFS Search - If you want to know where someone's IPFS-hosted blog exists, finding it can be very difficult if you don't know the CID. NNS helps locate specific content by its name, which is much more human-readable and easier to remember.</p><p>Package Naming - Similar to IPFS Search, NNS makes locating specific Wasm code easier through package naming.</p> What is NNS Not? <p>It's not a petname system. Petnames don't cross connectivity or trust barriers. In a local-first future, we need names to help us continue working offline and ensure we interact with the person/data we intend.</p><p>It's not a way to prove ownership of a name (that's what the DIDs are for!). It helps you discover those proofs.</p><p>It's not a new namespace. </p><p>It's not guaranteed to be globally consistent.</p><p>It's not a blockchain.</p> Possibilities <p>It can bring together all existing standards in one place instead of trying to create a new standard.</p>XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">https://xkcd.com/927/</a><p>It could replace IPNS and DNSLink by improving latency and security. Yes, a decentralized DNS!</p><p>Currently, there are several ways to link DNS names to the decentralized web, but virtually no options link email, social handles, HTTP, etc.</p><p>We could enable permissionless usage of names that we don't own using NNS by signing a proof that we own an email address (for example) even if that email is from a centralized service that hasn't enabled interactions with some new decentralized service. </p> Next Steps <p>This work is in the beginning/experimental stages, and many questions still need to be answered. We also need to solve for latency and locality and ensure a degree of consistency. </p><p>Here's the recording of Blaine's presentation at IPFS Thing 2023.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about NNS, you can review the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/nns-the-name-name-system/3684">spec</a> and join our monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan?tk=I52b5p">UCAN community calls</a>. </p><p> </p>

  The G7 is pushing for increased oversight of P2P cryptocurrency transactions through the&nbsp;FATF.  Authorities insist that the proposed regulatory changes could lead to a safer and more transparent cryptocurrency market, fostering wider adoption.  These stricter regulations raise concerns about privacy rights and could increase costs for crypto service providers.  <p>Cryptocurrencies have surged onto the global stage, carving out a significant niche in an increasingly digital world. However, the rapid expansion of this relatively nascent market has also been accompanied by notable challenges.</p><p>The Group of Seven (G7), recognizing these challenges, is now pushing for improved oversight of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. And although this call to action has its share of potential benefits, it also underscores the complex realities of&nbsp;change.</p> A Significant Shift <p>The G7’s call for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to intensify its scrutiny signals a significant shift in global regulatory focus.</p><p>The FATF, an intergovernmental body known for setting global standards against illicit financial activities, currently only supervises transactions that go through crypto service providers. By extending this oversight to include peer-to-peer transactions, the G7 aims to cast a broader safety net over the global crypto landscape.</p><p>This proposition comes at a pivotal moment as digital currencies continue to gain traction worldwide, with regulators insisting that a robust regulatory framework is not just essential anymore — it’s imperative.</p><p>Authorities believe enhanced oversight could curb illicit activities, strengthen overall market confidence and security, spur trust among users and potential investors, and set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>More on the topic: G7’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p> The Flip&nbsp;Side <p>This regulatory coin involves striking a delicate balance between increased oversight and the sanctity of user privacy — a valued feature that has been central to the appeal of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While necessary for mitigating risks, regulations may impinge on the freedom and privacy that crypto users have come to appreciate.</p><p>Also, the increased costs for crypto service providers to adhere to new regulations could indirectly affect the users. While some view these potential costs as necessary for the sector’s evolution, others fear it could hamper innovation and growth in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Balancing these aspects — privacy, security, and cost — will be a crucial part of the regulatory evolution.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule — Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p> Final Note <p>While the G7 calls for enhanced oversight of individual cryptocurrency transactions is a significant step towards a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem, it is essential to tread carefully.</p><p>The crypto landscape is a complex and rapidly evolving one, and ensuring its sustainable growth requires a regulatory approach that considers all sides of the equation.</p><p>The crypto world is on the brink of significant changes, but with careful consideration and balance, these changes could pave the way for a brighter crypto&nbsp;future.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

From the generic meta-patterns at the conference covering themes such as collaboration, standards, multi-cloud and technology integration, through to more IAM focused conversations covering MFA, passkeys and authentication attacks. Are passkeys now here to stay? What will help adoption? Will attacks on passkeys start to increase along with usage rates? Will attacks against existing MFA forms including SIM swap, MFA fatigue and social engineering be a compelling event to improve adoption?</p>

<p>Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is a critical requirement for organizations. In the past we’ve talked about the need for CLM <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/05/the-speed-of-business-is-fast-is-your-pki-keeping-up/">due to CA sprawl and concerns around legacy PKI</a>, and it being a means to rein that in and centralize certificates across environments. We also know that the number of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/12/the-trend-continues-organizations-are-managing-and-issuing-more-certificates-than-ever/">machine identities are on the rise</a> and in addition to the sheer number of machine identities that need to be managed, they also bring complexities – such as short-life certificates – that make manual processes unsustainable.</p>
<p>While those are excellent reasons to invest in a proper CLM tool, let’s talk a bit more about the role of CLM in relation to overall IT strategy – like implementing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and preparing for post-quantum.</p>
<p>Zero Trust</p>
<p>Digital certificates provide identity to people and machines, such as mobile devices, virtual machines, and IoT devices. Those certificates need to be issued by a PKI/certificate authority, which will then be able to verify that thing and give it access, whether that’s allowing someone access to your network, or servers talking to one another.</p>
<p>The part where CLM comes in as an important component of your overall Zero Trust strategy is in making sure you have strong issuance protection for your certificates. Essentially making sure no rogue certificates get issued giving too much access or privilege. This same reasoning applies to the need for control at any stage in the lifecycle of a certificate, like revocation.</p>
<p>Going one step further, here’s how CLM helps enforce the principles of Zero Trust:</p>
 
 Verify Explicitly – Making sure the right certificate is provisioned to the correct endpoint/target 
 Least Privilege – Providing the right assurance and access/privilege, by picking the correct certificate and lifecycle controls to be able to issue and manage it 
 Assume Breach – The ability to contain an attack and limit the loss and damage by revoking certificates (incident response) 
 
<p>Post-Quantum </p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum preparedness, there is a looming <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">threat to existing cryptography</a>, which means organizations need to take steps today to prepare for the migration to quantum-safe cryptography. One of the first steps in that preparation is to have visibility into your cryptographic assets – from hardware and software to keys, certificates, and secrets.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways CLM can help:</p>
 
 Inventory. With robust discovery capabilities, CLM tools can help centralize the visibility of certificates across environments, from different certification authorities, so you know what credentials you have and where. 
 Identify Weak Cryptography. Is your cryptography up to date? Do you have hard-coded algorithms?<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/"> Are you crypto-agile</a>? The right tools can identity any risks you might have with your cryptography so you can remediate in advance of preparing for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
 Consolidation. Going back to a core use of CLM – reining in the CA sprawl – it can be a tool to help migrate and consolidate your PKI footprint, making the transition to PQC much easier. 
 Automation. With the growth in the number of certificates organizations are managing, and the complexities of IT landscapes, organizations are looking for automation. There’s too much to manage and it’s too great of a risk to not have, making it a necessity. Pairing that with the migration challenge of PQC, automation will be a key ingredient to successful implementations. 
 
<p>Whether for the practical reasons of ensuring you have visibility and control over your environments, or for the more strategic reasons of implementing Zero Trust and preparing for post-quantum, make sure you’re using the right CLM tool alongside your PKI to ensure a secure future.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Hamzat and I am an Ontology harbinger.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am a quiet and simple person in general. However, I get things done quickly when something piques my interest. My strength is my ability to work really well within a team. I like to have an impact on the success of my team, therefore, I work hard and contribute many of my own&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering before starting my career. My hobbies include reading, traveling, and going on adventures. If I could have a superpower, it would be to be positioned whereby I can do things that make me happy and support humanity each and every day without having to worry about financial implications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology as a harbinger in 2017 to help others to understand and contribute to the company’s vision and mission. My role is to provide support for Ontology’s English-speaking community members. This involves providing members with information on the Ontology project or assisting them with any questions they might have. I also run a procurement company (BitKong General Merchandise) aside from volunteering with Ontology.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has been well-funded from the start and devoid of any crypto drama. As a project, it places huge value on its community and acts on any community feedback related to the Ontology product offering. Ontology is wholly dedicated to building the most impactful thing for the crypto space — a framework for Decentralized Identity Management, and this is something that sets it apart as a Web3&nbsp;project.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Although I don’t have an active part in developing the Ontology project, I enjoy supporting the success of the project through my role. I contribute to building a community with a rich knowledge of the Ontology project, disseminating any information, and offering support to&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>I am very grateful for the time spent working with Ontology. While it has been a tough journey, it has sharpened my perception as an individual. Also, being able to provide support to other people, irrespective of their background, and being recognized for my efforts frequently, is very fulfilling for&nbsp;me.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about being able to contribute to the growth of the Ontology community and provide much-needed support to the ever-growing network of Ontology members. I have seen how Ontology has succeeded in recent years as a decentralized identity provider and how the project has grown steadily, so I am very excited to see how it&nbsp;expands.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I expect Ontology to be very successful in the next five years and to become a dominant force to contend with in the industry. I think it will outpace its competitors with its data privacy protection products and decentralized identity management tools, and thus, become a widely adopted Web3 project with a high price appreciation for its native&nbsp;token.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-hamzat-5f01a23ee227">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Hamzat</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>As organizations undergo digital transformation to zero-trust architectures, identity-driven security becomes a critical aspect. Beyond new authentication technologies, organizations must have strong authorization controls. Today, if and when an identity is compromised, the attacker can make lateral movements with very few restrictions and access a wide range of critical systems and information. Much of this over-permissive environment can be attributed to manual permissions management processes that are hard to maintain over time. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), which underlie these manual processes, provide a good baseline for access security. However, their complexity grows over time and the management overhead they place oftentimes subvert the very goals of security and compliance they are deployed for. Just-In-Time Access Management (JITAM) represents a new robust and secure authorization strategy that can reduce the need for periodic access certifications and manual role administration, while providing auditability. Learn how the authorization space is rapidly changing from RBAC and ABAC to JITAM, and how it could benefit your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/whats-next-in-enterprise-authorization-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Cross device flows lets a user initiate an action on one device (e.g. a SmartTV) and authenticate or authorize that action on a trusted personal device (e.g. a mobile phone). Examples includes authorizing a smart TV to access streaming content, or authenticating to a service by scanning a QR code with a mobile phone and completing the authentication on the mobile phone. This process of authorizing an action on a separate (but trusted) device from the one on which an action is initiated is an increasingly common flow, whether used for devices with limited input capabilities, multi-factor authentication or credential presentation. A number of standards have adopted this pattern including Device Authorization Grant (formerly Device Code Flow), Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) and Self Issued OpenID Provider (SIOP). These flows solve important business problems, but is vulnerable to attacks where the user is tricked into granting consent to an attacker. The IETF OAuth working group has recognised this challenge and is creating new guidance that leverages zero-trust principles to defend against these "illicit consent grant" attacks. This session will discuss the attacks and how the new guidance can mitigate these threats against cross device flows.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cross-device-flows-illicit-consent-grant-attacks-eic2023"></a>

Identity and authorization credentials as well as policies are a key enabler of securing the API endpoints.<br> <br> These different ZTA approaches include:<br> <br> 1) ZTA Using Enhanced Identity Governance, <br> 2) ZTA Using Micro-Segmentation, and<br> 3) ZTA Using Network Infrastructure and Software Defined Perimeters.<br> <br> Our presentation will demonstrate how Trust Frameworks and Identity Governance (1) are the foundational layer for a credentialing infrastructure.

  <p>In this session, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts look at the potential of utilizing DID approaches within the enterprise. This session will look at the business benefits, the steps involved, important considerations, challenges, pitfalls, and recommendations for implementing decentralized identity. Martin&nbsp;will explain the potential and look at how this will impact existing technologies such as IGA, PAM, and Access Management, and how this relates to other trends such as WfA, BYOD, Policy-based Access, and more. He also will outline where interoperability and standards must further evolve to enable organizations in re-inventing their IAM, without ripping everything apart.&nbsp;He will discuss the steps involved, important considerations, challenges, pitfalls, and recommendations for implementing decentralized identity in the enterprise.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/leveraging-decentralized-identity-enterprise-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The past few years have seen a startling increase in decentralized technologies for Digital Identities. So far, much of their adoption has been limited to academic or proof-of-concept integrations (barring some shining examples) rather than consolidated production-ready use cases.</p>
<p>Generally, there isn't an enforced link between real-world and digital identities, and rightfully so. Still, enterprises' policies and regulations mandate companies to ensure restricted access to reserved data and undeniable attribution, which collides with general anonymity and distributed principles. Albeit SSI technologies aim at filling this gap with trusted-yet-privacy-preserving solutions, companies still need to consolidate digital identities and collapse them into a well-defined entity. We will talk about a hybrid approach to classic IAM for workforce management including W3C native credential integration with solidified and well-established SSO federations. In other words, delegate to the end users the choice of which identity technology to use as long as they can provide a trust chain that the companies can verify.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hybrid-iam-interoperable-verifiable-credentials-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The most interesting thing about recent AI innovations in the field of LLMs (Large Language Models) such as ChatGPT is that there is not much discussion going on about the effects LLMs will have on our daily lives, the way we consume information, seek guidance and the way we create information. Will we still need Identity Governnance Tools in 5 years time or will a universal cyber-AI have taken over the task of securely running the enterprise you currently work for?&nbsp;What about Tech Analysts and their guidance work? Will 90% of their work be done by non-humans? In this session we will try to jointly find answers on how tech guidance and consulting/advisory will change and, at least partly, disappear.</p>
<p>And this is how ChatGPT would write the Abstract of this discussion:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The session on "Tech Guidance in the Era of Polycrisis &amp; AI Driven Disruptive Change" will examine the increasing disruptive pressure on today´s business models caused by an evolving landscape of AI driven technology and the critical role of tech analysts to help organizations navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the convergence of multiple crisis and the rapid pace of technological change.</p>
<p>Topics to be covered include the evolving role of tech analysts in an AI-driven world, the importance of understanding the ethical implications of technology, and the impact of technological change on job markets and society as a whole. The session will also delve into the challenges of staying abreast of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing technological landscape, as well as the importance of fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within organizations.</p>
<p>Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with speakers and other participants in a lively discussion of these critical issues, gaining valuable insights into the future role of tech analysts in helping organizations succeed in an era of polycrisis and AI-driven change and disruption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/tech-guidance-polycrisis-ai-change-eic2023"></a>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted standard for authorization, but it can be complex to implement correctly. It's not uncommon for developers to have difficulty understanding the nuances of the OAuth 2.0 flow and instead rely on simpler approaches such as using API keys in "god mode."<br> <br> OAuth 2.0 can be difficult to set up and configure, especially for developers who are new to the standard. It involves creating an OAuth 2.0 client, setting up redirect URIs, and managing access and refresh tokens, which can be confusing and time-consuming. Additionally, the standard requires developers to handle user authentication and authorization separately, which can be difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the concepts.<br> <br> Many developers may not understand the security benefits of OAuth 2.0 over API keys. OAuth 2.0 allows for fine-grained access control, enabling developers to limit access to specific resources and actions. In contrast, API keys provide more open access, allowing all actions on all resources. Developers may be inclined to use API keys instead of OAuth 2.0 because they are simpler and easier to implement, but they don't offer the same level of security.<br> Developers may find it hard to understand the standards, and may end up using an inconsistent approach.<br> <br> The panel will discuss these reasons and other potential causes for why developers may not be using OAuth 2.0 correctly, and provide recommendations for how to overcome these challenges. We will highlight the benefits of OAuth 2.0, such as improved security and the ability to provide fine-grained access control, to encourage developers to adopt the standard. Additionally we will give examples of real-world attack scenarios that could have been avoided if the application was using OAuth 2.0.</p>

<p>We entrust workloads and devices with our most sensitive data, giving them access to far more information than the human on whose behalf it operates, if it is even operating on behalf of a human. Yet, managing these non-human identities and applying Zero Trust Policies to them is a Herculean task complicated by a heterogenous technology landscape, amplified by multi-cloud/multi-hybrid environments, exacerbated by critical skills shortages and magnified by exponential growth in workload and device identities. <br> <br> It's the kind of problem standards excel at solving by creating interoperability layers between heterogenous environments, codifying the wisdom of the crowd to alleviate pressures on rare skills, and creating eco-systems of interoperable solutions that meet a common security bar. <br> <br> Fortunately there are already several standards efforts that can help us manage non-human identities. But how are all these efforts related and how to we avoid replacing a patchwork of heterogenous solutions with a patchwork of heterogenous standards? Is it possible to craft a standards framework and connect all these efforts in a single identity trust fabric, and is that desirable? If we had such a framework, what would it look like? <br> <br> In this talk we explore the benefits of weaving a standards framework for non-human identities by bringing together more than 18 standards from at least 7 standards bodies while identifying opportunities to align and connect them all to solve the emerging challenge of managing non-human identities at scale.</p>

<p>As always, there is something new and relevant in this. The fundamental question for many organizations will be on how to address the identity threat challenge best. Does it require new or different tools, or just a different use of what is already there? What to look for specifically? And how to reduce the risk of identity-based attacks?

  <p>As a global OEM of highly critical and complex industrial devices, managing access to hundreds of millions of IIoT device resources spread across customer sites all around the globe is already a challenging task. &nbsp;<br> Use cases for providing a digital service platform need to address end customers accessing devices owned by themselves as well as priviledged access for in house and third party analytics applications and serice personnel. A combination of requirements for excelent user experience, authorization management and high performance for cross-tenant queries for endless scenarios can become a nightmare. &nbsp;<br> The task was to analyze the access requirements, abstract them and then deploy a “Zanzibar” inspired approach to manage access authorizations with a swift and reliable backend architecture, able to handle millions of information assets to be protected against unauthorized access. &nbsp;<br> Creating a mere access model does not do the full trick - it has to be cleverly designed into data storage structures and queries to achive the required performance goals! &nbsp;<br> The talk quickly introduces the problem set and then dives deeper into how to implement data storage optimization magic to get quick response times and swift adjustments of authorizations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/spicing-up-authorization-eic2023"></a>

Most frequently encountered are probably “user” and “identity” - do they represent the same type of entity or is a difference intended?

  <p>Regulatory bodies, government agencies, and CIOs are mandating Zero Trust as a cyber security framework. What does Zero Trust mean for your security strategy? With a Zero Trust security model, nobody is trusted automatically, even when they’ve cleared the perimeter. Instead, all identities are verified, minimum access is granted based on context, and activities are monitored to make sure controls are working as expected. The Zero Trust model requires multiple security controls throughout an IT environment to protect and manage identities, devices, networks, applications, and data. This session will take you through the reality check of where Zero Trust started, how it has evolved over the years and what does it really mean for your organization today.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beyond-zero-trust-zero-friction-eic2023"></a>

So let’s keep them all together in a scalable cloud storage repository. Once it is there, it is just like any other big data. We need to analyze and apply intelligent monitoring to detect situations of interest. So we need to apply trained ML models to a stream of such data for immediate alerting when the traces indicate an unwanted behavior occurring or brewing.

  <p>Do you know during the peak holiday season, 75% of the traffic on your site can be malicious or bot?<br> <br> In 2022, there has been an 85% increase in Account takeover and it results in not only monetary losses but also losing consumer trust. <br> <br> To address these, the right authentication strategy is a combination of active authentication (SMS, Push Notification, WebAuthn, passkeys) and passive authentication that includes IP reputation, device fingerprinting, and user behavior analysis. This enables a frictionless experience for “good users” without lowering the defenses for “bad users.” <br> In this session, we’ll explore Dark Web techniques, open-source tools, and services that fraudsters use for credential stuffing, fake account creation, and account takeovers. In addition, we’ll share a practitioner's viewpoint on rolling out various active and passive authentication solutions and how the convergence of identity and fraud can help you build the right passwordless strategy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/better-passwordless-experience-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Italy has two National Digital Identity schemes, namely: SPID and CieID (leveraging the national ID card). Both of them are based on SAML2 and are on their way to supporting OpenID Connect. The reasons for this decision are numerous, and they are primarily related to OpenID Connect Core features such as flexibility, ease of implementation, better support for mobile applications, and widespread adoption, particularly in the private sector. To manage this transition, we considered several documents by the OAuth working group describing security best Current Practices and the OpenID Foundation specifying a profile for iGov and a framework for federation. In particular, the latter defines a hierarchical federation model with high security, interoperability, scalability, and transparency based on dynamic delegation mechanisms; Italy is an enthusiastic early adopter. <br> In this talk, we introduce the Italian OpenID Connect profile based on the iGov and federation profiles and explain the main security measures that we considered within our design from the aforementioned standards and available best current practices. We also discuss how the Italian OpenID Connect profile contributes to the iGov and OpenID Connect Federation documents. We conclude the presentation with a brief discussion of eIDAS 2.0 and some of the ongoing preliminary works in the context of the Italian digital identity ecosystem to move toward an SSI-based solution using the Italian OpenID Connect profile as a starting point.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/italian-digital-identity-ecosystem-eic2023"></a>

That data can also be used to cause harm, but technology alone will not solve the problems of control, protection of basic rights, and the delivery of fair and fraud resistant services. <br> <br> In this session Adam Cooper seeks to identify the real questions we should be asking and provides his own insights based on over a decade of working with governments, citizens, and the private sector to deliver better outcomes for all of us.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/centralized-or-decentralized-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Securing access to data and applications has become a cornerstone of any modern cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>User access governance projects however have a history of incurring multi-year roll-outs and requiring specialized personnel, making many companies shy away and bear excessive cyber risk.</p>
<p>For those companies, approaching user access governance as a data problem can provide the answer. This approach effectively trims down user access governance to its essentials: low-effort data collection, user-friendly risk analytics, access reviews and plugging into the existing ITSM processes. This data-driven approach has the potential to let companies achieve mature access governance in a matter of days, not months.</p>
<p>In this session, Elimity CEO Maarten will give an overview of the essentials of user access governance and will showcase how this approach is successfully applied in practice by industry leaders such as <a href="https://www.securitas.com/">Securitas</a>, <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/">the Belgian Railroads</a> and <a href="https://www.federale.be/">Federale Assurances</a>.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mature-access-governance-eic2023"></a>

You may have seen this before through the disguise of acronyms such as ReBAC (relationship-based), KBAC (knowledge-based), PBAC (policy-based), NGAC (Next-Generation), FGA (fine-grained), and even some implementations of ABAC (attribute-based). All of these terms refer to techniques that use graphs to enforce access-control for any level of coarseness.<br> <br> In this session you will learn why all the latest Dynamic Authorization offerings on the market use GBAC in a way or another, and how you can successfully adopt the technique yourself. Graphs are becoming ubiquitous - one can just look at the rise of the GraphQL API model to witness their popularity first-hand. Through concrete, real-life examples we will showcase the use of graphs to solve common access problems using the same modern and future-proof techniques that you see in the current authorization market.<br> <br> As a result, storing all identity data in graphs truly unlocks its full potential. Graphs are data-science and analytics enablers, and have the potential to transform the IAM practice from a cost centre to a true revenue generator. We’ll explore how this can happen for you too…</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/graph-based-access-control-eic2023"></a>

<p>Employees don’t need us. And by employee, I mean more than end-users. This is a broader conversation; including software developers, IT engineers, DevOps practitioners, and more. To get people to opt in and follow secure practices, we turn to behavior science. IT security leaders must offer them a compelling experience. In this panel we will discuss how to&nbsp;carefully balance the need for security, compliance, and efficient resource management to ensure that your cloud environment is both secure and effective.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/rethinking-cloud-access-management-eic2023"></a>

  <p>PAM (Privileged Access Management) is one of the established core disciplines within IAM. PAM also is the IAM discipline that is changing most from what it has been in the past.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is the impact of CIEM &amp; DREAM, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management or Dynamic Resource Entitlement &amp; Access Management. This is about the expansion of PAM beyond humans accessing servers and selected applications towards any type of human and non-human (silicon) identity accessing any type of workload, from servers to dynamic cloud resources. This also implies an expansion from serving static data center infrastructures to dynamic workloads in today’s agile IT. PAM is changing, with more parties involved – a “PAMocracy”, as KuppingerCole Analyst Paul Fisher recently named it.</p>
<p>These changes also require expansions in integration to other IT services. There needs to be a dynamic governance approach, where IGA comes into play. It requires rethinking whether PAM tools really should care for authentication. There is no need for authentication point solutions in an age where most organizations have a strong Access Management solution with MFA, passwordless authentication and adaptive, risk- and context-based access in place. Finally, this new PAM must integrate with the DevOps tools chain for permanent updates about new code and the resources used as well as with IT Asset Management for an always up-to-date insight into the ever-changing, dynamic IT landscape that needs to be protected.</p>
<p>Also worth to think about is integration with further security solutions, beyond the standard SIEM/SOAR integration. AI-powered security solutions are one aspect. Integration to Cloud Security Posture Management is another example.</p>
<p>In this panel, the state and requirements on the future PAM will be discussed.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-role-of-pam-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Access control is a key part of cyber security, however traditional approaches do not work well for modern business IT environments that nowadays typically include a mix of applications on-prem and across multiple cloud environments.</p>
<p>Most modern companies tend to struggle with access management for a variety of reasons. These include the fact that it is difficult to make the necessary connections to the many disparate IT systems for which they need to provision access, role-based access management is challenging, static role-based entitlements are difficult to manage and typically require regular recertification processes, and traditional approaches are focused on granting access to resources required by an individual to perform their job function, but do not cover how those rights are actually used to stop any abuse of entitlements.</p>
<p>In addition, course-grained authorization is no longer sufficient because modern applications and sensitive data assets in cloud-native, containerized and DevOps environments require fine grained authorization capabilities that can also supply identity attributes and context variables.</p>
<p>A policy-based approach can address many of the pain points experienced by organizations today by enabling a centralized, consistent, dynamic, on-demand (just-in-time) way of managing access to IT resources. In this panel session we will discuss nothing less than the future of Access Management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/getting-rid-of-roles-recertification-eic2023"></a>

 How would such an Officer quantify the value of the identity infrastructure to the business? 
 Does the need for the role differ based on industry sector and geography? 
 How would this role fit with the Chief Digital Officer, Information Security Officer, and Privacy / Data Protection Officer? 
 And how would this make things better for the digital identity practitioner and the industry as a whole?

  <p>Imagine a world where security risks are identified and mitigated before they even happen. Imagine if access and auditing recommendations were made with the precision of a computer algorithm. Imagine the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices. We have reached an inflection point in the world of AI.&nbsp;The release of technologies like ChatGPT is as monumental as the development of the internet or Google as a search engine.&nbsp;AI is going to change the way we think about IGA. With the capabilities of AI, IGA solutions can provide a higher level of granularity, faster data processing, and more complex analysis to better identify and mitigate risks in real-time. This will lead to more effective risk management, smarter access and auditing recommendations, and increased automation of processes and operations. But this is just the beginning. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even greater benefits from AI-enabled IGA solutions in the future. Imagine a future where your organization's security is not just protected but anticipates and proactively prevents threats before they happen. So I ask you, are you ready to join us in shaping the future of IGA? Are you ready to harness the power of AI to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices? The future is here, and it's time to embrace it.<br> In this talk, attendees will learn about the potential for AI to revolutionize Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-future-of-iga-eic2023"></a>

In this session, we will start with a quick overview of these paradigms and their constituents, before showing how to adapt this to your current state of cybersecurity and your concrete cybersecurity requirements. Based on that, we will look at examples of such concrete architectures, the maturity levels, and on how to build your own roadmap towards the cybersecurity mesh/fabric that makes Zero Trust a reality.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-driven-cybersecurity-mesh-eic2023"></a>

  <p>In this talk, Krishna Balan Kannappan will describe Kone´s path to a holistic and integrated Identity Security infrastructure.</p>
 
 IDM Deployment in KONE includes Lifecycle management of KONE Internal Users and non person accounts. Automated Processes in IDM ensures that minimum accesses required for Internal Users are granted automatically based on User Attributes and all accesses are removed automatically when user leaves the organization. Non Person accounts are hardened automatically based on the usage. 
 Applications authorization is managed by IDM using various provisioning mechanisms. 
 Applications authentication is controlled by Azure AD, MFA enabled is mandated for all applications and end users. 
 Admin Accounts used for Accessing KONE Infrastructure and Workstations are managed in IDM(Microsoft recommended Tier based model is used). 
 Self Service allows Role Owners and Account Owners to Create Access Reviews, Manage Passwords, Manage Access. 
 KONE SOC team uses IDM for performing emergency actions to disable/enable/reset Password of AD Accounts. 
 
<p>Privilege Access Management:</p>
 
 KONE uses PRIVX as the PAM Solution for allowing access to Infrastructure. PAM is integrated with IDM for authorizations. PAM Solution ensures KONE Infratructure cannot be accessed outside PAM by access controls and continuous monitoring. 
 PAM Uses Separate MFA for added Security. 
 Automations are implemented to onboard/offboard Application servers into PAM 
 
<p>DevSecops model is used for Development, automated deployments, Security Scans and automated Testing.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-security-implementation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>When I travel aboard or do business with someone from outside my country, my payment cards and phone work across international boundaries. When will my Digital ID do the same? <br> <br> This presentation will share how OIX’s work on Global Interoperability, part of the GAIN initiative, is defining how this will be possible through smart digital IDs or wallets that dynamically adapt to the policy rules of each new trust framework they encounter in a way that works seamlessly for the end user. <br> <br> So, when I fly to the EU from the US my Digital ID from my US based wallet provider reads the rules of the EU trust framework and simply adapts. I don’t need to get a new local Digital ID for my visit to the EU. The EU trust framework policy rules will be described using a new globally applicable Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework that allows all frameworks to publish their policy characteristics in a standard machine-readable way. <br> <br> My digital ID wallet contains key ‘golden credentials’ that should be accepted all over globe: passport, driving licence, bank account, telco account and my digital national ID card. Each trust framework will value these differently in its own Assurance Policy, which can also be published via the policy rule exchange framework. To make this work, new proofing and data content standards for some of the golden credentials will be required.<br> <br> Technically, exchange of policy rules will be a decentralized approach, where policy rules are shared directly from each trust framework only to wallets they trust. The presentation will also outline the technical architecture to underpin this, and how the Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework will fit as a policy component as part of the Open Wallet Foundation architecture. <br> <br> OIX is working with and analysing various trust frameworks around the global to create the Open Policy Rules framework, including the UK, Canada, EU, Australia, Singapore, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. <br> <br> Come and find out more about how OIX’s vision of allowing us all to have a trusted Digital ID that can be accepted anywhere in the world can be achieved.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-id-wallet-all-over-the-world-eic2023"></a>

   Decentralized Identity is about to change the way we do IAM in enterprises. It is not just about the C-identities (consumers, customers, citizens). This raises two questions: What do to differently in IAM, to leverage the potential of decentralized identities? And what not to do anymore, because it is becoming legacy?

  <p>Decentralized Identity is about to change the way we do IAM in enterprises. It is not just about the C-identities (consumers, customers, citizens). This raises two questions: What do to differently in IAM, to leverage the potential of decentralized identities? And what not to do anymore, because it is becoming legacy? IAM, without any doubt, will change fundamentally. But is it about rip-and-replace of IAM and in particular IGA, or about complementing it? In this panel, &nbsp;we dive into this decentralized lake of innovation, new standards, products, vendors and start-ups in order to find out how to benefit from DIDs in the enterprise.</p>
<p>Are there interoperability models and how could a longer-term migration scenario look like? What about Identity Workflow Orchestration? Join this great panel session to discuss the way forward for workforce identity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-inside-the-enterprise-eic2023"></a>

  <p>There’s a lot of foundational work happening in the space of Selective Disclosure (SD) right now. Selective Disclosure enables you to have a token with many claims (say, an ISO Mobile Drivers’ License (mDL)), and only release the claims necessary to the interaction – for instance, your birthdate but not your home address.&nbsp; Selective Disclosure enables Minimal Disclosure.&nbsp; This is sometimes realized using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) but that’s not always necessary.</p>
<p>In decentralized identity ecosystems, users hold their own credentials to share them with others when needed. One key requirement for these credentials is selective disclosure: instead of sharing the entire credential, users should be able to share only the minimal amount of information necessary for a given use case. This is where SD-JWT comes in.<br> SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) is a new format for enabling selective disclosure in JWTs. It is based on the JOSE family of standards for signing and encryption, making it easy to understand and implement.<br> Developed by the IETF OAuth Working Group, SD-JWT is not limited to verifiable credentials, but can be used universally to provide selective disclosure for any JWT.<br> <br> Due to its simplicity, SD-JWT has quickly gained traction, with several implementations already available and ongoing adoption as an important building block in both commercial and public projects. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts behind SD-JWT and provide a detailed overview of its capabilities and benefits. We will also discuss the current state of SD-JWT adoption and future directions for its development.</p>
<p>Some of the current work pertinent to Selective Disclosure is:</p>

  <p>From digital identity to full scale digital trust, this session is perfect for anyone new to identity, as well as identity professionals who are trying to get a handle on what decentralization is all about and why it is so important for Internet-scale digital trust.<br> <br> In this session, we will cover a brief history of how the identity landscape has gone through an evolution from the dreaded username and password, through centralized, federated and social logins, to now the need for decentralized solutions that support digital trust for both human and objects.<br> <br> We will explain the various actors involved in a decentralized identity trust triangle, what role technology plays (e.g., digital wallets and digital credentials), and how governance of an ecosystem fits in to create the trust diamond. We will discuss various technical components that may be employed and what is required — and more importantly what is not? We will also present how decentralized trust solutions can support the trust of objects that have nothing to do with human identity, but are necessary to create a digital trust landscape that enables digital transactions to happen seamlessly, efficiently, and automatically.<br> <br> We’ll also touch on how the traditional identity solutions and emerging decentralization can co-exist in context appropriate settings.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-rage-eic2023"></a>

According to the Verizon DBIR, more than 80% of breaches start with compromised credentials.Decentralized identity represents a massive paradigm shift to a safer, more secure future by making the user's device the transport mechanism for that single user's data. In other words, no more “trusted” third parties. Decentralized identity eliminates the need to build connections into federation systems, and reduces the amount of personally identifiable information organizations must collect.In short, we’ll discuss how shifting to a decentralized identity model reduces risk for organizations while simultaneously improving users privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-future-of-digital-identity-eic2023"></a>

  <p>This decade may well be labeled “the decade of the digital credential.” From COVID passports to mobile driver’s licenses, digitized credentials transforming to “born digital” credentials, and governments and large tech companies developing their own wallets, personal information has never been easier to share with the wave of a device. The convenience is amazing, and the privacy implications are terrifying. <br><br> Even scoping the issue down to government-issued credentials or credentials directly derived from government data, there are a variety of requirements feeding into this growing ecosystem:</p>
 
 user control of data 
 data minimization 
 relying party accountability 
 extensibility to other domains 
 optional audit log of transactions and ability to assert rights (CCPA, GDPR) 
 minimization of fraud 
 
<p>In this session, Heather Flanagan and Mike Kiser will discuss the outcomes of the recently released white paper on government-issued credentials and the privacy landscape (publication date expected in April 2023). The issues at hand are not solely about policy, nor are they only about technology. It is about closing the policy and protocol gaps that exist between today’s disparate solutions and services and providing a vision of a privacy-preserving, globally viable privacy landscape.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ubiquitous-credential-government-issued-identity-eic2023"></a>

But even the smallest businesses can benefit from this technology. So the question we will answer: What can verifiable credentials do for you if, say, you have a small business?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Let’s start with a few of the problems that all businesses face: employee and access management, engaging customers, and payroll. While larger organizations can have entire teams dedicated to each of these tasks, leaner businesses — such as a single location — might have a small number of people trying to manage everything; this is where verifiable credentials can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s break down exactly how for each business problem.</p>
<p>Employee and Access Management</p>
<p>Employees at any business need to be allowed access to certain things to do their job properly, such as&nbsp; interacting with the suppliers to procure ingredients, or a manager or team lead may need to set the schedule and hours for other employees. By providing everyone a credential it becomes easy to grant these permissions, and for the employees to be able to share that they are authorized by their employer to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>Creating these different levels of access is super easy to set up, it can be as simple as checkboxes — employee X can access suppliers, while employee Z is new, and can only access the time clock to clock in and out. Should an employee leave, removing their access, business-wide, is as simple as revoking their credential: no more need for changing passwords or getting their keys back.</p>
<p>All of this can be coordinated without the complexity and expense of creating direct integrations with external databases. Some of this vision is far reaching (such as lock access via credentials), but some of this (such as employee software access via credentials) is quite real today.</p>
<p>Engaging Customers</p>
<p>Customers are the lifeforce for any business; so, you need to do your best to keep them.This means building relationships, online and in person — and this is where verifiable credentials shine. They enable you to create a trusted digital relationship that enhances the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to build a trusted relationship by enabling direct, semantically described, privacy-preserving, and secure communication with your customers. This is not the same as sending your customer an email or text message and he or she sending one back. This is direct communication that is solely between you and your customer, by consent, and managed through a digital wallet.</p>
 
 Secure verification
 
 Customers can verify they are dealing with a business representative and workers can verify customers. This would be critical for any home medical provider. 
 The Agent software can detect when a customer is approaching and verify the customer and their order. 
 
 
 Secure messaging
 
 A customer can ask business or restaurant for today’s business hours, and where exactly it is, the special offers (if any), and the method of payments they accept. 
 The restaurant can alert a customer that their order is ready, the customer doesn’t need to stay within earshot or sight, and the business saves the cost of a specialized solution. This also prevents the need to share private data, such as a phone number, to receive the notification. 
 
 
 Enhanced data handling
 
 The business can save customer order history on the customer’s device with the customer’s permission, allowing the customer to share their preferences on a subsequent visit if they want to order their “usual.” 
 Data is saved on the customer side, so there is no need for the business to store customer data and manage data privacy compliance. 
 
 
 Balanced power
 
 Customers have full control over the connection with the business; they don’t need to unsubscribe or ask to be taken off a list. 
 Businesses benefit via simple customer relationships that are both powerful and regulation compliant. 
 
 
 
<p>The customer can interact with the business knowing that their personal data is not being stored or their behavior tracked, and they have consent over how they engage with the business. Loyalty programs built with this technology contain significant advantages over traditional solutions.</p>
<p>Payroll and Timekeeping</p>
<p>Tracking hours and payroll&nbsp; is a huge part of running any business. Verifiable credentials provide a secure way for everyone to clock in and out&nbsp; and automated payroll. By using an employee credential, no one else will be able to clock in for another employee if they are running late, or be able to see when anyone else clocked in unless they have access to that data, providing the business with a more accurate look at employee hours.</p>
<p>Easier than you think</p>
<p>Finally, if you take nothing else away from this article, we hope that you understand that none of this has to be complicated or particularly expensive. Whether you see your business as big or small, verifiable credentials offer a way to streamline several different aspects of your operations and make your life easier.

<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Good morning, Robert. How are you?</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
I’m good Huzefa. How are you this morning?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Wonderful. I’m so excited about next week.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So am I.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
We are going to be at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, which starts on May 9th and goes through May 12th. We will be at Booth 40, so we will have a presence there. Anybody can stop by, come and say hello, or if you just want to learn about 1Kosmos, stop by our booth. In addition to this, we are also hosting two sessions, one of the sessions is titled Utilizing Verifiable Credentials in the Workforce for Vendors and Contractors. This session is hosted by Mike Engle, our co-founder, our Chief Strategy Officer as well. This will be a very, very exciting session, primarily because how verifiable credentials can play in the workforce and his thoughts around it, along with live implementation that we’ve done. And the second session that we are providing is around Trends in Passwordless Authentication in Customer Identity and Access Management. Passwordless authentication has grown rapidly. The need for Passwordless is there in the market, but it’s primarily targeted on the workforce today. So we talk about how the customer identity and access management market is changing the passwordless access, and that would be another talk track, and I’m hosting that one.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So I know that I’m excited about a bunch of things. What are you excited about going to be there?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
EIC or the European Identity Conference, in my opinion, is a premier identity conference, which is out there. It brings together the whole notion of how digital identity plays on the cloud with security as well. Very, very excited to see new emerging trends, which are going to be in the market for identity and digital identity in particular, as well as very excited to see our customers, partners and a few prospects as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. I’m same boat. I always like going over and just listening to what’s going on in the market, how Kuppinger sees the world, just in general, where they see the market going. Plus, it’s always good to see new friends, old friends, just kind of catch up. We know that this industry is pretty small, so it’s always fun to catch up with people and then obviously talking to customers and potential prospects is also a lot of fun. So I’m looking very forward to it. Plus I’ve never been to Berlin, so I’m looking forward to that too.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
There you go. And I’ll have a great company in Berlin with you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
That’s right, that’s right, that’s right. It is just going to be you and I. And you mentioned the booth earlier. We’re going to be at Booth 40 just for people that are coming by. When you do come by, we’ve got a great demo that we’d love to show you. It really illustrates what makes 1Kosmos different and as a thank you, we’re going to enter you into a draw for a brand new Apple Watch plus we’ve got some pretty cool 1Kosmos socks, so if you need some socks, swing by, we’d love to get you a new pair of socks. And then one of the activities at the EIC, which is short for the European Identity and Cloud conference is the passport. So if you are an attendee and you’ve got your passport, don’t forget to swing by. We’ll stamp that for you as well.</p>
<p>And aside from that on our website Huzefa, I’m pretty sure you’re aware, but for those of you that haven’t seen it, there’s a opportunity there to book a meeting with us ahead of time. So as we know, we get to conferences, calendars fill up. It gets a little bit crazy sometimes so if you want to plan your days a little bit more in advance, you’re more than welcome to go to our website, click on the EIC link, and there’s an option there where you can enter in your information and book a time to meet with either Huzefa or myself or both of us while you’re at the event. So it’s a great way to kind of plan for things ahead of time, or you can do it while you’re at the event as well. So looking forward to seeing everybody there.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Absolutely. Looking forward to seeing you next week. Looking forward to seeing our customers, and all the analysts as well.</p>

<p>Innovations in finance and payments are unlocking new experiences for consumers and&nbsp;fintechs&nbsp;alike.&nbsp;As of 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/banking-trends-and-statistics/">78 percent</a>&nbsp;of adults in the&nbsp;U.S. prefer to bank via a mobile app or website.&nbsp;As more people open accounts and manage their finances online, digital transaction volumes are projected to reach&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-payments/worldwide">$15 trillion</a>&nbsp;by 2027.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS brought the banking industry into the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165274305/the-fed-raises-interest-rates-again-despite-the-stress-hitting-the-banking-syste">global spotlight</a>. The banking sector has been in a state of uncertainty after California regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank in the largest U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banks-face-scrutiny-fed-rate-decision-looms-2023-03-22/">bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis</a>.&nbsp;The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-03-17/tabbush-report-founder-reacts-to-recent-bank-turmoil-video">has delivered</a> a small rate hike amid global banking tension.</p>
<p>There are many factors that could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, when interest rates started sharply rising last year, and depositors demanded their deposits, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail">the bank was forced to sell</a> U.S. Treasury bonds at a loss. Amid this environment, it is more important than ever for banks to project an image of calm, stability, and transparency to their customers.</p>
<p>Since the invention of instant payment card issuance in the mid-2000s, it has quickly become a top priority for banks and credit unions as it provides convenience and a better experience for customers and members. We saw it become a top priority first through a dramatic increase in the use of instant issuance for getting chipped cards quickly into the hands of cardholders during the transition to EMV, and then through persistent availability of instantly issued cards through the COVID-19 pandemic via drive-up, drive-thru, and self-service terminals.</p>
<p>However, recent macroeconomic impacts in the retail banking sector have heightened consumers’ awareness of who they use as their primary banking institution, making it even more critical for financial institutions to differentiate themselves and prove their commitment to their clients and the broader community.</p>
<p>Instant card issuance allows cardholders to receive their debit or credit card from a local branch or interactive teller machine in minutes – the moment they open their account or are in need of a new card. These instantly issued cards are activated, personalized, and permanent. This quick and easy process can enhance the customer experience and improve customer loyalty, affinity, and likelihood to become a brand ambassador. By offering instant card issuance, banks and credit unions can demonstrate their commitment to their clients by providing a convenient and efficient service that meets their needs. This can help build trust and confidence in the institution, which is particularly important as consumers have more options for banking than ever before.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating commitment to cardholders, instant card issuance can also help banks compete with fintech startups and other financial institutions. These players are known for their agility and ability to quickly respond to customer needs, which has driven traditional banking models to leverage a unique differentiator: their physical footprint in the community. Instant card issuance allows financial institutions to offer a similar level of speed and convenience but through an in-person relationship-building event.</p>
<p>As we move through 2023, instant card issuance will become more important than ever before as banks and credit unions are looking to demonstrate their commitment to their community, differentiate themselves in a competitive market, and enhance the customer and member experience.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) recently published a working paper on May 8th, 2023, diving into the complex world of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on the economy. The paper, titled “CBDC and business cycle dynamics in a New Monetarist New Keynesian model,” provides a deep-dive into the intricacies of an economy intertwined with CBDCs.</p>



<p>To embark on this exploration, the authors of the study ingeniously integrate a New Monetarist-type decentralized market into a New Keynesian model with financial frictions. This hybrid model, featuring a centralised market (CM) and a decentralised market (DM), helps to simulate the potential impact of an interest-bearing CBDC on the economic landscape.</p>



<p>The centralised market (CM) in the model encapsulates the New Keynesian dynamics, introducing familiar frictions such as monopolistic competition among retail goods producers and Calvo-type sticky prices, which allow for real effects of monetary policy. In addition, the model includes investment adjustment costs for intermediate goods-producing firms and a unique incentive constraint for bankers, leading to frictions in the bank intermediation process.</p>



<p>In contrast, the decentralised market (DM) is a monetary search model, providing a platform for CBDCs and bank deposits to function as a medium of exchange. Here, households receive a preference shock at the beginning of the DM, determining their roles as sellers or buyers, creating a double-coincidence-of-wants problem.</p>



<p>The study shows that the introduction of an interest-bearing CBDC can help stabilize the liquidity premium. This can influence bank funding conditions and the opportunity costs of money, potentially smoothing the reaction of investment and consumption to macroeconomic shocks.</p>



<p>An increase in CBDC supply, which leads to a decrease in the liquidity premium, can boost consumption, output, and inflation. The study underlines the pivotal role of the central bank’s adjustments to the CBDC supply in response to changes in the liquidity premium in shaping the dynamic impact of the CBDC on the economy.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that the existence of a CBDC does not significantly alter the model’s responses to typical macroeconomic shocks. Instead, it tends to dampen and smooth their transmission to core variables such as output and inflation.</p>



<p>By integrating the New Monetarist decentralised transactions with the New Keynesian business cycle dynamics, this research provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate the properties and impacts of CBDCs.</p>



<p>The implications of this study are profound, casting light on how CBDCs could affect monetary policy, financial stability, and the broader role of digital currencies in our economic systems. As central banks worldwide continue to explore the potential of CBDCs, this research presents a crucial step towards understanding the multifaceted effects of these digital currencies.</p>

<p>Our recent 0.6.10 Orbit Enterprise release includes a Trust Decision Helper module which allows for an additional trust task called “ask a trust registry” to be used alongside others. Not only do we facilitate the lookup of trust registries when a party is looking to make a trust decision, but we’ve also implemented options that leverage the DNS zone of a party you may be interacting with.</p>
<p>Here is some additional details from the release notes that capture the module being applied towards a holder receiving a credential offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in better understanding why we’re leveraging DNS in this flow, we recently wrote a <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">blog post</a> which covers the use case in much more detail.</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we show how an organization being offered a credential can use the issuer’s DNS information, which has been put into their DID document, to validate that the owner of the DID also has ownership of a specific domain name. Additionally, they can use pointers in the domain name system to discover trust registries that could facilitate trust decisions to be made.</p>
  
			
		
<p>We hope you find this demonstration useful and thought-provoking. Please get in touch with us if you’re looking to do any work in the intersection of credential exchange and trust registries. As we continue to work on more trust registry enhancements and features, we would love to collaborate with different community members.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and&nbsp;thank you for joining us. As the years have been passing, I&nbsp;have noticed&nbsp;actually that, digital signatures are becoming more and more common. At a time when we need to sign some agreements, electronically or Internet services. So, let’s take some time today and&nbsp;hear what is going on, what the trends are, in the European Union, but particularly, in&nbsp;Sweden, where today’s guest is coming from.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Magnus Kardell.&nbsp;He is the product owner of SignPort, a product developed by Knowit, enabling high&nbsp;security, e-identification and e-signatures. He is a specialist in identification and signing&nbsp;services, with a focus on IAM and SSO Federations. Magnus started his career in this field in 2013&nbsp;and has since then gained extensive experience in the public sector, catering to clients&nbsp;with high security standards and needs. With a strong background in the industry, Magnus&nbsp;is dedicated to delivering innovative and secure solutions to his clients through SignPort.</p>
<p>Hello, Magnus.</p>
<p>Magnus Kardell: Yes, hello. Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you. We are going to talk about signatures. But&nbsp;let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. First of all, we want to hear about our&nbsp;guest, so we want to hear about you. Tell us a bit about your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Magnus: Thank you. Yeah, Magnus Kardell is my name, and I work at Knowit Secure&nbsp;Solutions, as Oscar mentioned, and I’m product owner for SignPort, which is an&nbsp;identification and signing service. I started roughly 10 years ago with IT security and at the&nbsp;time we were having, and working with, identity and access management. Providing single sign on&nbsp;and federations between different organisations, and soon after that, we were adding&nbsp;also signature services.</p>
<p>In Sweden, there is a technical framework provided by the&nbsp;Swedish agency, DIGG, the agency for digital government. We have always complied to that&nbsp;standard, and that’s where we built our services. It’s mainly targeting public sector, but it’s&nbsp;also good for private sector. And I think in 2016, we made the first signatures, doing it this way&nbsp;and according to this standard. So, we were first with that one. And I’ve been a project manager&nbsp;for establishing about 40 customers in Sweden, in different configurations, and they&nbsp;are mainly government agencies and large municipalities.</p>
<p>So that’s basically my&nbsp;journey and where I got my experience in this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds great. So magnus, what would you&nbsp;say are the main challenges that organisations, we talk about public and private,&nbsp;these organisations’ face, when they ask you for a digital signature solution?</p>
<p>Magnus: When it comes to public sector, you have to consider many things, maybe more than&nbsp;for a private company. For example, to start with, you need to be able to connect to different eID&nbsp;issuers. So, you can’t only have one.</p>
<p>In Sweden, BankID is the most common, but you need to be able&nbsp;to connect to different, both for identification and also signing. And also, there is a request for&nbsp;dividing into what we call private eID issuers where we use your personal number, which is more&nbsp;private. But that can also be as an employee at an organisation. So, you have that kind of&nbsp;– maybe you don’t want to mix your private entity and your employee entity, so you have&nbsp;to consider that. And also, international, so you can also identify yourself and sign with&nbsp;an eID issuer that is from another country. So that’s one of the things.</p>
<p>The most common eID&nbsp;issuer is BankID, of course, but there is also Freja e-ID, Freja org ID, which is for employees&nbsp;more, and foreign e-ID, that is international. So those are examples, but there are more. So, you&nbsp;need to cope with that, and you need to be able to connect to those.</p>
<p>They are also high security&nbsp;when it comes to signatures. It’s level three, which basically means that you need a hardware&nbsp;secure module, where you do the actual signing. So that’s also a bit higher in security than&nbsp;the general need.</p>
<p>A signed document must be self-supporting over time. So, you can’t&nbsp;rely on our service later on, it has to be self-supporting. And the supplier of the signature&nbsp;service must be replaceable. That’s not good for us, but it’s good that we are, because well, all&nbsp;companies, they are not forever. So, it’s, we should be able to replace as a supplier. So&nbsp;that would be in our system cemeteries that our customers that they, that the document itself&nbsp;is self-sustaining. And you have different things, in some cases, the documents to be signed are&nbsp;really sensitive, or the content is delicate, so you need to be able to sign the document&nbsp;without the document itself leaving the customer’s IT environment. But some requirements&nbsp;also on the signature service.</p>
<p>There are also, in some cases, you need a pure e-service, like&nbsp;signing portal. But in some other cases, the customer probably has their own platform&nbsp;that we would like to connect to our, how to say – signing engine. So, we have to provide APIs for&nbsp;our customers’ e-services– sometimes you have a simple signing portal, and in other cases,&nbsp;you let the customers e-platforms connect to our signing service. So, these are things that&nbsp;they need.</p>
<p>And then, of course, going into public sector, there can be really high volumes, when&nbsp;citizens in the country are using the service. It’s demand for high availability, and there is&nbsp;also a demand for high level automation. That means that the signatures need to be – you need to&nbsp;be able to validate the document electronically to the person who has signed it. If you look into&nbsp;the electronic signature of the PDF and read, signed by the supplier of the service, that is&nbsp;a no go, because then you can’t electronically extract what person who has actually signed&nbsp;the document.</p>
<p>So, this also put some specific requirements, and this is about the journey to&nbsp;digitalisation, and we’re not there yet. We may be in the beginning, of course, so far, when we&nbsp;sign a document on, electronically, like a PDF, that’s good. But often, it’s human reading&nbsp;it, at the end, at the other end anyway. So, we have replaced the paper, which is good.&nbsp;It’s much smoother. That’s very good. But still, it isn’t, the flow isn’t really digitalised.&nbsp;And if looking at these challenges that our customers have, they need to be able to do&nbsp;this high level of automation, at least have it further on.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are&nbsp;requests for sustainable operations. For example, excess heat in the operation centre should be fed&nbsp;back into the district heating network. So, this kind of, you don’t really think of them, but if&nbsp;looking at society, you need to think about those things to be sustainable. Those requirements I&nbsp;mentioned now, or the challenges there were, these organisations have. Of course, they’re mainly for&nbsp;government authorities or municipalities, but, I mean, it could apply also for private companies.&nbsp;It’s not bad, it’s really good things. So that’s about the challenges.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see quite many, different types. As you mentioned, some are purely&nbsp;security, some more like usability, what the user is going to face. What else? And the last one,&nbsp;you mentioned actually, the sustainability side. So yeah, different – and some are, yeah,&nbsp;legal. So yeah, different for different fronts, there are these type of requirements for signature&nbsp;services. And when it’s great that our solutions that, yeah, fix all these together and give a&nbsp;great product to, for us, for the users.</p>
<p>So, I would like to hear now, how are you solving&nbsp;some of these challenges? What are the main use cases? Just, if you can illustrate some&nbsp;of those use cases, hot use cases, let’s say?</p>
<p>Magnus: Signature service that we provide,&nbsp;SignPort is following the, I mentioned before, DIGG, the agency for digital government in&nbsp;Sweden they put up a framework for how to solve these issues. But there is also architecture or&nbsp;reference architecture for how to cope with these challenges. So, we follow that. And if looking&nbsp;at our service, it’s split up in four different components, mainly, four different components, and&nbsp;it’s a Signing Portal, Support Service, a Digital Signing Service, and Identification Service.&nbsp;So, these are the four different components.</p>
<p>And the Signing Portal is like a web page that is&nbsp;an e-service, a service provider. The only thing you can do is to just create a signing assignment.&nbsp;Just to, for example, take a PDF document, drag and drop, and then you apply the email address to the&nbsp;signers, and you send it away, and create the sign message, so that’s how it works. It’s a&nbsp;very simple, but useful tool for just keeping the, having a web interface to the users.</p>
<p>Then we have a Support Service. And the support service is basically calculating the hash of the&nbsp;document to be signed, and then the hash is sent further on to the digital signing service.</p>
<p>Digital Signing Service is a bit more – has the highest security, it contains these hardware&nbsp;secure modules, etc. That are creating those signings with the highest security.</p>
<p>And then&nbsp;we have the Identification Service, which is actually different identity providers connecting&nbsp;to each e-ID issuer. And we’re splitting this up, you can facilitate several things, because&nbsp;the signing portal and the support service is – those are the only components that are hit by&nbsp;the document to be signed, and they are done in a way that they can be installed in our customers’ operations.&nbsp;So, by doing it that way, the document to&nbsp;be signed is never leaving our customers’ IT departments. So, they stay at our customer.&nbsp;That is one thing. And by splitting up, so you have an API towards the support service, you also&nbsp;facilitate the possibility that the customer has other e-services that also would like to use an&nbsp;API for signing documents.</p>
<p>Those two parts, the signing portal and support service are rather&nbsp;easy components, that doesn’t contain any hardware or anything like that. So, it’s easy for the&nbsp;customers to install and operate themselves. Some other customers might – doesn’t have&nbsp;that requirement. They want the software as a service solution, and we can provide that&nbsp;as well. So, that’s possible to do it that way.</p>
<p>The Digital Signing Service, containing the&nbsp;hardware secure modules, and everything around that, that we always operate ourselves,&nbsp;but that part is never hit by the documents to be signed. And then we have the&nbsp;Identification Service, which is basically SAML 2.0 IDP connecting to, to different. It can be&nbsp;used as a pure identification service only for logging into it, and e-service, for example,&nbsp;but not in this case, also for signing. So that’s how our service is split up with those&nbsp;four different components, and how we can meet all these requirements that we have from the&nbsp;customer. But it is possible to do it this way.</p>
<p>And for the signing portal, we – it is a rather simple web page, and it has a basic structure, but we can customise it for our customers. So, if a municipality use that, we can customise it for that municipality; so it states the name and everything. So, the user feels that they are in the same. But when connecting to the support service then the – our customers can fully integrate and have everything that is shown to the users and the e-service that the agency provide. So that’s a little bit how it works and how it’s set up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Actually, one topic, I think you mentioned a little bit, maybe to&nbsp;understand even better is the self-supporting signed document. Right? So, you said – tell&nbsp;us a bit more about that, how it works.</p>
<p>Magnus: If taking a PDF, for example, the&nbsp;standard we use are PDF advanced electronic signatures. When I say that agency for digital&nbsp;government, the technical framework is based on eIDAS. So, it’s international standards that&nbsp;is based on. And when I say self-sustaining, then I mean that it should be able to validate the&nbsp;document to the person who has signed it, using only the document.</p>
<p>It isn’t really through, but&nbsp;you don’t need SignPort in order to validate it. You just need the public key from our signing&nbsp;service. And that’s the only thing you need, then you can validate the signature to the&nbsp;person who has signed the document. And the public key is – it can be downloaded, it can&nbsp;be stored, so that you have it. But it’s public service, so it’s, once it’s out, it is possible&nbsp;to achieve later on. But if you have that, you can validate the document to the person.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;then you can do, for example, if a government, an agency received a signed document, you&nbsp;can validate it and extract the person, electronically, that has signed a document&nbsp;provided that you rely on our public key. But then you also include the verification list in&nbsp;the document, so you can see that when it was signed, the identity wasn’t revoked. So, it’s sustainable also over time, together with a signed timestamp as well. So, basically, that makes it, self-supporting.</p>
<p>There might be other ways to&nbsp;do this onwards, the standards aren’t really set&nbsp;yet. But this is how we do it, in order to achieve this. Possibilities there are very replaceable,&nbsp;but it’s a good thing, I guess, if looking at.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. You have mentioned also that, a big part of your requirements come from the public service, and you’re following what needs to&nbsp;be comply in Sweden. So, let’s focus on that. So, what are signature service must comply in Sweden?</p>
<p>Magnus: It is for the public sector. In Sweden, the agency for digital government, they have&nbsp;set up a technical framework and a normative specification, and this setup addresses all&nbsp;the requirements that I listed above. So, it’s not a requirement on the public sector in&nbsp;Sweden, but it is the recommendation. And if following it, it will be much easier when,&nbsp;for example, different agencies collaborate and send documents between each other, if the signed&nbsp;documents follow the standard, the same standard. And there is also a requirement to&nbsp;connect to foreign eID, eIDAS.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you – it isn’t that many&nbsp;countries that is connected foreign eID yet. But, for example, if someone from Germany would like&nbsp;to use e-services in Sweden, it’s possible. Also, Denmark and several other countries, and there&nbsp;are more upcoming. So, there is a possibility to use also within Europe, both for identification&nbsp;and signing.</p>
<p>For the private sector, it isn’t – of course, there are requirements that the service&nbsp;has to be easy to use. I think that’s the main thing. But otherwise, there aren’t that,&nbsp;must have requirements as I believe on, when it comes to security or sustainability, and so on that. Maybe companies would like such things, but it isn’t a real requirement. So, you can use more or less whatever signing service you like. And there are many, and that’s OK. So, what we’ve seen in private sector is mainly, we have some customers, but they are mainly connected to either health care or law, when you’re more close to the public sector. So that’s what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Definitely a good overview&nbsp;how signatures have being applied in Sweden. I would like to ask a final question. So, for all&nbsp;business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that&nbsp;they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah. I think if you do not yet&nbsp;have a digital signature service, get one. It’s so much more efficient and sustainable than&nbsp;paper. So, if you don’t have one, get one. And when getting one, think about the future, how is&nbsp;the validity of the signed document proven over time? What happens in collaboration with other&nbsp;parties?

<p>Oscar: All right, excellent. Excellent, Magnus,&nbsp;for this final recommendation. So please, yeah, let us know if someone would like to follow the&nbsp;conversation with you, or follow the work you’re doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Magnus: If you want to reach me, I think it’s easiest on an email address, which&nbsp;is magnus.kardell@knowit.sc, M-A-G-N-U-S dot K-A-R-D-E-L-L @knowit.sc. So, you can reach me&nbsp;there. And I believe we’ll set up a home page for SignPort, there is one, but I think we will update it soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Again, thank you, Magnus, for this conversation, and all the best.</p>

  <p>Decentralized Identity protection is important in data collaboration because it helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations involved in the supply chain. By ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information, identity protection helps to prevent data breaches and other security incidents. &nbsp;A chain of trust establishes a series of checks and verifications that ensure that the data being shared is accurate and trustworthy. This is critical in the context of supply chain regulations, where inaccurate or incomplete information can have serious consequences for compliance and risk management.</p>
<p>In the second part of the talk, we will explore the concept of adaptive protection for identities in Microsoft Purview. By using a combination of machine learning, behavioral analysis, and risk-based decision making, we can create a dynamic system that adapts to new threats in real time. This approach offers a more proactive and effective way to safeguard identities, and can be applied across a range of industries and contexts. Together, we can work to develop a more robust and resilient digital identity ecosystem that protects individuals and organizations alike.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/adaptive-protection-for-identities-eic2023"></a>

  <p>What started as a simple blog post from Google has rapidly ballooned into an industry movement. Major vendors have implemented the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol / Profile (CAEP) and analysts, practitioners and decision makers agree that it is critical to the future of zero-trust. This keynote, by the inventor of CAEP, goes into the pain points that led to the development of CAEP, the process to recast it as a part of the Shared Signals working group in the OpenID Foundation and the trends that make it an indispensable component of any zero-trust architecture. CAEP’s non-prescriptive nature makes it easy for anyone to implement their own policies and the Shared Signals Framework makes communicating changes efficient and nearly instantaneous. A future powered by Shared Signals and CAEP enables enterprises and vendors to break information silos to create a highly secure outcome.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/caep-and-shared-signals-eic2023"></a>

  <p>OpenID Connect Federation enables trust establishment at scale and is being deployed to do so in Europe.</p>
<p>A key question when granting access to resources is “Who do you trust?”.&nbsp; It’s often important to know who the party is that you’re interacting with and whether they’ve agreed to the terms and conditions that apply when accessing a resource.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect enables identities of participants to be securely established but doesn’t answer the question of whether a participant is trusted to access a resource such as your personal data.&nbsp; A complementary mechanism is needed to do that.&nbsp; In small-scale and static deployments, it’s possible to keep a list of the trusted participants.&nbsp; However, in large-scale and dynamic deployments, that doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe how the OpenID Connect Federation protocol enables scalable trust establishment with dynamic policies.&nbsp; It does so by employing trust hierarchies of authorities, each of which are independently administered.&nbsp; Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations, departments within organizations, and individual sites.</p>
<p>Two OpenID Connect Federations are deployed in Italy, enabling secure access to digital services operated by Italian public and private services with Italian digital identities.&nbsp; This presentation will also describe why OpenID Connect Federation was selected for them and how it meets their needs.&nbsp; OpenID Connect Federation is being used by the GAIN PoC.&nbsp; A public deployment is also being planned in Sweden.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/who-to-trust-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Authorization in modern applications is becoming increasingly complex, particularly when it comes to managing access to resources at the individual user and group levels. OAuth has become a widely-used standard for granting access to resources on behalf of a user, but it is not well-suited for these more nuanced use cases. In this talk, we will explore the confusion surrounding the use of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization in applications. We will discuss the standard meaning of authorization in OAuth, which is to grant access for an application to call APIs on behalf of the user, and how misusing OAuth for this purpose can lead to bad architecture and bloated JWT tokens. We will also introduce alternative standards like UMA (User-Managed Access) and GNAP (Group-Based Nested Access Protocol) as potential solutions for user and group-controlled resource delegation. These standards provide a more fine-grained and dynamic approach to access control and can be integrated with policies created by a PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control) server for a more comprehensive solution. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the limitations of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization, and with a clear understanding of the potential of UMA and GNAP as solutions for these use cases.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-modern-applications-eic2023"></a>
