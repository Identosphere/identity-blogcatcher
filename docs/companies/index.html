<p><a href="https://en.facephi.com/">FacePhi</a> is targeting the air travel sector through a new partnership with Spain’s top airport operator. <a href="https://www.aena.es/en/passengers/passengers.html">AENA</a> currently manages dozens of airports in Spain and beyond, and will be using FacePhi’s face-based <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/argentinian-lender-turns-facephi-remote-onboarding-100602/">onboarding and authentication technology</a> to enroll passengers and employees in a number of different identification programs.</p>



  



<p>The contract will run for a period of four years, and is worth roughly €1.5 million. FacePhi also stressed that its technology will be used strictly on an opt-in basis, and will not be used in any surveillance applications. Those restrictions are in keeping with the company’s broader commitment to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-javier-mira-ceo-facephi-ethical-biometrics/">ethical use of facial recognition</a>.</p>



<p>So what will AENA be doing with FacePhi’s technology? On the public-facing front, FacePhi will help AENA register people in different passenger screening systems. Once registered, people will be able to pass through airport checkpoints with only a facial recognition scan, and will enjoy a more streamlined passenger journey that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/frost-sullivan-reports-growing-demand-contactless-airport-management-solutions-022303/">minimizes physical contact</a> between passengers and airport staff. People would be able to use such systems to check-in and to pass through security, and to enter VIP lounges and board their planes once inside the airport.</p>



<p>AENA will also use FacePhi internally to verify the identities of employees. The technology can help with access control, and will make operations more efficient while eliminating the need for physical identification cards.</p>



<p>In both scenarios, facial recognition matches will only be conducted at discrete times and locations, and only with the informed consent of the person being scanned. Opting into the program does not grant consent for surveillance operations.</p>



<p>“This contract showcases how our roadmap is helping us reach our set goals regarding growth and expansion to new sectors and markets,” said FacePhi President and CEO Javier Mira. “This project is also a clear example of the values that FacePhi has always defended, because it is about using biometrics to make people’s lives easier, while making an ethical use of it.”</p>



<p>FacePhi is based in Spain, and was recently <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/spain-lists-facephi-strategic-company-country-111605/">listed as a strategic company</a> by the Spanish government. The company is best known for providing remote <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/banco-santander-chooses-facephi-benchmark-supplier-081607/">onboarding solutions for the financial sector</a>. AENA, meanwhile, has already <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/thales-inetum-bring-more-biometric-screening-tech-spanish-airports-032504/">installed biometric gates</a> at airports in Valencia, Bilbao, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/thales-expands-biometric-screening-program-madrid-airport-022203/">Madrid</a>, and previously updated its biometric infrastructure through a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-atos-upgrade-aena-airports-biometric-tech-100804/">partnership with Atos</a> back in 2019.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuance.com/">Nuance Communications</a> continues to see growth in its healthcare and enterprise security business lines. The company has issued an update for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 – the fourth quarter of its fiscal calendar.</p>



<p>The company is reporting revenues of $333.1 million for the quarter, up from $307.7 million from the same period last year. According to CEO Mark Benjamin, that success is largely attributable to ARR growth on the part of Nuance’s cloud solutions, especially its Dragon Medical and DAX AI platforms for healthcare operations. Overall revenues from the healthcare sector were up 12 percent year-over-year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company’s Security &amp; Biometrics and Digital Engagement solutions have seen full year growth of one percent compared to 2020, with Benjamin noting that the increase “marks the sixth consecutive year of organic growth for the Enterprise division.” While Nuance has focused most strongly on the healthcare sector in recent years, its other offerings include <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/korean-bank-uses-nuance-gatekeeper-biometrics-protect-phone-video-calls-121603/">voice recognition technology</a> that can improve customer service while guarding against fraud.</p>



<p>As for Nuance’s net result for Q4, the company is reporting a GAAP net loss of $10.8 million, an improvement over its GAAP net loss of $32.4 million in the same period last year. Nuance also reports a non-GAAP net income of $28.8 million for the latest quarter, though this is down from its non-GAAP net income of $42.1 million a year ago.</p>



<p>In announcing the results, Nuance noted that it had completed the sale of its medical transcription and electronic healthcare record implementation businesses in March of this year, and explained that “the businesses’ results of operations have been included within discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements.”</p>



<p>The company also noted its upcoming merger with Microsoft. The latter had entered into an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsoft-to-acquire-nuance-in-16b-deal-704122/">agreement to buy Nuance</a> in a multibillion-dollar deal earlier this year, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asserting at the time that “Nuance provides the AI layer at the healthcare point of delivery and is a pioneer in the real-world application of enterprise AI.”</p>



<p>The pending transactions means that this will be one of Nuance’s last quarterly updates as its own company. Nuance expects the deal to close by the end of the first quarter of 2022, or early in the second quarter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idemia.com/">IDEMIA</a> has announced two important promotions on its executive team. Julia Schoonenberg is the company’s new Executive Vice President of Financial Institutions, and Matt Cole has been named EVP of the company’s Public Security and Identity unit.</p>



<p>For her part, Schoonenberg came to the company by way of Oberthur Technologies, where she got her start as Telecoms Business Manager in 2002 and rose through the ranks to the position of RCIS Business Director when <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ot-morpho-idemia-409281/">Oberthur merged with Safran Identity &amp; Security</a> in 2016 to form the multinational conglomerate that is now IDEMIA. She served as SVP of Financial Institutions in the Middle East and Africa before this latest promotion.</p>



<p>“We’ve got a number of payment solution challenges facing us in the next few years involving ever more security, user convenience and efficiency,” Schoonenberg commented in a statement. “I’m looking forward immensely to taking up these challenges alongside all my IDEMIA colleagues!”</p>



<p>Matt Cole, meanwhile, has been with the company since the start of 2020, when he joined was named as the head of IDEMIA’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-set-division-502204/">Secure Enterprise Transactions</a> business unit. Before coming to IDEMIA, Cole spent the bulk of his career at Cubic Transportation Systems, where he started as a Project Accountant in 2003 and eventually became President of the firm’s transportation business unit.</p>



<p>“We have ambitious growth targets as a team backed by our long track record of delivering worldwide market-leading security and identity solutions to French or international governments,” Cole said, adding that he looks forward to working with IDEMIA CEO Pierre Barrial and the rest of the executive team to deliver on those goals.</p>



<p>For his part, Barrial – who was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-announces-new-ceo-908307/">promoted to the role of CEO</a> in the middle of last year – praised Schoonenberg for having “been key in driving our business in the Middle East and Africa region,” and said he was “delighted” about Cole’s promotion, adding, “I have worked closely with him for the past two years and appreciated his strategic vision and leadership talent.”</p>



<p>News of the promotions comes after the appointment of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-north-america-targets-transportation-government-sectors-with-two-new-execs-110203/">two new VPs and a Chief Technology Officer</a> at IDEMIA’s North American division this autumn.</p>

<p>A strategic review launched by <a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a>‘ (FPC) board of directors this past summer has reached a conclusion: the company will divide its operations into two main subsidiaries.</p>



<p>One of them, to be called “Fingerprint Technology Company”, will remain focused on mobile biometrics, the area in which FPC made its name over the past decade as a supplier of fingerprint sensors during the mobile revolution. The subsidiary will be based in Shanghai, and overseen by Ted Hansson, who will act as its President.</p>



<p>The other subsidiary, based in Zug, Switzerland, will comprise what was formerly called Fingerprint Cards’ “Payments &amp; Access” business line. Dubbed “Fingerprint Cards Switzerland”, the subsidiary will be headed by President Michel Roig.</p>



<p>While the latter business line has been exploring new opportunities in both the payments and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-extends-reach-in-access-control-market-with-ekey-integration-709211/">access control</a> sectors in recent years, in a statement announcing the changes, Michel Roig emphasized “the massive growth opportunity in payments,” adding that basing the subsidiary in Switzerland “has significant benefits as our customers and partners express a strong preference to work with European based technology providers and partners.” </p>



<p>Fingerprint Cards has been particularly focused on opportunities in the emerging concept of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/top-three-manufacturer-fpc-module-biometric-payment-cards-710262/">biometric payment cards</a> featuring embedded fingerprint sensors.</p>



<p>The company’s strategic review was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-bod-launches-strategic-review-707072/">first announced in July</a> by Board Chairman and former CEO Johan Carlström, who explained at the time that the review would consider “strategic alternatives” aimed at maximizing the company’s potential. The menu of options included acquisitions, spin-offs, and new listings, he said, adding that “[t]here has been considerable interest for Fingerprints from a number of different players, which has triggered the review process.”</p>



<p>Now, in the company’s announcement of its conclusion, Carlström emphasized the logical soundness of its subdivision. “The Mobile and Payments industry ecosystems differ in many respects including structure, regulatory environments, and geography,” he explained. “The world’s top three payment card producers are all based in continental Europe, while most of the largest smartphone OEMs are headquartered in Asia.”</p>



<p>Fingerprint Cards CEO Christian Fredriksson added that the separation of the two businesses “enables clearer and more efficient day-to-day operations while both subsidiaries continue to benefit from access to the same unique IP as owned by the Group.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/">Innovatrics</a> Is allowing law enforcement agencies to identify suspects using soft biometric characteristics like scars, marks, and tattoos (SMT). To that end, the company has updated its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-offers-forensics-fraud-prevention-release-abis-7/">Automated Biometric Identification System</a> (ABIS) to give investigators the ability to upload photos of SMTs to an ABIS database, and to search that database for potential matches.</p>



  



<p>According to Innovatrics, the enhanced ABIS will help law enforcement identify suspects in the absence of high quality face or fingerprint images. In that regard, the company noted that soft biometric features like scars and tattoos are better identifiers than broad demographic traits like race, gender, and age, largely because scars and tattoos are more unique to an individual.</p>



<p>In practice, investigators can use the Innovatrics ABIS to upload a photo of a tattoo or another marker, and then use the platform to apply the relevant labels and link it to an individual profile. From there, investigators can search through the rest of the database to find other incidences of that particular marker. Any photos should be compliant with and classified according to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/eff-raises-ethical-concerns-about-nists-tatt-c-tattoo-recognition-database-031901/">NIST’s guidelines</a> for photographic evidence. The photos themselves can be sorted based on location and the type of marker, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Hard biometrics like face and fingerprint recognition are still the first option for most investigations. However, SMTs can help generate a short list of suspects in cases in which law enforcement does not have access to those more concrete identifiers. The full Innovatrics ABIS can be used for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-unveils-multimodal-abis-enrollment-app-093003/">biometric onboarding and enrollment</a> in a number of different sectors, though the SMT feature is geared primarily toward law enforcement.</p>



<p>Innovatrics has previously argued that its SmartFace surveillance platform can help investigators <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-explains-how-smartface-can-speed-up-surveillance-investigations-042805/">identify suspects in video feeds</a>. The company has also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-adds-two-new-algorithms-passive-liveness-detection-platform-102805/">introduced two new algorithms</a> to improve its passive liveness detection capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clearme.com/">CLEAR</a> is expanding its airport footprint in South Florida. The company has announced that it is opening three expedited security lanes at Palm Beach International Airport (PBI), supplementing the lanes that are already in place at the international airports in Miami, Orlando, and Fort Lauderdale.</p>



  



<p>The CLEAR expedited screening system uses iris recognition to verify the identities of registered CLEAR Plus travelers. CLEAR Plus is a subscription service that costs $15 per month, though members can add an additional adult to their account for $60 for a full year.</p>



<p>A CLEAR agent will take passengers directly to the TSA’s physical security checkpoint once they have completed their iris recognition scan at one of CLEAR’s dedicated lanes. The system allows those passengers to bypass the traditional screening process on the way to security, and negates the need to show a driver’s license for identity verification.</p>



<p>According to CLEAR, the three PBI lanes will create more than 30 new jobs and contribute $1.9 million to the airport and the local Palm Beach County economy. The iris recognition program is now available at 39 airports across the country, a tally that includes eight of the top 10 destinations from PBI itself. As a result, those departing from and returning to Palm Beach can take advantage of the service on both legs of their trip.</p>



<p>“We’ve been committed to Florida since day one with our first airport launch, and now we are thrilled to partner with Palm Beach County to help bring this experience to local residents, travelers and visitors,” said CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker.</p>



<p>“PBI is known for an easy, convenient traveling experience and bringing CLEAR lanes with touchless technology provides our travelers additional peace of mind as they depart the Palm Beaches,” added Palm Beach County Department of Airports Director Laura Beebe.</p>



<p>CLEAR introduced biometric screening lanes at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-brings-effortless-security-screening-oakland-international-airport-041601/">Oakland International Airport</a> in April, and then <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-expands-biometric-screening-program-boston-airport-111002/">added more lanes to its Boston program</a> earlier this month. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-renews-biometric-screening-partnership-denver-airport-122105/">Denver</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clears-contactless-biometric-screening-comes-nashville-airport-081808/">Nashville</a> are some of the other airports that currently offer the CLEAR Plus screening service.</p>

				  BBS+ signature styles are not going to be ready for deployment anytime soon. This is precisely why you should build today and in a way that allows you to add them later.<br>
  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Sam Curren, Senior Architect<br><br>New technology is inevitable: some of it will be evolutionary, some of it will be revolutionary; some of it will eat your business, and some of it might change the world and make life better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you know when to wait and when to jump?</p>
<p>This is the dilemma for many people looking at decentralized identity right now. Is it ready to be implemented, are there “off-the-shelf” products I can use—or will it all be so much better next week or in a month or in a year?</p>
<p>The dilemma seems to divide the decentralized identity community. Standards groups and initiatives advocate for the best possible solution, in the hope that it will eventually exist, while companies building solutions—like Indicio—say “build now because what we have works and works well and can be added to later. The ‘better’ may never come but the good—especially if open source—will continually get better and be relatively easy to upgrade.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we believe our position is not just a matter of business logic: There’s a massive downside to letting failing technology—our current centralized and federated ways of managing identity—continue to fail businesses and consumers, citizens and governments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This downside is vastly greater than any of the differences between decentralized identity technologies that can be used today, those in development, and those hypothesized as being available sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Don’t turn BBS+ into a minus<br>This issue is not abstract. Right now, there is much discussion around JSON-LD <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+</a>&nbsp;being “the” standard for managing verifiable credential key signatures in decentralized identity systems. The Good Health Pass, for example, recommends BBS+ for Covid digital credentials.</p>
<p>BBS+ is good and Indicio is excited about adding it to its options for customers building decentralized solutions. But we can’t do so because BBS+&nbsp; is still under development and it’s unclear when the final version will be available. Meanwhile, we have JSON-ZKP-CL Signatures that provide the ingredient BBS+ is working to add: privacy preserving predicate (zero-knowledge)&nbsp; proofs and blinded identity binding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predicate proofs mean that you are able to generate a proof of something—such as age—without having to disclose the actual information, and they are a boon to preserving privacy.</p>
<p>When thinking about BBS+, it is important to remember that credential format is just one part of a larger system that must be developed. Governance, Issuance and Verification agents, Holder apps, and more all need to be implemented; user experience must be developed; business relationships created: Decentralized identity is an ecosystem of infrastructure, software and governance working together as a product. All of these things can be deployed using existing production-ready credential formats. And the gains made now will translate into the future adoption of BBS+.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bigger point is this: Decentralized identity is at a breakthrough point. Governments in Canada and Germany have decided that verifiable credentials are the way forward; pilots and consumer products are being unveiled on a weekly basis. This is not the moment to say, “let’s wait;”&nbsp; this is the moment to say “let’s scale.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we’ve shown how to make decentralized ecosystems work to solve real problems for lots of customers. In building, we’ve advanced the tech. In advancing the tech, we’ve built more solutions. This is the virtuous cycle of innovation and scale that we’re creating. We will add BBS+ into our products when it is available.

			 Are you ready to digitize yourself in the metaverse? 
<p>The metaverse has been a hot topic of late. As Facebook rebranded to Meta, a lot of attention has turned towards projects focused on this alternate reality. Decentraland’s MANA token reached a new all-time high, and companies such as Roblox saw big increases in share prices.</p>
<p>As is always the case with nascent technologies, the rise of metaverse platforms has brought some issues. Here are a few:</p>
 
 Unfiltered content&nbsp;– anyone can access any type of content, and considering a large amount of the user base are teenagers, this is concerning. 
 Accessibility problems&nbsp;– gaining access to metaverse platforms is a pain when you consider how many accounts you need for various web services. 
 Loss of virtual assets&nbsp;– anything purchased in the metaverse can simply be lost, and the tokens representing these assets can never be recovered. 
 Privacy concerns&nbsp;– users are increasingly concerned about privacy issues and protecting their data, with this not being helped by Facebook throwing their hat in the virtual ring. 
 
<p>The key to solving these issues is abundantly clear:&nbsp;<a href="https://onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xgmW5PSKnMPgtCeY35vwyzbuRJvRQSGOEv50dRNMZ0tCqXVh5v8F9kSg1LXQXUfQA0_2R">digital identities</a>. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Age restricted content&nbsp;– users log into the metaverse with identities, allowing platforms to appropriately filter certain content and environments. 
 Universal login&nbsp;– like Google authentication, onchain digital identities enable users to log in to different virtual venues in the metaverse via one click. 
 Asset recovery&nbsp;– onchain identities guarantees ownership of virtual assets because tokens can be linked to the identity and not to the wallet. 
 Privacy protected&nbsp;– service providers only need to see the proof of verified information, instead of the actual data, thus alleviating privacy concerns. 
 
<p>As the metaverse gets more and more popular, and with more virtual assets being viewed, bought and sold in this environment, identity will become a core component of this world. Users will need to know who they are dealing with, they will need easy recovery processes in the case of lost wallets. This will be key as the metaverse matures and its ties with digital assets continue to strengthen.</p>

<p>We are delighted to introduce two new additions to the KILT ecosystem: the Sporran browser extension — the wallet for KILT Coins and credentials — and Stakeboard, the staking platform for&nbsp;KILT.</p> Sporran <p>The <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> wallet can be used to hold KILT Coins and provides a way for users to sign and submit KILT blockchain transactions. And in early December, users will also be able to use Sporran to store credentials and create a digital identity — similar to how you would in the real world by adding credentials (like your driver’s license) to your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>You could also build several identities — for example, your work identity with all your qualifications, your gaming identity with your rankings, etc. Sporran provides a way to manage and sign transactions with these digital identities on the KILT blockchain. This is designed to restore your control over your own data when you are providing your information to online services.</p><p>Currently, Sporran is available for use as a browser extension on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sporran/djdnajgjcbjhhbdblkegbcgodlkkfhcl">Google Chrome</a> and<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sporran/"> Firefox</a>. See our guide to creating a Sporran identity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">here</a>.</p> Stakeboard <p><a href="https://stakeboard.kilt.io/">Stakeboard</a> is a web application that allows you to interact directly with the KILT blockchain to stake your KILT&nbsp;Coins.</p><p>To participate in staking on Stakeboard you need a KILT Identity (wallet address) with at least 1,001 KILT Coins (1,000 for staking; 1 to cover any transaction costs). Each Identity with this minimum can choose one collator to delegate their coins to. Collators hold the data of the KILT blockchain, collect transactions and build blocks. You can find the list of collators <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KILT_Initial-16-Collators_4-Oct.pdf">here</a> and on community sites like <a href="https://stakekilt.com/">StakeKILT.com</a>.</p><p>When the chosen collator successfully produces blocks, their delegator can receive a reward of up to 8% per annum in the first year after launch; 6% in the second year. See our “<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-7-key-things-you-need-to-know-to-use-Stakeboard_22-Nov.pdf">How to stake on KILT</a>” guide for more details on navigating Stakeboard.</p><p>Sporran and Stakeboard were developed by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH, a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the entity that initially developed KILT Protocol.</p><p>For any questions about these services, go to our <a href="https://support.kilt.io/support/home">Tech Support</a> site.

It was founded in January 2018 by Ingo Rübe and German publishing house Burda GmbH, for whom he served as CTO from 2012 to 2017; Swiss publisher Ringier AG later joined as a shareholder. BOTLabs is the initial developer of KILT Protocol, which is now a fully decentralized blockchain network. The Sporran wallet and SocialKYC identity verification service were developed by a subsidiary of BOTLabs called B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. BOTLabs is a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) and a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and Blockchain for&nbsp;Europe.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a fully decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s open-source Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy.

<p>Bisherige Lösungen für das Managen von Identitäten sind gekennzeichnet von Datensilos, die einerseits jeder Diensteanbieter mit hohem Aufwand selbst betreibt — oder andererseits von globalen Identitätsanbietern, die den Diensteanbietern diesen Aufwand abnehmen können. Das Problem des isolierten Identitätsmanagements ist, dass der durchschnittliche Internetnutzer über 20 verschiedene Identitäten hat, die separat angelegt und gewartet werden müssen — mit entsprechendem Aufwand und daraus resultierend Inkonsistenzen zwischen den Datensilos. Globale Identitätsmanager wie Google helfen, diese Probleme mit Hilfe des Single-Sign-On unter Nutzung einer Google-ID zu überwinden. Für den Nutzer ist dies bequem und einfach. Jedoch wird die Hoheit über persönliche Daten und deren kommerzielle Verwertung aus der Hand&nbsp;gegeben.</p><p>Vor diesem Hintergrund streben Selbstsouveräne Identitäten (SSI) die Verknüpfung der Nutzerfreundlichkeit einer Google-ID mit einem hohen Grad an Nutzerkontrolle und Privatsphäre an.</p> Was genau ist&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI bilden die neueste Entwicklungsstufe digitaler Identitäten. Eine Identität meint alle Attribute einer Person, Organisation, oder Gegenstands, die dieses Subjekt definieren. Attribute beschreiben die Charakteristika eines Subjekts. Eine digitale Identität meint hier die digitale Repräsentation dieser Attribute. Je nach Verwendungskontext können verschiedene Teilidentitäten benötigt werden, die nur einen Teil der Attribute umfassen.</p><p>Ein Credential ist ein fälschungssicherer und überprüfbarer Nachweis von Attributen eines Subjekts. Credentials werden in einem persönlichen digitalen Wallet gehalten. Das Subjekt ist der Holder der Nachweise, nachdem es diese von einem Issuer beschafft hat. Ein Issuer stellt Credentials nach einem Schema aus, das eine übergreifende Verwendung und allgemeingültige Interpretation erlaubt. Ein Verifier fordert, z.B. für den Zugriff auf einen Dienst, einen Nachweis einer Berechtigung (ein Credential) von dem zugreifenden Subjekt. Über ein Verifiable Data Registry werden dazu Identifikatoren ausgetauscht, die auf Subjekte, deren Credentials und deren Issuer verweisen können. Das Verifiable Data Registry enthält keine subjektbezogenen Daten.</p>Rollen und Informationsflüsse beim Identitätsmanagement mit SSI (Quelle: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#roles)">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#roles)</a> Welchen Mehrwert bringt&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI überwindet das inkonsistente und — für Nutzer als auch Diensteanbieter — aufwändige Identitätsmanagement in isolierten Datensilos und gleichzeitig die Abhängigkeit von bisherigen Single-Sign-On-Identitätsmanagern wie Google und Twitter, die die Anmeldevorgänge der Nutzer kontrollieren, auswerten und verwerten. Mit SSI haben Subjekte wie Personen oder Maschinen eine einzige Identitätsverwaltung (zumindest für einen gewissen Namensraum). Die einer Identität zugeordneten Berechtigungsnachweise müssen nur einmal eingeholt werden und können dann nach Bedarf passgenau für beliebig viele Anmelde- und Nachweisprozesse eingesetzt werden. Analog zur Plastikkärtchen-Identität können die Nachweise geprüft werden, ohne den Herausgeber zu involvieren.</p>Heutiges Identitätsmanagement in Silos vs. Selbstsouveränes Identitätsmanagement (Adaptiert von: <a href="https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/2019/08/12/chancen-der-self-sovereign-identities-ssi-aus-sicht-von-unternehmen-fuer-das-identity-access-management-iam/">https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/2019/08/12/chancen-der-self-sovereign-identities-ssi-aus-sicht-von-unternehmen-fuer-das-identity-access-management-iam/</a>)<p>Für Diensteanbieter vereinfachen sich Onboardingprozesse, das sogenannte Know-your-Customer und die Compliance zu den damit verbundenen Regularien. Zudem sind die bereitgestellten Identitätsinformationen aktuell. Durch die Vereinfachung der Onboardingprozesse werden diese auch mit einer höheren Wahrscheinlichkeit als bislang von den Nutzern abgeschlossen.</p><p>Nutzer von Diensten (beliebige Subjekte, auch Maschinen) können ihre Identität in Plug-and-Play-Manier einsetzen und ihre Identität einfach zwischen verschiedenen Diensten portieren. Das Verwalten und Aktuellhalten von dutzenden Nutzerkonten und das Merken der zugehörigen Passwörter entfällt, da nur noch ein Zugang zum persönlichen Wallet erforderlich ist. Konsequenterweise reduzieren sich auch IT-Sicherheitsprobleme, die durch die Verwendung des gleichen Passworts für verschiedene Nutzerkonten entstehen.</p> Welche Herausforderungen gibt&nbsp;es? <p>Einschränkend kann vermerkt werden, dass die Vorzüge und Nutzbarkeit einer selbstsouveränen Identität sich zunächst auf diejenigen Dienstanbieter beziehen, die auf einer Verifiable Data Registry präsent sind — ähnlich den mobilen Anwendungen auf den App Stores. In Analogie dazu ist ein SSI-Netzwerk umso wertvoller für seine Nutzer, je mehr Dienste darüber nutzbar sind. Schließlich ist hier ein Wachstums- und Konsolidierungsprozess zu erwarten, der über die Durchsetzung von bestimmten Angeboten entscheidet.</p><p>Ein kritischer Gedanke ist, dass mit dem Verifiable Data Registry eine ähnliche Abhängigkeit der Identitäts-Subjekte wie bislang zu den Single-Sign-On-Anbietern aus den Sozialen Medien entstünde. Dieser Gedanke führt jedoch in die Irre, denn das Verifiable Data Registry kann mit Hilfe von Distributed Ledger-Technologie in einem Blockchain-basierten Netzwerk betrieben werden. Mehrere dezentrale Rechenknoten, die von unterschiedlichen Akteuren betrieben werden können, würden das Netzwerk bilden. Oftmals sind hier auch Non-Profit-Organisationen wie <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin </a>oder die <a href="https://energyweb.org/reports/the-energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Foundation</a> aktiv. Ein deutlicher Kontrast zu den bisherigen Single-Sign-On-Anbietern.</p><p>Ein ausschlaggebender Faktor für den Erfolg von SSI wird sein, dass die Issuer von Credentials das erforderliche Vertrauen herstellen können. Weiterhin wird, wie so oft, die Nutzererfahrung und die daraus resultierende Akzeptanz entscheidend sein. Lösungsanbieter wie Spherity nutzen eine Cloud, um ein <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/multi-party-computation-b4d2a7c3042">nutzerfreundliches Identitätswallet</a> bieten zu können, das auch Private Keys verwahrt und vor dem ungewollten Verlust der Identität schützt.</p> Wer treibt SSI&nbsp;voran? <p>Die Bundesregierung und die Europäische Union sind unter anderem Treiber von SSI. Sie fördern das Entwickeln der Konzepte, Technologie, Standards und Regulierungen bis hin zu Pilotierungen in verschiedensten Branchen und Bereichen.</p><p>Das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie fördert z.B. das <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/">„Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten“</a>. Eines der Schaufensterprojekte ist IDunion. <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion </a>arbeitet an der Schaffung eines offenen Ökosystems für dezentrale, selbstsouveräne Identitäten. Dazu wird mit Blockchain-Technologie ein verteiltes Identitätsnetzwerk aufgebaut. Das Projekt wird von 47 namhaften Forschungs- und Industriepartnern vorangetrieben. 51nodes ist Partner von&nbsp;IDunion.</p>Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten (Quelle: <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/schaufensterprojekte/">https://digitale-identitaeten.de/schaufensterprojekte/</a>)<p>Die Europäische Union finanziert z.B. das <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">„European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab“</a>. 20 Teilprojekte kümmern sich um die Schaffung und Erweiterung eines Open Source-Softwareframeworks für SSI. Weitere 42 Teilprojekte entwickeln kommerzielle Komponenten and Dienste unter Nutzung des SSI-Frameworks.</p> Anwendungsbeispiel: Wie kann SSI der Energiewirtschaft helfen? <p>Vor dem Hintergrund der Energiewende stehen die Betreiber von Übertragungs- und Verteilnetzen für elektrischen Strom vor großen Herausforderungen und neuen gesetzlichen Pflichten. Über eine Million (privater) dezentraler Stromerzeuger müssen effizient und effektiv in bestehende energiewirtschaftliche Prozesse (z.B. der <a href="https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/regelenergie">Regelleistung</a> und des <a href="https://www.transnetbw.de/de/strommarkt/systemdienstleistungen/redispatch-2-0">Engpassmanagements im Redispatch 2.0</a>) integriert werden.</p>Leistungen und Prozesse der Energiewirtschaft (Quelle: <a href="https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/systemdienstleistungen">https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/systemdienstleistungen</a>)<p>Aktuell sind energiewirtschaftliche Prozesse gekennzeichnet durch produktspezifische und teilweise aufwendige Registrierungsprozesse an verschiedenen Stellen. Beispielsweise kann man hier das <a href="https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR">Marktstammdatenregister </a>der Bundesnetzagentur, die <a href="https://www.regelleistung.net/">Regelleistungsplattform</a> der Übertragungsnetzbetreiber und die Plattform <a href="https://netz-connectplus.de/home/projekt/">connect+</a> zur Kooperation und zum Datenaustausch der Netzbetreiber nennen. Hinzu kommt eine geringe Motivation der Betreiber von kleinen Energieerzeugungsanlagen und der Sicherung der Aktualität der Daten an den unterschiedlichen Registrierungsorten.</p><p>Die Frage von erforderlichen Nachweisen betrifft z.B. die Art der Stromerzeugung (z.B. EEG-Anlage) bzw. für welches energiewirtschaftliche Produkt die Anlage eingesetzt werden darf und kann. Die Identifikatoren (Energy Identification Code) für Anlagen werden zentral durch den <a href="https://www.energiecodes-services.de/bdew-codes.html">BDEW </a>vergeben. Weiterhin gibt es Vorgaben zur Marktkommunikation durch den Regulator, die mit Hilfe einer Zertifikatinfrastruktur für Signierung und Verschlüsselung erfolgt. D.h. die Zertifikate müssen bei allen genannten Stellen eingepflegt und aktuell gehalten werden. In einem “Internet of Energy”, wenn Millionen von Endkunden mit ihren dezentralen Flexibilitätsanlagen (z.B. Elektromobilität, Heimspeicher, Wärmepumpen, etc.) auf den Energiemarkt drängen, kommen diese Systeme zur Abwicklung der Massenprozesse für Registrierungs- und Veränderungsanforderungen in der notwendigen Geschwindigkeit an ihre&nbsp;Grenzen.</p><p>Der Ansatz von SSI verspricht demgegenüber die Vision der Integration von Millionen von dezentralen Anlagen in die Prozesse und IT-Systeme der Netzwirtschaft in unaufwändiger Plug-and-Play-Manier, ohne dass Mehrfachanmeldungen und parallele Konsistenzhaltung in redundanten isolierten Identitätsmanagementsystemen weiter erforderlich wären. Damit sollten Hürden für Anlagenbetreiber sinken und die Prozesse der Netzwirtschaft können schlanker und reibungsärmer aufgestellt werden. Schließlich würde ein wichtiger Beitrag für das Gelingen der Energiewende geleistet.</p><p>Aktuell arbeitet 51nodes gemeinsam mit dem Übertragungsnetzbetreiber <a href="https://www.transnetbw.de/de">TransnetBW</a> an der Erörterung von SSI im Kontext der Energiewirtschaft. Bislang konnten schon mehr als zehn potenzielle Anwendungsfälle für SSI identifiziert werden.</p> Interesse an&nbsp;SSI? <p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes</a> ist ein Anbieter von Lösungen für die Crypto Economy. 51nodes unterstützt Unternehmen und andere Organisationen bei der Umsetzung ihrer SSI- und Blockchain-Projekte.

<p>🇺🇸 US Infrastructure Bill’s Cryptoasset Reporting Requirements Seen as Overreach</p> 
<p>On November 15th 2021, President Joe Biden signed a<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684"> bipartisan infrastructure bill</a>. The bill includes new taxation reporting requirements for cryptoasset brokers.<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408199"> Observers are concerned</a> with the open-languaged “broker” definition used in the bill which could be interpreted as including any blockchain network participant. Indeed, the “broker” definition of the Internal Revenue Code is supplemented by: ‘‘any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.’’</p> 
<p>In the infrastructure bill, any person or entity which falls under the definition above will have to comply with the following reporting requirements: “[A]ny broker, with respect to any transfer (which is not part of a sale or exchange executed by such broker) during a calendar year of a covered security which is a digital asset from an account maintained by such broker to an account which is not maintained by, or an address not associated with, a person that such broker knows or has reason to know is also a broker, shall make a return for such calendar year, in such form as determined by the Secretary, showing the information otherwise required to be furnished with respect to transfers subject to subsection (a).’’&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Industry participants were<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408199"> quick to react</a> accusing the government of regulatory overreach. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano,<a href="https://cryptonews.net/en/2733539/"> reacted to the bill stating that</a>:&nbsp; “we are in a slightly bad position today, because the Infrastructure Bill was passed. If it's left to its own devices, by 2023 when these mandates come into place...depending on how they are interpreted and what the IRS does with it, it can cause catastrophic damage.”</p> 
<p>House Representatives, including Patrick McHenry from the House Financial Services Committee,<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mhh_026_xml__signed.pdf"> introduced a bipartisan bill titled “Keep Innovation in America Act”</a> to clarify the reporting requirements of “brokers” following the changes made to the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed legislation would amend the supplement to the “broker” definition cited above to: ‘‘any person who (for consideration) stands ready in the ordinary course of a trade or business to effect sales of digital assets at the direction of their customers.’’&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The reporting requirements cited above are also amended to include the following sentence at the end of the paragraph: “Information reported by brokers under this section shall be limited to customer information that is voluntarily provided by the customer and held by the broker for a legitimate business purpose.”</p> 
<p>The changes in the “Keep Innovation in America Act” ensure that the reporting requirements are limited to cryptoasset businesses rather than individuals interacting with the blockchain to validate transactions. The bill proposes to push back the date some of these new requirements come into force to 2026.</p>

<p>🇮🇳 India Continues Exploring Cryptoasset regulation</p> 
<p>Details<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/17/india-to-ban-crypto-as-payment-method-but-regulate-as-asset-report/"> have emerged</a> regarding a cryptoasset regulation bill which is due to be presented to the Indian parliament this winter. The bill will reportedly ban payments using cryptoassets but allow users to trade their assets. Authorities are expected to ban active solicitation, such as advertisements, from cryptoasset business. These reports follow India’s Standing Committee on Finance<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-parliament-committee-discusses-crypto-regulation-industry-experts/"> inaugural hearing</a> with industry stakeholders on “CryptoFinance: Opportunities and Challenges”' on November 15th 2021. These developments illustrate the government's willingness to move rapidly on cryptoasset regulation as<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-president-working-group-releases-report-on-stablecoins"> Elliptic covered</a> announcements by the Ministry of Finance earlier this month.</p>

<p>🇮🇱 Israel is Adopting New AML Laws for Cryptoassets</p> 
<p>The Israeli’s government<a href="https://www.justice.gov.il/Units/HalbantHon/News/Pages/AML_MSB_order-14112021.aspx"> new anti-money laundering (AML) order</a> for cryptoasset businesses took effect on November 14th 2021. The updated regulation includes a licensing requirement for cryptoasset businesses. According to<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/anti-terror-banking-rules-now-apply-to-cryptocurrency-684971"> The Jerusalem Post</a>, the director of the Authority for Combating Terror Financing and Money Laundering, Shlomit Wagman, said this new framework will reduce criminal activity in the cryptoasset ecosystem while increasing the legitimacy of the industry. Members of the industry<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/16/israels-new-aml-rules-may-help-banks-onboard-crypto-clients/"> hoped</a> that these new rules will facilitate their relationship with local banks. As Israel ramps up its efforts to regulate the cryptoasset industry, the US Department of the Treasury<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USTREAS/bulletins/2fc3308?reqfrom"> issued a press release</a> detailing a partnership with the Israeli Minister of Finance to combat ransomware on November 15th 2021.</p>

<p>🇰🇷 South Korea is Looking to Tighten Cryptoasset Regulation</p> 
<p>South Korean regulators were criticised by cryptoasset businesses<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-lawmakers-push-back-against-controversial-know-the-sender-rule"> following a hearing on new bills set to regulate the industry</a>. One of the bills would introduce a "know-the-sender" rule. As such, cryptoasset businesses would be obliged to gather information on the identity of the issuer of each transaction they receive. Stakeholders remarked that this rule would be impractical and severely limit the transactions which take place locally. These requirements are akin to the<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf"> Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule”</a> (Recommendation 16).</p>

<p>🇺🇸 US Department of Justice to Sell Cryptoassets Linked to Fraud</p> 
<p>The US Department of Justice is<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"> set to liquidate $56 million in fraud proceeds</a> of a cryptoasset project named BitConnect. This is the largest seizure of cryptoassets by US authorities. BitConnect’s main promoter, Glenn Arcaro, was charged with conspiracy to defraud investors using a Ponzi scheme which gathered more than $2 billion.&nbsp; When ordered by the court, the government will start selling the seized cryptoassets to restitute these funds to the victims. The Department of Justice encourages victims of the fraud to<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/us-v-glenn-arcaro-21cr02542-twr?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"> reach out</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> has announced two strategically important appointments to its Board of Directors. Experienced tech executive Sue Barsamian will be lending her expertise and mentorship skills as a new Director, while former Okta CFO Bill Losch will act as Onfido’s Audit Chair.</p>



<p>In a statement, Onfido CEO Mike Tuchen explained that the new board appointees “are two exceptional industry leaders with specialized experience in accelerating companies into hypergrowth, which will be vital as we embark on the next stage of our expansion journey.”</p>



<p>For her part, Barsamian brings executive experience from multiple tech companies, most notably Hewlett Packard, where she started as VP of Business Operations and Strategy in 2007, eventually becoming Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of HPE Software for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a position she held from 2016 to 2017. Now, she sits on the boards of multiple firms including Five9, Box, NortonLifeLock, Gainsight, and Xactly Corp.</p>



<p>Onfido’s announcement, however, highlighted her previous board roles, emphasizing a “track record of building and mentoring teams… at security company Symantec, data company Segment, and identity management platform, Auth0.”</p>



<p>Losch, meanwhile, was lauded for his leadership in helping Okta “to scale quickly from a disruptive start-up to a publicly traded technology firm which has grown to a forecasted $1 billion plus in revenue and 13,000 global customers.” Before serving as Okta’s Chief Financial Officer – a position he has held since 2013 – Losch was CFO of MobiTV, and he previously served in Chief Accounting Officer roles with Yahoo! and Dreamworks Animation.</p>



<p>“I’m thrilled to have an opportunity to work with Sue and Bill,” Tuschen said. “With our enhanced leadership team, we’re in a strong position to make accessing the digital economy a safe and smooth experience for everyone.”</p>



<p>The expansion of Onfido’s board – and the company’s ability to attract this kind of talent – speaks to the company’s rising profile amid growing demand for biometric identity verification solutions. Onfido has been reporting <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-revenues-up-more-than-200-yoy-from-german-speaking-customers-708251/">significant revenue increases</a>, and was recently a winner in the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-recognized-fraud-prevention-2021-cybersecurity-breakthrough-awards-101307/">2021 CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards</a>. Building on its momentum, the company announced its acquisition of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-acquires-biometrics-pioneer-eyn-reports-q3-growth-710261/">liveness detection startup EYN</a> last month.</p>

<p>Filling holes in the web3 stack</p>
<p>This was a very fun and interesting conversation with Lauren Feld, Head of Growth at <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a>, a company building the <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Ceramic Network in my opinion is one the most exciting projects in the web3 space. Ceramic is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and sharing streams of data.</p>
<p>This is interesting to consider in a decentralized identity context. As we all know, we leave massive traces of ourselves in the digital world. The products that have enabled user generated content in the web2 world have dramatically increased the volume of data we leave behind. If this data is valuable, which social media companies can attest is true, then how could this data be returned to the rightful generator/owner of it. How can it also be made portable across different applications?</p>
<p>On this podcast we often talk about Verifiable Credentials and recently a bit more about government issued digital IDs. I hope this conversation gives listeners some excitement about what’s now being made possible with some exciting bottom-up approaches and how turning the data layer of applications into a public utility is the logical evolution of the web.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 What excites Lauren about web3 applications? 
 What is the pulse on DAOs to incorporate Decentralized ID into them? 
 The importance of Mutability 
 An overview of Decentralized Data Storage Ecosystems, in particular IPFS, one of first protocols in the web3 space 
 What makes Data Composability important for open data layers? 
 How to go about building Distributed Data Models? 
 Key considerations when Selling to Developers rather than to enterprises 
 How to think about Verifiable Credentials in a context of your online data 
 Some Exciting Use Cases happening using Ceramic (you can find more use cases here: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">https://blog.ceramic.network/)</a> 
 Can older business models use Ceramic to decentralize their data layer?

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 13th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/SGnode_ONT">Geoff Richards</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAO">Wing DAO</a> communities.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I was initially drawn to the staking opportunities provided by Ontology. I was reading about staking and right in front of me was this established project, with a clear vision for the future, and excellent rewards for people backing the&nbsp;vision.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I never needed to ask, ‘Why Ontology?’. The team has identified a clear need for solutions around data and identity. The current and future requirement for decentralized, trustless solutions to data and identity security is without question. As more projects launch in the Web3 space, this need only becomes greater. So, for me, Ontology is an enabler; a solution that will make other projects better. It’s not about competing in the Web3 space, it’s about making the experience better and more secure for everyone involved.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I’m a huge fan of the community around Ontology. If you look back at previous Harbinger interviews, all these people have answered my questions, solved my confusions, and generally made me feel welcome in the space. I hope I do the same for&nbsp;others.</p><p>I like to be the first to receive information. And the opportunity to do what I like, which is helping people! Although, I began doing this long before I became Harbinger.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>At times, the crypto space can feel a little like the Wild West. There are bad actors and people looking to take advantage of new users. A strong community is our best solution to this&nbsp;problem.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>If you hang around the Telegram channel for any amount of time, you’ll see people helping by sharing their own experiences. We have regular calls to discuss the project, as well as the Web3 and blockchain space in general. I honestly don’t know of another community that engages with its members in such a way. If you have a question, a problem, an idea, or a solution, then there is always an opportunity to be&nbsp;heard.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I mainly hang out in the Telegram rooms; I guess it’s become my natural environment. However, I’ve recently spent more time on Discord, where there are some excellent opportunities to share ideas. We even have dedicated channels to throw your ideas around in. Rather than seeing other channels, I’d really like to see the Discord community grow.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Being a Harbinger means that you really believe in the aims and goals of the project. If you want to be a Harbinger, the first step is to be a positive force in the community. Understand what Ontology is about and share that understanding.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Altruistic, Thoughtful, Passionate.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>The answer to all these questions is the same. I’d like to see more opportunities to use ONT ID, and for the community to tell people that they are using&nbsp;it.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Ontology has a fantastic vision for the future. The technology is excellent, and the community is supportive. Next is the expansion of dApps on the ecosystem, and people using the opportunities Ontology provides to be creative. With the upcoming EVM launch, this feels more achievable than ever. Once that happens, the community can help by using the things that people build and telling everyone how cool they&nbsp;are.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

   Okta Early Access Hackathon revisited 

<p>In August, Okta’s developer relations team invited intrepid developers to participate in <a>the virtual Okta Identity Engine Early Access Hackathon</a>, and challenged them to build a working app with our limited availability new customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform. A month or so after, judges convened, <a>winners were announced</a>, and thousands of dollars in prizes were distributed. Kudos to hundreds of participants, and props to all involved.</p>

<p>In October, we sat down with UK-based developer <a href="https://devpost.com/software/gooseclip">Matthew McKenzie, the creator of GooseClip</a>, our first prize winner.</p>

 

 

 Introducing peer-to-peer GooseClip 

<p><a href="https://gooseclip.com/#/">GooseClip</a> is an authenticated peer-to-peer communication platform, rooted in the Go programming language, and inspired by “a frustration at the lack of interoperability of our modern devices.” As Matt describes it, “GooseClip obscures the complexity of peer-to-peer networking by presenting a simple 2-route API, /attach and /connect.” This becomes the base upon which he builds various example mini-products, which demonstrate the versatility and simplicity of the underlying p2p platform.</p>

<p>Developer advocates <a href="https://twitter.com/quorralyne">Heather Downing</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/briandemers">Brian Demers</a> spoke with Matt about peer-to-peer technology, his vision for GooseClip, and his experience hacking Okta and building auth. Matt shared some insights about building leading edge applications and launching new tech products as an independent developer and technical founder.</p>

The goal of this trial is to create an experience for customers that maintains openness and ensures peer-to-peer transaction discovery that is compliant with the new FATF Travel Rule requirement.</p><blockquote>“We built Shyft to ensure that the ethos of digital asset networks was maintained regardless of the regulatory requirements that would come,” said Joseph W. of Shyft Network. “We are excited to see this public system be put to work by the largest players globally, and are proud to see leading stablecoins, like Tether, maintain decentralization while allowing the ecosystem to meet regulations. We see systems like Veriscope, and networks like Shyft, as critical infrastructure layers to the future of decentralized data coordination and transmission.”</blockquote><p>In August of this year, Shyft Network, in collaboration with Tether, Bitfinex and other exchanges, key industry players, and liquidity providers announced the global deployment of Veriscope, a public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule. Just a few days ago, Shyft Core, the development team behind Veriscope, announced the open-source release of the infrastructure to enable developers and other VASPs to freely integrate with the platform, Tether will be one of the first to put this infrastructure to the&nbsp;test.</p><blockquote>“Veriscope’s opensource solution to discovering VASPs and transmitting customer information is an interesting use case that’s in line with the ethos of Bitcoin” said, Leonardo Real, CCO of Tether. We look forward to continuing to lead the&nbsp;charge”.</blockquote><p>To learn more about Tether, please visit,<a href="https://tether.to/"> https://tether.to/</a>.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner.

			 Tony Malghem is Tech Lead at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hello! I am Tony, 29, TechLead for Tokeny. I graduated as a Software Engineer from Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France. After spending some time in Paris and discovering the start-up world, I followed my girlfriend to Luxembourg when she landed a more interesting job in one of the many banks here 🙂</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I absolutely loved the job I had in Paris in the startup. The pressure, the smaller team, the « family business » kind of feeling. When I moved to Luxembourg, I decided to try something different, but I was missing all of this too much. I lost myself working in banks and it got too much. One of the person I worked with told me about Tokeny, and I was very interested in this new challenge. So I wrote an email to our amazing HR Radka, and the rest is history 🙂&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s amazing! I know, you must be thinking to yourself: ”Of course he’s lobbying for his company”, but honestly, it’s one of the best companies I’ve ever worked with. The team is incredible, with people from so many different backgrounds and experiences, with great ideas, a big commitment and a strong team spirit. We all stick together in the ups and the downs, we lose together and we win together. I am proud to be a member of this company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Too many things! I love learning new stuff, so I always end up finding a new passion and throwing myself in it. The latest one is baking! I started writing a few years ago, and created a writing community to make progress. We even self published a compilation of short stories last year 🙂 Anything I can share with my friends and family, really.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p></p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To make this planet a better place to live for my son. I would love to break this cycle of previous generations making the next one’s life more difficult, by fighting climate change for example.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>It’s pretty cliché, but to make everyone accept their differences so we can all live together without fighting. Difference is a strength, not a curse 🙂</p>

<p>After achieving many major milestones in 2021 including the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/the-dock-token-migration-is-now-complete/">Token migration</a>, the release of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">Dock’s API</a>, and launching Ledger Wallet support, the Dock team is proud and excited to make some new additions to the roadmap that will take us into 2022. </p><p>We will continue to strive to build innovative solutions, drive adoption, and engage with our community. Below, you’ll find high-level descriptions of the upcoming milestones.</p><p>Anonymous Credentials (Q4 2021)</p><p>We’re working on launching anonymous credentials and BBS+ Signatures to further protect our users' right to privacy. Currently, if an individual wishes to share an accreditation, they must share the entire credential. Anonymous credentials are an enhancement to privacy meaning individuals can select certain parts of a credential to share as well as prove information contained in the credential without exposing any of the information.</p><p>As an example, a credential holder will be able to prove their educational qualifications without the verifier knowing the date they attended and graduated from university. The credential holder will have complete control over the specifics of what data they wish to share. </p><p>Self-Serve Issuer Console (Q1 2022)</p><p>Dock is working on a Self-Serve Issuer Console which will allow any organization to issue credentials without having to write a single line of code. The console will enable organizations to issue and verify credentials, enabling rapid prototyping and pilots to prove the benefits of verifiable credentials without having to hire developers. </p><p>Digital credentials remove any risk of fraudulent activity; credentials are issued by an educational or training body, and these can be optionally anchored to the Dock blockchain which serves as a timestamp for the credential. By simply signing up with an email address in their internet browser, organizations can design and issue their verifiable credentials to their users via email. </p><p>V2 Dock Mobile App (Q1 2022)</p><p>We understand the trouble and delay verifying a person’s credentials can cause, and the worry for the individual of not having ownership of their credentials. We plan to release an additional feature to our Mobile App in Q1 of 2022 giving users the ability to store and manage digital credentials. Credential holders can take back control of their data as they receive verifiable credentials from issuers and have control over who sees them. </p><p>Dock will embed a verifiable credentials wallet into the existing Dock Mobile App allowing users to receive, store and manage their data. Please note that the first version of this wallet will be published in the app stores in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Wallet SDK (Q1 2022)</p><p>Many SMEs and large organizations want to offer storage and functionality of digital credentials in their applications but don’t have the resources to make this happen. For organizations that want to offer digital credentials, the holders of these credentials often have to download a third-party app to store and manage their data. This disconnect means the user is working across multiple apps and managing their own data can become troublesome. Dock’s Wallet SDK can significantly improve the user experience by allowing organizations to embed an identity wallet into their own, existing React Native apps and can be deployed rapidly. A credential holder will be in control over their data and who sees it.</p><p>Enabling digital credentials to be stored in a crypto wallet can take months of development, meaning more money and time being spent from the already scarce resources of a developer's time. Dock will provide support for other languages based on market demand in the near future.</p><p>Our team is looking forward to achieving these significant milestones, continuing to grow Dock, and engaging with the community. We will continue to keep everyone updated through our blog and <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockNetwork">social channels</a>, subscribe to our blog below.</p>

<p><br>We are excited to announce our partnership with <a href="https://www.teller.finance/">Teller Finance</a>! &nbsp;Hot off the release of Bloom’s innovative new DeFi-focused platform, <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a>, we are teaming up with Teller, assisting them as they bring their algorithmic credit risk profile to the DeFi space. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Teller is a perfect fit for Bloom, and we are excited about the potential this partnership represents. &nbsp;By utilizing Bloom’s verifiable credentials (VCs) that can be easily permissioned, Teller is able to confidently focus on their mission to enable the creation of decentralized lending markets that can offer loans without the need for collateral. Their cloud-based protocol was designed to function as a decentralized non-custodial liquidity pool where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Bloom’s VCs become part of a risk assessment algorithm which allows Teller’s protocol to interact with undercollateralized loans.<br></p><blockquote>“This partnership with Teller Finance represents an exciting venture for Bloom, as both companies share a common vision to expand undercollateralized lending within the DeFi arena. &nbsp;We feel that, together, the possibilities are limitless with Teller’s protocol easily integrating with Bloom’s solution.” - Ben DiScipio, Bloom CSO<br></blockquote><p>OnRamp is a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, providing access to reusable VCs that were previously only available to the traditional finance sector. &nbsp;This means that enterprises now have an elegant solution within the undercollateralized market as we assist them with KYC, sanction screening, and other financial verifications. &nbsp;Beyond that, we see a real opportunity to dramatically increase participation in the DeFi space with Teller, as we work together to incorporate alternative signals to determine creditworthiness and enable risk assessment. &nbsp;We share the same passion for decentralized identity and believe that decentralized lending can be executed securely and efficiently. <br></p><blockquote>"We at Teller are thrilled to partner with Bloom to use their secure identity and credit scoring solutions on our decentralized lending platform. Bloom’s cost-efficiency and risk reduction when it comes to identity theft and fraud prevention perfectly aligns with our mission to provide users peace of mind when borrowing and lending." &nbsp;Ryan Berkun, Teller CEO<br></blockquote><p>At the heart of the Teller Protocol are the main contracts, including their ATM contracts. &nbsp;ATM, or Autonomous Teller Machine, is a decentralized money market smart contract that is connected to a Credit Risk Algorithm (CRA), through which users can request loans using personal consumer data that is computed by Teller's open-source CRA. By integrating Bloom’s innovative platform into their process, Teller is emphasizing the importance of enabling secure, reusable VCs while maintaining user privacy. &nbsp;Our hope is that the scope of our partnership will continue to expand and open doors to all of the verifications OnRamp can provide.<br></p><p>We are proud to partner with Teller and are thrilled to share with them all that OnRamp and the BloomID can offer within the DeFi sector.

 A step-by-step guide on publishing your first dataset on Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>Have you ever wondered how to make money over the blockchain? If you have datasets to sell, you will be amazed at how simple the process is. The blockchain often sounds like a complex and abstract concept that requires a lot of technical knowledge. In reality, interacting and selling datasets over the blockchain is an incredibly straightforward process that only has a couple of unfamiliar steps.</p><p>In this article, we will walk you through the steps to publish and sell your datasets via Ocean Protocol, which is a World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer.</p> Ocean puts you in&nbsp;control <p>We understand that many companies don’t feel comfortable sharing or selling data. This is because sharing data is perceived to be a risk — the risk of either losing your competitive advantage or violating strict data privacy regulations. This is why we have been driven to build you the tools so that sharing data means gaining control and preserving privacy.</p><p>Ocean Protocol gives you complete control of your data by removing any third parties from the process, selling data over the blockchain is completely decentralised. As we will demonstrate below, Ocean also gives you a super easy-to-use marketplace for selling your data. This reduces the barriers to entry and brings you customers for your data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>From the very beginning, Ocean has strived to put you in control of your data, we are on a mission to break the black-box data selling model of Facebook and others. We achieve this through the core concepts of access control, orchestration and decentralization. With access control and orchestration, any data or AI service can be shared under the conditions set by the owner of data. There is no central intermediary, which ensures no one can interfere with the transaction and both the publisher and user have transparency.</p> So much more than a typical data&nbsp;market <p>By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain, Ocean Protocol offers you so much more control than a typical data market. The gatekeeper to accessing your data is a smart contract, which is an immutable piece of code running on the blockchain that no one is able to change. You can have confidence that the terms and conditions to access your dataset can never be altered by an intermediary.</p><p>While Ocean Market is a great place for selling data, we also understand that some data is too sensitive to be shared — potentially due to GDPR or other reasons. For these types of datasets, we offer a unique service called compute-to-data. This enables you to monetise the dataset that sits behind a firewall without ever revealing the raw data to the consumer. Researchers and data scientists pay to run their algorithms on the data set and the computation is performed behind a firewall, all they receive is the results generated by the algorithm.</p> How to publish a dataset on Ocean&nbsp;Market  Tutorial Sections  1. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#b740">Introduction</a><br>2. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#b171">Setup Your Wallet</a><br>3. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#a296">Add Ether cryptocurrency to your wallet</a><br>4. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#9106">Publish your data asset on Ocean Market</a><br>    4.1 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#a03f">Connect your account</a><br>    4.2 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#52e1">Enter your dataset information into the publish form</a><br>    4.3 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#679d">Sign the transactions &amp; publish your dataset</a> <br>5. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#affc">Decide on pricing type</a><br>    5.1 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#4e3d">Fixed pricing</a><br>    5.2 <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#ec22">Dynamic pricing</a><br>6. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#0f66">Create fixed pricing for a data set</a><br>7. <a href="https://medium.com/p/27cb93dfe805#f94a">All done!</a>  1. Introduction <p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> provides a convenient and familiar interface for you to publish and sell your data. If you haven’t seen it before, now is a good time to have a look at the site. You’ll find it looks a lot like any other data marketplace — running the blockchain doesn’t compromise usability.</p><p>What you decide to sell via Ocean is entirely up to you. The dataset can comprise images, location information, audio, video, sales data, or combinations of them all. There is no exhaustive list of what type of data can be published, you can be as creative as you want. Just make sure that the data you’re selling is legal and not in breach of copyright or other regulations, our policies can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">here</a>.</p><p>There are only a few unfamiliar things you need to get used to when selling data over the blockchain:</p>  Every interaction with the blockchain costs money. There is no centralised company controlling the system that is going to pay for computation and server costs, so the user must pay. This is called the gas fee — it’s basically like putting gas into your car to make it&nbsp;run.  You need to have a wallet to store the cryptocurrency that you will be paying for these gas fees. This can easily be set up as a browser extension.  Each time you interact with the blockchain, you will be asked to “sign” a transaction. This is the process where you pay the gas fees and verify the origin of the transaction. It is equivalent to being asked to enter your pin when you pay with a credit&nbsp;card.  <p>If you’re familiar with the blockchain space, you may be wondering which blockchain Ocean Protocol uses. It was originally deployed on Ethereum but we have since deployed to four other chains, and there will be more to come in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It is important to note that the gas cost associated with signing transactions on different blockchains varies significantly. For the purpose of this guide, we will be focusing on how to publish datasets on the Ethereum blockchain, as it is the most ubiquitous. However — it is also the most expensive. If you would like to explore a cheaper option, we would recommend reading our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">blog post on using Polygon</a>. We also have instructions in our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/polygon-bridge/">documentation</a> on how to transfer funds from Ethereum to Polygon (via a&nbsp;bridge).</p> 2. Setup Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Let’s start with getting your wallet set up to interact with the blockchain. After this, the process of publishing a dataset is very familiar — it just requires filling out a&nbsp;form.</p>  Go to your browser’s web store for extensions and search for MetaMask.  <p>2. Install MetaMask. The wallet provides a friendly user interface that will help you through each step. MetaMask gives you two options: importing an existing wallet or creating a new one. Choose to Create a&nbsp;Wallet:</p><p>3. In the next step create a new password for your wallet. Read through and accept the terms and conditions.</p><p>4. Once your wallet is set up, MetaMask will show your Secret Backup Phrase. It is very important that you write this down (ideally more than once) on paper (don’t save it on your computer) and store it somewhere safe. If you forget your password or lose access to your computer, this is the only way to regain access to your cryptocurrency.</p><p>5. Continue forward. On the next page, MetaMask will ask you to confirm the backup phrase — this phase is very important so they’re checking you’ve actually written it down. Select the words in the correct sequence.</p><p>6. Voila! Your account setup is complete. You can access MetaMask via the browser extension in the top right corner of your&nbsp;browser.</p><p>7. You can now manage Ether and Ocean Tokens with this wallet. You can copy your account address to the clipboard from the options. When you want someone to send Ether or Ocean Tokens to you, you will have to give them that&nbsp;address.</p><p>If you feel you need some more help setting up your MetaMask wallet, you can also watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dn0wVs9kWolBCbtHaFxsi408cumOeth">tutorial video snippets</a> and <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">view these instructions</a> on our documentation.</p> 3. Add Ether cryptocurrency to your&nbsp;wallet <p>There are many places where you can purchase cryptocurrency and you may have used some of them before. To keep things simple, we will purchase Ether from within MetaMask. It’s easy to buy cryptocurrency in MetaMask with your credit card or Apple/Android pay. Here are the&nbsp;steps:</p>  Open Metamask and click&nbsp;“Buy”  <p>2. MetaMask gives you a few different options, which you’ll see here. Wyre (the first option on the list) is fast and easy to use so let’s click “Continue with&nbsp;Wyre”</p><p>3. Now enter the amount of Ether that you would like to purchase and the currency that you will be paying in. At this point, you will also need to tick to accept the terms and conditions.</p><p>4. Now you need to enter your personal payment details — name, address, credit card number&nbsp;etc.</p><p>5. All you have to do is click “Accept” and Wyre will process the payment and send you your cryptocurrency.</p><p>Once the payment processing is complete you will now see that your balance in MetaMask is no longer&nbsp;zero.</p> 4. Publish your data asset on Ocean&nbsp;Market <p>Great — so you’ve got your wallet set up and you’ve bought some cryptocurrency. You are now ready to publish your dataset on Ocean Market. Head on over to the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">site</a> and let’s get&nbsp;going!</p> 4.1 Connect your&nbsp;account <p>The first step is to connect your wallet to the site. This is the equivalent of logging in on a traditional site. This lets Ocean Market know the public address that’s associated with your Ethereum&nbsp;account.</p><p>You’ll see that Ocean Market gives you a few different options for the type of wallet that you want to connect. In our case, we will click MetaMask as that is the wallet that we have set&nbsp;up.</p><p>MetaMask will now ask you to select the account that you would like to connect to Ocean Market — this is only relevant if you have more than&nbsp;one.</p><p>Now we need to click “Connect” to confirm that we want MetaMask to connect our account to Ocean Market. You can see here that MetaMask helpfully explains that this site is requesting to “View the addresses of your permitted accounts (required)”.</p><p>Now that your wallet is connected, you will see that your wallet address is shown in the top right-hand corner.</p><p>Click “Publish” from the top of the site and let’s start filling out the publish&nbsp;form.</p> 4.2 Enter your dataset information into the publish&nbsp;form <p>The publish form is nice and straightforward and most of the fields are obvious (title, description, author etc) — they also all have descriptions of what’s expected underneath in case they’re not&nbsp;clear.</p><p>The link to your dataset should be entered into the “file” field. You need to take responsibility for hosting your dataset — this can be on Google Drive, Dropbox, or AWS — anywhere that it can be downloaded from. For the access type, you need to decide if customers will be allowed to buy your raw dataset or if you only want them to run computations on it behind a firewall (Compute-to-Data). It’s also advisable to enter some tags — these are keywords that help customers discover your dataset, try to think of words that people will be searching for.</p><p>The only blockchain-specific field is the datatoken name and symbol. The datatoken is the token on the blockchain that grants access to your dataset — consumers have to purchase the datatoken to have access. The name of the datatoken doesn’t really matter, it’s just important it’s unique, so it’s fine to keep the default or click refresh a couple of times until you see something you&nbsp;like.</p><p>You can also decide how long you would like users to have access to the dataset after their initial purchase by choosing the timeout. If you’re constantly updating your dataset you may wish to have a shorter timeout so that customers come back to purchase the latest&nbsp;copy.</p> 4.3 Sign the transactions &amp; publish your&nbsp;dataset <p>When you finish filling out the form and click submit, you will see a series of pop-ups from Metamask. This is the process of signing the transactions and paying the gas fees that were mentioned above. There are two transactions that you need to&nbsp;sign.</p><p>In each of these pop-ups, MetaMask shows you an estimate of how much the gas fee is likely to be. It also gives an estimate of how long the transaction is likely to take. It also shows you the functions that the transaction is carrying out. The first one is “Create Token” and the second is “Contract Interaction”. Click “confirm” on each&nbsp;pop-up.</p><p>Awesome — your dataset is now published! Now you see that using the blockchain isn’t so difficult after&nbsp;all.</p> 5. Decide on pricing&nbsp;type <p>Once the dataset is published, you can think about how you want to set the pricing for your asset. The pricing can only be set from the Ethereum account that published the dataset. If you have multiple accounts, you need to ensure you’re still connected with the same one you used to do the publishing.</p><p>There are 2 options for setting the price of an asset on Ocean Marketplace. It is important to think carefully about which one is appropriate for your data asset. Once you set the pricing type you will not be able to change it, although you will still be able to change the&nbsp;price.</p> 5.1 Fixed&nbsp;pricing <p>Fixed pricing is fairly self-explanatory — you set the price and that’s what customers pay to access your data. You can change the price at any time and customers will always have to pay the amount that you&nbsp;set.</p> 5.2 Dynamic&nbsp;pricing <p>Dynamic pricing is a little more complicated as the price is determined by an automated version of an order book. This concept is called an Automated Market Marker (AMM). Under the hood, Ocean uses the Balancer&nbsp;AMM.</p><p>If you would like to create dynamic pricing you will need to purchase Ocean tokens so that you can provide liquidity to the AMM pool. The price that the customer pays is set by the ratio of Ocean tokens to datatokens within the pool. As more people purchase the datatokens, the ratio changes and the price increases. If you remove Ocean tokens from the pool the ratio changes in the other direction and the datatoken price goes&nbsp;down.</p><p>Anyone can add liquidity to the pool you have created — they are known as liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees when the datatoken is purchased.</p> 6. Create fixed pricing for a data&nbsp;set <p>To keep things simple, let’s use fixed pricing for the dataset that we have just published. From the publish success page that you are on, click “Go to Data&nbsp;set”</p><p>Now click on “Create pricing”. This takes you to the section where you can choose either dynamic or fixed&nbsp;pricing.</p><p>Click on the “Fixed Price” tab at the top. Now there is a simple form for you to enter the price of your data asset. The price that you set is in Ocean tokens — this is the cryptocurrency that your customers will use to purchase your&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Once you have entered the price and clicked “Create Pricing” you will, once again, be presented with a series of MetaMask pops. There are three pop-ups that you need to confirm in this case: Creating the pricing, minting the datatokens, and then allowing Ocean Market to spend them (i.e. selling them on your&nbsp;behalf).</p><p>Once you have confirmed each of these transactions you will see the success message explaining that fixed pricing has been&nbsp;set.</p><p>After reloading the page you will see that your dataset is now for sale at the fixed price which you&nbsp;set.</p> 7. All&nbsp;done! <p>Excellent — you’re all done! We have covered a lot in this article so well done for making it all the way to the end. You have set up your MetaMask wallet, bought Ether, published your first dataset, set the pricing and signed all of the transactions along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Hopefully, now you see that publishing and selling data on the blockchain doesn’t require any advanced technical knowledge. Once you have got your MetaMask wallet set up, it is a fairly straightforward process. You have to fill out a form and click confirm on a couple of pop-ups — that’s pretty much it. Now all you need to do is notify your potential customers and start earning money from the&nbsp;sales!</p><p>Let’s also not lose sight of why we’re doing this — Ocean Protocol is significantly better than any centralised data exchange. It is completely decentralized and puts you in complete control. It is completely unique in enabling you to sell access to sensitive data sets without exposing the raw data (Compute-to-Data).</p><p>We are always happy to answer any questions that you may have after reading this article, the best way to get in touch is <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/776848812534398986">discord</a>.

				  A ground-breaking development in decentralized fintech from Liquid Avatar Technologies, Dynamics Inc., and Indicio — and what it means for the future.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Liquid Avatar Technologies’<a href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1k98Fpjr0-liquid-avatar-technologies-and-dynamics-inc-tap-payment-infrastructure-for-verification-of-digital-credentials.html"> PassmateTM</a> shows how decentralized identity will transform the world: by easily integrating into systems that already exist. The soon-to-be-launched Software as a Service — conceived by Liquid Avatar’s David Lucatch, enables verifiable credentials to run on existing payment rails.</p>
<p>It was the kind of insight that seems obvious after someone points it out: Businesses already have the infrastructure to handle debit and credit card payments and PassmateTM simply uses these to deploy verifiable credentials. They will be used, first, to deal with age verification for proof of purchases — a non-trivial risk for small businesses in Liquid Avatar’s home province of Ontario, Canada, where merchants can be hit with costly, livelihood-destroying fines if they fail to verify the age of their customers. But more importantly, it provides a simple and powerful deterrent to something far worse: the poor choices underage purchasers can make when they succeed in fooling retail clerks.</p>
<p>PassmateTM will enable a verifiable credential to be used at point-of-sale without the business having to add costly new infrastructure or requiring sales clerks to discern valid from fraudulent IDs — and the purchaser will be able to prove they are of legal age without having to divulge personal details like their exact date of birth or home address.</p>
<p>It doesn’t stop there. PassmateTM can handle all sorts of “proofs” without having to reveal their full content—such as Covid test status or any other qualification that might be necessary to access or purchase a product or service. It will be piloted in early 2022 in Ontario, then the rest of Canada, before an expected broader geographic rollout.</p>
<p>But it’s the ability to use verifiable credentials at point-of-sale card payment terminals and devices that sets up a paradigm change for identity in the marketplace. A financial institution, payment processor or card issuer can now think about adding a verifiable credential to manage proof of identity in a low-cost, frictionless way, and do so without a customer having to reveal unnecessary personally identifying information (PII). This has the potential to alleviate the pain of credit card fraud while avoiding complex data privacy compliance.</p>
<p>While the current pace of innovation in decentralized identity reveals its protean capacity to solve long-standing problems around authentication, compliance, and security, there is also the opportunity that the technology itself creates by doing things differently and enabling things that were not previously possible.</p>
<p>This is where we turn to <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">DIDComm</a>, one of the key technical elements of decentralized identity and one that makes PassmateTM possible. DIDComm is a decentralized communications protocol for peer-to-peer communication that can run over any existing transport but also function offline. DIDComm is where decentralized identity gets really exciting.</p>
<p>DIDComm is the next phase of Social<br>The ability to generate secure relationships and rich communication through DIDComm will have a profound effect on the way brands and businesses engage with consumers and consumers engage with brands and businesses.</p>
<p>As one marketing <a href="https://www.opinium.com/the-next-brand-consumer-dynamic-the-view-from-the-us/">report</a> into emergent behavior put it, “we’re entering a consumer-first landscape where relationships with brands are symbiotic, not top-down, and based on a system of shared ideals, values and mutually beneficial interactions.”</p>
<p>This is where DIDComm is a game-changer. By enabling rich “consumer-first” interaction in a privacy-preserving and secure way, DIDComm is the evolutionary path for social media. Instead of the one or the few speaking to the many and interaction mediated by an algorithm, it’s going to also be about the one-to-one. Instead of broadcasting for influence, it will also be about creating authentic relationships. Given current trends, this is going to be huge. Organizations and brands that master this technology are going to turn consumers into collaborators, stakeholders, and advocates.</p>
<p>And that’s not all…</p>
<p>The DIDComm of Things<br>With the proliferation of sensors and cameras, digital objects will be able to engage with non digital objects. This is the foundation of the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45">spatial web</a> and it will enable the creation of digital twins, smart factories, and smart cities. To work, all the connected “things” in the spatial web will need verifiable identities and to be able to communicate with each other offline in secure, peer-to-peer ways. Verifiable credentials and DIDComm make this possible.</p>
<p>Crash—crush?—the future<br>PassmateTM is a signpost for the near future. The ability to authenticate and trust data and relationships and communicate in new ways is going to change everything, slowly at first, then swiftly like a flood.</p>
<p>Indicio is incubating this future. We love working with visionary companies and organizations to make their visions of a better digital world come to life. You can contact us <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the ID-Ideal project, Jolocom brings sovereign identities and SSI into a single wallet.</p>



<p>To improve efficiency and interoperability in the digital space, Jolocom presents the ID-Ideal project. The starting point is the fact that every user has 70 digital identities online. Why not introduce one single secure digital ID solution to merge all of those identities? ID-Ideal is one way of many, offering an integrated solution or a middle way so that many identities can be supplemented by a single, secure digital ID solution.</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation program “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SSDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and one of four projects that qualified for the implementation phase.</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of the four SDI implementation projects, to which it will lend its expertise in self-sovereign identity and years of experience in developing digital identity wallets. Other projects include “ONCE” and the “SDIKA” project. The SDI projects are special because they bring competitors around the table who are working together on one solution. In addition, they achieve interoperability, so that the use of digital identification no longer remains inefficient.</p>



<p>ID-Ideal’s implementation phase began in May 2021. Current developments relating to the European eIDAS regulation are also taken into account, with the clear aim of providing future-orientated solutions on the subject of digital identities. Citizens should be able to act from the comfort of their home – be it when changing their place of residence, applying for a care center or other notifications of changes. The solution should not be used regionally but across Germany and Europe.</p>



<p>Based on the so-called ID-Ideal Trust Framework, the technical, legal, and semantic interoperability of services and applications is regulated. The aim is to stimulate the creation of an ID ecosystem. If many ID services can coexist, the overarching exchange of digital evidence becomes possible. This is how we actively create trust between actors inside the digital space – one of the basic principles of Jolocom.</p>



<p>The idea behind ID-Ideal is to create a basis for existing and future identity services. To achieve this, interoperability between the individual ecosystems is necessary. For this reason, the project mainly focuses on key aspects:</p>



<p>A) Trust Framework: harmonize various ID services and create standards for secure digital identities</p>



<p>B) High relevance to everyday life and very good usability to increase the incentive</p>



<p>C) Establishing a TrustNest initiative: an open community that promotes certification, exchange, and further development</p>

On-Chain Activity   121 total dApps on MainNet as of November 15th,&nbsp;2021.  6,817,107 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 4,275 from last&nbsp;week.  16,707,199 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 32,714 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   1,843 new members joined our global community this week. The active community has attracted a large number of new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-andrey-80675a5e6d85">Andrey Sher</a> from our Russian community said that Ontology has made progress in the Web3 field and created a unique decentralized identity solution. He hopes to help more community members learn about privacy protection through Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1458879704304283653?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on “Let NFT return to the public.”; with the emergence of more and more DeFi+NFT projects, Ontology’s DID solution and OScore provide them with a solution for identity verification. Through on-chain and off-chain data, users will have accurate identity and reputation information to trade NFTs with each&nbsp;other.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/DeIDSummit/status/1458464473170251783?s=20">DeID Summit</a>: Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, invited Charles Wayn, co-founder of Project Galaxy, to discuss “NFTs as a service infrastructure”. Charles said: Project Galaxy is providing services related to on-chain certificates (NFTs) for communities and enterprises. These certificates (NFTs) contain a lot of user data and provide users with credibility in the&nbsp;network.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1457981281883627525?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Astro, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s upcoming 4th anniversary NFT event; community members provided many novel ideas for this&nbsp;program.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>VentureBeat — <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/06/decentralization-may-be-key-to-protecting-our-digital-identities/">Decentralization may be key to protecting our digital identities</a></p><blockquote>Researchers around the world are working to create alternatives to our existing digital identities through the decentralized web, or Web 3.0. These alternatives use new protocols that remove the need for intermediaries during transactions, while further democratizing the web and bringing value back to creators and participants. The goal is to enable internet users to verify their credentials without the dependence of intermediaries while managing their own identities. This will create a fair, secure, fast, and scalable new internet with a stronger focus on security and&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><p>With Ontology’s ONT ID and OScore technologies, users can manage decentralized digital identities and reputation scores. ONT ID is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about them. It protects user privacy and ensures data security, enabling trusted collaboration. Ontology uses technical means to provide trust guarantees between unfamiliar users, combines a decentralized credit system with traditional finance, has created a credit-based cross-chain decentralized asset management platform (Wing Finance), and realizes Web 3.0 peer-to-peer transactions and disintermediation.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Jolocom bringt im ID-Ideal Projekt hoheitliche Identitäten sowie SSI in eine Wallet.</p>



<p>Um Effizienz und Interoperabilität im digitalen Raum einzuführen, stellt Jolocom das Projekt ID-Ideal vor. Ausgangspunkt ist die Tatsache, dass jeder Nutzer und jede Nutzerin über 70 digitale Identitäten online verfügt.&nbsp;Wieso nicht viele Identitäten durch eine einzige, sichere digitale ID Lösung ergänzen?&nbsp;ID-Ideal ist ein Weg von vielen, eine ganzheitliche Lösung oder einen Mittelweg anzubieten, damit so viele Identitäten durch eine einzige, sichere digitale ID Lösung ergänzt werden können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ist Teil des Innovationswettbewerbs „Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” (SDI), gefördert durch das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi). Es ist eines von insgesamt vier Projekten, die es in die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase geschafft haben. Weitere Projekte sind u.a. ,,ONCE’’ und das Projekt ,,SDIKA’’. Die Jolocom GmbH bringt ihre Expertise aus der Entwicklung der selbst-souveränen Wallet in insgesamt drei Umsetzungsprojekte von sicheren Digitalen Identitäten ein. Die SDI Projekte sind besonders, weil sie Mitbewerber:innen an einen Tisch bringen, die gemeinsam an einer Lösung arbeiten. Außerdem bemühen sie sich um Interoperabilität, damit die Nutzung digitaler Nachweise eben nicht mehr ineffizient bleibt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Projekt ID-Ideal startete im Mai 2021 in die Umsetzungsphase. Dabei werden auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung berücksichtigt, mit dem klaren Ziel, zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten bereitzustellen. Bürger:innen sollen bequem von zu Hause agieren können – sei es bei der Ummeldung des Wohnsitzes, dem Antrag auf einen Kita-Platz oder andere Veränderungsmitteilungen. Die zu erarbeitende Lösung soll nicht regional bleiben, sondern eine deutschland- und europaweite Anwendung finden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Basierend auf dem sogenannten ID-Ideal Trust Framework wird die technische, rechtliche und semantische Interoperabilität von Diensten und Anwendungen geregelt. Ziel ist es, die Entstehung eines ID-Ökosystems anzuregen. Wenn viele ID-Dienste koexistieren können, wird der übergreifende Austausch digitaler Nachweise möglich. So wiederum schaffen wir aktiv Vertrauen zwischen den Akteur:innen im digitalen Raum – eines der Grundprinzipien von Jolocom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Idee hinter ID-Ideal besteht darin, eine Basis für bestehende und zukünftige Identitätsdienste bereitzustellen. Um das zu erreichen, ist Interoperabilität zwischen den einzelnen Ökosystemen nötig. Aus diesem Grund fokussiert sich das Projekt vor allem auf drei zentrale Aspekte:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A) Trust Framework: verschiedene ID-Dienste harmonisieren und Standards für sicheren Austausch von Nachweisen schaffen&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>B) Hohe Alltagsrelevanz und sehr gute Nutzbarkeit, damit der Anreiz größer wird&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>C) Aufbau einer TrustNest Initiative: eine offene Community, die Zertifizierung, Austausch und Weiterentwicklung vorantreibt&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining for a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. As you may have heard before that Sweden is one of the countries that has one of the best electronic identifications in the world. And we are going to hear specifically one of these systems, which is Freja eID.</p>
<p>So our guest today is Kristofer von Beetzen. He is the Chief Product Officer at Freja eID. He joined the company in 2012 and was part of the transformation from a technology-centric IT security company to the cloud-based user-oriented identity service that is offered with Freja eID today. Kristofer was previously working with media production and advertising, and has studied marketing at the University of Vaxjo. His interest aside from bringing Freja to the world is writing, and he has published several books and columns – among them are a crime novel and a book on poker strategy.</p>
<p>Hello, Kristofer.</p>
<p>Kristofer von Beetzen: Hello. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure, super interested in hearing about Freja eID, which a few years ago- Ubisecure started work more and more in Sweden, and then I start hearing this name Freja eID. So you will tell us for everybody how exactly this system works, this service. But please, first, we would like to hear from you a bit your personal side. Tell us about yourself, and how was your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yes. So, I started out in the industry, actually, as I said, I came from media production and advertising. I was working with this company, back then was called Verisec. And I was working with their communication and PR and so on. And they were working a lot with the traditional digital identity things like hardware tokens for banks, establishing trust on a pretty high level so that banks could migrate from bank offices to online banking. So this company was actually started already in 2002. And then they also started with some initial product development with an authentication server, and had some plans of going international with this product. So I actually went from being a consultant to the company to joining them in 2012, as a part of their expansion.</p>
<p>And along the way, we kind of figured out that the proprietary solutions, that was kind of the name of the game back then, where you had an authentication server placed in your server room, and then issuing identities from your own organisations to your customers. We saw that, particularly in Sweden, and in the Nordic countries, the use of these kind of communities, such as BankID and similar, were taking a lot of ground. And we didn’t really see this coming in other countries at the same pace and speed. So we thought that if this is the future of identity, that you have this kind of cloud service and Identity-as-a-Service, rather than having your own, each company having their own identity systems, then we can actually do something and create something in Sweden, and then take it to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So that was kind of how I came into this. And then somewhere around 2016, we started the work to focus on these Freja eID products. And then we actually transformed the whole company and change the name and so on from Verisec to Freja eID group. And now we’re totally focused on this service and sold off the legacy products that actually was in place when I started.</p>
<p>Oscar: So Verisec became Freja. And Verisec was always a Swedish company?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Oh, yes, yeah. And Verisec still exists, so the legacy part we sold is now in a new company called Verisec International. And they are still doing a lot of good things and working on those solutions that we developed back then. But we felt that we needed to focus, which is one of the hardest things when it comes, especially in this technology era where you can do almost anything and it’s tempting to do anything and everything. But we felt like we really need to focus on this Freja eID order to make it successful. Because we really felt that we had such a strong drive and we had such a strong support from users and from relying parties that this was needed. So we took the decision. And actually last year we changed the name to Freja eID Group and now we’re solely focused on the Freja eID product.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla And I guess you joined the company in a more advertising or marketing role and then you move to innovation.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, I started out as the VP Marketing and was looking after the communications and all the things related to how we established ourselves as a brand and so on. And then when we came to doing this kind of consumer-oriented product which Freja eID is, we realised, OK, we need some product management here. We need to think totally different, because our main target group is the users, not the IT security director and such, which were the previous.</p>
<p>And I was fortunate enough to have a couple of colleagues that worked as product designers in the company. And they were actually much more knowledgeable and had ideas around product management in this new evolving tech era than any of us had in the company. So as it happened, they took me to a conference in London, which was called Leading Design. And that was for the purpose of inspiring me and the management to understand how to build the company as a product and user-oriented company rather than a technology-oriented company.</p>
<p>And that’s maybe the total opposite of how it’s normally done, I guess, when the management is trying to inspire employees, here it goes the other way around. So thanks to designers, we actually realised that we need to make a shift in how we organise development, how we organise ourselves within product design, and so on. And that turned out really well. So I’m grateful for that inspiration. And now we have a totally different organisation than before.</p>
<p>And actually, at that conference, there was an American product specialist, who had – the topic of his presentation was, “Is it product or marketing? Yes.” And I think that was kind of interesting. And when you have a product that is continuously developed, you have an interaction with your users, and the product becomes what the user needs, if you see what I mean, then the kind of limits between marketing and product disappears in a way. So we have organised ourselves now as a company without a marketing director in the traditional sense. The product organisation takes care of what we’re going to develop, and the sales process of it and the marketing. So it’s one big unit doing this in a very integrated and agile way. So it’s completely different from how it was organised before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very, very interesting. Please tell us how the product or service Freja ID was created.</p>
<p>Kristofer: So we had- and it’s no secret that we saw how it grew and grew with this BankID community here in Sweden to begin with. We saw that it was almost impossible for us to sell our authentication servers, which was very successful in Latin America, in Spain, in other countries, and they were serving banking customers in the volumes of I think it was as much as 50 million users for that product.</p>
<p>And when we tried to pitch this authentication service here in Sweden, it was more or less impossible, because everyone was in the next generation. They were looking at Identity-as-a-Service and with pre-established identities, which is something that’s pretty unique, I think, for the Nordic countries, which means that we as a company, we kind of vouch for the identities. We make sure that the users come into our ecosystem into our community, we check their identities, we make all the identity checks, and document checks with the issuer, and so on. So when you have registered with Freja, then you have an electronic identity that can be reused to many places, all the way from tax authority to gambling services, to healthcare, and so on.</p>
<p>So there was no competition in this area. It was BankID, and nothing else, basically. And in all the other business areas in the world, in history where one company has taken such a dominant position that it’s more or less a monopoly, then there is room for innovation and there’s room for improvement. And to be honest, in the beginning, the most common question we’d had the first couple of years was why do we need Freja? What is Freja good for when we have BankID? And then I always answered, “Well, did you remember back in the ‘70s when we had one TV channel?” Oh, and people just like, understand that competition is something good. And what we have built over these years is something that has been differentiated a lot from BankID.</p>
<p>So, I think there’s room for a couple or two or three identities on a national scale and on a European scale, I think we will see quite a few solutions. But it’s kind of like we tried to look at it from the user perspective. And the thing with identity, and that’s a discussion that’s becoming more and more relevant now when we have the discussion of self-sovereign identities and so on, is that everything becomes related to your identity as things become digital. In one way or the other, you need to identify yourself online and in all the services that are some way digitalised, right?</p>
<p>So, we wanted to give the user back the control of this. So we wanted to create something that was both kind of met all the compliance and regulatory measurements that we could test Freja against, but also something that really was user-centric in a way that you, as a user, can really control your identity. And that was kind of the starting point rather than having an identity that is controlled by the government or controlled by your bank or someone else, open it up for the user to call the shots I would say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so please tell us how Freja eID works for an individual.</p>
<p>Kristofer: So what you do is you start to register for the service. And you do that by downloading the app. And then you register on your own, so to say. So you take a selfie, and you register your ID document, and you register your email address, and set the pin and so on. And then we make all these checks, make sure that the face is the same on the selfie as on the ID document and check the validity of the documents. And up until now, that’s kind of similar to what you see on identity verification services that are offered everywhere.</p>
<p>So, the difference is that we then bring you in safely into our database and to our community. And you can then reuse Freja to a lot of services. So currently we have, and this is mostly in Sweden, because this is where the focus has been up until now. So you have around 350 plus services that we have agreements with. And then you can use Freja to access those services by logging in or making electronic signatures. And that’s kind of what’s expected from an electronic identity.</p>
<p>But we’ve taken this one step further. So since we have the face and the selfie of the user, we have created in the app a physical ID document. So you can use Freja instead of your physical ID document in many places in Sweden. For example, when you pick up a parcel at the post, or when you go to a pharmacy and things like that.</p>
<p>Oscar: People just show it or there’s a… it has to be scanned or just shown to the person?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Well, it’s both, either you can show it and then they have the information that is the same things that’s presented in your physical ID document. But there’s also a QR code so they can scan it, and they can get the information that way. Or they can make a transaction all the way to our backend, which means that if you have a transaction that is of high value, then you make an electronic signature in a physical context, which means that they are the same level of assurance as when you do an online transaction with an electronic signature. We offer the whole range of that.</p>
<p>So, that’s kind of the starting point of what we’re doing. But we also see that there is kind of interesting way forward here. So if you think about everything that is required, in terms of KYC, in terms of digital identification, in all sorts of areas, primarily, I mean, we’re talking about payments, we’re talking about gambling, we’re talking about other regulated industries. If you have control over the digital identity ecosystem as we have, I mean in Sweden, there are BankID, and there are Freja eID. So either one of these two needs to be – you need to be connected to one of these in order to make payments, for example.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing with one of these systems is controlled by the few large banks. And then you have all the FinTech companies that’s trying to challenge these big banks, right? But the interesting thing is what happens when these FinTech companies eventually challenge the big banks, to the extent that the big banks feel threatened. And the FinTech companies are dependent on the very infrastructure that the FinTech companies need, namely, the identities.</p>
<p>So I think if you construct and build an infrastructure of identities, which is, you know, in Sweden, we’re government approved. We have now been approved by EU in the pre-registration to eIDAS from the Swedish government. If you have such an infrastructure, then you can build upon that payment services, you can build everything that actually needs this regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>And I’m not saying that we’re going to do it, but we can offer this to all these FinTech companies who don’t want to be dependent on their competitors. And I think it’s the same wherever you go in different countries, a lot of the FinTech companies are dependent on ID methods issued by the banks. So we’re building kind of a parallel infrastructure here that is open for competition in a way that the bank-controlled identities are not.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. What type of services already, you mentioned around 300, right, already services that are using? Tell me the types, just to have an idea what type of services are already using today Freja eID.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, we started out by trying to get a lot of these well-known and well-used public services such as the tax authority, the insurance authority, the unemployment agency, and healthcare services, digital healthcare services, because partly they have a big reach. Everyone in Sweden uses them at one point or another, and it’s also about credibility. So even if we’re governmentally approved, it’s so much more easy to say to the next customer, “The tax authority trusts us. Oh, so it’s pretty easy for you to trust us as well.”</p>
<p>So we have a large chunk of the public sector, its municipalities and government agencies. But now we’re kind of shifting focus towards the commercial side of things, e-commerce and payments, as I mentioned, gambling, and the whole kind of private sector. And the thing with the private sector, perhaps not the banks then but it has not been regulated. In Sweden, it became regulated with gambling that you need an eID in order to register an account and so on.</p>
<p>But for e-commerce and so on, it’s not like they have regulatory demands to have a Level of Assurance 3 identity to onboard a user. So they have been using things like Facebook and Google and things like that. But I think we’re seeing a shift now towards the benefits of having a better interaction with your users with a proper eID rather than these solutions that I mentioned.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, I would rather if – prefer my customer of an e-commerce site to use something like Freja eID as the identification definitely.</p>
<p>Kristofer: And one more thing that I mean, to comment on the e-commerce, what is happening there? I mean, if you think about if I may make an analogy of how Google was perceived in the media industry. So you had all of these big media houses all the way from New York Times to every other media outlet in the world, they were like, “OK, should we accept Google as the advertising engine, or we lose out on a big chunk of advertising money? So should we let them into our house and have them as kind of the advertising agency for our own media outlets?” And they were like “Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?” And as we’ve seen, Google has taken a huge chunk of that advertising revenue.</p>
<p>So basically, it’s Google, rather than New York Times, to take one example, that’s controlling the flow of the advertising money for their own media outlet, OK? And this is nothing new, you know about the story. But the same thing is actually happening with all these checkout companies. You have in e-commerce, you have these payment checkout companies that’s taking a big chunk, and that they’re providing a lovely and brilliant service, makes it easier for you as a customer to check out when you pay for your goods and so on. But what happens is that most users have a relation with the checkout company, not with the e-commerce operator.</p>
<p>So what happens then is that it’s the checkout company that owns the customer relation, not the e-commerce company that’s actually selling the goods. So we’re having the same thing over again, as Google had with the media outlets. It’s now happening with the checkout companies and e-commerce companies. And here, we’re saying to them, “Why would you give away your core assets, which is the relation to your users? You could offer your users to identify to your service rather than the users identifying to the checkout service.” And that’s where Freja comes in. And slowly, I think this is starting to dawn on them that if they do the same mistakes as the media outlets were doing with Google, then they might not have a long-term profitability, at least on that side.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it makes sense. Just to clarify also, can Freja eID be used outside Sweden in some way or another?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, that’s the whole concept of what we’re trying to build here. We’re focusing on Freja to build a strong position here. And we actually have already released Freja for other countries, so Finland, Norway, Denmark, and the UK. But we’re not kind of focusing there to bring in relying parties as it is today. But we have some Swedish customers who have users in these countries. So they can onboard users from different countries. And if we have some customers saying, “Ah, we actually need you to open up Poland, Germany, and France and whatever” then we can do that. And that’s just a matter of adding international ID documents and doing some testing.</p>
<p>So then when we have built this service and become stronger in Sweden, then we can take the next step. And our goal is to make this a European eID, and we very much look forward to the EU identity wallet development, because we think Freja is basically a blueprint of what they’ve been discussing, or rather, their kind of presentation of the wallet is a blueprint of Freja, I don’t know. But we’ve been around for a while. And we have this whole wallet concept. And we think it’s something that we can scale up on a European level. We’re not there yet. But I think we have a good position to do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the authentication/identification is the main service that Freja eID offers. You also mentioned signatures, you also mentioned compliance with eIDAS so tell me if there is something else that Freja eID offers right now.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah, and one thing that’s very interesting, and I was actually looking at when you, in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-iam/iam-vs-ciam/" title="Ubisecure on your webpage">Ubisecure on your webpage</a>, you describe customer identity management, and then the traditional identity management for employees as two different categories. And that’s, I totally agree on that description. And what we have done with Freja is that we have made it possible to add your own organisation eID in Freja. So if you’re an organisation and you want to issue employee identification to these employees, you can do that in the Freja ecosystem and you have the whole lifecycle management within Freja and you onboard and offboard users and so on. And you pass along whatever attributes that you as an organisation need to have in order for your employees to login to this cloud service or open doors with Freja or whatever.</p>
<p>So we’re both this consumer-oriented identity, but also this organisation identity. And that’s also really growing fast here in Sweden. Because it’s been – traditionally, it’s been a lot of either you have some kind of proprietary system for employee authentication, or you ask your users to utilise your private eID to log in to your workplace. That’s not a good idea. But it’s been the way it’s been done here because it’s easy, it’s simple for the organisation to just ask employees, “Hey, use your private eID.” And then we don’t have to worry about it.</p>
<p>So, we kind of combined these worlds. So we issue the identity. We make sure that this person, who is your employee, we have the fundamental identity verification of the individual. And on top of that you can manage your own identity lifecycle, and connect to all the services that’s in your organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us what are your plans for the future of Freja eID?</p>
<p>Kristofer: The next big thing I would say that we’re planning, and we did some test pilots around this, and that is to expand the concept of what is possible, what kind of value we can provide for our users. So if you think about an electronic identity, it’s probably one of the most used apps on your phone, at least if you have a system like we have in Sweden, where you use eID to everything. So you use your eID many times a day perhaps or at least many times a week. So then you have a trusted relation with your electronic identity. And we try to utilise that.</p>
<p>So we have a section in Freja eID, in the app, that’s called Explore. And here we present interesting services and new services that’s suitable for this particular user. And then in that way, we can offer our relying parties to connect with our users. So it becomes more of a relation where if you are searching for something and you want to have a trusted connection to that company, we can offer… well, I wouldn’t say that we would offer a search engine, but in the same way, as Google can add value by connecting an end user with a service, we can do the same thing here. And on top of that, we can actually add the KYC process and everything.</p>
<p>So let’s say you’re applying for a loan, you find within Freja that, oh, here’s the different financial companies that’s connected to Freja. And they have an offer that suits you, you can click on that. And then you can pass along your regulatory KYC, or a lot of the KYC and identity data and become a customer in a click. And that’s something that Google cannot do. And that’s something that Facebook and others cannot do either. So we kind of shortcut this user acquisition, user journey by adding KYC and having users explore and discover services via Freja eID rather than from other sources.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, and that sounds definitely very powerful. Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Kristofer: So that’s kind of what we’re developing in this moment right now. And then, when the time comes, and when we have built the strongholds here in Sweden, we’re looking to take this outside of Sweden. We were, as I mentioned, you know, pre-approved in the EU a couple of weeks ago, we’re looking at what’s happening in the UK with their certification process for electronic identities. So Europe is – it’s a big market, and that’s the next step. And we’re not really looking outside of that for now. But who knows what happens in the future?</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. So Freja eID is coming to the rest of Europe, at least for now.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yes, that’s our plan at some point. And I think it’s also a timing aspect of it. I mean, if you think about- I mean, here in Sweden, our challenge is to convince people that that OK, so there’s a new kid in town. They have BankID. But with Freja, you can have this and this and this and this, so… but you have an incumbent that you’re trying to challenge. So that’s a challenge of its own.</p>
<p>If you go to a country like the UK, where identity is something that’s perhaps a bit you know, they don’t have identity cards in the same way, they don’t have a personal identifier as we have in the Nordic countries. So, a totally different challenge to convince someone from England to start using an electronic identity everywhere and trust that. It’s totally different challenges. I think the analogy with streaming music a lot. Spotify was obviously also a Swedish company. And it took a while for them to convince the world that streaming music was better than alternatives. And there are still people don’t think, they’d find the records on CD or pay by song or whatever is a better solution. But I think streaming music, and that’s pretty obvious maybe. But a few years ago, it wasn’t that obvious that streaming music would be the answer to that particular industry challenge.</p>
<p>And I think it’s also pretty obvious to see, at least if you look in the Nordic countries, an electronic identity of the sort that we have here in the Nordics, I think that would be the norm in the rest of the world. But that will take time. It will take time before this spreads and you have to fit all the – before even countries have frameworks that you can get compliance against, it will take time. So I don’t really feel the stress in that regard. I think time is on our side in this case.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but I’m sure that you will come definitely. Kristofer, to finalise, could you leave us with one idea for all business leaders who are listening to this conversation, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Kristofer: Yeah. And that would be to see identity as a core asset. And if you leave that asset in the hands of the banks, or if you leave that asset in the hands of checkout companies, or anyone else that controls your main relation to your users, I think you will have a brutal wake up down the line. And there are not many providers of this open solution that Freja is, but I think that is the future because users do want to control their identities. And they can do it in a direct relation with your company. And I think you will benefit from that on the long-term, even if it’s perhaps easier in the short-term to take the solutions available today. But then you lock yourself into something that will be very difficult to get out of in the long run.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Kristofer, could you tell us for the ones who like to follow the conversation with you, what are the best way to find you on the net?</p>
<p>Kristofer: First of all, if you have any direct questions, you can write to info@frejaeid.com and I’ll respond to that email address. And you can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kvonbeetzen">Twitter</a> and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristofervonbeetzen/">LinkedIn</a>, search my name Kristofer von Beetzen and hopefully I’ll pop up in that search and just connect and I’ll be happy to continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Thanks a lot. Again, it was a pleasure talking with you, Kristofer. And all the best.</p>
<p>Kristofer: Thank you so much.</p>

In fact, any application that requires a digital identity and authentication is a good fit for SSI. Here are some <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> that our Hackathon participants developed using our tech&nbsp;stack.</p> Compute the Cost of Development <p>The next step is to estimate the overall cost of development.</p><p>To do this, you must come up with a high-level technical architecture of your solution, so you can determine the resources you’ll need for its development, and also estimate the duration by which it will be ready. Based on these estimates, determine the overall cost of development.</p><p>Armed with the technical architecture and budget, you can convince the stakeholders to buy into your use&nbsp;case.</p> Expand your Architecture Diagram <p>Once you have the buy-in, it’s time to work towards developing a pilot solution.</p><p>Start with your architecture and build on it. Break it down into small modules and create architecture diagrams for each&nbsp;module.</p><p>Also, design the business flow for your system, so there’s high-level visibility into your system’s architecture and functionality.</p> Build a VC&nbsp;Schema <p>Next, come up with the different types of VC schemas your application would&nbsp;need.</p><p>Browse through our <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-vc-generator-app-and-how-to-leverage-it-4fa5a54844f2">VC-Generator app</a> to get an idea of what schemas you’ll need for your application and make a list accordingly.</p><p>Once you have the list, it’s time to build the different VC schemas using our <a href="https://ui.schema.affinidi.com/schemas">Schema Manager</a>. You can use the Schema Manager to build new schemas or to reuse the existing&nbsp;ones.</p> Seed Verifiable Data <p>With the schemas in place, it’s time to start seeding the schemas with verifiable data.</p><p>You can seed the digital identity of the issuers and verifiers to anchor them and give control of their respective <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. Next, generate the metadata of both the parties of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust triangle</a> and establish the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public key</a> of the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Build the Issuance&nbsp;Tool <p>Now, it’s time to build the issuance tool based on the type of issuances in your proposed application.</p><p>The type of issuance will depend to a large extent on whether you are building a generic portal, an on-prem app, API, or a plugin for an existing&nbsp;tool.</p> Build or Integrate the Edge Agent and&nbsp;Storage <p>Your next step is to build or integrate both the edge agent and the&nbsp;storage.</p><p>The edge agent can be a white-label web or mobile wallet that your end customer already uses. For new users, consider/recommend Affinidi’s web and mobile wallet as it can be easily integrated with the rest of your application.</p><p>You can use the Affinidi vault for&nbsp;storage.</p> Create the Verification Tool <p>With the credentials ready, you need a way to verify&nbsp;them.</p><p>For this, build a verification tool using a generic portal, a gateway API, or an SDK, as required.</p> Build the UI for Presentation and&nbsp;Exchange <p>Next, create a visually appealing and intuitive UI for information exchange.</p><p>If you’re using an API for verification, you may want to create an API for this presentation exchange.</p><p>In both cases, you may want to create a protocol for verifiers to request a verifiable presentation or a partial VC (in the case of selective disclosure) from the&nbsp;holder.</p> Create the Issuer/Verifier Registry <p>Finally, build a verifier or issuer registry along with tools to edit&nbsp;them.</p><p>As a part of this tool, you must generate an entity VC, which is a VC that authorizes an issuer to issue certain types of VCs. You can also work on publishing the metadata in this&nbsp;stage.</p><p>With this, you have built a pilot solution for your SSI application.</p> Do a Test&nbsp;Run <p>It’s now time to do a test run of your application. Make sure your application issues VCs and stores them in the holder’s wallet. It should also enable the holder to create a verifiable presentation and share it with a verifier when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Collect and analyze the report of your test runs and present them to the stakeholders involved.</p><p>Based on the reports and test runs, make the necessary changes to your application to ensure that it meets your business goals. Test the application iteratively to ensure that it works the way you&nbsp;want.</p> Deploy in Production <p>After making the necessary changes, deploy it in production. Add <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">VC revocation</a> capabilities if you have not done it&nbsp;already.</p> Maintain and&nbsp;Scale <p>Lastly, stay on top of the usage analytics and create a commercial model that will generate revenue for you. Continuously monitor user behavior and make the necessary updates to your&nbsp;product.</p><p>Once you have scaled the application, think about opening the ecosystem and creating a marketplace around&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus, this is the journey of an SSI developer using Affinidi’s <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api">tech&nbsp;stack</a>.</p> Example Use&nbsp;Case <p>To understand this journey, let’s take our <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">driving license</a>&nbsp;example.</p><p>To build an app that issues, stores, and verifies the driving license verifiable credential, you&nbsp;must,</p>  Know the concepts of VCs and the advantages of building a VC-based application.  Identify a use-case. For example, you can integrate this driver’s license VC with an auto insurance app to determine the yearly premium of the&nbsp;holder.  Calculate the cost of development including the time and resources required.  Create an architecture diagram of the implementation and include its integration with the wider use-case, which in this example, can be the premium computation app.  <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">This article</a> contains the technical implementation using Affinidi’s tech&nbsp;stack.  Next, build the UI for presentation, create a registry, and do a test&nbsp;run.  Based on the test results, make changes if needed, and deploy it in production.  <p>We hope this use-case gives you an idea of the developer journey and where you are in it, and we look forward to seeing your SSI apps built using our tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Please reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> if you have any questions, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

<p>I am saddened today to learn that MX co-founder and CTO Brandon Dewitt passed away after a five-year battle with cancer. I’ve always enjoyed competing in the marketplace, but I’ve enjoyed the people much more. At Finicity, we have known Brandon for a long time. We enjoyed talking with him about his unique entrepreneurial ideas and passion for helping others through financial inclusion.</p>
<p>His role as a member of the Silicon Slopes community and his impact, not only on MX but on emerging founders and startups, truly shows how much he cared about others. He was well-known for his love of the MX team and their goals and dreams. Brandon clearly demonstrated a desire to help people easily understand and manage their finances so they could meet their goals and focus on the important things in life. We also now see that he modeled perseverance, determination and an example of helping others all while he was in his own major battle.</p>
<p>As he said,<a href="https://www.utahbusiness.com/how-brandon-dewitt-co-founded-mx/"> “I feel it’s crucial that those in a position of experience and success turn around and pay it forward to those who are just starting out―just like we all once were.”</a></p>

 GiD Report#186 — What is&nbsp;web3? <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/market-stuff-185-what-the-future-of-identity-looks-like-c96c62550db3">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  What is&nbsp;web3?  This week in&nbsp;web2  The problem with inflation  Stuff happens   1. What is&nbsp;web3? <p>You’ve likely seen the term web3 or Web 3.0 bandied about lately. There’s plenty of chatter about the next chapter of the internet, but what exactly is&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50">Chris Dixon on&nbsp;web1</a>:</p><blockquote>The internet, I think, has kind of had four important, distinct phases. There was web1 — this explosion of stuff in the nineties — and the key feature there was that it was governed by open protocols, and because they were open protocols, Sergei and Larry and other entrepreneurs — all the main names, Pierre Omidyar’s eBay, Google, Amazon — they could build internet services that they would truly own and control that no one could rug pull them the way you get rug pulled on a platform like the iPhone or on Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>That first wave, those applications were what I call skeuomorphic. They took things that were from the offline world, like magazines, and put them on the internet. It’s a lot of websites where we were just reading&nbsp;stuff.</blockquote><p>Then came&nbsp;web2:</p><blockquote>Then there was this next period of the 2000s, where a new wave of entrepreneurs came along and they said, wait a second. No, these are computers. You can read and write and put code and do all sorts of other things. During this early phase, you had — you probably never heard of them — things like Flickr and Delicious and the whole six degrees early social networking — people were building the early primitives and the early ideas. Then you had Mark Zuckerburg and Ev Williams and Jack Dorsey and other people take those and package them up really beautifully. And boom, that was web2. Then web2 got accelerated by mobile, which was another layer of interesting stuff that happened on&nbsp;top.</blockquote><p>Web2 peaking and consolidating — and transitioning to&nbsp;web3:</p>Web2 is like TV in the 70s according to Chris Dixon. Photo:&nbsp;asbe<blockquote>Then we had a period of incumbent domination between 2012 and 2020 with Apple and Google, etc. These companies get bigger and bigger, and the internet is now at a precarious point where it could turn into TV where you have four channels like CBS and NBC — like TV in the&nbsp;70s.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s the great cause that we’re all fighting for here — to keep the internet open and interesting and not like that. But then you had this counter-trend that began to develop, obviously originally with Satishi, and then very importantly with Vitalik and Ethereum. That’s led to this explosion of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>“These companies get bigger and bigger, and the internet is now at a precarious point where it could turn into TV where you have four channels like CBS and NBC — like TV in the&nbsp;70s.”</blockquote><p>The beginning of&nbsp;web3:</p><blockquote>I think we could be in that moment, that golden period moment that I remember very much in mobile. I was there — we knew mobile was a big deal, but it’s very hard to know when you’re in the process. Is it linear, exponential? Because you’re sitting on one point, and you don’t really know how fast it’s&nbsp;going.</blockquote><blockquote>A big part is having credibly neutral platforms upon which to build. If you build an application on top of Ethereum — whether it be a game or an NFT experience or a DeFi protocol — you do not have to worry about the protocol deciding to kick you off later or charge you 30% of your take rate or whatever. So you can invest and spend your life as an entrepreneur betting on that platform and building around it in the same way as in web1 — you knew that you could do that around HTTP and&nbsp;SMTP.</blockquote><blockquote>The inherent problems of&nbsp;web2:</blockquote><blockquote>A very formative moment in my experience — I don’t know if you were both in tech then — was the Facebook/Twitter API massacre. Essentially, there was this huge wave of people that built startups on Facebook and Twitter and they were all just summarily shut off. I had a lot of friends who had startups that were built on the Twitter API. Twitter was an ecosystem. It was a developer platform for many years. Yes, it had users using it directly, but it actually didn’t even have an app for a long time. It was all third-party apps, and those were all companies, and there were people who’d spent their lives on it. I don’t blame Twitter. I’m friends with a lot of these people at these web2 companies. I don’t think they have ill intent. I think the problem is the&nbsp;model.</blockquote><blockquote>Like I like to say, in web3, it’s “can’t be evil.” In web2, it’s “don’t be evil.” So with web2, you’re depending on the good intentions of the founders and part of its architecture. You don’t have a blockchain; you don’t have code that locks them into it. If you build on Ethereum, the code is locking you into certain commitments. If you build a smart contract, it’s there — it’s immutable like everything else. Maybe if you’re an ultra-founder, Jack Dorsey or something, you can resist this, but for almost everybody else, you ultimately report to shareholders and those shareholders want you to maximize profits. That, I believe, is fundamentally inconsistent with maximizing the health of the networks built on&nbsp;top.</blockquote><blockquote>I think that corporations and networks are fundamentally misaligned. A corporation is going to want to grab more and more of the money and close off the network when what the people in the network want is openness and low take rates and open permissionless access. Those two things are fundamentally misaligned in the last 10 years. We’ve seen how that misalignment playsout. A lot of the reason people are unhappy on these networks is that they feel this viscerally.</blockquote><blockquote>A lot of these creators who were early to build YouTube up are now at the whims of the algorithm, at the whims of the company. The company gets to monetize, get the take rates changed, and the creators feel that viscerally. They were part of this network creation, and they should have been part of the governance and economics of the&nbsp;network.</blockquote><blockquote>But they&nbsp;aren’t.</blockquote><p>Check out Dixon’s full chat — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50">5 Mental Models for Web&nbsp;3.0</a>.</p><p>Or an edited, truncated version (16 min.) from GEOPOP — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DYjN6nZFU0">What is Web&nbsp;3.0?</a></p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50&amp;amp;t=0s">90–5 Mental Models for Web3 | Chris&nbsp;Dixon</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DYjN6nZFU0">What is Web 3.0? | Chris&nbsp;Dixon</a>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value">How NFTs Create&nbsp;Value</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/microsofts-blockchain-director-major-brands-embracing-nfts-will-drive-mainstream-adoption/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Microsoft’s Blockchain Director: Major Brands Embracing NFTs Will Drive Mainstream Adoption — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/microsoft-and-the-metaverse/">Microsoft and the Metaverse</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/reddit-co-founder-solana-ventures-launch-50m-fund-for-web3-social-media/">Reddit Co-Founder, Solana Ventures Launch $100M Initiative for Web 3 Social&nbsp;Media</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/the-world-s-largest-record-company-is-creating-an-nft-super-group">The World’s Largest Record Company Is Creating an NFT Super&nbsp;Group</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/pstav">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/123572/coinbase-launches-its-wallet-as-a-standalone-browser-extension">Coinbase launches its wallet as a standalone browser extension</a>   2.

The problem with inflation <p>The other topic that’s getting plenty of chatter is inflation. Is it transitory, having shocked out supply chains after the pandemic shut down the economy? Or is it our comeuppance for printing so much money since&nbsp;2008?</p><p>We’ve seen asset values — from real estate to equities to crypto — explode in price in a period of extremely easy money. Rising inflation will put a quick end to that story. With the Fed planning beginning to taper its buying program and looking to raise rates multiple times next year, the pendulum is starting to swing the other&nbsp;way.</p><p>(And just how much DeFi-fueled leverage is in the crypto space when a big correction comes?)</p><p>Anyway, we’re not here to make predictions. Instead, we have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inflation-wealth-ray-dalio/">Ray Dalio break down the fundamentals inflation, wealth, and power</a> (in the context of big&nbsp;cycles):</p><blockquote>Yesterday’s inflation report showed inflation raging so you are now seeing inflation erode your wealth. That is no surprise. At this time 1) the government is printing a lot more money, 2) people are getting a lot more money, and 3) that is producing a lot more buying that is producing a lot more inflation. Some people make the mistake of thinking that they are getting richer because they are seeing their assets go up in price without seeing how their buying power is being eroded. The ones most hurt are those who have their money in&nbsp;cash.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Here are the key principles to keep in&nbsp;mind:</blockquote><blockquote>Wealth = Buying&nbsp;Power</blockquote><blockquote>Wealth ≠ Financial Wealth</blockquote><blockquote>Making Wealth = Being Productive</blockquote><blockquote>Wealth Decline = Power&nbsp;Decline</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The United States now is spending a lot more money than it’s earning and paying for it by printing money that is being devalued. To improve we have to raise productivity and cooperation. Right now we are on the wrong&nbsp;path.</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inflation-wealth-ray-dalio/">his full post&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/dollar-climbs-us-inflation-surge-fuels-rate-hike-speculation-2021-11-10/">Dollar climbs as U.S. inflation surge fuels rate hike speculation</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/the-first-fed-rate-hike-is-now-expected-as-early-as-july-following-the-hot-cpi-data.html">The first Fed rate hike is now expected as early as July following the hot CPI&nbsp;data</a>  Ray Dalio: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/inflation-wealth-ray-dalio/">On Inflation and&nbsp;Wealth</a>  An extra surreal Money Stuff: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-09/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-doing-fraud-on-securities-fraud">Doing Fraud on Securities Fraud</a>  <a href="https://civicscience.com/crypto-is-creating-newfound-wealth-and-job-freedom-for-many-americans/">Crypto is Creating Newfound Wealth — and Job Freedom — for Many Americans — CivicScience</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/11/miami-to-give-bitcoin-yield-from-miamicoin-to-its-citizens/">Miami to Give ‘Bitcoin Yield’ From MiamiCoin to Its&nbsp;Citizens</a>  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-mayor-elect-wants-kids-to-learn-crypto-in-school-2021-11">New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams says schools should teach about cryptocurrency</a>   4.

Choosing the best workforce SSO solution depends on your IT environment and user base. Some SSO solutions control authentication for users accessing resources from desktops in a single security domain. Others provide universal SSO across complex hybrid environments that include legacy on-premises, cloud-based and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. There are also SSO solutions capable of acting as an authentication authority across multiple identity types and broad use cases from cloud to on-premises. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Shyft Network Core Team Open Sources Veriscope, prepares to enable cross solution discovery to Make Travel Rule Compliance Open, Free, and Simpler than&nbsp;Ever  Following the FATF’s latest regulatory guidance, we’re making our decentralized compliance framework including dashboards, admin tooling, and Shyft Attestation architecture completely free and available for anyone to&nbsp;use. <p>In August, <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> announced <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, the first public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel rule. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf">In collaboration with some of the world’s top cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Deribit, Bitfinex, BitMEX, Tether, and Huobi</a>, Veriscope provides a decentralized compliance web framework and a smart contract platform for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to enable travel rule compliance. Veriscope meets the growing demands of the rising regulatory efforts that have commanded attention and action across cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, and many other elements of blockchain.</p><p>Now, two months later, following exchanges collectively initiating the phased deployment of Veriscope on the Shyft Network, we’re proud to share that we will be open-sourcing Veriscope. This deployment makes Veriscope available for free, so that any project can connect to the Veriscope Network and the Shyft Attestation architecture.</p><blockquote>See Open Source Repo equipped with dashboard’s and setup guides here: <a href="https://github.com/shyftnetwork/veriscope">https://github.com/shyftnetwork/veriscope</a></blockquote><blockquote>Screenshot demo’s for the Front end web framework can be found here: <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/vasp-demo/">https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/vasp-demo/</a></blockquote><p>As early adopters of crypto, we at Shyft Core believe that it’s essential that the sector maintains openness. We also believe that compliance should not have to force the ecosystem to rebuild the existing financial system &amp; risk user safety. To maintain decentralization, we need to promote open-source software to solve new regulatory challenges. Veriscope is that solution — and it’s ready for the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Shyft Network acts as layer 0 to travel rule aggregators, protocols, and data transmission services &amp; the Veriscope framework provides an open system for anyone to leverage to enhance security guarantees, universalize the discovery and coordination processes required for cross entity data transmission, and dashboards to manage all travel rule&nbsp;data.</p><p>We built this system to ensure that any entity can maintain the highest level of data security, while also enabling automated discovery across any crypto transactions.</p> FATF: Explained <p>In February of 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released guidance designed to mitigate risks around virtual assets. In section 7B of the guidance, the FATF recommends the application of the Travel Rule to virtual assets. This rule requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), such as cryptocurrency exchanges, custodial wallets, and OTC desks to share sender and receiver information ahead of processing inter-VASP transactions on behalf of&nbsp;users.</p><p>FATF helps address Anti-Money Laundering (AML), a set of policies and guidelines laid out in every country’s framework to fight black money and counter terrorist financing.</p><p>As a result, it promotes KYC (Know Your Customer), a tool that acts as the first line of defense to support AML. In its most general sense, KYC is a questionnaire wherein the customer is asked certain questions and required to share personal data which is used for identification and verification purposes. Data commonly shared includes: name, address, and employment details,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Suppose you’re a business, crypto exchange, governmental body, or consumer who engages with crypto or the exchange of virtual assets. In that case, it’s critical you know and understand the FATF Travel Rule — and the nuances of compliance, so that KYC can be upheld. Recent FATF guidance from back in March requires those who shepherd the transfer of assets, including cryptocurrency, to share data from senders and receivers. FATF deems these exchanges as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Shyft Network is the first platform to create technology (Veriscope) that enables VASPs to seamlessly comply with FATF rules, partnering with ten of the top crypto exchanges to implement an industry-wide solution using our database bridging and data attestation infrastructure.</p> Why Is an Open Source Veriscope So Important? <p>Following <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html">FATF’s guidance in March of 2021</a>, the Versicope governance team participated in a consultation where we <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-day-the-veriscope-secretariat-responded-to-the-fatf-ab37957746b3">provided comments</a> to their proposed guidance, a decision we made because we understand the value and opportunity we have to act as a bridge between governing bodies like FATF and crypto at large. FATF released their <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/28/fatf-crypto-guidance-looks-to-bring-industry-in-line-with-banks/">latest guidance</a> on October 28, 2021, an eagerly-awaited moment that we shared feedback on in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1453743155505991686">a Twitter thread</a> and will create regulatory situations that open-sourcing Veriscope will help&nbsp;solve.</p><p>From the definition of stablecoins to whether NFTs are VA (Virtual Assets) and therefore subject to regulation, FATF’s guidance will inevitably impact how users of the blockchain ecosystem will function moving forward, especially when considering the nuances of how we define different sectors and their function. Veriscope gives businesses and users the infrastructure to keep up with changes and optimize their actions, regardless of the size of their operation.</p><p>Open source Veriscope allows VASPs large and small to utilize its infrastructure to onboard, write, send and receive regulatory data sets over Shyft Network. This update allows for unlimited extensions, such as third-party tools and apps, into the system, including monitoring and analytical tools with aggregation to be embedded and utilizable. Veriscope’s infrastructure can also be repurposed and extended by any other teams who would like to use it for their internal dashboarding requirements — and they will be able to do this quickly; admin tools and setup scripts make implementation possible in less than a&nbsp;day.</p><p>Taking an open-source approach to building a solution for FATF is essential if we’re to ensure that we don’t gate keep systems that should remain inherently open for everyone. Shyft Network took the dated approach of many closed source companies and flipped the script (and code) to provide front ends and web frameworks for free to anyone who wants to use them. This architecture allows people to specifically implement aggregation services for the Travel Rule and enable entirely new systems to be built using the Shyft Core attestation architecture and discovery layer.</p><p>This is only the beginning of a much larger set of products and services that will span other verticals across the industry utilizing this open source infrastructure and framework.</p><p>By open sourcing Versicope, Shyft Network is democratizing Travel Rule compliance for a varied set of businesses, exchanges, technologies, and their communities. We know that together crypto is stronger and that if mainstream adoption of blockchain is to become reality, we must evolve so that institutions, exchanges, and individuals can function together and comply with any incoming regulation.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shift Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a></p>

<p>A softer, gentler DAO that gives more space and freedom for experimentation</p> 1. Overview <p>OceanDAO’s social layer is getting developed further, as part of a broader shift to embrace and leverage the growing number of participants inside the Ocean Ecosystem. Specifically: we are introducing OceanDAO Working Groups (WGs)&nbsp;[1].</p><p>Each WG has stewards (who’s accountable to run the group), and members (people who participate). This organizational and coordination structure is inspired <a href="https://tecommons.org/">by the Token Engineering Commons&nbsp;(TEC)</a>.</p><p>Here are the initial WGs, and their initial stewards.</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CGqLJgWKwzDlZFgA7FPmkyRaZHmorutMv-GaSroMSPw/edit?usp=sharing">Parameters &amp; Roadmap WG</a> — [Roberto, Trent]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kw4UwJHZaCf5PKvU3ONoN5nSj-r5zZAX2KJCqzJFT7M/edit?usp=sharing">Project-Guiding WG</a> — [Razvan,&nbsp;AlexN]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ouW4oxKEgyaBeiZew4bd9HFwbNUiwReK0A2Ww7jmAik/edit?usp=sharing">Core Tech WG</a> — [Trent,&nbsp;AlexC]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lV3XPqFlReB89c0cvPfbXENE2NE_-8ppQnSQxSy0ITk/edit?usp=sharing">OceanDAO Engineering WG</a> — [Roberto]  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oVtu31GcqzEWx3teHOfXIYDZN0tjuciyhtvUWzq91Xk/edit?usp=sharing">Data Consume Volume WG</a> — [Sheridan, Razvan]  <p>The Parameters &amp; Roadmap WG focuses on immediate and macro level discussions that may cover all other WGs. Most stewards should be in attendance of this WG, and we welcome everyone to&nbsp;join.</p><p>Basic WG organization:</p>  Every WG will discuss and meet openly <a href="https://discord.gg/bYEEwsnC">inside of our&nbsp;Discord</a>.  Each WG has 2 public Discord sub-channels: WG Channel, WG Voice Channel (and&nbsp;video)  Each group has its own onboarding process. It’s up to the WG to&nbsp;decide.  Each group has a 30 or 60 min call, typically weekly.  Meetings will be recorded and shared&nbsp;async.  <p>We expect more WGs to emerge over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Details on each WG can be found&nbsp;below.</p> 2. “Value Add” Rather than “ROI &gt;&nbsp;1” <p>OceanDAO’s emphasis on ROI &gt; 1 was a useful construct from a purely mechanical perspective. But in practice it focused too much on a stark, objective ROI number that could be very hard to measure. How do you measure ROI for improving documentation? Yet there is value being created. Projects shouldn’t need a business orientation.</p><p>So we have shifted OceanDAO focus away from “ROI &gt; 1”, and towards “value add” with a larger emphasis on community. It’s a softer, gentler DAO that gives more space and freedom for experimentation.</p><p>To reflect this shift, here is an updated criteria for projects around “value add” and community.</p><p>Project Criteria</p><p>Ways that a team might add&nbsp;value:</p>  Usage of Ocean — how well might the project drive usage of&nbsp;Ocean?  Viability — what is the chance of success of the&nbsp;project?  Community active-ness — how active is the team in the community?  Adding value to the overall community — how well does the outcome of the project add value to the Ocean community / ecosystem?  <p>This is a short list, on purpose. It balances tech &amp; viability, with community.</p> 3. Details on Each&nbsp;WG  3.1 Parameters &amp; Roadmap&nbsp;WG <p>Mission: Decide each funding round’s parameters (short term), and update <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18CL5YTJ2-WLQPwq755omqw1AF9ekW1DP_RHyf3V3IHw/edit#slide=id.ge7dbc14a25_0_0">roadmap</a> (med term). Overall, to improve the funding process for projects getting funding from OceanDAO.</p><p>Criteria include “feeling of safety” for teams, promoting community, and more. (Details&nbsp;below)</p><p>Stewards: Roberto Alcantara, Trent McConaghy</p><p>Meetings: Tuesdays 10.00 ET, 16.00 CET, 17.00 EET (60&nbsp;min)</p><p>Criteria on this WG’s Decision-Making</p>  Promote “feeling of safety” for&nbsp;teams  Promote community  Increase # voters, and quality of voter decision-making  Increase # projects, and value-add of projects (ref project criteria)  Increase OceanDAO (including WGs) transparency, visibility, openness  Identify ways for OceanDAO to scale&nbsp;further   3.2 Project-Guiding WG <p>Mission: To help guide OceanDAO grant proposers and recipients to add value via: discussions, project assessments, ways to leverage the network, and candid feedback. In turn, we hope that a decentralized review and guidance process may lead to many teams that are more effective, as a key part of growing the Ocean ecosystem. The project-guiding WG should help promote a “feeling of safety” for teams. Not gatekeepers.</p><p>Stewards: Razvan Olteanu, Alex&nbsp;Napheys</p><p>Meetings: Mondays 10.00 ET, 16.00 CET, 17.00&nbsp;EET</p><p>(plus meetings with individual teams by members of&nbsp;WG)</p> 3.3 Core Tech&nbsp;WG <p>Mission: Steward community initiatives towards high-impact technical outcomes. Near-term mandate: for each grants round, provide 3–10 target tech projects for “earmarks”.</p><p>Stewards: Trent McConaghy, Alex&nbsp;Coseru</p><p>Meetings: Tuesdays 15.30 CET, 16.30&nbsp;EET</p><p>Responsibilities of Group: Document tech opportunities to improve Ocean product ecosystem, which can be readily done outside OPF core team. These can be improvements to core tech, integrations, or potentially apps on top. Turn top-ranking ones into earmarks and&nbsp;more.</p> 3.4 OceanDAO Engineering WG <p>Mission: To align internal and external contributors, and improve overall technical output towards OceanDAO Engineering roadmap deliverables. To help identify opportunities and solutions that deliver an efficient DAO-stack across all verticals (grants execution, funding, voting, delegation, UX, treasury management, working groups,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>Stewards: Roberto Alcantara</p><p>Meetings</p>  Every Mon, Wed, Thurs 15:45 CET, 16:45 EET (15&nbsp;min)  Every Tue 17.00 CET, 18.00 EET (60&nbsp;min)   3.5 Data Consume Volume&nbsp;WG <p>Mission: To define best practices, build processes, and increase alignment across all participants within the Ocean Ecosystem towards Data Set supply, liquidity, and most importantly Data Consume&nbsp;Volume.</p><p>Stewards: Razvan Olteanu, Sheridan&nbsp;Johns</p><p>Meetings: Every 2nd Mon 11.00 ET, 17.00 CET, 18.00 EET. First mtg is Nov 22,&nbsp;2021.</p> 4. Town&nbsp;Halls <p>We are updating our Town Hall agenda to improve the UX of every participant, and coordination around every engagement inside OceanDAO.</p><p>We will be covering: Grants Program, WGs, Deep Dives, and Dockside.</p>  The Grants Program section will talk about where we are in the funding process, provide visibility into the program, and celebrate each step of the&nbsp;way.  The WG section will have each steward present 1–3 slides that cover what each WG is up&nbsp;to.  Deep Dive will be presented by both Core &amp; DAO contributors, taking us further into their journeys and providing deep insights into their progress.  Dockside will be a period where we invite all Core &amp; DAO participants to share updates, talk about their projects, their proposals, and general updates behind their progress.  <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UEpeOi4LHk_hEbm7yrAWC0q9wWohFbKU2rCGwj54pLk/edit#slide=id.gfa4c73f874_0_53">Here is the outline</a> for our <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/WUlTDtriFqNn3alnfNbDqpraJiDWUvUlm7V3SUKSFkwe08hjT3-w7i0CwPSBRWqg45xtBv5ZsAtb56L_.fFxbyj6qLm6ybmwn?startTime=1636559892000&amp;_x_zm_rtaid=fdkNA-6SQ5CYCVo8eKmBxw.1636993387014.e7a71f4cbba1c802e26211c688a6deb5&amp;_x_zm_rhtaid=610">Nov 10, 2021 Town Hall zoom session</a> which we’ll be using into the future.

Looking&nbsp;Ahead <p>Our goal is to continue expanding DAO-first initiatives that facilitate coordination and outcomes towards key organizational pillars. Every WG is aligned with a pivotal mission that will help realize the goals of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>Working Groups have been developed around evergreen initiatives that will forever benefit from contributions. There are more WGs that are currently being considered, such as those that involve Outreach:</p>  Awareness &amp; Community  Grant Proposal &amp;&nbsp;Referral  Business Development  <p>We will continue to reflect on key organizational initiatives and how we can all benefit from increased transparency, coordination, and decentralization.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>This article introduces OceanDAO Working Groups (WGs). They are a development of OceanDAO’s social layer, as part of a broader shift to embrace and leverage the growing number of participants inside the Ocean Ecosystem.</p><p>We have shifted OceanDAO focus away from “ROI &gt; 1”, and towards “value add” with a larger emphasis on community. It’s a softer, gentler DAO that gives more space and freedom for experimentation.</p><p>There are WGs for guiding projects, parameters &amp; roadmap, engineering, and more. We invite you to join us on Discord, attend our meetings, and become a WG&nbsp;member!</p> 7.

Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the VerusID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Each VerusID on the Verus blockchain can even be used with Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS — currently on testnet) to launch a token or DeFi currency, and even an interoperable blockchain. These blockchains inherit all features as they are on the Verus blockchain.</p><p>VerusIDs can hold funds. They can be personal <a href="https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike">profiles</a>, corporate websites, or government portals. VerusIDs are much more than identities or today’s NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. And now those assets can be exchanged easily.</p><p>With the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers). If you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized on the blockchain, without any middleman or contract controller.</p><p>For total payment privacy, you can even pay or receive payment using private addresses and zero knowledge transactions based on the Zcash Sapling protocol.</p> Exchanging in&nbsp;Private <p>In addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it’s a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in&nbsp;private.</p><p>A powerful use case example: A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content.</p><p>Now imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has&nbsp;arrived.</p> Five New&nbsp;APIs <p>VerusID Marketplace introduces five new RPC APIs and CLI commands for this major upgrade: makeoffer, takeoffer, getoffers, closeoffers and listopenoffers.</p>  makeoffer: define what you offer and for what. What you offer can be funds, VerusIDs, or when PBaaS goes live even other currencies. What you want in return can also be funds, VerusIDs or currencies. In exchange for what you offer, you also define what VerusID or how much you want for it and in what currency.  takeoffer: take a specific offer in exchange for its&nbsp;request.  getoffers: specify which VerusID or currency you want to see offers for or on offer, and it returns all offers (buy and sell) in all currencies, sorted by highest to lowest&nbsp;price.  closeoffers: close expired or unexpired offers which you opened with makeoffer.  listopenoffers: list all offers that you have opened with makeoffer.   🔒 Protect Your Funds with Verus&nbsp;Vault <p>The new mainnet upgrade enables a completely new level of security and safety for all your funds. Verus Vault allows you to lock any VerusID under your control, while still using its funds to actively stake and earn on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>When you lock a VerusID, its funds can not be spent anymore. All locking and unlocking are visible on the blockchain.</p> Two Lock Mechanisms <p>You can lock a VerusID in two different ways that cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the revocation and recovery authorities together.</p>  Locked and unlocked until number of blocks passed: funds can not be spent until a predetermined number of blocks have&nbsp;passed.  Locked and unlocked with a delay: funds can not be spent until an unlock has been requested + a predetermined number of blocks have&nbsp;passed   Powerful Use&nbsp;Cases   Safe staking: put funds to stake with on a VerusID. Use Vault to lock the identity with a delay of 10,080 blocks ( ~1 week). Now whenever someone gains access to the private keys of the locked VerusID, they have to unlock the identity in order to spend the funds. When someone makes an unlock request that isn’t you, you are warned. The intruder has to wait 10,080 blocks before he can spend the funds. If you have set up revocation and recovery authorities, you now have one week to safeguard your funds away from prying hands, back into your&nbsp;control.  Trusts: setting up a trust fund for your children. Give your child a time locked VerusID with funds on them. When he or she turns 18, the VerusID unlocks and the funds can be spent. Keep revocation and recovery authorities with yourself or a&nbsp;trustee.  Vesting period: when doing a currency or chain launch, development funds can be diverted to a locked VerusID. After two years the VerusID unlocks and the funds can only be spent with signatures of other developers. You can also spread the funds across multiple identities with different unlock&nbsp;periods.  <p>These are just a few examples on how the powerful Verus Vault can be used. VerusID can store any asset on the Verus network, including those bridged from other blockchains. When PBaaS is on mainnet, the first bridged asset is Ethereum.</p> ⏰ VerusID (NFT) Marketplace and Verus Vault activate on block 1,796,400 (expected on Monday, 29 November 2021). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Update your wallets to v0.9.0</a> before the activation blockheight to ensure smooth staking, mining, and general operation.  🏆 Use VerusID (NFT) Marketplace to exchange VerusIDs publicly and privately.  🔒 Use Verus Vault to lock funds for security, vesting, trusts, inheritance, and&nbsp;more.  🔥 Visit <a href="https://verus.io">verus.io</a> for more information on&nbsp;Verus  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-vault-verusid-nft-marketplace-mainnet-upgrade-7abb5092c81b">Verus Vault &amp; VerusID (NFT) Marketplace Mainnet Upgrade</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 &nbsp; SEC Shares Views on DeFi Risks, Regulation and Opportunities  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-defi-20211109"> offered views on the status of decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) regulation in an article published in The International Journal of Blockchain Law. While DeFi has the potential to optimise transaction speed, cost, and customization, the Commissioner argues that it mimics traditional financial services offerings and products. As such, DeFi is analogous to offerings and services already under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Therefore Crenshaw expects the ecosystem to face comparable challenges to traditional financial markets. According to Crenshaw:</p> 
  
  “Unless required, there will be projects that do not invest in compliance or adequate internal controls;  
  when the potential financial rewards are great enough, some individuals will victimize others, and the likelihood of this occurring tends to increase as the likelihood of getting caught and severity of potential sanctions decrease; and  
  absent mandatory disclosure requirements, information asymmetries will likely advantage rich investors and insiders at the expense of the smallest investors and those with the least access to information.”  
  
<p>The Commissioner remarks that DeFI projects lack standards on risk disclosure and provide too little information for investors to appropriately assess risk, and she cites this as a cause for reduced investor confidence and investor participation. In the long run, the Commissioner argues that regulatory frameworks facilitate flourishing markets. Those responsible for regulating these markets are the same authorities encountered in traditional finance including the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury and the SEC. At the time of the Commissioner's statement, however, no DeFi participants have registered with the SEC. The Commission aims to increase engagement with market participants and reminds that development teams can liaise with the<a href="https://www.sec.gov/finhub"> Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology</a> to clarify their regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Commissioner Crenshaw offered a stern warning: non-compliant projects face enforcement actions. For example, in 2021,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10961.pd"> DeFi Money Market received a cease-and-desist order</a> as it offered and sold more than $30 million of securities in an unregistered offering while misleading investors on the project. Nonetheless, the SEC encourages innovators to reach out to discuss regulatory changes that can allow for DeFi innovations. As it stands, the Commissioner identified two problems that need to be addressed by the DeFi ecosystem to ensure markets are fair for all investors:</p> 
  
  Lack of transparency regarding the operational arrangements of DeFi projects: projects are often launched by professional investors which may influence the governance of the project. The statement claims that these are rarely disclosed in plain English and put retail investors at a disadvantage. More to the point, the Commissioner declared: “It is not reasonable to build a financial system that demands investors also be sophisticated interpreters of complex code.”  
  Like other blockchain-based projects, DeFi transactions are pseudonymous: although transactions are public and immutable, not knowing who is behind an address or transaction raises concerns of market manipulation. Indeed, trading volumes can be inflated by one entity transacting with itself. This hinders the ability of investors to obtain reliable information before making a decision. The Commission highlights that in traditional financial markets investors have agreed to give up some degree of privacy to benefit from regulated markets with less manipulation and fraud. The SEC expects that DeFI projects which overcome the pseudonymity hurdle are more likely to succeed.  
  
<p>The statement concludes that some DeFi projects already fit in the SEC’s jurisdiction. When this is the case, developers should comply with existing regulations. Furthermore, the SEC expects collaboration from the ecosystem to find solutions that are suited to this new technology.&nbsp; Beyond “profitability, speed of development and innovation”, the Commissioner presses developers to contribute to a financial system in which “investors have access to actionable, material data, and it should be a system that reduces the potential for manipulative conduct.”&nbsp;</p>

 &nbsp; OFAC Adds Sanctioned Entities  
<p>On November 8th 2021, the US Department of the Treasury<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0471"> announced new sanctions</a> against a cryptoasset business that was used to launder the proceeds of ransomware attacks. The Treasury estimated that ransomware payments reached $590 million during the first half of 2021. It underscored that non-compliant exchanges were increasingly targeted by cybercriminals to launder the proceeds of their crimes. To counter this threat, the Treasury sanctioned<a href="https://chatex.com/"> Chatex</a>, a Latvian cryptoasset exchange used to launder ransomware proceeds, as well as three of its partners. A further two Ukrainian individuals were added to the list as they took part in ransomware attacks which generated more than $200 million in cryptoassets. The Treasury reiterated that “financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action.” Read our coverage of last week's sanctions <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/crypto-addresses-holding-nfts-worth-532k-are-among-latest-sanctioned-by-ofac">here</a> and learn more about how Elliptic can screen your cryptoasset transactions in real-time to<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-transaction-monitoring"> limit your exposure to sanctioned entities</a>.</p>

 &nbsp; Sweden Considers Restricting Proof of Work Mining Citing Environmental Concerns  
<p>The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA) and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)<a href="https://www.fi.se/en/published/presentations/2021/crypto-assets-are-a-threat-to-the-climate-transition--energy-intensive-mining-should-be-banned/"> have concluded</a> that cryptoassets based on proof of work (POW) protocols such as Bitcoin threaten Sweden’s ability to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change. Because of the rise in the price of cryptoassets in recent weeks, blockchain encryption puzzles have become increasingly complex requiring more computing power. As a consequence, electricity demand has surged. The SFSA and SEPA mention that cryptoasset miners are increasingly relocating to the Nordic region thanks to the availability of renewable energy. However, authorities claim that this clean energy is being diverted from “essential services.” They suggest that legislators (including the European Commission) consider a tax on energy-intensive production of Bitcoin, a ban on POW mining and disclosure requirements for businesses who trade or invest in cryptoassets using this protocol. Nonetheless, the SFSA and SEPA recognise that there is a risk of encouraging relocation of businesses to less restrictive jurisdictions.</p> 
<p>As with recent regulatory announcements on the<a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2021/10/22/hmrc-to-send-nudge-letters-to-crypto-asset-investors/#:~:text=HMRC%20is%20preparing%20to%20send,from%20their%20crypto%20asset%20holdings"> tax treatment</a> and<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2021/october/jon-cunliffe-swifts-sibos-2021"> macroprudential regulation</a> of cryptoassets, this development shows that authorities are closing in on all facets of the ecosystem.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; Singapore Clarifies Approach to Cryptoassets, DeFi and Central Bank Digital Currencies  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Ravi Menon, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made a<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/the-future-of-money-finance-and-the-internet"> statement on cryptoassets, DeFi and Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> at the Singapore Fintech Festival. In his speech, he stated that MAS did not view cryptoassets as money and reminded the industry that cryptoasset businesses are subject to licensing and supervision requirements due to ML/FT risks. Nonetheless, Menon recognized the potential benefit that blockchain technology could bring to an economy and he highlighted a particular interest for cryptoassets which are backed by reserves.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His statement also addressed Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), stating that MAS sees benefits in issuing a wholesale digital currency targeted at banks to improve reserve management and transform cross-border payments. Turning to a retail CBDC (a digital Singapore Dollar available to all), he said that MAS does not see the development of a CBDC as urgent. He argued that cash would still be relevant in the foreseeable future, Singapore’s payment system is sufficiently efficient and inclusive, and substitution from the Singapore Dollar to foreign CBDCs is not presently seen as a threat. Nonetheless, Menon announced the launch of Project Orchid to work on the technical requirements needed to issue a CBDC if MAS decides to launch a retail CBDC. He also reminded participants at the meeting of a number of MAS’s initiatives including<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/mas-and-financial-industry-to-use-new-digital-platform-to-fight-money-laundering"> COSMIC</a>, a platform for financial institutions to share data relating to high risk and illicit activity using their own systems.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; UK Statement on CBDCs  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and the Bank of England (BoE) announced the next steps in the exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This follows the creation of a joint<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/april/bank-of-england-statement-on-central-bank-digital-currency"> CBDC Taskforce</a> by HMT and BoE in April 2021. In 2022, both agencies will launch a public consultation to assess the merits and implications of a CBDC as well as starting high level design planning. HMT and BoE note that no decision has been made on the introduction of a CBDC in the UK. If regulators chose to develop a CBDC following their 2022 consultation, the announcement suggests that it would launch during the second half of the decade at the earliest. Spokespersons from HMT and the BoE stated they were looking forward to an open discussion on this topic with all stakeholders.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">Private Key JWT flow</a> is one of the more complicated OIDC flows to set up. At Okta, it’s commonly used to get OAuth4Okta access tokens which enable you to perform managementr tasks on your org. If you already know HOW it works and just want to get to the code, <a>click here</a> to skip ahead. If you’re looking to gain a better understanding of how it works, here’s a high level explanation:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you’ve obtained the access token from this flow, you can throw it into the Authorization header of requests to your Okta APIs:</p>

<p></p>

<p>But let’s break it down a bit more:</p>

 Step 1: Generate keypair 

<p>Typically, one may think of JWTs as strictly being in the realm of the identity provider (IdP) - and in most cases that’s correct. When an IdP grants tokens to a service provider (SP), it is signing those tokens with a private/secret key. Part of the responsibility of the SP when validating tokens is to use a public key provided by the IdP to verify the signature.</p>

<p>The Private Key JWT flow flips this on its head - at least at the start. It’s now the SP’s turn to generate a public/private keypair, share the public key with the IdP (more on that in Step 2), create a JWT, and sign it with their private key (more on that in Step 3).</p>

<p>But I digress…Step 1 is really just about generating the keypair. (In this case, RSA keys with a 2048-bit key size).</p>

 Step 2: Register public key 

<p>The next step is registering your public key with the IdP. With Okta, that’s done through our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oauth-clients/#register-new-client">clients</a> API. With this step, Okta will create an application integration and generate a unique client ID - this value will be important when it comes time to create the Private Key JWT. It will be this client ID as well as the working public key decryption that validates your request.</p>

<p>In other flows like the popular <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main">Authorization Code</a> flow, the identity provider generates a secret value called the client secret. In the Private Key JWT flow, the burden is on the service provider to generate a secret value for the same purpose - albeit by different means.</p>

 Step 3: Get access token 

<p>There are two components to this step (creating the private key JWT and then submitting it to the IdP to obtain an access token), but the Python command <code>get_access_token.py</code> performs both at once so we can treat this as a single operation.</p>

<p>Using the private key created in step 1, you sign a JWT with the following <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/create-sign-jwt/">claims</a>:</p>

   <code>'iss': {client ID generated in step 2},
'sub': {client ID generated in step 2},
'aud': {okta_url}/oauth2/v1/token,
"exp": {epoch expiration at future time}
</code>   

<p>This token is sent to the /token endpoint of the IdP:</p>

   <code>  POST /token HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  grant_type=client_credentials&amp;
    scope={scopes}&amp;
    client_id={client ID generated in step 2}&amp;
    client_assertion_type=
    urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&amp;
    client_assertion={private key JWT}
</code>   

<p>Assuming everything is set up correctly, the IdP should respond with an access token that you can use to access scoped resources.</p>

<p>For an even deeper look at this flow, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/overview/">check out our walkthrough</a>. For now, it’s time to set this up with Python!</p>

 Python private key JWT setup 

 
   Clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-private-key-jwt-python-example">OktaDev Private Key repo</a>, open terminal, and <code>cd</code> into the project root. 
   Create a new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtualenv</a> in the root folder with <code>virtualenv env</code>. 
   Run the virtual environment with <code>source env/bin/activate</code>. 
   Install necessary Python packages with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. 
   In the root folder, create a new <code>.env</code> file and paste the following values into it: 
 

   <code>PRIVATE_KEY=
PUBLIC_KEY=
MODULUS=
CLIENT_ID=
OKTA_URL=
API_KEY=
SCOPES=
</code>   

<p>Scripts will generate values for the first 4 vars once you’ve run the first two commands. You will need to fill out the other values. Note: the API key is needed for creating the OAuth client in Okta, so make sure the token you use has permissions to create applications.</p>

 
   OKTA_URL=https://{your_okta_domain} 
   API_KEY={okta_api_key} 
   SCOPES=’okta.users.read okta.users.manage’ 
 

<p>The SCOPES var is an string of scopes (seperated by spaces) granted to your eventual access token that you will be using for management tasks. I put in a couple common ones as a placeholder. In your Okta application, it would look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Running the scripts 

<p>To run these scripts, make sure you are still in the root folder of the cloned repository.</p>

 Step 1: Generate keypair 

<p>Run the following command in terminal:</p>

   <code>python generate_keys.py
</code>   

<p>You should see confirmation printed to the terminal:</p>

   <code>///////////////// Keys generated and added to .env file.
</code>   

<p>Sure enough, you can pop over to the .env file to see the <code>PRIVATE_KEY</code>, <code>PUBLIC_KEY</code> and <code>MODULUS</code> values populated there.</p>

 Step 2: Create OAuth service app in Okta 

<p>Now that you have the keypair, you can create the OAuth app in Okta with the public key. The scopes you defined in the .env file will also be granted in the application. Type the following into the terminal:</p>

   <code>python create_okta_service_app.py
</code>   

<p>You will get confirmation in the terminal of the created app, that the client ID of the app was updated in your .env file, as well as scopes granted.</p>

   <code>///////////////// Okta Service app created: 

{application object}

///////////////// Setting CLIENT_ID in .env:

{client ID of newly created app}

///////////////// Scopes granted: 

{scopes granted to the application}
</code>   

<p>If you navigate to your applications in Okta, you will see this newly created app under the name Private Key JWT Service App.</p>

 Step 3: Create PKJ and get access token 

<p>The two scripts above should only need to run once for setup. From hereon out, you can run the following command to get an access token from Okta:</p>

   <code>python get_access_token.py
</code>   

<p>You should see the access token printed to terminal:</p>

   <code>///////////////// Access Token:

{access_token}
</code>   

<p>You can now use this token to perform management tasks on your Okta org based on your defined scopes by passing it in the Authorization header as Bearer {access_token}.</p>

 In conclusion: Keep it secret, keep it safe 

<p>The Private Key JWT flow is complicated to set up, but once the pieces are in place it should be pretty automated. As always, the private key is the key to the castle. So…</p>

<p>The past few Holochain releases have focused on both increasing resilience and adding features for developers.</p><p>One task is particularly important, even though you’ll probably never see or experience it — and in fact, its invisibility will be the proof of its success. Right now, the core dev team is doing extensive sharding tests, tuning parameters, adjusting the algorithm, and testing again. Currently, they’re investigating how peers respond to dramatic changes in their neighbourhood, such as many neighbours leaving at once or adjusting their <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">arcs</a> of responsibility.</p><p>What they’re seeing is that nodes respond very quickly to changes in their neighbourhood — which is great in principle, but such rapid responses are causing ‘oscillations’ that take a while to calm down. It’s a bit like when you meet someone coming toward you in a hallway, then you both try to make way for each other but end up moving in the same direction. So you readjust, get in each other’s way again, and repeat a few more times before you figure it out. That’s what’s happening at the DHT level, and the dev team is working on strategies to dampen those oscillations and allow nodes to reach stability after disruptions.</p><p>As regular readers know, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/#how-rrdht-makes-things-fast-and-robust">sharding</a> is Holochain’s long-term plan for building scalable peer-to-peer networks. Sharding is already built into Holochain, but it’s currently disabled by default. This testing and improvement work is getting it ready for real-world use.</p><p>Now let’s dig into what’s happened in the last three Holochain releases.</p> Holochain 0.0.113: Small release <p>This version of Holochain, released three weeks ago, was a small one. It contained two changes:</p>  Your <code>post_commit</code> callbacks should now be ‘infallible’, which means that they don’t return a <code>Result</code>. In fact, the host doesn’t even expect or check for a return value. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)  Breaking: <code>HeaderHashes</code> and <code>HeaderHashedVec</code> no longer exist. They were previously only used in <code>post_commit</code>, which is fairly new. Note that I mistakenly reported this for 0.0.112. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211027100746">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.114: Introspection, network simulations, and more <p>There are quite a lot of changes in last week’s release. Developers will note that zome functions can get more info about their context, while under the hood, we worked on DHT resilience improvements and got prepared to write sharding tests.</p>  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html"><code>zome_info</code></a> now includes <code>entry_defs</code>, a vector of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/prelude/struct.EntryDefs.html">entry definitions</a> from the same zome. No code changes needed, but zomes will need to be recompiled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>)  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.dna_info.html">dna_info</a></code> now includes <code>zome_names</code>, a vector of strings containing the names of the zomes as defined by the DNA manifest. As with the above, only recompilation is necessary. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>)  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.call_info.html">call_info</a></code> now includes the name of the function being called. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1078">#1078</a>)  Breaking: Within a hApp manifest, both ‘<a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.10/holochain_types/app/type.CellNick.html">nick</a>’ (deprecated) and ‘slot’ for a DNA have been collapsed into one new property called ‘role’. It does the same thing as ‘slot’ — gives the DNA an identifier that other components of the hApp (UI and other DNAs) can use to easily address cells created with that DNA, regardless of the DNA hash. This role identifier is internal to the hApp, and the role can also be filled by DNAs and cells that are external to the hApp, such as a DNA that implements DPKI. The only change you need to make is to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1045/files#diff-664227a03af324bf24e56578368216ab0a83cf7d90f0315a3a54b2ae638c5d5eL7-L8">replace <code>slots</code> with <code>roles</code></a> in your hApp manifest. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1045">#1045</a>)  Breaking: A source chain <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/chain/fn.query.html">query</a></code> now guarantees ordered results: elements will be returned in header sequence ascending (oldest to newest). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1004">#1004</a>)  New: the admin API now has a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/0.0.114/holochain/conductor/api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DumpFullState"><code>DumpFullState</code></a> endpoint, which lets developers inspect individual cell states during testing. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1065">#1065</a>)  <code>remote_signal</code> now uses a more efficient method of sending notifications to peers, which can take advantage of a multicast approach. It will also now fail silently if it can’t contact the peer — which is a good reminder that signal delivery is <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/#when-not-to-use-signals">not guaranteed</a> and shouldn’t be relied on for important exchanges. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1075">#1075</a>)  Breaking: Remote nodes will now return a <code>Busy</code> message if they’re overloaded with incoming gossip. This continues work in fixing consistency bottlenecks, allowing peers to process DHT data at a sustainable pace. This breaks the network protocol, which means that cells running on conductor 0.0.114 won’t be able to communicate with cells running on earlier conductors. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1076">#1076</a>)  Sweetest tests can now create simulated networks, which is already being used in sharding tests. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1036">#1036</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1037">#1037</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211103094627">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.115: Network reliability, more introspection <p>This week’s release is a quiet one, mainly bringing improvements to the database and networking code. Once again, the <code>*_info</code> host functions, which lets a zome function call introspect its context, have gotten some additions which will require no code changes but will require recompilation of your zomes’ WASM.</p>  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.115/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html">zome_info</a></code> now includes <code>externs</code>, a list of zome functions that comprise the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#zome">zome’s public API</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1081">#1081</a>)  Breaking: <code>zome_info</code> now includes <code>properties</code>, similar to the <code>dna_info</code>’s <code>properties</code> but specific to the zome. Note that this is just a placeholder and isn’t populated with any data, as it’s waiting for future changes to the DNA manifest spec. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1080">#1080</a>)  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.115/hdk/info/fn.agent_info.html"><code>agent_info</code></a> now includes the agent’s current chain state, as at the time <code>agent_info</code> was called. (This includes any elements written to the scratch space and waiting to be committed in the current zome call.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1079">#1079</a>)  Bugfix/breaking: Support for the the newest Lair keystore manager has been added, bringing more reliable connection management. If you decide to use it, you’ll need to rebuild your keystore, as the encryption passphrase is now hashed before being used as a key. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1094">#1094</a>)  Bugfix: Data from private source chain elements are now no longer processed by the local DHT shard, preventing errors when trying to commit them. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1104">#1104</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1110">#1110</a>)  Bugfix: ‘Delete’ DHT ops are now formed properly, preventing cells from shutting down. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1105">#1105</a>)  Bugfix: Nodes will try to silently reconnect to peers if a connection is dropped. This improves network reliability. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1083">#1083</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1111">#1111</a>)  Bugfix: Cells hosted on a HoloPort no longer error when trying to retrieve data from their DHT shard. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1098">#1098</a>)  Bugfix: All database transactions are asynchronous; this fixes various database connection issues. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1097">#1097</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211110083530">changelog</a>.</p> And two more releases  holochain-conductor-api 0.2.4 <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api">holochain-conductor-api</a>, the JavaScript client library for talking to local Holochain conductors, has been updated and a new version has been released. Here are the changes:</p>  Update: Call zome functions using the new app API endpoint name. This fixes an issue where attempts to call a zone function used a previously deprecated and removed endpoint name and were returning an error. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/pull/91">#91</a>)  Update: Update app installation endpoint calls and data types to replace ‘slots’ and ‘nicks’ with Holochain 0.0.114’s ‘roles’, along with other hApp bundle format changes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/pull/90">#90</a>)  <p>You can find it in all the usual places — you can get it via NPM as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/conductor-api"><code>@holochain/conductor-api</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/releases/tag/v0.2.4">download it from GitHub</a>.</p> Tryorama 0.4.6 <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a>, the JavaScript-based testing framework for hApps, has also seen a new release. As with holochain-conductor-api, this brings it in line with the changes in Holochain 0.0.114. Get it via NPM as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama"><code>@holochain/tryorama</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases/tag/v0.4.6">download it from GitHub</a>.</p><p>There’s a lot more going on in developer land, but as you may know, we’re preparing for the first public test of Elemental Chat. Right now, I’m busy writing educational materials for all the people who will be trying a hApp for the first time!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@motoki?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Motoki Tonn</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/kintsugi?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>At Dock, we’re focused on providing the best possible developer tools to ensure our products are easy to use while providing the best possible experience for technical teams. So today, we’re delighted to announce that we’ve incorporated a sandbox environment for users of our API. &nbsp;</p><p>For the uninitiated, Dock’s API enables businesses and developers to easily and instantly issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities on the Dock Blockchain. Dock integrates industry-leading World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) VCDM standards, allowing interoperability with other open source technologies. We provide a range of open-source software on <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork">GitHub</a> that can be used alongside the API.</p><p>You can test our API in the sandbox testnet by simply switching the toggle to test mode.</p><p>Primary features of Dock’s API include:</p>  Issuing, verifying, managing, and revoking/unrevoking verifiable credentials  Creating and managing decentralized identities  Anchoring credentials on-chain to enable timestamping  Creating and assigning schemas to credentials for compliance  <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#primary-features">And more</a>  <p>All of which you can test out in the sandbox environment! </p><p>To get started; create a free account, log into your <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">dashboard</a> and acquire your API key. </p><p>By default, API keys are created for production. You can switch the toggle to test mode and utilize the API in this endpoint. Any transactions made in test mode will not carry through on production. Note; your API keys for production and testnet are different. </p><p>All about DIDs</p><p>Decentralized Identities (DIDs) are globally unique identifiers that allow their owner to prove cryptographic control over them. DIDs on Dock are created by choosing a 32-byte unique (on Dock chain) identifier along with a public key. </p><p>Get accustomed to Dock’s API before utilizing your 50 free transactions on production;</p><p>Using the sandbox environment, create a new DID, public key, and controller by using an auto-generated keypair. It is important to have a public key of one of its three supported types. </p><p>Dock supports 3 types of public keys: sr25519, ed25519, and secp256k1. These public keys are supported by 3 classes: PublicKeySr25519, PublicKeyEd25519, and PublicKeySecp256k1.</p><p>You can update your public key or the controller of an on-chain DID by preparing a signed key update. You can even rotate the key of an existing DID following the instructions on our <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#update-did">API documentation here</a>.</p><p>A DID can be deleted from the testnet blockchain by sending the corresponding message signed with the current key. However, further attempts to resolve this DID will fail, just as it would in production mode. </p><p>Issuing Credentials</p><p>Simple to verify and almost impossible to fake or modify, recording credentials on the blockchain will increase security and prevent fraud. Though the VCDM spec does not mandate it, an issuer in Dock must have a DID on a chain. </p><p>You can use the sandbox environment to issue credentials just as you would on production; ensure your public key is accessible to the holder and verifier to verify the signature (in proof) in the credential. The DID can be found in the issuer field of the credential.</p><p>Updating or deleting Registries</p><p>Utilize the sandbox environment whenever you need it, simply switch the toggle in the top right corner to test mode and get to work.</p><p>There can be multiple registries on the chain, and each registry has a unique ID. A registry can be created, updated, revoked/unrevoked, and even deleted in a few simple steps. View our <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#registries">API documentation here</a> and get started in the sandbox environment. </p><p>Verify Credentials</p><p>In production, upon receiving a verifiable credential or presentation, a verifier verifies the validity of the credentials. </p><p>The verify method can be used to check the authenticity of the issuer and the issuer’s signature, revocation status if the credential is revocable, and if the holder has signed the presentation.</p><p>Verify a credential or presentation in our <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">sandbox testnet here</a>.</p><p>Give it a try</p><p>Dock’s API allows you to easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities on the Dock Blockchain. It’s easy to set up and implement, and requires no sign-up fee! Get started in our sandbox environment and your 50 free transactions will be in production when you switch over.</p>

<p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to the Co-founders of Unit — <a href="https://www.mihealy.com/">Michael Healy</a> and <a href="https://www.yipworx.com/">Thy-Diep (“Yip”)&nbsp;Ta</a>.</p><p><a href="https://docs.unit.foundation/">Unit.Network</a> is a parachain built on Substrate and linked to the <a href="https://polkadot.network/about/">PolkaDot network</a> that (1) provides tools to build and grow a token, (2) enables decentral (free-market) banking, and (3) is fundamentally designed to catalyze the token economy — widespread adoption of tokens for use (not just investment) throughout the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We spoke about how tokens could help distribute value in the world, the future of a token economy, the role of cryptocurrency treasuries, and more during our conversation.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;<a href="https://anchor.fm/dataeconomy/episodes/Michael-Healy--Thy-Diep-Yip-Ta--How-token-economy-could-contribute-to-distributing-value-e1a3p90">podcast</a>.</p><p>What is a token economy, and how can it solve the problem of inequity in&nbsp;society?</p><p>Imagine an economy driven by tokens. The concept of tokens is super new. At the moment, when people think about coins or tokens — they think about Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><blockquote>“How we view tokens is that they’re just a way for value to flow around the economy more efficiently and freely, and a way to share and distribute value in a more equitable way. Currently, the way the world works is that the people who benefit from business organizations doing well are just the founders and the investors. However, organizations would be nothing without the customer base and employees. They won’t be able to thrive or survive without them. When a project like Uber reaches worth $80 billion on the stock exchange, none of it goes to the 2 million drivers that are a huge support system for Uber. The inspiring vision of the token economy is where everything in the world has a token- whether it’s your local restaurant or your friend who’s an artist. You have an idea for a project, and you create tokens,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><blockquote>“Token is the container that enables the flow of economic transactions in a world where every stakeholder who helps contribute value can have a fair share in it,” added&nbsp;Yip.</blockquote><p>Many people who know about cryptocurrencies also consider a range of operational questions like what to build on or how to make a token. According to Michael, blockchain technology is going to become commoditized. People are comparing which blockchain is better and does more transactions per second or is more decentralized.</p><blockquote>“It’s not going to matter which chain you issue your token on. It’s not going to matter which platform you’re using to put data on. It is just going to be about how to monetize, and the best thing about the blockchain is that it’s decentralized. Even with us being cofounders, we just can’t decide to take everything down tomorrow,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><p>However, a decentralized token economy can only be enabled with the help of a seamless treasury system. <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/zhangb2/treasury.pdf">A treasury system</a> is a community-controlled and decentralized collaborative decision-making mechanism for sustainable funding of blockchain development and maintenance. During each treasury period, project proposals are submitted, discussed, and voted for; top-ranked projects are funded from the treasury. More specifically, the treasury system supports liquid democracy/delegative voting for better collaborative intelligence. Namely, the stakeholders can either vote directly on the proposed projects or delegate their votes to experts. Its core component is a distributed universally composable secure end-to-end verifiable voting protocol. The integrity of the treasury voting decisions is guaranteed even when all the voting committee members are corrupted. Michael comments on the concept of a treasury that Unit is building:</p><blockquote>“It sounds very simple- put funds into a treasury, and the treasury is providing this fundamental book value. This is super cool to address and understand how to value different tokens. For example, you can currently look at different coins and tokens on two popular sites- CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. But there’s no parameter for assessing the underlying value that’s being created or generated backing up the token. The Unit Treasury really solves&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>The future of Token&nbsp;Economy</p><p>How big is the token economy? If you look at tokens, it’s about 8000 tokens. The crypto market cap of the token market cap is between $2 to $3 trillion. It sounds like a lot of money, but the biggest company globally is Apple which is about $2 to $3 trillion; Tesla just crossed over, being worth $1 trillion. That’s just one&nbsp;company.</p><blockquote>“There are about 8 billion people in the world. We think each person is going to have a token. We think more than having a personal token; they will own a token for a community or different businesses and projects. We are at a stage with just 8000 tokens. If this was a party, the music hasn’t turned yet and nobody is here. Most people in the world, most companies, most leaders don’t see the potential and possibility of tokens yet. So I guess our responsibility, vision, mission, and purpose behind Unit to bring the future and the value of tokens to the entire world,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><p>Use cases of token&nbsp;economy</p><p>Everything in the non-internet and non-mobile world eventually moved to the internet. Newspaper, shopping, education, travel — everything went online. It’s the same with a token and blockchain. There is an opportunity if there isn’t a decentralized app or a token for a particular industry or a particular business. For example, if there’s a supermarket, which is centrally owned and centrally runs, there’s an opportunity for you to create a supermarket, which has decentralized ownership and decentralized operations.</p><p>Yip mentions that other use cases will be everything related to helping the gaming and the metaverse economy come to&nbsp;life:</p><blockquote>“ People will spend more and more time in Virtual Reality and mixed reality environments, and all this needs creators. A lot of people can already start to earn a living, producing content like this. It’s not about consuming gaming but being able to consume it and produce at the same time. You can become a creator in that new economy and already play and earn, but also create and earn. This will reduce a lot of inequities in the&nbsp;market.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2: 15 to 5.36: What does data ownership mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>5.36 to 11.40: What is a token economy, and what problems can it solve?

  <p>When you hear SSO (Single Sign-On), you probably immediately think of web apps, and how you only need to sign into one web app first, then all other web apps give you seamless access. Unfortunately, for desktop and mobile applications (often referred to as “native apps”), the seamless web SSO experience (also referred to as native SSO) has not caught on. This is partly due to the lack of an industry standard or best practice on how to accomplish native SSO.</p>

<p>Although there is no standard yet, there’s been growing demand for a solution, due to the continued expansion of native apps, both desktop and mobile. In 2020, a report from RiskIQ counted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/02/28/there-are-now-89-million-mobile-apps-and-china-is-40-of-mobile-app-spending/?sh=33b7e96721dd">8.9 million mobile apps</a>. There are also a large number of internal native apps available to employees within an enterprise.</p>

<p>In comparison with desktop or web apps, it’s even more critical to enable SSO for mobile apps, due to the smaller keyboard and screen on a mobile device, which makes password input more painful. To date, complex proprietary solutions have not proven interoperable with the variety of native applications an enterprise installs on employee devices. Thus, there is still a dire need for an industry-standard solution.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this problem is widely recognized, and an OIDC draft spec <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">Native SSO for Mobile Apps</a> has been released to address the issue using a token-exchange approach. Okta recently added support for this draft spec. In this article, we describe the solution and compare it to an existing approach. We also share an example app to demonstrate how you can use the token-exchange solution to build SSO for your apps, not only within the same device, but also across devices. Specifically, the example demonstrates how you can single-sign-on with Okta to a mobile app on one device (such as your iPhone), then have access to all your apps on another desktop device (such as your Mac).</p>

 Sharing web sessions with native apps 

<p>Before we describe the token-exchange solution, let’s explore how to build a native SSO solution based on web SSO. If we could share web login sessions with native apps, we could leverage the advance in browser SSO technology. Web session sharing has become more restrictive due to the continued increase in privacy restrictions on mobile devices. Apple leads the charge on adding more privacy restrictions, but Android is quickly following suit.</p>

<p>Apple introduced <code>SFSafariViewController</code> in iOS 9, which enables an embedded web browser experience inside a mobile app. But Apple quickly changed its behavior. In iOS 11, <code>SFSafariViewController</code> no longer shares any browser cookies with the standalone Safari browser on the same device, making it impossible to share SSO sessions between a mobile app and a web app.</p>

<p>Apple introduced <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> in iOS 12 to add the ability to share browser cookies, but it is restrictive:
It can only be used in an OIDC-style login flow, and only shares persistent cookies, not session cookies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/shared-sso-android-ios/ios/overview/">Okta developer guide on web session sharing</a> illustrates how two mobile apps on the same device can share a web login session. At a high level, it involves these steps:</p>

 
   Enable persistent cookies. Okta login session is stored in a session cookie by default, but only persistent cookies can be shared in iOS. 
   Login App 1 through the embedded browser. The login session is saved in a persistent cookie. 
   Login App 2 through the embedded browser. Since the login session is still in the persistent cookie, the user is not prompted for login. 
 

 Native SSO based on token exchange 

<p>Okta’s native SSO solution is based on token exchange, and it builds on an OIDC draft spec <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">Native SSO for Mobile Apps</a>. The following diagrams, taken from the spec, illustrate the flow to enable native SSO.</p>

<p>Sign-in to the first application is similar to a normal OIDC sign in, using a system browser. The only difference is that we request the <code>device_sso</code> scope, and in return, we receive a <code>device_secret</code> along with the returned tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When Native App 2 requests login, it can simply take the ID token and device secret returned for App 1, and call the token endpoint to exchange for tokens for App 2. The returned tokens for App 2 have their own refresh lifecycle.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO Guide</a> goes into more detail on how to enable native SSO, and demonstrates the interaction through curl commands.</p>

 How is it different 

<p>The token-exchange-based native SSO solution is simpler and better than sharing web SSO in at least several regards:</p>
 
   Out-of-the-box config: Sharing web SSO requires you to use an API to configure all users to use a persistent cookie for session management. (The default is to use a session cookie.) A login session will persist even after you close the browser, which may be a surprise for some users. In contrast, native SSO is one of the supported grant types that can be easily enabled in the Okta admin console. 
   Single LogOut: It is not possible to single logout all applications with the web SSO sharing solution. If you want to log out from all apps, you have to log out from each app one by one. In contrast, in native SSO, one can simply revoke <code>device_secret</code>, then all apps automatically sign out. 
   Multiple devices: Sharing web SSO can only work on the same device. In contrast, native SSO can work across devices, as long as <code>device_secret</code> can be safely shared. In fact, the remaining portion of this blog demonstrates how to implement native SSO across multiple Apple devices. 
 

 Single sign-on across multiple Apple devices 

<p>Many of us own multiple devices such as iPhone, MacBook, iPad. It would be great to single sign-on to apps across all the devices we own. In this section, we demonstrate how to sign into a mobile app on an iOS device and a desktop app on a MacBook by leveraging iCloud keychain.
Note that this demo generalizes the <code>device_secret</code> concept described in the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">draft spec</a> to beyond a single device. While it allows you to single sign-on across multiple devices, you do lose the ability to revoke access on an individual device. (You can only revoke all devices.) Also, you lose the assurance that the <code>device_secret</code> can identify a single device.</p>

<p>We first need to create two OIDC apps in your Okta admin console, one for the iOS mobile app, another for the Mac desktop app. See our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO Guide</a> for full instruction.</p>

<p>Next, let us start an Xcode project, and add two targets: one for an iOS app (<code>nativesso</code>), another for a Mac app (<code>nativessomac</code>). The full source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ios-native-sso-example">Native SSO sample app repo</a>.</p>

 Store device secret in iCloud Keychain 

<p>The key to enabling native SSO is to be able to securely share <code>device_secret</code> across multiple devices. We can use iCloud Keychain. We will show how to use Apple’s keychain interface functions to save and restore the device secret.</p>

<p>By default, a keychain item is only stored per app. No other apps can access the keychain items your app saves. However, the keychain has a concept called the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps">keychain access group</a>. You can enable multiple apps to share the same keychain access group, then all of these apps can read and write from the same Keychain Access Group. A Keychain Access Group is tied to a developer account, so only your apps (if enabled) can access the group. No other apps from other developers can access your group, so it is secure.</p>

<p>First, let us add the keychain access group. Click the target, select Signing &amp; Capabilities, click + to add a Keychain Sharing capability. Then input a unique group name, such as <code>com.atko.group</code>, in the box. This will update the entitlement file. Repeat this step for other targets or apps that you want to share the device secret with.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To save a device secret and ID token in the keychain, we invoke the following function:</p>

   <code>static func addDeviceSecret(idToken: String, deviceSecret: String) {
    let attributes: [String: Any] = [
        (kSecClass as String): kSecClassGenericPassword,     // only Password items can use iCloud keychain
        (kSecAttrSynchronizable as String): kCFBooleanTrue!, // allow iCloud
        (kSecAttrLabel as String): keychainTag,              // tag to make it easy to search
        (kSecAttrAccessGroup as String): keychainGroup,      // multiple apps can share through this group
        (kSecAttrAccount as String): idToken,
        (kSecValueData as String): deviceSecret.data(using: .utf8)!
    ]
    // Let's add the item to the Keychain! 😄
    let status = SecItemAdd(attributes as CFDictionary, nil)
}
</code>   

<p>We first set the <code>attributes</code>:</p>

 
   <code>kSecClass</code> is set to <code>kSecClassGenericPassword</code> because iCloud keychain only supports password items, not certificates. 
   <code>kSecAttrSynchronizable</code> flag indicates that we want to use iCloud keychain. 
   We add a <code>kSecAttrLabel</code> to facilitate a later query to find this key. 
   <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code> is set to the same keychain access group enabled in the entitlement, for example <code>com.atko.group</code>. 
   We reuse fields designed for saving passwords: save ID token in <code>kSecAttrAccount</code> field, and device secret in <code>kSecValueData</code>. 
 

<p>After the attributes are set, it is a simple call to Apple’s API <code>SecItemAdd</code> to save the credentials.</p>

<p>We can find the previously saved device secret through a query to the iCloud keychain through the following function.</p>

   <code>static func queryForDeviceSecret() -&gt; (idToken: String?, deviceSecret: String?) {
    let query: [String: Any] = [
        (kSecClass as String): kSecClassGenericPassword,     // only Password items can use iCloud keychain
        (kSecAttrSynchronizable as String): kCFBooleanTrue!, // allow iCloud
        (kSecAttrLabel as String): keychainTag,              // tag to make it easy to search
        (kSecAttrAccessGroup as String): keychainGroup,      // multiple apps can share through this group
        (kSecMatchLimit as String): kSecMatchLimitOne,       // should only have one key
        (kSecReturnAttributes as String): true,
        (kSecReturnData as String): true]
    var item: CFTypeRef?

    // should succeed
    let status = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &amp;item)
    
    if let existingItem = item as? [String: Any],
        let idToken = existingItem[kSecAttrAccount as String] as? String,
        let deviceSecretData = existingItem[kSecValueData as String] as? Data {
        let deviceSecret = String(data: deviceSecretData, encoding: .utf8)
        return (idToken, deviceSecret)
    }
    return (nil, nil)
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>query</code> is set using the same set of parameters as used in the <code>SecItemAdd</code> call, then it is a simple call to the Apple’s API <code>SecItemCopyMatching</code>.</p>

 Exchange device secret for new tokens 

<p><a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios">Okta OIDC iOS library</a> is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS">AppAuth library</a>. For token exchange, we will use AppAuth’s built-in functions.</p>

<p>We first have to construct a configuration for AppAuth.</p>

   <code>let configuration = OIDServiceConfiguration.init(
    authorizationEndpoint: URL(string: authorizeUrl)!,
    tokenEndpoint: URL(string: tokenUrl)!
)
</code>   

<p>The <code>authorizeUrl</code> should be set to your AS (Authorization Server)’s “authorize” URL, for instance: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>. The <code>tokenEndpoint</code> should be the token url, like this: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>.</p>

<p>Then we construct a token exchange request. Note that we specify the new grant type <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange</code>, and also add in the special parameters in the <code>additionalParameters</code> field. Specifically, <code>actor_token</code> should be set to the device token, and <code>subject_token</code> should be set to the ID token you obtained earlier when a different app signed in.</p>

   <code>let request = OIDTokenRequest(
                configuration: configuration,
                grantType: "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange",
                authorizationCode: nil,
                redirectURL: nil,
                clientID: oktaOidc.configuration.clientId,
                clientSecret: nil,
                scope: "openid offline_access",
                refreshToken: nil,
                codeVerifier: nil,
                additionalParameters: [
                   "actor_token" : deviceSecret!,
                   "actor_token_type" : "urn:x-oath:params:oauth:token-type:device-secret",
                   "subject_token" : idToken!,
                   "subject_token_type" : "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token",
                   "audience" : "api://default"])
</code>   

<p>Lastly, we perform token exchange to get a new accessToken, refreshToken for the new app.</p>

   <code>// perform token exchange
OIDAuthorizationService.perform(request) { tokenResponse, error in
    if error != nil {
        // handle errors
    }
// Signed in, persist tokens, 
}
</code>   

 End-to-end login flow 

<p>Now that we have the building blocks of save-and-query device secret, and token exchange, let’s tie them together to enable login on a device. Essentially, it follows these steps:</p>

 
   Look up <code>deviceSecret</code> from iCloud keychain.
       <code>  let (idToken, deviceSecret) = queryForDeviceSecret()
</code>       
   
   If <code>deviceSecret</code> exists, attempts token exchange, as outlined in the previous section. 
   If the token exchange succeeds, the user is already logged in. We then save login state locally so that the app does not need to do a login check on the next startup. This is leveraging Okta OIDC library’s built-in capability to persist login state locally.
       <code>  stateManager!.writeToSecureStorage()
</code>       
   
   If no <code>deviceSecret</code>, or token exchange fails, invoke the OIDC login flow.
First construct a configuration for Okta’s OIDC library:
       <code>  let configuration = try OktaOidcConfig(with: [
   "issuer": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default",
   "clientId": "0oa826j5pHmPRt2n00w6",
   "scopes": "device_sso openid offline_access",
   "redirectUri": "nativesso:/callback",
   "logoutRedirectUri": "nativesso:/logout"
  ])
</code>       
    <p>Then invoke the OIDC flow. On an iOS device:</p>
       <code>  oktaOidc.signInWithBrowser(from: self, callback: SignInHelper.oktaOidcCallback)
</code>       
    <p>On a Mac:</p>
       <code>  oktaOidc.signInWithBrowser(redirectServerConfiguration: nil, callback: SignInHelper.oktaOidcCallback)
</code>       
   
   If the sign-in is successful, we save the login state locally, the same as in step three. In addition, we save the device secret in the iCloud keychain, so that other apps can perform native SSO login.
       <code>  removeDeviceSecret()
  addDeviceSecret(idToken: stateManager!.idToken!, 
               deviceSecret: stateManager!.authState.lastTokenResponse!.additionalParameters!["device_secret"]! as! String)
</code>       
   
 

<p>Note that the Okta SDK currently does not understand the device secret field, so we are parsing for the field directly from the last token request response.</p>

<p>By now, you should be able to launch both the iPhone app and the Mac app. The first one will prompt you for login, but the second one will be able to log you in without any prompt.</p>

 Okta’s Native SSO is available now 

<p>Okta’s native SSO feature is now in GA (general availability). You can turn it on in your org, and start experimenting. Beyond the demo use case we showed above, we envision it will open up many more scenarios. Give it a try, and drop a comment below to directly reach the development team. We would love to hear your feedback and feature requests.</p>

<p>We’ve already told many folks what we are advising <a href="https://www.cheqd.io">cheqd</a>&nbsp;and participating in the cheqd network as a node operator – but we wanted to provide more information for the community (clear disclosure – that means we will, or do – depending on when you are reading this article – hold cheqd tokens).</p>
<p>This article aims to explain areas where we are aligned with cheqd as well as a few areas we will be pushing them towards.</p>
 1. OUR CLIENTS 
<p>We serve a range of client types (government, military, financial institutions, NGOs, not-for-profits, startups). I’ll deal with them in two distinct groups here as the first group is unique while the others fall into the same broad bucket.</p>
 1.1 GOVERNMENT 
<p>We advise several government agencies and they, right now, aren’t overly interested in token-enabled networks for operational use. However, they do need to understand what things will mean when permissionless ledgers and tokens are “normal” and citizens insist on their use.</p>
 1.2 OTHER CLIENTS (Corporations, Financial Institutions, Startups, Investors, Crypto Projects, and Not for Profits/NGOs) 
<p>We are advising multiple organizations about the state of decentralization/crypto/web3 space and about the key developments in the space. Many of these organizations are either actively interested in understanding what impact permissionless ledgers and tokens will have on them immediately or over the longer term. Their interest ranges from rabid to tepid to allergic. Some may be partial competitors to cheqd but they are also potential collaborators. It’s an interesting mix.</p>
<p>The reason we advise them is that it is our job at Continuum Loop to keep them apprised about where things are headed (here comes an obligatory Canadian hockey quote from a non-sports fan):</p>
<blockquote><p>“I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”</p>
<p>– Wayne Gretzky</p></blockquote>
 2. COMPLIANCE 
<p>For many of our clients, compliance is a big issue. While many of the #decentralizeTheWorld types would like to think that there is no need for this, the world we live in needs it. So part of our efforts with cheqd is in understanding and advising on how the cheqd network fits with various compliance and audit needs.</p>
<p>Payments aren’t simple. Sure, in crypto it is easy to send funds from one address to another on the same chain. Once you start exchanging between different coins/tokens you add quite a bit of complexity. Adding the KYC/AML needs that you will, as a citizen of a country, require and things get hairy quickly.</p>
 3. INTEROP/STANDARDS 
<p>We have been talking more and more about what we call “premature interoperability” and “premature standardization”. The gist of these discussions is that there are only a few areas right now where interoperability and standardization make any sense – and neither have definitive good answers. We’ll be supporting cheqd to align with the key initiatives that we see are making a difference, particularly with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, Hyperledger with the <a href="https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html">Aries Interoperability project</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;with its interoperability profile efforts. These leading groups are bringing the industry together and I’ll be helping cheqd play a role there.</p>
 4. GOVERNANCE 
<p>As a founder (and funder) of the Trust Over IP Foundation, the consideration of governance of any ecosystem is critical. We’ve looked at how cheqd could fit into various different ecosystems that we are helping with and are pleased that it fits nicely. It is focused on the creation of a permissionless network. They are working to ensure that no single party holds too much control. In this case, control could easily kill an ecosystem so that is critical. One of my most important operating principles is pinned on my Twitter profile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control only what you must. Influence the rest.</p>
<p>— Darrell O'Donnell 🇨🇦🆔 (@darrello) <a href="https://twitter.com/darrello/status/792496888444575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>A governance-related area that I will be pushing cheqd and others in the SSI/decentralized identity realm relates to where developers fit into the governance structure. To date, the ecosystems we are working with don’t incentivize developers well, or at all. That’s a deep flaw in my view. We have created back-of-napkin incentive concepts that show our team internally what is feasible with cheqd in the longer term, and from the Continuum Loop side, we’re satisfied that we’re off to a good start.</p>
 5. COMMERCIAL MODEL 
<p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is part of what we help our clients understand. One big problem is that to date they really only get uptake where they are radically reducing costs, which is a bottom-line impact for companies.</p>
<p>The more interesting use cases from a business perspective are top-line revenue related – how does a business drive massive value for its customers using verifiable credentials? Any business that drives value deserves a portion of that value (while rent-seekers take oversized percentages of value while adding little or nothing, and should rightly be removed from the system).</p>
<p>The problem has been answering the following range of questions:</p>
 
 How does a Verifier pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Holder pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Verifier pay a Holder; 
 or any variant of those pairings (or more than 2 parties)? 
 
<p>This is indeed a hard problem, especially when you consider how privacy, security, and compliance are impacted when you introduce payment.</p>
<p>Many of our clients feel there is a way to add value and drive revenue with decentralized identity, but we haven’t had any good answers to date. We believe we are getting much closer to that with cheqd and other projects we are working on.</p>
 6. FIAT versus TOKEN 
<p>One of the first questions I asked the cheqd team when we started getting into discussions was how they would make life easy for users that want to use, or just stick with, fiat currency for transactions. They will need to provide details for you but I am satisfied that they are taking a good approach to make fiat payments work – especially when it comes to network fee stability.</p>
<p>On the tokenomics side, we aren’t going to get into the science (magic/mythology/voodoo – pick your term) of tokenomics as that is not our area of deep expertise. However, it is worth mentioning a few things that are important to our clients and our team. Governance is an obvious one. Another is ensuring that the non-token world can be abstracted away from the token when required. Another is how cheqd’s approach may enable commercial models that, to date, have been holding back the use of decentralized identity. The team at cheqd has a coherent explanation of how <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-f13f680cf00d">cheqd is handling the tokenomics here</a>.</p>
 7. SOVRIN 
<p>I have fielded a lot of “but what about Sovrin?” questions. These ones baffle me somewhat, but I get it. I want to be clear, we (Continuum Loop and I) fully support the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> and its mission. I am an ex officio member of the Sovrin Board of Trustees, by virtue of co-chairing the <a href="https://sovrin.org/i4a/">Identity For All Council</a>, which is hosted at the Sovrin Foundation. I volunteer a lot of time with Sovrin and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Similar to Continuum Loop’s work with governments that are working on deploying, or have deployed, Hyperledger Indy networks of their own, Sovrin plays a critical role. We don’t believe that there will be one single SSI network but Sovrin is important both as a network, as well as its facilitator/leader role in a network-of-networks. The cheqd network adds to the diversity in the network-of-networks and I imagine that the two groups will work together nicely.</p>
<p>Sovrin is also the progenitor of much of the leading thinking that is in the space – Trust Over IP Foundation; Sovrin Governance; Hyperledger Indy; and more.</p>
 8. CONCLUSION 
<p>We’re looking forward to learning how our relationship with cheqd shakes out. We’re going to be learning alongside them and our clients. I am sure we will make progress and I am sure we will stumble at times. That’s what we do at Continuum Loop.</p>
<p>Our clients are the ones that face an uncut jungle and do one of two things – grab a machete to cut trail (Innovators*) or look for the narrow trails that other adventurous souls have already started to cut (Early Adopters*). Our clients are not looking for paved roads through well-known paths (majority and laggards). By the time those roads are in place the rest of the world is already using them.</p>
<p>* If the Innovator/Early Adopter terms are unfamiliar check the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">Technology Adoption Life Cycle</a>. Keep in mind that most folks that talk about the adoption life cycle usually start with “we need the Early Adopters”, when they likely mean they need the Innovators.</p>

<p>Identity platform grew eightfold in the UK compared to previous year, continues to see increasing demand for its solutions.</p>
<p>London and Manchester, November 11th, 2021: IDnow, a leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification from Germany, with offices in Manchester and London, has grown eightfold year-over-year in the UK market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow, comments: “We’re seeing a significant rise in demand for our services from the UK market this year. The pandemic pushed many industries into accelerating their digitisation, and as part of that, consumers now expect a much quicker and fully digital onboarding process. The knock-on effect of that has been an increase in cybercrime making security more important than ever and meaning businesses have a heightened focus on delivering a safe and secure process for customers.”</p>
<p>IDnow’s UK growth is aligned with the global demand for its solutions. The firm sees substantial interest across the world, with more and more companies deciding to switch to fully digital application processes.</p>
<p>To meet the rising demand, IDnow acquired two companies in 2021: French identity technology provider, ARIADNEXT and German IdentityTM. The merged companies able to offer one of the broadest sets of identity verification solutions to the European market.</p>
<p>IDnow’s Director UK&amp;I, Roger Tyrzyk, adds: “Since we launched into the UK in 2019, we’ve seen consistent growth, as businesses look to deploy most secure digital onboarding processes possible. As digitisation continues at pace, we are expecting this demand to continue to grow and as a result, will be looking to further invest in our UK presence, with plans to create more jobs over the next 12 months. As digital identity experts, our expansion will come at a critical time, as the UK Government moves forward with its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, a national approach for digital identity solutions which will enable people to prove who they are quickly and safely.”</p>
<p>As part of its high-growth strategy, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become recognised as an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 900 customers worldwide, including Canopy, MyCDD, Entain and ICICI.</p>

<p>Travel and tourism was one of the worst affected industries due to the COVID pandemic.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.unwto.org/unwto-world-tourism-barometer-data">UNWTO World Tourism Barometer</a>, international travel fell by 72% in January-October 2020 when compared to the previous year, resulting in a loss of about USD 935&nbsp;billion.</p><p>In 2021, things began to look up for this industry as it saw a reasonable recovery, thanks in part to the widespread availability of vaccinations. Another important aspect that bolstered the travel industry is the adoption of digital vaccination certificates and travel passes that boosted the confidence of people to travel&nbsp;again.</p><p>At a time when airline companies and airport authorities were scrambling to check the vaccination status of their passengers, these digital credentials streamlined the verification process and created a safe travel experience for everyone involved.</p><p>The European Union digital COVID certificate and Affinidi’s safe travel passes played a big role in different geographies to get people to travel&nbsp;again.</p> Affinidi’s Safe&nbsp;Travel <p>Affinidi’s Safe travel, in particular, made a big difference in boosting travel in Southeast and Central Asia by providing end-to-end validated digital health credential solutions based on <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">self-sovereign identity</a>.</p><p>Essentially, any traveler who tested negative in the RT-PCR test was given a vaccination credential mentioning the same, and this could be shared securely with the airline, airport authorities, or any other verifier as needed. This interoperable solution used QR codes for easy verification and followed the principles of self-sovereign identity such as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">selective disclosure</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This created a sense of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust</a> for the verifying entities because these <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> are tamper-proof and machine-verifiable, and hence required no physical contact. As for passengers, it was a safe and secure way to share their vaccination status <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">without revealing</a> additional personal information.</p><p>In all, it worked well for every stakeholder in the travel industry.</p><p>While this has been helpful to create a sense of confidence during the pandemic, what happens in a post-pandemic world? How can digital credentials continue to enhance the travel experience? More importantly, are there more ways to generate revenue from these credentials?</p><p>To explore these answers and to discuss new revenue streams within the travel industry using digital credentials, join us for Affinidi’s webinar on November 25th at 4 pm&nbsp;SGT.</p><p>Toby Berger, the Director of Travel Affinidi, and Shankar Pillai, the Director of Engineering. Health/Travel, Affinidi will be talking about the impact of digital credentials in 2022 and&nbsp;beyond.</p> What to Expect from the&nbsp;Webinar? <p>In this webinar, Toby will be talking about the main adopters (issuers, holders, and verifiers) of the COVID verification solutions and relevant use-cases. He will be giving you pointers on the aspects you should consider while selecting a verification solution and the likely challenges you will face while implementing them.</p><p>Toby’s insights will be followed by a use-case presentation by Shankar where he will use Affinidi Travel as an example to demonstrate how VCs can help enable safe travel. He will also describe its architecture, so you can visualize its integration with your&nbsp;idea.</p><p>Finally, Kamal Laungani, the Global Developer Ecosystem Manager, will describe the APIs and SDKs that can help you build an VC-based&nbsp;app.</p><p>These interesting sessions will be followed by Q and A on our&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>.</p><p>Sounds interesting, right?</p><p>Register <a href="https://lemmatree.zoom.us/webinar/register/8016354073764/WN_WrlR9eGZQ6K3RgKIDPKkKQ">here</a> for the webinar, and together, let’s see how we can leverage the power of digital credentials to boost the travel industry and gain economic benefits from&nbsp;them.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a> to know about such interesting events.

<p>“Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties. The result:&nbsp;a composable human-centric and privacy preserving computing fabric for the next wave of the web.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This quote from venture capitalists Max Mersch and Richard Muirhead writing in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>&nbsp;is a pretty good answer to the question, as is this from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=745d290558df">Forbes Technology Council</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment, overtaking Web 2.0’s centralization, surveillance and exploitative advertising. Decentralized infrastructure and application platforms will displace centralized tech giants, and individuals will be able to rightfully own their data.”</p>



<p>Clearly Web 3.0 will shake up data privacy and change the data economy as we know it. Indeed, as the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) suggested in 2018, Web 3.0 might just be the answer to our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy woes</a>.</p>



 What is Web 3.0? 



<p></p>



<p>Web 3.0 is the latest iteration of the internet that’s arriving even as Web 2.0 still consumes us. Web 3.0 goes by several different monikers: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">decentralized internet</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">spatial web</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">semantic web</a>. A brief history of the internet’s evolution puts Web 3.0 in context:</p>



  Web 1.0 was&nbsp;static desktop web pages.  Web 2.0 is interactive content on desktop, mobile and social media, and constant connection via devices.  Web 3.0 will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">marked</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;open source software&nbsp;and trustless&nbsp;(users interact publicly or privately without a trusted third party)&nbsp;and&nbsp;permissionless&nbsp;(no governing body)&nbsp;networks. It will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">built</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;edge computing,&nbsp;decentralised data networks&nbsp;and&nbsp;artificial intelligence.  



<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte</a>&nbsp;says Web 3.0 or the spatial web will combine machine learning from the semantic web with distributed ledger technologies like blockchain to authenticate and decentralize information resulting in “interaction with information away from screens and into physical space.”</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>



<p>And this shows how Deloitte sees the spatial web continuing to emerge from now:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a><br>



<p>Clearly, the hallmarks of Web 3.0 will be decentralization and greater user interaction and control over data. Data will be dispersed across an array of computing resources, including phones, appliances, sensors and vehicles,&nbsp;rather than held exclusively in central data stores&nbsp;and, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>&nbsp;says, it&nbsp;“will eventually eliminate the boundary between digital content and physical objects that we know today” and “improve efficiency, communication and entertainment in ways we are only beginning to imagine today.”</p>



<p>The enabling technologies of Web 3.0 are the innovations we’re already seeing, such as&nbsp;augmented and virtual reality, advanced networking (e.g. 5G), geolocation, Internet of Things devices and sensors, distributed ledger technology (e.g. blockchain), and artificial intelligence and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are one example of Web 3.0 innovation, but as Mersch and Murihead say in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>, Web 3.0 goes way beyond cryptocurrencies to crypto-connections of people, corporates and machines … “leading to a “return to the global village” — daily immersion in the human-centric and highly personalised interactions from which we used to benefit, yet now delivered at the global scale of the internet and supporting an ever-increasing myriad of human and machine skills specialisations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;sees Web 3.0 as promoting “true sovereignty” where users own and control&nbsp;who profits from an individual’s time and information … “and eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it.”</p>



 What does Web 3.0 mean for privacy? 



<p></p>



<p>For privacy, this brave new world will mean humans, enterprises and machines can share more data with far greater privacy and security. We will no longer rely on (or will at least interact on our own terms with) Big Tech platforms with all their inherent risks, and users will own their own data and digital footprint via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">IAPP</a>&nbsp;laid out exactly what Web 3.0 could mean for privacy and was highly optimistic:&nbsp;</p>



  We’ll use cryptographically secured digital identities to trustlessly complete transactions that currently require us to give up our highly sensitive and highly valuable&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. We will no longer be the product and return to being the customer.  The Googles of the world will no longer control our data and bad actors will be less able to attack it. What’s more, governments won’t control our data either. Instead, all apps, users and connected devices will interact directly and data will be stored in secure decentralized ways. This will mean we’ll see fewer data breaches that affect large numbers of users, and rightfully return control of data to individual users.  The “middleman” of centralized identity management on the web will be obsolete and users will instead interact directly using&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">self-sovereign identities</a>.&nbsp;  



 Obviously, this is all sounds like a data privacy nirvana, but the IAPP has two warnings:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  Privacy regulations might be stumbling blocks and regulators will need to unravel issues including:  Who is the controller/processor for decentralized personal data  Where would the decentralized data be stored – location and jurisdiction&nbsp;  How to respond to subject access requests, and which entities are required to respond to such requests  How to delete or change personal information on and off the blockchain.<br>  Easy to use and convenient decentralized applications will be paramount for the average user.&nbsp;  



<p>And that’s where Anonyome Labs is helping to realize the vision of Web 3.0. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">applications and platforms</a> are already allowing users and enterprise partners to create and manage multiple digital identities via our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, with each Sudo providing a range of privacy protecting capabilities. You can see these capabilities in our exemplar app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;which currently provides for private, secure and compartmentalized&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">communication</a>. Learn more about how we’re promoting self-sovereign identities&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">here</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll obviously stay abreast of the emergence of Web 3.0 and we’ll keep talking about the innovations and issues in coming months and years.</p>

<p>The time has finally arrived! As of November 10 at 4:14 pm CET, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a fully decentralized blockchain network. This means that BOTLabs GmbH, the company behind the initial development of KILT Protocol, has handed over decision-making to the community. From now on, KILT will be run via a sophisticated system of governance in which any KILT Coin holder can propose changes to the network that can be voted on by the community. This level of decentralization is what makes Web3, the next generation of the internet, truly fair and exciting.</p> Decentralization Day <p>Until now, the Sudo (super user) key allowed the development team to make any necessary changes to the blockchain on behalf of the network without the vote of the KILT community. Now that the network has been audited and these functionalities are running as planned, the time has come for the community to take&nbsp;control.</p><p>Today KILT reached the final step of decentralization. The Sudo key was removed and governance of the KILT blockchain transitioned into the hands of its community.</p> Governance at&nbsp;work <p>The first proposal in front of KILT community governance is to allow tokens to be transferred (TTE) and to distribute the “thank you” KILT Coins to supporters of the crowdloan. With sufficient backing, this proposal will go to referendum at the end of this week (by 12 November) for KILT Coin holders to vote on over the following 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Following a successful referendum, proposals are automatically carried out on KILT on-chain by the system, after an enactment period of one day. So it can be expected that the KILT Coins will be distributed to crowdloan supporters in around two weeks’ time. Follow the process on-chain <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.kilt.io%2F#/democracy">here</a> to see blockchain democracy in&nbsp;action!</p> The Path to Decentralization <p>Over three years of planning and development have gone into bringing KILT Protocol to this point. First conceived in 2018, KILT was developed by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/about-us/">BOTLabs under the direction of Ingo Rübe</a>. From the beginning, KILT was designed to evolve into a decentralized blockchain network that aims to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy and dignity to the individual as well as enabling innovative, industry-agnostic business models around identity.</p><p>Thanks to support from its community, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-wins-kusama-parachain-auction-slot-6-launches-mainnet-a48aed4ed5e0">KILT</a> secured a parachain slot on the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> network and launched as a live blockchain on September 8th of this year. KILT was designed as a limited delegated proof of stake (<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">LDPoS</a>) system, with delegators who support a network of collators that hold and secure the data of the KILT blockchain and create blocks. Following this design, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">an initial cohort</a> of 16 active collators were onboarded at launch. This number is expected to increase to 75 in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>Since launch, the development team of KILT Protocol added functions such as staking, governance, and a Treasury, which will fund projects that support the KILT ecosystem, approved by community vote. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/how-it-works/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials</a> were also added to provide developers with tools to create businesses around identity and credentials.</p> In the Hands of the Community <p>As part of handing over the network to the ecosystem, BOTLabs GmbH, the company that developed KILT, will publish a series of how-to guides and blogs over the next few weeks to help the community to take control of their network. These will include guidance on how to become an active participant in the ecosystem including how to vote and how to stake on&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Keep an eye on KILT’s <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> to follow these exciting developments and to learn how to become an active member of the KILT community!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials.

				 10.11.2021 Die Zukunft gehört digitalen Identitäten  <p>Der Fachartikel “Elektronische Gesundheitskarte auf dem Prüfstand: Die Zukunft gehörte digitalen Identitäten” ist als Titelstory in der aktuellen Ausgabe der E-HEALTH-COM, dem unabhängigen Fachmagazin für Gesundheitstelematik, vernetzte Medizintechnik, Telemedizin und Health-IT für Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz erschienen. In dem Beitrag von Christian Hälker, Michael Hartmann und Dominik Deimel geht es um die Lösung des sicheren Zugriffs auf die Gesundheitsdatenautobahn ohne elektronische Gesundheitskarte.</p><p>„Ohne eGK in die TI“: Mit dieser Herausforderung startete Ende 2020 der Verband der Privaten Krankenversicherung (PKV Verband) ein Innovationsprojekt zu digitalen Identitäten. Es findet mittlerweile große Aufmerksamkeit und könnte die Zukunft der deutschen Telematikinfrastruktur entscheidend mitprägen.</p><p>In einer Marktrecherche im zweiten Halbjahr 2020 hat sich der PKV-Verband mit unterschiedlichen Ansätzen bei der Realisierung digitaler Identitäten in der Branche beschäftigt und sich für eine Innovationspartnerschaft mit den Firmen msg systems ag und comuny entschieden.</p><p>Seit Februar 2021 arbeiten diese beiden Unternehmen zusammen mit den privaten Krankenversicherungen Allianz, Debeka, Signal Iduna und mit Beteiligung der gematik unter der Koordination des PKV-Verbands an der technischen Realisierung der Lösung zum Zugang zur TI ohne eGK. Im August hat sich diesem Projekt auch die BARMER als erste gesetzliche Krankenversicherung angeschlossen und im September dann die ERGO/DKV als weitere PKV, um den Einsatz des Lösungsansatzes für ihre Versicherten zu eruieren.</p><p>Ziel ist, Identitäten auf dem Mobilgerät komfortabel zu erzeugen und zu nutzen. Der Anspruch der PKV an digitale Identitäten ist hoch, sie müssen sicher sein und dem Konzept der gematik zum föderierten Identitätsmanagement entsprechen. Danach sollen mit einem Zugang viele digitale Lösungen in der TI erreichbar sein.</p><p>Die Ende September abgeschlossene Konzeptions- und technische Umsetzungsphase konnte allen Beteiligten die Machbarkeit und die Vorteile eines IDP-Lösungsansatzes mit Datenhaltung und Prozesssteuerung auf dem Mobilgerät aufzeigen. Das Innovationsprojekt konnte aufzeigen, dass die Einführung von physischen eGK-Diensten wie E-Rezept und ePA für private Krankenversicherer nicht zwangsläufig notwendig sein wird. Jeder Versicherer stellt zukünftig einen Identitätsprovider bereit, lässt diesen hierfür bei der gematik zu und betreibt ihn anschließend entkoppelt von eigenen Fachanwendungen wie zum Beispiel der ePA […].</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/EHC_Sonderdruck_Digitale-Identitaeten_PKV-Verband_Online.pdf">Weiterlesen?

<p><br>Another day, another data breach! &nbsp;It's the reason why Bloom was founded and why we feel so passionately about what we build. &nbsp;These breaches will just continue to happen until we shift the paradigm from centrally stored personal data to models built around decentralized identity. &nbsp;Let’s take a look at the facts of this latest breach.<br></p><p>Robinhood Data Breach Compromises Names and Email Addresses of Millions of Customers<br></p><p>On November 3, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a> released a statement that an unauthorized intruder gained access to the personal information of millions of its customers. &nbsp;The data breach compromised the email addresses of approximately five million people, and separately, the full names of around two million people. &nbsp;Further evidence shows that a smaller number of customers may have had additional personal information exposed.<br></p><p>Based on the on-going investigation, it appears social security numbers and bank account data were not breached, and that there has been no financial loss to any customers. &nbsp;The incident is still under investigation and Robinhood has enlisted the help of law enforcement, as well as Mandiant, a cybersecurity company. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Robinhood’s data breach is just the latest attack in a year that has seen a record number of breaches. &nbsp;Despite the knowledge that a cybersecurity-related incident was likely, an intruder was able to easily bypass Robinhood’s security system, compromising the information of millions of customers who had put their trust in the company.<br></p><p>Why does this keep happening? &nbsp;When are users going to start to demand that every company they deal with not store their personal information centrally? &nbsp;Decentralization is the future - not just for transactions, but for personal data storage and interactions. &nbsp;Download the Bloom App if you haven't already done so and see why over a million other users believe that their personal information should be theirs. &nbsp;And if you're a business, sign up for an <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp Demo</a> and see what it could mean for your business. &nbsp;It’s time to be proactive about our digital identity.<br></p><p>Data Breaches Reach an All-time High in 2021<br></p><p>As we approach the holiday season, the days are getting shorter, shopping receipts are getting longer, and cybersecurity threats are at an all time high. &nbsp;In fact, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), the number of data breaches so far this year has already <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/identity-theft-resource-center-to-share-latest-data-breach-analysis-with-u-s-senate-commerce-committee-number-of-data-breaches-in-2021-surpasses-all-of-2020/">surpassed the total for 2020</a>. &nbsp;This is extremely alarming news and worrisome as we approach the time of the year when online shopping is at its peak, and more of our personal information is available on the web.<br></p><p>As of now, there have been over 1,290 data breaches - up by 17% since last year. &nbsp;With the exponential growth in the connectivity of cyber devices, and the vulnerability of a centralized intermediary, cybersecurity is more important than ever. &nbsp;Phishing and ransomware attacks continue to be the most prevalent weapons for hackers, and the firm Cybersecurity Ventures estimate that a new ransomware attack will occur every 2 seconds. &nbsp;Ransomware is a criminal extortion tool in which key files are encrypted by hackers, rendering them inaccessible to the victim until a ransom has been paid. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Although ransomware is not a new tactic, the expanded attack surfaces and interconnectivity of digital commerce have made the cybersecurity threat as dangerous as ever. &nbsp;Hackers, constantly seeking new avenues to exploit, are now demanding payments in the form of cryptocurrency. &nbsp;The US Treasury Department has tied approximately $5.2 billion in BitCoin transactions to ransomware payments. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Awareness and Transparency<br></p><p>Cybersecurity is all about risk management. &nbsp;As the number of threats increases, more and more Americans are expressing concern that their personal information, or that of the centralized financial institutions to which they are associated, is at risk. &nbsp;The problem, though, is this: awareness does not necessarily lead to action. &nbsp;Too often, people assume that cybercrime is someone else’s responsibility, and believe that a hack will never affect them personally. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Furthermore, some organizations and governments have purposefully been withholding important data breach notices. &nbsp;In 2017, a ransomware attack called WannaCry, disrupted hospitals, schools, and government organizations in over 100 countries, demonstrating the vulnerability of globally-connected networks and devices. &nbsp;Although the WannaCry attack (and others, including CryptoLocker, WhiteRose, and Petya) was seen by some as a wake-up call, organizations and governments did not fortify against future attacks. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Significant Attacks in 2021<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the more significant attacks that have occurred just this year.<br></p>  Bonobos: In January, Bonobos, a men’s clothing retailer, was victim of a massive breach, in which personally identifiable information (PII) of over 7 million shoppers was leaked in a forum for hackers. &nbsp;The PII included address, phone numbers, account information, and partial credit card numbers.  Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn: Due to an unsecured database, the PII of 214 million social media users was leaked, exposing full names, subscriber data, location, and other contact information.  CNA Insurance: Hackers in March attacked CNA, one of the largest insurance firms in the US, compromising the data of around 75,000 employees, and leading to the halt of trading for a short period of time. &nbsp;CNA Insurance agreed to pay the hackers $40 million to regain access to their ransomed network.  National Basketball Association: This year, the NBA was targeted by a ransomware attack, with the group responsible claiming that they had stolen 500gb of confidential data.  Buffalo Public Schools: Unfortunately, cyberattacks within the education sector are also becoming more prevalent, and in March the Buffalo Public Schools suffered a ransomware attack that targeted highly sensitive information for the 34,000 students within the school district.<br>  <p>As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough for people, hospitals and healthcare facilities have also become increasingly prone to cyber attacks. &nbsp;Often these critical facilities are forced to comply for fear of shutting down their medical operations. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Securing our digital identities is a universal problem. &nbsp;The interconnectivity of the world we live in means that cyberthreats will continue to impact our lives, and although awareness is increasing, so too is the complexity of the targeted attacks. &nbsp;Information shared with a centralized entity is vulnerable to a breach, as the user loses control of precisely who has their personal data. So, what can be done to mitigate the risk?<br></p><p>The Bloom Solution<br></p><p>Taking proactive measures is a good place to start. &nbsp;Staying hyper-vigilant to cyber trends and utilizing new and emerging tools to help with compliance and risk will certainly help to avoid an attack. &nbsp;Bloom offers a solution for digital identity, user privacy, and risk assessment. &nbsp;In fact, Bloom was founded in response to the 2017 Equifax scandal, in which hackers gained access to the private information of 147 million US citizens. &nbsp;By developing the BloomID, Bloom gave its users the ability to create and control their own digital identities. &nbsp;More recently, with the release of OnRamp, our latest DeFi-focused product, we are securely connecting enterprises to users by offering reusable, verifiable credentials to help enable compliance and risk assessment. &nbsp;This means that your personal information and financial data, used in determining creditworthiness, are available to use on a decentralized platform without sacrificing your privacy. &nbsp;<br></p> Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all with one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>,,Auf meinem Bildschirm sehen Sie sechs Menschen‘‘, sagte Frank Puscher. ,,Einige mögen Ihnen sympathischer sein, andere weniger. Was beachtenswert ist: keiner dieser Menschen existiert in echt.‘‘ Unter diesem Eindruck begann die Vortragsreihe zum Thema: ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘. Am 4. November 2021 luden das BMWi, BMJ und VDE ein, um über exakt dieses Thema virtuell zu diskutieren, Lösungen zu präsentieren, und auf die Fragen der 103 Teilnehmenden einzugehen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der erste Teil der Fachkonferenz begann mit einer Einführung in die Problemstellung: Es ging zum einen um Fake Reviews im Internet, zum anderen um eine Einführung in das Thema Deep Fakes – eine Mischung von Deep Learning und Fakes. Anschließend gab es Impulsvorträge zu der Kernfrage: Wie schützen wir den politischen Diskurs in Zeiten der Aufmerksamkeitsökonomie? Hier wurden die Herausforderungen bei der Regulierung von Deep Fakes herausgestellt und Beispiele aus der Gegenwart. Im zweiten Teil der Konferenz ging es konkret um die Frage: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Impulsvorträge griffen diese Frage von verschiedenen Ansätzen auf und zeigten Ideen für den möglichen Umgang und Regulierungen von Deep Fakes. &nbsp;</p>



 Teil 1: Wie sieht die Problemstellung aus? KI als globaler Trend.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>Ab wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?</p></blockquote>



<p>Künstliche Intelligenz nimmt mehr Raum in Diskursen ein. Ob in der Altenbetreuung, beim Auftritt in Lernvideos oder Beantworten von Kundenfragen, KI Klone werden uns wohl immer häufiger in der nahen Zukunft begegnen. Dabei handelt es sich durchaus nicht um etwas Exotisches: Eingebettet in unsere Gesellschaft handelt es sich um eine Software, die bereits jeder nutzen kann. Ein anschauliches Beispiel verdeutlicht, dass virtuelle KI Klone sogar CO2 sparen könnten. Wenn Prominente ein Double von sich erstellen, könnten sie zur selben Zeit an verschiedenen Orten sein und müssten nicht selbst reisen. Das führt zwangsläufig zu der Kernfrage: Ist das schlimm? Wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betrachtet man die Rolle von KI in Deutschland fällt zunächst auf: so weit verbreitet wie in anderen Ländern ist es hier nicht. Bereits 2018 benannte eine Studie des Roland-Koch Instituts die USA als führende Nation im Bereich KI. Vom Amazon Go Supermarket, in welchem man ohne Angestellte, Kasse, und Barcode-Scanner einkaufen kann, bis hin zu KI Klonen, die Termine beim Friseur ausmachen: die USA zeigen Ausschnitte einer Welt, die hier noch nicht Realität, aber definitiv Zukunft sein kann (<a href="https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718">https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doch noch ist es hierzulande weniger verbreitet. Auswirkungen von KI gestützter Fakes auf den politischen Diskurs sind überschaubar, dafür im Handel jedoch mehr ausgeprägt. So lässt sich ein Problemfeld von Fake Reviews im Internet deutlich erkennen: Die negativen Folgen von durch Bots kreierter Fake Reviews kreieren die Gefahr, seriöse Anbieter:innen nicht mehr zu erkennen, ein allgemeines Zurückgehen von Vielfalt, und das Abhängen neuerer Plattformen. Wie eine Studie herausstellte, haben 85% aller befragten Händler:innen bereits negative Auswirkungen auf ihre Verkaufszahlen erlebt – durch Fake Reviews. Problematisch hierbei sind vor allem das Fehlen eines Unrechtsbewusstseins und eine effektivere Rechtsdurchsetzung.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Man sieht: die Grenzen zwischen Realität und Künstlicher Intelligenz vermischen. Ebenfalls ist zu erkennen, dass es sich um ein zukünftiges Problem handelt, welches definitiv Auswirkungen annehmen wird. Freilich bringt das Vorteile mit sich, aber jede Münze hat zwei Seiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fokussierte man sich in der Fachkonferenz auf das mögliche Ausmaß von KI, wenn keine Regulierungen vorliegen. Auch wenn es sich noch um Zukunftsszenarien handelt, sind negative Folgen bereits absehbar. Diese ziehen sich von der individuellen Ebene (Verletzung von Menschenrechten, Psychologischen Folgen), über die Wirtschaftliche Ebene (Versicherungs- oder Steuerbetrug) bis hin zur ganzen Gesellschaft (Verletzung demokratischer Werte). Kompliziert wird es weiterhin, wenn man die Anonymität der Täter:innen bedenkt oder die rechtlichen Herausforderungen. Das Paradox liegt hierbei zwischen Rechten wie Kunstfreiheit und staatlichen Pflichten, nämlich dem Schutz von Persönlichkeitsrechten. Selbstverständlich ist auch das Erkennen von KI Klonen oder automatisierter Bots nicht immer einfach. Als Bot gilt ein Account, der mehr als 50 Tweets pro Tag twittert. In einer vorgestellten Studie wurde ein Twitter Account eines kanadischen Ingenieurs untersucht, der im Durchschnitt über 300 Tweets pro Tag twitterte. Wie allerdings festgestellt wurde, handelte es sich hierbei allerdings nicht um einen automatisierten Account, sondern um einen echten Menschen. Alles sind Herausforderungen, denen die Regierung sich definitiv wird stellen müssen. KI ist ein globaler Trend, der sich weiterentwickelt.&nbsp;</p>



 Teil 2: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Die Rolle von SSI.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>,,Wir stehen hier – wie in vielen anderen Bereichen – Infrastrukturfragen gegenüber. Individuelle Pflichten sind da ein winziger Anteil; der Löwenanteil liegt bei systemischen Veränderungen.‘‘ </p>Irene Adamski</blockquote>



<p>Wie herausgestellt, stellt KI aktuell keine Gefahr da. Diese besteht vorwiegend im Bereich von Fake Reviews im Internet und der Verbreitung gefälschter Inhalte durch KI-Klone. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Mitte von Schwierigkeiten liegen die Lösungen. Derlei gibt es einige, und auch Jolocom hat am Donnerstag den von uns verfolgten Ansatz vorstellen dürfen: Selbst-Souveräne Identitäten (SSI) im digitalen Raum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu seinen und ihren Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen. Globale Entwicklungen zeigen den Vorwärts-Trend von KI-Anwendungen. Auch auf EU-Ebene gibt es Ambitionen, digitale Identifikationsnachweise auszugeben. Die eIDAS Verordnung strebt eine digitale Identität an, die von jedem Mitgliedsstaat herausgegeben und von den anderen Mitgliedsstaaten anerkannt werden müssen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es ist wichtig, an der Wurzel des Problems anzusetzen und Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum auszubauen. Dieses Vertrauen kann vor allem durch SSI hergestellt werden.  &nbsp;</p>

Ontology Technical Director, Ning Hu, was invited to participate in the second hardcore technology sharing BeWater Live held by Bewater Community, top developer community of China, sharing content on the theme “From 2D Social Network to 3D Social Network” for technology enthusiasts.  Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, shared her opinion in the article “<a href="https://beincrypto.com/women-and-web-3-0-experts-weigh-in-on-community-and-financial-freedom/">Women and Web 3.0 — Experts Weigh-In On Community and Financial Freedom</a>”, published in BeInCrypto. She said decentralized finance offers more opportunities for authentic creativity and boundary-breaking, and women’s role in the redefinition of what finance is, is&nbsp;key.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>CoinDesk — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/22/why-us-policymakers-should-embrace-web-3/">Why US Policymakers Should Embrace Web&nbsp;3</a></p><blockquote>Big tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.</blockquote><p>When people talk about Web3, it is often difficult to circumvent a puzzle: how to protect their own identity and privacy data while also being connected with the real world? In order to solve this confusion and to prepare people for the Web3 explosion, Ontology proposed the decentralized digital identity (DID) solution, ONT ID. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 So long, View Engine! 

<p>With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.</p>

<p>The way you can now create components dynamically is an example of how this release simplifies existing capabilities. Dynamic components are components loaded at runtime. You might use this when you need to tailor visible components based on responses from a server call. Previously, to dynamically create components, you had to use the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code>. Now the API takes the Component type directly. Let’s look at how this works.</p>

 Set up the Authorization Server 

<p>In my example, I am authenticating using OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect through Okta. In my Okta Authorization Server, I added a custom claim named <code>pet_preference</code> to my identity token. Does this sound only vaguely familiar? Refresh your understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect by reading “<a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/10/29/things-to-keep-in-mind-about-auth">The Things to Keep in Mind about Auth</a>”.</p>

<p>With this custom claim, I want to display dynamic components specific to the value. The app uses the claim value to rotate through images of pets that match their preference.</p>

 Prepare the components 

<p>To write something like this, you’ll first create components for the customized views of different pets that all implement the same interface, such as one named <code>PreferenceComponentInterface</code>. The interface has a property named <code>data</code> so you can pass in customized information. You’ll also need to get the <code>pet_preference</code> custom claim value and retrieve content specifically for it. Once you have the data for the preferred pet, you can add the code to create dynamic components.</p>

 Implement the dynamic component creation 

<p>Create a <code>Directive</code> to house the view.</p>

   <code>import { Directive, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appPreference]'
})

export class PreferenceDirective {
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }
}
</code>   

<p>And a container component that handles the dynamic creation of the component. I simplified the code snipped to focus on the v13 change. In an upcoming post, I’ll do a complete walkthrough of creating this application.</p>

   <code>class PreferenceItem {
  component: Type&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;;
  info: any;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-secret-preference',
  template: `&lt;ng-template appPreference&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;`
 })

export class SecretPreferenceComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild(PreferenceDirective, {static: true}) private host!: PreferenceDirective;
  
  private preferences: PreferenceItem[] = [{
    component: MyCustomComponent,
    info: 'example'
  }, {
    component: MyOtherCustomComponent,
    info: {
      isTrue: true
    }
  }];
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {
    const preferredItem = this.preferences[0];
    const compRef = this.host.viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;(preferredItem);
    compRef.instance.data = preferredItem.info;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Notice you didn’t have to inject the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code> to do this. The API is more straightforward to use. A more realistic use case might be a custom claim for the department and displaying customized content based on the authenticated user’s department.</p>

 Clean-up after each test 

<p>Testing Angular apps is much improved in v13, and better cleanup of the DOM between tests is the new default. Now, Angular does a better job of cleaning up the DOM, and tests run faster and more performantly with better isolation between tests.</p>

<p>The clean-up behavior is configurable when configuring or resetting the <code>TestBed</code>. Let’s look at an example test where we greet the user after they’ve logged in.</p>

<p>Component code</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  template: `
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;Welcome {{name}}!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/ng-container&gt;
  `
})

export class ProfileComponent {
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? 'stranger')
  );

  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Test code</p>

   <code>describe('ProfileComponent', () =&gt; {
  let component: ProfileComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;ProfileComponent&gt;;

  let authStateSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj&lt;OktaAuthStateService&gt;([], { authState$: of(authState) });

  beforeEach(() =&gt; {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ ProfileComponent ],
      providers: [
        { provide: OktaAuthStateService, useValue: authStateSpy }
      ],
      teardown: { destroyAfterEach: false } // flakey tests!
    });
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes the user by name', () =&gt; {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
      
    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome Test Name!');
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes a user with no name', () =&gt; {
    (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(authStateSpy, 'authState$')?.get as jasmine.Spy).and.returnValue(of({
      isAuthenticated: true,
      idToken: {...idToken, claims: {sub: 'sub'}}
    }));
      
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();

    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome stranger!');
  });
});
</code>   

<p>We can configure the teardown cleanup in this test suite by changing the value of <code>destroyAfterEach</code>. With this change enabled by default, you have the option of writing new tests with better performance. Plus, you can disable the default for tests that aren’t ready to consume the changes. Angular has our backs on non-breaking updates!</p>

 Enhanced developer tooling 

<p>Creating Angular apps is now easier with developer tooling enhancements and compilation time improvements.</p>

<p>The first thing you might notice is how much faster the build time is. A lot of work went into improving the build time. By adding <a href="https://angular.io/cli/cache">a build cache</a>, the Angular team found build time improvements of up to 65+%!</p>

<p>The Angular Language Service’s tooling improvement to auto-apply optional chaining feels like a small thing but is such an appreciated feature. I can focus on the object property I want to use, and the tooling handles the optional chaining for me!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: The example demo shown above is for demonstration purposes, and exaggerates capabilities to showcase the new feature. Please remember to apply sound software development practices to your real-world applications.</p>

 So long, Internet Explorer! 

<p>In this release, we also say goodbye to Internet Explorer. <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840">Dropping Internet Explorer support</a> means lots of doors open up for new features, refactoring the code base, and keeping up with security best practices. With extra polyfills, you can use Okta’s Auth JS library in Internet Explorer, but the recommendation is to migrate away from it.</p>

 All the Angular v13 details 

<p>These are the features that I found most interesting, but there are lots more in Angular v13! You can read more about them in the <a href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-v13-is-now-available-cce66f7bc296">Angular team’s blog post</a>. You can read about the changes in the new version of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary">RxJS</a>.</p>

 Upcoming changes 

<p>Angular keeps improving and growing. The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap">subsequent releases</a> should prove exciting, with features such as strict typing for forms and standalone components in the works.</p>

<p>Due to the ID-Wallet project in Germany, some articles and comments have equated Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) with blockchain technology in the last few weeks. The impression is given that SSI only works in conjunction with a blockchain. Spoiler, that’s not the case.<br>In the following, I will try to explain why this is not the case in a simplified way.</p>



<p><br>The term blockchain is used in this article to represent all Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). Including all public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, permissioned / public and permissioned / private Blockchains.</p>



<p>What does decentralized mean in Decentralized Digital Identities (aka SSI)?</p>



<p>The “decentralized” doesn’t refer to Blockchains. Decentralized means that a person’s data is stored with the person and is under their control. Most of the time, the information is stored on the smartphone, on a so-called wallet. An SSI wallet also has nothing to do with storing cryptocurrencies. Conventional Digital Identity systems store the data and information centrally on the server of the provider.</p>



<p>Private and public key, what is it?</p>



<p>SSI is only possible due to cryptography. One of the cornerstones is asymmetric encryption. A key pair is generated using a cryptographic method. The key pair consists of a public and a private key. As the names suggest, the private key must remain private, and the public key can be shared with the broader public You can do two things with the key pair:</p>



  You can encrypt a message. <br>Encryption is done with the public key and decryption with the private one.  You can sign a file. <br>The signature is made with the private key, and the signature is verified with the public key.  



<p>The signature function is essential for further explanation.</p>



<p>SSI and digital signatures.</p>



<p>In an SSI system, an issuer generates the data (e.g. a driver’s licence), digitally signs it and transfers it to the holder. The holder can send the signed data or only parts of it to a verifier. The verifier can use the issuer’s public key to check the authenticity of the data.</p>



<p>How does the verifier get the public key?</p>



<p>For the verifier to be able to check the data, he needs the issuer’s public key. But how does he get it? In conventional systems, such as SSL certificates, a central point is contacted. Our browser asks a registration authority whether the website’s certificate is registered. In this way, our browser ensures that we are not on a fake page. The disadvantage is that the process depends on a central service and collects information about the activities.</p>



<p>Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain.</p>



<p>A Blockchain can be used to store and query the public key. It should be emphasized that the Blockchain alone does not provide any security whether the stored key comes from the specified issuer. It must be guaranteed that the issuer is who he claims to be. This cannot be achieved by technology alone. In addition, organizational and process specifications must be defined. This is called governance or a trust framework. But this is a different topic and would go beyond the scope of this article.<br>The theoretical advantage of a Blockchain is that it is decentralized, and theoretically, every verifier can keep a copy of a Blockchain node, ensuring that he does not have to contact a central service. In reality, however, the query is usually made by a central service that itself operates a node and provides the information.</p>



<p>Can other storage locations than Blockchains be used for the public keys?</p>



<p>Yes, you can. It would even be possible to use existing PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures). It only has to be ensured that privacy of the holder is ensured and that no third party receives information about the use of the data. Another aspect is the dependence on a central service. If this stops the service or deletes individual keys, the key cannot be verified anymore. These aspects must be taken into account in the design of a trust framework. Here again, decentralized technologies could be helpful …</p>



<p>The following graphic shows an example in which 2 documents from 2 different exhibitors are checked by one auditor. The first issuer, in this case, a bank, uses a Blockchain network to store the public key. The second issuer, an authority, uses an existing PKI.</p>



For a bigger picture, <a href="http://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/process_EN.png">click here</a>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>In the past two years, the SSI community has emancipated itself from Blockchain technology. It has been recognized that a Blockchain is not necessarily a prerequisite for realizing Self Sovereign Identity. And there is not “the one” Blockchain network on which an SSI system has to be built. It doesn’t matter which one, as long as it meets security and operational standards.<br>It is also difficult for authorities, for example, to abandon their current PKI implementations. Furthermore, it can therefore make sense to use existing PKIs.</p>



<p>Jolocom considers these requirements and develops its next generation of SSI technology independent of the underlying storage, PKI or Blockchain networks. Any storage location can be linked.<br>More important than the technology used is the definition of the organization and the processes so that a secure PKI and the highest level of privacy is guaranteed for the citizens.</p>

 The <a href="https://shyftfederation.com/federation">Shyft Node Federation</a>, consisting of all validators for the Shyft Network, publicly signed off on voting guidelines and node rights and responsibilities. <p>It’s official: <a href="https://coinshares.com/">CoinShares</a>, <a href="https://www.maven11.com/">Maven11</a>, Fabric, ClicketyClack, Connect Capital, AD Node, <a href="https://stakingteam.com/">Staking Team</a>, Merkle Trading, <a href="https://blockunity.com/">BlockUnity</a>, Paycase Financial, <a href="https://defi.tech/">DeFi Technologies</a>, Mempool Partners, Nodebased, NP IR, among others, have signed off on the <a href="https://shyftfederation.com/docs/shyft-federation-constitution.pdf">Shyft Node Federation Constitution</a> — the guidelines for node governance of Shyft Network. The Constitution outlines responsibilities, voting guidelines, and ground rules that enable improvement protocols and a framework for new nodes to enter the Network. The Federation Constitution is also a resource for the Shyft Network community to stay informed on the rules that guide the Network and federation members’ expected duties and responsibilities for the months&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>The Federation Constitution details the current rights, duties, penalties, and authorities for members. Members can seal transactions as a Validator on the Chain upon signing of the Constitution, with each validator entitled to one vote per matter, including the option to propose additions or amendments to the Constitution. Additionally, members have the right to verify current network configurations and performance. As incentivization for their duties, members will receive SHFT for their performance at a rate of 7 SHFT per block&nbsp;sealed.</p><p>The Constitution also outlines Federation duties regarding commitment to ensuring the security of the Chain and individual Node Operations. Federation members agree to sealing blocks, remaining online, and deploying critical security-related software updates upon signing. Federation members also must generate applications, onboard new users, and support ongoing use cases that leverage the Chain. Members are also required to uphold the common good of the Federation through their public messaging activity, with specific guidelines around the release of financial advice in public forums. Additional duties outline governance participation for members pertaining to the potential risk of removal, notification of validator transfer, and confidentiality agreements. If Federation members fail to uphold their duties, the Constitution specifies penalties, including Member review and potential loss of&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The Federation must adhere to a common set of principles to execute on the mechanics agreed upon by the supermajority of its members. Principles include managing DAO mechanics in existing smart contract and on-chain voting systems, addition and/or removal of Validator keys (with specific voting parameters), and specifications on proposed changes, if applicable, to protocol code on Github. In closing, the Constitution outlines potential Amendments to the Constitution, including guidance on proposal endorsements, review/committal timelines for amendments, and voting necessities for the passing or failure of suggested amendments.</p><p>By making these rules, guidelines, penalties, and opportunities public, Shyft Network is implementing a more transparent and trustworthy environment for Federation members to navigate and capitalize on their obligations and opportunities. As an innovative public constitution focused on building Proof-of-authority (PoA) in blockchain, Shyft Network is creating opportunities for Federation members to become successful validators by incentivizing good participation through the attachment of reputation to identity a sector. As a more secure and robust alternative than PoS (proof-of-stake) when considering the distribution of trust across private and public networks, the guidelines in the Constitution create the best possible framework for Federation Members to uphold their duties for the betterment of the Network and their own position.</p><p>The entire Shyft Network team would like to recognize and express gratitude to the entire Node Federation member network, who, upon signing this Constitution, demonstrate their commitment to the highest level of trust in blockchain, our Network, and community.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out the Federation Website (<a href="https://shyftfederation.com/federation">The Federation | Shyft Federation</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/fMMeQ9ck">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

 GiD Report#185 — What the future of identity looks&nbsp;like <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-184-every-company-is-an-identity-company-4422ca3f3ccb">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The future of identity will be portable and decentralized  Why we should care about our&nbsp;data  Cartoon of the week — Metaverse edition  Tweet of the week — What constitutes ownership?  Stuff happens   1. The future of identity will be portable and decentralized <p>This week, we’ve got a great long read via <a href="http://global.id/toddjcollins">/toddjcollins </a>— <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">an in-depth piece by Kei Kreutler analyzing the state of digital identity and where it might go in the context of&nbsp;web3</a>:</p><blockquote>Whether it’s the enforcement of legal identities, platform lock-in, or more implicit social norms, the logic of individualized identity was baked into web 2.0. With the advent of web 3.0, we have a chance to do things differently. Ultimately, web 3.0 identity will revolve around questions of privacy, portability, and ownership. Beyond such clearly contentious issues, we still have the ability to imagine more, with a reinvigorated array of tools in our hands for thinking through identity. One of these tools is multi-signature accounts, which are accounts that can provide identity collections for individuals, groups, or organizations. Embracing more than the normative individual as a fundamental unit of account, such a paradigm could better serve the creation of resilient, accountable, and mutualistic institutions leading into the twenty-first century.</blockquote><p>Kreutler covers everything from SSI to DIDs to NFTs to DAOs. If those terms don’t make a ton of sense to you, then <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">you’ve found yourself some productive evening reading</a>. Notably, Kreutler believes that smart, interoperable identity will underpin the so-called Metaverse — which got a big bump in relevance recently with Facebook’s branding and strategic pivot.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://avc.com/2021/10/web3-vs-web2/">Web3 vs Web2 — AVC</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewharris/2021/10/22/a-complete-revolution/">The Future Of Money: A Complete Revolution</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-files-to-sell-digital-sneakers-as-it-seeks-downloadable-kicks-11635873070">Nike Files to Sell Digital Sneakers, as It Seeks Downloadable Kicks</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-papers-show-a-company-locked-in-zuckerbergs-stranglehold">Facebook Papers Show a Company Locked in Zuckerberg’s Stranglehold</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/mythical-games-hits-unicorn-status-with-150m-round/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Mythical Games Hits Unicorn Status with $150M Round — Blockworks</a>   2. Why we should care about our&nbsp;data <p>First up, Facebook is ditching its facial recognition program, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-shut-down-facial-recognition-in-photos-videos-11635874174?mod=djem10point">the WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook said it is shutting down its facial-recognition system in the coming weeks, scrapping a feature that has developed into a key tool for sharing photos on social media but has raised concerns among privacy advocates and regulators.</blockquote><blockquote>The move continues a dramatic reshaping of the tech giant in recent weeks, which includes pausing the development of an Instagram for children product and a rebranding of the entire company to Meta Platforms Inc. to focus on a future beyond social&nbsp;media.</blockquote><blockquote>People who have opted into facial-recognition service will no longer be automatically recognized in video and photo content, according to Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at Meta, formerly Facebook Inc. He said the social-media platform would also delete data related to the faces of more than one billion&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>In related news, Australia is pretty much done with Clearview AI, ordering them to delete all data belonging to Australians, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete">the Verge&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to destroy all images and facial templates belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator.</blockquote><blockquote>Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was trialled by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) between October 2019 and March&nbsp;2020.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair,” said OAIC privacy commissioner Angelene Falk in a press statement. “It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.”</blockquote><p>This one is a bit stickier and goes to the heart of the debate around what constitutes public data — and if that data is public, shouldn’t it be accessible by&nbsp;anyone?</p><p>If you accept that to be true, it speaks toward individual responsibility around privacy and oversharing. Our personal data is incredibly important and we should probably think twice before offering it to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-shut-down-facial-recognition-in-photos-videos-11635874174?mod=djem10point">Facebook to Shut Down Facial Recognition in Photos,&nbsp;Videos</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete">Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</a>   3.

Tweet of the week — What constitutes ownership? <p>As much as blockchain maximalists might have you believe, a private key does not necessarily constitute ownership. We’re human beings living in a society under the rule of law. If someone’s car keys fall out of their pocket at the park and you pick them up, you don’t suddenly own their car. All you have are someone else’s car&nbsp;keys.</p><p>We saw this play out in the world of NFTs last week when <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinbecerra/status/1454328591202721796">three of Calvin Becerra’s Bored Apes were&nbsp;stolen</a>:</p><p>Of course, just because something you own was stolen doesn’t mean they aren’t still yours — though, apparently, this is a contentious issue to&nbsp;some:</p><p>As it played out, the community disagreed. Major NFT exchanges including OpenSea pledged to lock the NFTs making it impossible for the thieves to cash&nbsp;out.</p><p>This story has a happy ending — eventually, all three Bored Apes were <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinbecerra/status/1457725639344021522">returned to their rightful owner</a>.

They’re the latest in a line of such projects that dates back to CryptoPunks and Crypto Kitties, both of which launched in&nbsp;2017.</blockquote>  What they’re saying: “The project’s name, Bored Ape Yacht Club, represents a club for people who got rich quick by ‘aping in’ — crypto slang for investing big in something unsure — and, thusly, are too bored to do anything but create memes,” writes Rolling Stone’s Samantha&nbsp;Hissong.  <blockquote>By the numbers: Bored apes have gone from nothing to a billion-dollar ecosystem in less than a year, with one ape selling for $3.4 million at Sotheby’s.</blockquote>  The 277-year-old auction house called its image “an NFT with historical significance,” on the grounds that only 100 apes have gold&nbsp;fur.  <p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bayc-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-interview-1250461/">How Four NFT Novices Created a Billion-Dollar Ecosystem of Cartoon&nbsp;Apes</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/04/fc-barcelona-joins-nft-rush-with-moments-from-122-years-of-history/">FC Barcelona Joins NFT Rush With Moments From 122 Years of&nbsp;History</a>   5.

Description: This week we welcome Kevin Sellers, our Chief Marketing Officer here at Ping Identity. When he’s not traveling the world, Kevin is leading the charge of our marketing efforts to be sure Ping is connecting with its users and championing truth, trust, and identity. Kevin talks about his transition from Intel into the identity space and what he’s learned, why partnering with Terry Crews was great for the brand, and his tips for brands looking to stand out and convey their uniqueness. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [3:00] Kevin talks about what he learned at Intel Inside about creating an emotional response and teaching consumers to think not only about what it is they are buying, but what goes inside, how it’s made, and how this makes a difference. [5:14] The identity world now can look like what Kevin calls the “sea of sameness.”Everyone talks about being the trusted solution. How does Ping Identity stand out and convey its specialties and uniqueness? [5:45] In this digital-first world, we must understand who it is that we are engaging with, and that means truly knowing your identity and how it matters. [8:25] Identity is the foundation of all commerce. Kevin shares how brands can position themselves in a way that shows their unique value. [9:11] What is the differentiator for Ping? Kevin first talks about knowing the soul of the company, which is a combination of mission, culture, leadership, and values, and also strategy. [11:19] Ping Identity helps its users become champions, which is more of an emotional place where the team can position capability through more of an outcome orientation than a feature or rational product-based orientation. [12:50] How did Terry Crews come to be involved with Ping Identity, how did it help the brand, and what makes Terry so cool to work with as the Chief Identity Champion? How can brands decide if working with a spokesperson is right for them? [21:42] Our identity is like a fingerprint; it is unique to us and cannot be copied. Our credentials can, but our identity is unlike anyone else’s, and that is why it is  the foundation of any digital transformation.  [23:08]The evolution that was eye-opening to Kevin was how important and central identity and access management really is.   &nbsp; Quotes:    “There’s what you want to be for the market, and then what you are. Part of the journey is to really do a discovery of the soul of the company.”—Kevin   “Most people will listen to and engage with a message from a trusted person talking about a brand, far more than they do a brand talking about a brand.”—Kevin   “Be true to your soul, be true to who you are, tell the story well, and you’ll find that that marketing is actually a pretty cool thing. And it actually can make a difference in the trajectory of your company’s success.”—Kevin    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity KevinSellers TerryCrews

  <p>Ransomware Attacks have become the biggest single cyber risk for enterprises of any size and industry. Current surveys and KuppingerCole´s own research indicate a steep rise not only in the number of attacks, but as well in the average damage &nbsp;per incident. The dark side of digital is industrializing itself, turning ransomware into big business The question is no longer if and when your organization will be attacked, but whether and how successful the attackers will be. “Sophisticated recent ransomware attacks are fully aware of standard backup strategies and corrupt or destroy your one and only option to recover without paying the ransom.” says KuppingerCole´s Cybersecurity Lead Christopher Schütze. &nbsp;“The complexity of today´s multicloud environments require more than traditional backup &amp; restore approaches” he continues.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide you with an overview on the pillars of a proactively resiliient IT Infrastructure. Starting with an individual ransomware resilience assessment, each participant will (individually and anonymously) benchmark the resilience of her organization against ransomware attacks, relative to the average value of the whole group that conducted the assessment. The key topics of this workshop will be:</p>
 
 The state of ransomware, from a business and a technical perspective 
 The ransomware attack surface&nbsp; 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Preparation&nbsp; 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Protection 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Response&nbsp; 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Recovery&nbsp; 
 Your individual ransomware risk and what to do now

<p>After three years of research and development, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> secured a Kusama parachain slot and launched mainnet in September 2021, and is now in the last phase before decentralisation. Part of this final stage is to ensure that the KILT blockchain is resilient to hacker attacks and to get an overview of potential weaknesses in order to fix them before the network is decentralised. To achieve this, BOTLabs GmbH, the entity behind KILT Protocol, engaged Security Research Labs (SRLabs) to perform a security&nbsp;audit.</p> The Auditor <p><a href="https://www.srlabs.de/">SRLabs</a> is a cybersecurity consultancy and hacking research collective striving to make the world more secure. BOTLabs selected them for their <a href="https://www.srlabs.de/bites/blockchain-security-best-practices-for-your-next-review">methodological approach</a> and <a href="https://www.srlabs.de/bites/blockchain-security-six-common-mistakes-found-in-substate-chains">extensive experience</a> in auditing Kusama, Polkadot, Substrate-based chains, and many networks in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> Audit Scope <p>The aim of the security audit was to assess the KILT Protocol with regards to its resilience to hacking attempts and to get an overview of the most relevant weaknesses in order to fix them before the launch of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We engaged SRLabs to perform audits&nbsp;of:</p>  The KILT Blockchain  The KILT Software Development Kit (SDK), which enables an easy way for developers and third parties to build applications on the top of KILT&nbsp;Protocol  The Sporran Wallet, a browser extension which in its current version can receive, hold and send KILT Coins; soon it will also be used to manage KILT credentials.  <p>In order to effectively review the KILT codebase, SRLabs employed a threat model-driven code review strategy. For each identified threat, hypothetical attacks that can be used to realise the threat were developed. Prioritising by risk, the codebase or relevant pallets was assessed for existing protections against respective threats and attacks, as well as the vulnerabilities that make these attacks possible.</p><p>Karsten Nohl, SRLabs’ founder, adds: “Every blockchain system comes with new security challenges due to the unique business logic and implementation. Starting from threat modeling enables our testers to focus attention on the most promising hacking avenues. The collaboration with BOTLabs on securing KILT Protocol worked really&nbsp;well.”</p> Audit Results <p>During the audit, SRLabs identified eight issues including two with a high severity. These two issues were found in the areas of staking and were resolved by the KILT development team with the first runtime upgrade. The remaining six issues affecting the area of KILT functionality with a severity of moderate to low were fixed by the KILT development team in a subsequent runtime upgrade, in advance of full decentralisation and the availability of the KILT functionality.</p><p>“We selected SRLabs for their experience with top projects in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. We appreciated their methodological and collaborative approach, and plan additional audits with SRLabs as we continuously evaluate KILT Protocol security,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-protocol-completes-security-audit-with-srlabs-4d7130212cbd">KILT Protocol Completes Security Audit with SRLabs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 12th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealAbyss">Andrey Sher</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyRussian">Russian community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I learned about Ontology shortly after its founding in 2017. Ontology had a fresh take on Web3 and brought its own, new and unique product suite. Namely, the management and protection of user online identities and&nbsp;data.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I like the idea of ​​Ontology and its future prospects; renting cars, devices, real estate, and the ability to provide these services without an intermediary. I like their range of services very&nbsp;much.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I see an opportunity to help show people how their data is managed and controlled online! Once people realize how little control they currently have over their data, Ontology’s decentralized identity and data solutions become very attractive.</p><p>I like to be the first to receive information. And the opportunity to do what I like, which is helping people! Although, I began doing this long before I became Harbinger.</p> 4. Why is it important to you to be a part of the Ontology community? <p>I am very close to the ideas and goals of Ontology. I want to be at the forefront of decentralized identity adoption.</p> 5. How is the Ontology community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Our community is similar to other crypto communities in certain respects. However, one thing that stands out to me is that people who come to Ontology become loyal supporters forever.</p> 6. What do you use as your main channels for interacting with the Ontology community and why? Do you want to see&nbsp;more? <p>Most often I use Telegram, but I also actively communicate through other social networks on cryptocurrency channels. There are a lot of people in these groups and you can get new ideas and information, as well as help people learn more about Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share an unforgettable experience or something you learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a journalist? <p>There is access to the admin chat. There, the admins turn to each other for help and if you closely follow everything, then later, you won’t even need to ask, you will know a lot of subtleties. I would like to highlight DuMonT, he is a real pro and responds very&nbsp;quickly!</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Innovative, thoughtful, impactful.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology can expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less? What kinds of things do you see community members doing that you think have helped our community grow? <p>Of course, the first is advertising and cooperation with companies and the integration of ONT ID. The creation of new applications, especially related to GameFi, is also important. The community should share and recommend Ontology on social media and messenger apps.</p> 10. What do you see as key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help achieve&nbsp;them? <p>Ontology has a great future. I believe the project will continue to grow and improve. The sky’s the&nbsp;limit!</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>When you communicate with a Kubernetes cluster, using kubectl, or a client library, or a tool like <a href="https://kdash.cli.rs/">KDash</a>, you are primarily interacting with the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/">Kubernetes API server</a>.

 Why secure the API server? 

<p>The API server has multiple layers of security. By default, all communication with the API server uses TLS. Authentication is done using service account tokens, bearer tokens, basic authentication, a proxy, or client certificates, depending on the platform. In the case of PaaS like Amazon EKS, AKS, and GKE, it can also be done using custom authentication mechanisms. Once a request is authenticated, the API server can use one of several authorization mechanisms, like Attribute-based access control (ABAC) or Role-based access control (RBAC), to control access to resources. And finally, there are also admission control modules that can be configured to control resource modifications.</p>

<p>Since the API server is the only part of the Kubernetes cluster that a client can access, it is essential to secure the API server. Unauthorized access to the API server can lead to hijacking of the entire cluster, which also lets an attacker access all secrets and data accessible to the services running on it. Hence, configuring users and roles properly is a must to secure the cluster, especially in organizations where more than one user can access the cluster.</p>

 Why OpenID Connect? 

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/">OpenID Connect</a> is an authentication standard built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an additional token called an ID token. OpenID Connect also standardizes areas that OAuth 2.0 leaves open to choice, such as scopes, endpoint discovery, and dynamic registration of clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the default authentication mechanism of the Kubernetes API server might be enough for simple use cases, where only a handful of people manage the cluster, it does not scale for bigger organizations. Also, the default is definitely not the most secure way, because Kubernetes does not handle user management and expects it to be done outside. This is where OpenID Connect (OIDC) comes in. OIDC can manage users and groups, which works very well with the Kubernetes RBAC to provide very granular control of who can access what inside a cluster.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With an OIDC integration, you can use the same OIDC provider used for SSO in your existing infrastructure to access your Kubernetes cluster, like Okta or Keycloak.</p>

 Use Okta as an OIDC provider to secure the API server 

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications and enables developers to build identity controls into applications, websites, web services, and devices. Okta is a certified OpenID Connect provider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us see how we can secure the Kubernetes API server using Okta as an OIDC provider and use RBAC to control access from the Okta Admin Console. If you are using Amazon EKS, check out this <a>tutorial for using Okta OIDC with EKS</a>.</p>

 What you’ll need to get started 

<p>Before you try this out, make sure you have access to the following.</p>

 
   An Okta account. You can sign up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">free Okta account</a>. Or, you can use another OIDC provider or <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex">Dex</a>, and the steps should be similar. 
   A Kubernetes cluster. I’m using <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a> to run a local <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> cluster. You can use any Kubernetes distribution, including managed PaaS like Amazon EKS, AKS, and GKE, and so on. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a> installed on your machine. 
   <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli">Terraform</a> installed on your machine. This is not required if you do the Okta configuration via the <a href="https://login.okta.com/">Okta Admin Console</a> GUI. 
 

 Set up an Okta OIDC application and authorization server 

<p>You can achieve OIDC login for the cluster by creating a simple OIDC application with Okta either using the Okta CLI or the Admin Console. But with an OIDC application alone, you would have to use the client secret to authenticate from kubectl or any other client library. Authenticating with the client secret does not scale and is not better than default k8s authentication mechanisms, as you won’t have granular controls over users and roles. For a more helpful setup, we need an OIDC application and an authorization server with customized claims and policies for Kubernetes. This way, we can use Okta to manage users and permissions as well.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to set up an OIDC application and authorization server in Okta. If you prefer to do this via a GUI, then follow the steps in the <a>**Configure Your Okta Org ** section</a> of the article mentioned earlier, to do it via the Okta Admin Console.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use Terraform to configure the Okta part so that you can reuse the code for any automation required. Let’s dive into each step needed.</p>

 Set up Terraform 

<p>You can find the complete Terraform source code for this article in this <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-k8s-oidc-terraform-example">GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>First, we need to configure the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Okta Terraform provider</a>. Create a new Terraform file, let’s say <code>okta.main.tf</code>, and add the following:</p>

   <code>variable "base_url" {
  description = "The Okta base URL. Example: okta.com, oktapreview.com, etc. This is the domain part of your Okta org URL"
}
variable "org_name" {
  description = "The Okta org name. This is the part before the domain in your Okta org URL"
}
variable "api_token" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Okta API token, this will be read from environment variable (TF_VAR_api_token) for security"
  sensitive   = true
}

# Enable and configure the Okta provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    okta = {
      source  = "okta/okta"
      version = "~&gt; 3.15"
    }
  }
}

provider "okta" {
  org_name  = var.org_name
  base_url  = var.base_url
  api_token = var.api_token
}
</code>   

<p>You need to provide the input variables <code>org_name</code>, <code>base_url</code>, and <code>api_token</code>. Update these values in a file named <code>okta.config.auto.tfvars</code>. The <code>.auto</code> in the name is important; otherwise, Terraform will not pick it up automatically. For example, if the address of your Okta instance is <code>dev-1234.okta.com</code>, then your <code>org_name</code> would be <code>dev-1234</code>, and <code>base_url</code> would be everything that comes after the org name (e.g., okta.com).</p>

<p>Next, you will need to generate the <code>api_token</code> value. Log in to your Okta administrator console as a superuser and select Security &gt; API &gt; Tokens (Tab) from the navigation menu. Next, click the Create Token button, give your token a name, click Create Token, and copy the newly generated token. Save this in a separate <code>secret.auto.tfvars</code> file excluded from Git or in an environment variable named <code>TF_VAR_api_token</code>.</p>

<p>The Okta provider is now configured and ready to go.</p>

 Create groups 

<p>Now we need some groups to differentiate and map different kinds of users who want to access our clusters. Let’s say we have a group of administrators with full access to the cluster and another group of users who have limited access. You can have any number of groups as per your needs. The configuration below will create two groups. The group’s privileges will be defined using Kubernetes RBAC policies on the cluster, which we will do later.</p>

   <code># Set up OKTA groups
resource "okta_group" "k8s_admin" {
  name        = "k8s-admins"
  description = "Users who can access k8s cluster as admins"
}

resource "okta_group" "k8s_restricted_users" {
  name        = "k8s-restricted-users"
  description = "Users who can only view pods and services in default namespace"
}
</code>   

 Assign users to the groups 

<p>The below snippet looks up existing users and adds them to the groups. You can add any number of users at this stage, or you can skip adding users and do it via the Okta Admin Console later. For this exercise, I’m fetching existing users. You could also create new users using the <code>okta_user</code> resource.</p>

   <code># Assign users to the groups
data "okta_user" "admin" {
  search {
    name  = "profile.email"
    value = "&lt;your_admin_user_email&gt;"
  }
}

resource "okta_group_memberships" "admin_user" {
  group_id = okta_group.k8s_admin.id
  users = [
    data.okta_user.admin.id
  ]
}

data "okta_user" "restricted_user" {
  search {
    name  = "profile.email"
    value = "&lt;another_user_email&gt;"
  }
}

resource "okta_group_memberships" "restricted_user" {
  group_id = okta_group.k8s_restricted_users.id
  users = [
    data.okta_user.restricted_user.id
  ]
}
</code>   

 Create an OIDC application 

<p>Now that our groups are in place, let’s create an OIDC application. We will set the application type to <code>native</code> and use PKCE as client authentication, which is much more secure than using a client secret. We will also set the redirect URIs to <code>localhost:8000</code> so that we can work with kubectl locally. We should also assign the groups we created earlier to this application here. Finally, we can capture the client ID of the created app using an output variable.</p>

   <code># Create an OIDC application

resource "okta_app_oauth" "k8s_oidc" {
  label                      = "k8s OIDC"
  type                       = "native" # this is important
  token_endpoint_auth_method = "none"   # this sets the client authentication to PKCE
  grant_types = [
    "authorization_code"
  ]
  response_types = ["code"]
  redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
  ]
  post_logout_redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
  ]
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [groups]
  }
}

# Assign groups to the OIDC application
resource "okta_app_group_assignments" "k8s_oidc_group" {
  app_id = okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.id
  group {
    id = okta_group.k8s_admin.id
  }
  group {
    id = okta_group.k8s_restricted_users.id
  }
}

output "k8s_oidc_client_id" {
  value = okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.client_id
}
</code>   

 Create an authorization server 

<p>Next, we need an authorization server so that we can define policies and claims. We will also capture the issuer URL in an output variable.</p>

   <code># Create an authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server" "oidc_auth_server" {
  name      = "k8s-auth"
  audiences = ["http:://localhost:8000"]
}

output "k8s_oidc_issuer_url" {
  value = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.issuer
}
</code>   

 Add claims to the authorization server 

<p>Let’s add a claim to the authorization server to add the user’s groups in the <code>id_token</code> when they authenticate. We will need this to do RBAC at the Kubernetes side. Also, note that we are only adding groups with the prefix <code>k8s-</code> to the claim. This is to avoid adding groups that are not related to Kubernetes.</p>

   <code># Add claims to the authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server_claim" "auth_claim" {
  name                    = "groups"
  auth_server_id          = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  always_include_in_token = true
  claim_type              = "IDENTITY"
  group_filter_type       = "STARTS_WITH"
  value                   = "k8s-"
  value_type              = "GROUPS"
}
</code>   

 Add policy and rule to the authorization server 

<p>Now we need to create policies and rules for the authorization server. The below policy defines which OIDC applications it will be assigned to. Then we create a rule for the policy that will define the PKCE tokens lifetime and refresh interval. For this, we are leaving the values at default, which is 1 hour lifetime and unlimited refresh interval, but you can change them as per your needs.</p>

   <code># Add policy and rules to the authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server_policy" "auth_policy" {
  name             = "k8s_policy"
  auth_server_id   = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  description      = "Policy for allowed clients"
  priority         = 1
  client_whitelist = [okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.id]
}

resource "okta_auth_server_policy_rule" "auth_policy_rule" {
  name           = "AuthCode + PKCE"
  auth_server_id = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  policy_id      = okta_auth_server_policy.auth_policy.id
  priority       = 1
  grant_type_whitelist = [
    "authorization_code"
  ]
  scope_whitelist = ["*"]
  group_whitelist = ["EVERYONE"]
}
</code>   

 Create the Okta configurations using Terraform 

<p>Now that the Terraform code is ready, let’s apply it. First, run <code>terraform plan</code> to see the changes that will be made. Verify that the changes proposed by the <code>plan</code> make the changes you wanted, on the resources that you intended to modify. Then run <code>terraform apply</code> and type <code>yes</code> to apply the changes. You should see an output similar to this. You can also log in to the Okta Admin Console to verify the changes.</p>

<p>Copy the output values as we will need them for the next steps.</p>

   <code>okta_group.k8s_admin: Creating...

</code>   

<p>You can run <code>terraform destroy</code> to revert the changes if required.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TIP: You can use the <code>terraform import &lt;resource_name.id&gt;</code> command to import data and configuration from your Okta instance. Refer to <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">these Okta Terraform provider docs</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

 Preparing the cluster for OIDC 

<p>Now we need to prepare the cluster to work with OIDC. For this, we need to update the API server flags below:</p>

 
   <code>oidc-issuer-url</code>: This will be your issuer URL from the Okta authorization server 
   <code>oidc-client-id</code>: This is the client ID from the Okta OIDC application 
   <code>oidc-username-claim</code>: This is the claim that will be used to identify the user. In this case, it is <code>email</code>. 
   <code>oidc-groups-claim</code>: This is the claim that will be used to identify the groups. In this case, it is <code>groups</code>. 
   <code>oidc-ca-file</code>: This is the CA file that is used to validate the OIDC server. If you are using Okta as an OIDC provider, then you don’t need to set this. 
 

<p>NOTE: If you encounter an issue where OIDC groups/users collide with Kubernetes groups/users, you can set <code>oidc-groups-prefix</code> and <code>oidc-username-prefix</code> flags as well.</p>

<p>Flags can be set when creating the cluster or by patching the API server via SSH, as described below.</p>

 Create a cluster with OIDC enabled 

<p>Here is how you can create a new k8s cluster with OIDC enabled using different tools. Execute the command for the tool you’re using. Make sure to replace <code>&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;</code> with values from the output of the Terraform step. For any other tools, refer to their documentation on how to update API server flags.</p>

 kubeadmn 

<p>If you are using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadmn</a>, add the following flags to the cluster configuration and pass them to <code>kubeadm init</code> command.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    oidc-issuer-url: &lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;
    oidc-client-id: &lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
    oidc-username-claim: email
    oidc-groups-claim: groups
</code>   

 kOps 

<p>For <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kOps</a>, create a cluster with the required config. For example, the code below will create a cluster in AWS.</p>

   <code>kops create cluster \
 --authorization RBAC \
 --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
 --cloud aws \
 --state $S3_STATE_STORE
</code>   

<p>Now edit the cluster config and add OIDC data.</p>

   <code>kops edit cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --state $S3_STATE_STORE
</code>   

<p>Add this YAML to the <code>kubeAPIServer</code> spec.</p>

   <code>kubeAPIServer:
  authorizationRbacSuperUser: admin
  oidcIssuerURL: &lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;
  oidcClientID: &lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
  oidcUsernameClaim: email
  oidcGroupsClaim: groups
</code>   

 k3d 

<p>To create a <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> cluster using <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a>, run the following command.</p>

   <code># k3d v5.0.0+
k3d cluster create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-username-claim=email@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-groups-claim=groups@server:0"
</code>   

 Updating an existing cluster to enable OIDC 

<p>If you already have an existing cluster, you can SSH into it using the root user and patch the API server with the following command.</p>

   <code>ssh root@master-node-ip

sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

...
    command:
    - /hyperkube
    - apiserver
    - --advertise-address=x.x.x.x
...

    - --oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt; # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-username-claim=email # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-groups-claim=groups # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
...
</code>   

<p>If you are using a managed service like <a>EKS</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/oidc#enabling_on_an_existing_cluster">GKE</a>, then follow their instructions to update the API server.</p>

 Configure RBAC 

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">Role-based access control</a> lets you control who can access what is inside a cluster. This is a very powerful feature and can be used to control access to specific resources. The great thing about using OIDC is that we can use it with RBAC to enable very granular control over resources.</p>

<p>Most Kubernetes distributions have RBAC enabled by default. If not, make sure to enable it before proceeding. It can be set using the <code>--authorization-mode</code> flag for the API server when creating or patching the cluster. For example, <code>--authorization-mode=RBAC,anotherMethod</code>.</p>

<p>For this exercise, we will use both groups we created in Okta. At the cluster level, we restrict admin access to a specific group that will be controlled via the OIDC provider, in this case, Okta.</p>

<p>Let’s create a cluster role binding by applying the below YAML via kubectl. This binds to the built-in cluster role called <code>cluster-admin</code> and restricts access to users in the <code>k8s-admins</code> group in Okta. Now any user added to the group will have access to the cluster, and removing someone from the group will be enough to remove their access.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: oidc-cluster-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: k8s-admins
EOF
</code>   

<p>In real use cases, you may want to restrict further a group’s access to specific resource types or namespaces, add multiple groups with different permissions, and so on. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">this</a> for different possibilities.</p>

<p>Now, let’s create a k8s role that can only view pods and services in the default namespace.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: restricted-user
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
EOF
</code>   

<p>Now we can bind the role to the second group we created in Okta.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: oidc-cluster-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: restricted-user
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: k8s-restricted-users
EOF
</code>   

<p>That’s it! The cluster is now ready for some OIDC action.</p>

 Connecting to the cluster using kubectl 

<p>Before we can go ahead and test this out, we need to do some setup for kubectl so that it knows how to do OIDC authentication. We need to install <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a> plugin for this. Go ahead and install it using any of the following commands.</p>

   <code># Homebrew (macOS and Linux)
brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin

# Krew (macOS, Linux, Windows and ARM)
kubectl krew install oidc-login
</code>   

<p>The plugin enables OIDC login capability for kubectl. Let’s test it out first. Run the following command, make sure to replace <code>k8s_oidc_issuer_url</code> and <code>k8s_oidc_client_id</code> with what you saved earlier during Okta set up.</p>

   <code>kubectl oidc-login setup --oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; --oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
</code>   

<p>This should produce an output that looks like this:</p>

   <code>authentication in progress...
Opening in existing browser session.

## 2. Verify authentication

You got a token with the following claims:

{
  "sub": "00u28lpcoheT48W5A5d7",
  "ver": 1,
  "iss": "&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;",
  "aud": "&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;",
  "iat": 1634657188,
  "exp": 1634660788,
  "jti": "ID.AmO7M7Z4xh_rSN4IHVuQEfJ4QuoADOWHSrVHuNyn9so",
  "amr": [
    "pwd"
  ],
  "idp": "0oa28lrldhsBglcC35d7",
  "nonce": "2Rsv7E84vo_K14J6qm9IgKjNsCUxb4Hc16qgzx9CKlk",
  "auth_time": 1634649927,
  "at_hash": "veXQkvqTjCl70OkZnKZVyA",
  "groups": [
    "k8s-admins"
  ]
}

</code>   

<p>Now let us update kubectl configuration to add an OIDC user:</p>

   <code>kubectl config set-credentials oidc-user \
--exec-api-version=client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1 \
--exec-command=kubectl \
--exec-arg=oidc-login \
--exec-arg=get-token \
--exec-arg=--oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; \
--exec-arg=--oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt; \
--exec-arg=--oidc-extra-scope="email offline_access profile openid"
</code>   

<p>Now we can use this user to authenticate to the cluster via kubectl.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --user=oidc-user -n default
</code>   

<p>This should open a browser window to authenticate you. You can use your Okta account credentials to log in.</p>

<p>Test out this RBAC configuration by playing around with different users in different groups. Users who are not in the <code>k8s-admins</code> group in Okta should not be able to access any resource. Users who are only in the <code>restricted-users</code> group should only be able to see pods and services.</p>

<p>You can use the below command to set this user as default for your current kubectl context.</p>

   <code>kubectl config set-context --current --user=oidc-user
</code>   

 Learn more about using OIDC with Kubernetes 

<p>Using OIDC is a great way to secure your Kubernetes clusters, especially in bigger teams. It is more secure than any of the default Kubernetes authentication mechanisms. On top of that, it will let you manage users and their roles and permissions in your cluster, and even add multi-factor authentication for your cluster.</p>

<p>While this exercise shows you an Okta implementation, the process would be very similar for other OIDC providers. Check out the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Okta Terraform provider docs</a> to see what else can be automated via Terraform. You can also automate the Kubernetes parts via terraform using the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Kubernetes Terraform provider</a>.</p>

			 Tokeny has successfully helped Enegra migrate its EGX security tokens from Ethereum to Polygon. End-users now benefit from faster, cheaper and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets. 
<p>Luxembourg — 5th November 2021 — <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, an asset tokenization and compliance infrastructure provider, has successfully helped Enegra Group Ltd (“Enegra”), a commodities trading firm with approximately $28 billion in net asset value (NAV), migrate its equity-tied EGX security tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p>The migration enables faster end-to-end transfers of EGX security tokens with near-zero transaction fees on Polygon and puts EGX tokens on a pathway to attract global top 20 token market cap status.</p>
<p>In September 2019, Enegra tokenized 100% of its equity and issued EGX equity-backed digital security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform. Enegra decided to switch to Polygon to address Ethereum’s mounting gas fees and slow transaction speed and improve liquidity for EGX token holders.</p>
<p>The EGX tokens were issued through the T-REX security token standard, now recognized as the ERC3643 by the Ethereum community. Thanks to the cross-chain compatibility of the standard, the migration to Polygon from Ethereum was seamlessly managed over a few days, and investors were able to retain the same wallet address for holding their EGX tokens. After the migration, investors were able to interact immediately with their tokens on Polygon via the same platform but without prohibitive gas fees.</p>

		 
	 
    We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra    
	 
		 
			<p>Energa’s decision comes at a time of intense interest in tokenization — a means of digitizing any asset and placing it on an immutable blockchain. Equity, funds, debt, and even real estate can all benefit from the added liquidity, efficiency, and transparency tokenization brings. Mid-cap companies, investment banks, asset managers, funds, and stock exchanges from all around the world are already starting to shift towards blockchain-based financial assets.</p>
<p>Enegra Group Ltd, incorporated in Malaysia, enables mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally against larger competitors by providing world-class commodity trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance. It currently has mining offtake agreements with 16 mid-tier mines in Southeast Asia with a combined Net Asset Value (NAV) of $US 28 billion, audited by Crowe LLP, a global top 10 accounting and audit firm.</p>

		 
	 
    Our goal is to provide our customers with a flexible and scalable solution for permissioned tokens. Issuers of tokens don’t need to worry anymore about being blocked on a blockchain forever. Without losing any history, we now have the tools and processes for smooth migrations from one network to another. Enegra’s migration has showcased how quickly and easily migration can be done using our technology stack. And, the benefits are realized instantly, which is exactly what investors need and expect.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Polygon was designed to work in parallel with the Ethereum network to improve functionality and promote infrastructure development. The leading Ethereum scaling platform achieves this via its array of scaling solutions, including Polygon PoS, Polygon SDK, Polygon Avail, Polygon Nightfall, and Polygon Hermez.</p>

		 
	 
    The tokenization of real-world assets and financial securities is probably the next big wave in DeFi, and we are excited to see our partner, Tokeny, bring qualitative and compliant assets to the Polygon network. By leveraging our infrastructure with the right software provider, such as Tokeny, businesses can quickly deploy or convert their assets to Polygon.  Sandeep NailwalCo-Founder at Polygon    
	 
		 
			<p>The EGX Security Token found at address 0x8db0a6d1b06950b4e81c4f67d1289fc7b9359c7f on Polygon. The EGX token complies with the ERC3643 standard.</p>

			 About Enegra&nbsp; 
<p>Enegra is an international mineral commodities trading business based in Malaysia. Enegra is proud to be one of the world’s first regulated companies to issue equity backed digital security tokens, under security token code EGX on the Polygon network. Enegra has secured lucrative mining offtake agreements among 16 mid-tier mines in Southeast Asia. This provides Enegra with exclusive access to 1.8 billion tonnes of thermal coal and up to 500,000 tonnes per month of nickel sands. The valuation of these mining offtake assets provides Enegra with an audited Net Asset Value (NAV) of $US 28 billion, audited by Crowe LLP<a href="https://www.crowe.com/"> https://www.crowe.com/</a>&nbsp; a global top 10 accounting and audit firm. Based on total issued supply, each EGX token has a NAV of $US 329, underwritten by an audited balance sheet.

 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

Today, we are excited to share more details about how ROCKI is leveraging <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>’s decentralized identity framework on its own platform.</p><p>Ontology’s decentralized framework encompasses <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/enter-web-3-0-with-ont-id-375930e78242">several products</a> including <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-2-0-take-charge-of-your-identity-with-customized-data-control-and-disclosure-features-c54bd9305e2d">ONT ID</a>, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, and <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>. Ontology’s Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration Management SDK enables ROCKI to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs.</p><p>Ontology’s DID technology relies on global trust anchors to verify user credentials that can then be used to establish a digital identity across multiple blockchains (e.g. Ontology, BSC, Ethereum, Polkadot).</p><p>We are proud to see ROCKI users now log into the services in a decentralized way thanks to Ontology’s decentralized identity-based batch verification solution, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT&nbsp;TAG</a>.</p><p>ONT TAG enables ROCKI (along with other apps) to quickly obtain a user’s verifiable credentials with the user’s authorization. The authorization process is performed whilst protecting user privacy. To authorize credentials, ONT TAG must first be granted permission by the user&nbsp;only.</p><p>This set of solutions fully takes into account the verification requirements of users and applications for specific information sources.</p><p>Being fully integrated into the ROCKI application, when users log into ROCKI, ONT TAG is working in the background to verify their credentials. This means that users unfamiliar with Ontology may not even know that ROCKI is actually relying on Ontology’s DID framework. Nonetheless, the user benefits from ONT TAG’s unique authorization process. The entire process only takes a few minutes, is cheap, and prevents the application from collecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>ROCKI is a fast-growing start-up with a growing user base of over 9,000 musicians and 30,000 songs. Thus far, over 1,200 music NFTs have been minted and traded on the platform. We are excited to be providing DID services to ROCKI’s users.
