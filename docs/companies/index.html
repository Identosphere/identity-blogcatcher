  <p>The Urbit community has grown at a rapid clip throughout 2021. There are so many exciting things going on that it's hard to convey them all, even with Developer Calls happening every two weeks. This event will function as a virtual "mini-conference" where we'll give a series of important and exciting announcements, including both formal and informal talks from many members of our community.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what we'll be discussing:</p>
 Introduction: State of the Network 
<p>12:00 PDT, Josh Lehman</p>
<p>Urbit is under heavy, active development by both Tlon and a wide range of contributors. Josh Lehman will discuss some of the most important areas of work being undertaken, provide a picture of where Tlon and community efforts are going in the future, and even has a few exciting announcements to make.</p>
 Taisho, Urbit's Port City 
<p>~12:20 PDT, Hunter Miller</p>
<p>Piloting an Urbit ship requires expertise that many lack. To achieve the rich and prosperous ecosystem we've all envisioned requires making that journey easier. In this talk, Hunter Miller introduces a new way for users to join the network with minimal effort.</p>
 Keynote: The Revenge of Teleology 
<p>~13:00 PDT, Justin Murphy</p>
<p>Teleology—or inquiry into ultimate ends—has been out of fashion since the seventeenth century, when Francis Bacon said that, “like a virgin consecrated to God,” it “produces nothing.” I argue that the digital revolution is inverting Bacon’s claim. Baconian instrumentalism is now suffering from diminishing returns—it is what the youth today call a Boomer Ideology. Rather, the greatest gains are going to individuals and communities with teleological attitudes. This talk will observe some examples and present a model consistent with the observations. Bitcoin inquires after the telos of money, the most winning independent “content creators” inquire after the telos of media, and Urbit inquires after the telos of personal computing.</p>
 Lightning Talks 
<p>14:00 PDT, you?</p>
<p>After the scheduled talks we'll break out into a series of 30 minute talks led by community members. There will be up to three talks given in parallel at each of 14:00 PDT, 14:30 PDT and 15:00 PDT (so nine talks total).</p>
<p>If you'd like to give a talk, please use <a href="https://airtable.com/shr0Xmqcv1HSy47EP">this form to sign up</a>. You can see the full list of <a href="https://airtable.com/shreGQ4kCU8RA5GJS/tblTZxCpqedJBwSkE">proposed talks here</a>, and if you'd like to voice your support for any of these specifically, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrhNRUAGCqZ38VXA">cast a vote using this form</a>.</p>

<p>On May 20th, 2021 <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/detail/news/the-eu-cloud-code-of-conduct-becomes-first-gdpr-code-of-conduct-to-receive-green-light-from-data-pro/" title=" it was announced">it was announced</a> that the <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/contact/request-the-eu-cloud-code-of-conduct.html" title=" EU Cloud Code of Conduct">EU Cloud Code of Conduct</a> had received official approval by the Belgian Data Protection Authority, following the positive opinion issued by the European Data Protection Board.&nbsp; At the same time, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) comprised of all the European Data Protection Authorities (DPA) <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-adopts-opinions-first-transnational-codes-conduct-statement-data-governance-act_en" title="provided a favourable opinion">provided a favourable opinion</a> that the <a href="https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/" title="CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct">CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct</a> complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>This has been a long journey – in 2017 we published a <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70276/cloud-provider-codes-of-conduct-and-gdpr/" title="Leadership Brief Cloud Provider Codes of Conduct and GDPR">Leadership Brief Cloud Provider Codes of Conduct and GDPR</a>.&nbsp; This compared how the 2 codes of conduct at that time would match the obligations from GDPR which had yet to come into force.&nbsp; Four years on, what is the significance of this announcement to organizations using cloud services?</p>
<p>When using a cloud service, the tenant does not have control over how the service is designed, secured, and run.&nbsp; Therefore, the tenant needs to trust that the cloud service meets their security needs and compliance obligations.&nbsp; These Cloud Codes of Conduct provide transparent frameworks that define the technical and organisational measures that a cloud service must implement to ensure that its processing of tenants’ data will meet the requirements of GDPR.</p>
 
 Good News but with a Caveat 
 
<p>The good news is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The EDPB is of the opinion that both draft codes comply with the GDPR and fulfil the requirements set forth in Art. 40 and 41 GDPR. According to the GDPR, adherence to approved codes of conduct may be used as an element to demonstrate legal compliance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is still more work to do. The key caveat in the EDPB announcement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They [the codes of conduct] are not to be used in the context of international transfers of personal data”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking at the two codes there are many similarities but some differences. The CISPE Code only covers Infrastructure as a Service while the EU Code of Conduct is more general. To some extent this explains the difference between the CSPs that support the different codes. Unsurprisingly, the CSPs supporting EU Code of Conduct include those providing several different kinds of service (SaaS and PaaS as well as IaaS) which are all covered by this code.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the existence of 2 codes increases the burden on the end user organizations.</p>
<p>The major remaining challenge for organizations using cloud services to hold and process the personal data of EU residents in compliance with GDPR when this involves international transfer of data to Third Countries.&nbsp; This challenge stems from the so called Schrems II judgment and the subsequent EBPB <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="recommendations 01/2020">recommendations 01/2020</a> relating to this.</p>
 
<p></p>
 Independent Verification 
 
<p>Much has been written on the subject of Zero Trust in the context of cyber security.&nbsp; &nbsp;Zero Trust is often defined to mean never trust always verify.</p>
<p>When highly regulated industries use cloud services and for certain kinds of data processed in them it essential for the tenant to be able verify the existence and effectiveness of service controls to demonstrate compliance.&nbsp; However, it is not practical for large CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) to allow tenants to individually audit the services they use, and so tenants must rely on independent third-party attestations that the services comply with standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The Cloud Codes of Conducts described above provide frameworks that have been validated by the EDPB and accepted by EU Data Protection Authorities.&nbsp; This is an important step towards what is needed but validation of the framework is not the same as verification of service compliance.</p>
<p>Currently the CSPs that are members of the framework bodies agree to provide self-certification of compliance.&nbsp; What is needed is independent verification.&nbsp; Setting up the processes for independent verification of compliance with the Codes of Conduct will be the next key step along the journey.</p>
 
 GDPR and Zero Trust Data Processing 
 
<p>The EDPB has not approved the Codes of Conduct in the context of international transfers of personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances what is needed is Zero Trust Data Processing – Never Trust the Cloud Service where this involves international data transfers.</p>
<p>During processing of the data there are three points at which the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal data can be compromised by public authorities in Third Countries:</p>
 
 During its transfer across networks, it may be accessed by third parties including governments. This access may be passive where the contents of the communication are simply copied. However, public authorities may also interpose themselves into the communication process and not only read the content, but also manipulate or suppress parts of it. 
 During its storage, by either accessing the processing facilities themselves, or by requiring the recipient of the data to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over. 
 During processing, the data could be accessed while it is being used or analysed. For example, when a service is being provided remotely. 
 
<p>Cloud services currently provide controls for the first two of these areas of risk through strong encryption where the tenant has full control over the keys.&nbsp; However, protection during processing depends upon what is being termed as “Confidential Computing”.&nbsp; Confidential Computing is an essential element of Zero Trust Data processing and there are several basic approaches to Confidential Computing:</p>
 
 Trusted environments – such as Intel SGX enclaves and AMD EPYC 3rd&nbsp;Generation CPUs where the data is only decrypted in a protected environment. 
 Pseudonymization&nbsp;–&nbsp;as opposed to&nbsp;anonymization - providing that the&nbsp;addition data needed to reconstitute the relevant (usually personal) data is adequately&nbsp;protected.&nbsp;But not the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-pseudonymisation-advanced-techniques-and-use-cases/" title="ENISA recommendations for data pseudonymization advanced techniques and use-cases">ENISA recommendations for data pseudonymization advanced techniques and use-cases</a>. 
 Homomorphic encryption – where the encrypted data can be processed without decryption but with additional computing overheads and usually the need to change the application.
 
 Multi party&nbsp;computing&nbsp;–&nbsp;protocols&nbsp;that split the data into parts that can be processed&nbsp;independently&nbsp;without any of the processors being able to&nbsp;reconstitute any personal data.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>To overcome the concerns processing personal data in third countries under GDPR, as well as those of regulated industries, CSPs will need to provide industrialised and easy to use approaches based on one or more of the above approaches.</p>
 
 Opinion 
 
<p>It is good news that both of these cloud codes of conduct have received approval from European Data Protection Authorities.&nbsp; However, the boards behind these codes of conduct cannot afford to rest on their laurels - they must now work to define and set up independent verification processes to enable cloud tenants to have greater confidence than that provided by self-certification.&nbsp; It is also essential that cloud services provide greater levels of controls – especially for confidential computing - for tenants to implement Zero Trust Data Processing.</p>

<p>Sidetree protocol is an open blockchain-agnostic protocol <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-sidetree-scalable-dpki-for-decentralized-identity-1a9105dfbb58">developed by DIF</a> and supported by Microsoft. The core idea of this protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protocol is designed to overcome many technical problems in existing implementations that include high throughput and cost, presence of centralized authorities, lack of scalability, and more. The Sidetree protocol bridges the need for a decentralized and open protocol as it batches together JSON (a standard for representing structured data) operations to lower the associated costs, improve throughput, enhance scalability, and at the same, allow these operations to be anchored to any decentralized identity&nbsp;network.</p><p>It also helps to create unique identifiers that are controlled and managed by users with their public key infrastructure. Further, it conforms to the W3C specifications, so developers can use the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifier (DID)&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>So, now that you have an idea of what is sidetree protocol, let’s delve into its architecture.</p> Sidetree Protocol Architecture <p>Sidetree protocols are layer 2 protocols that anchor to the underlying decentralized ledger system. That said, it is ledger agnostic and its primary role is to anchor batches of signed JSON operations to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>What this essentially means is that using this protocol, you can create tree nodes that sit side by side on the network and perform CRUD (Create, Recover, Update, and Deactivate) operations according to the W3C specifications. These nodes interact with a Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) like IPFS to create, recover, update, and deactivate a DID document stored in&nbsp;it.</p><p>In this sense, the sidetree protocol is wedged between the CAS at the top and the underlying decentralized network at the&nbsp;bottom.</p> Working of a Sidetree&nbsp;Protocol <p>Moving on, let’s understand how this protocol&nbsp;works.</p><p>A transaction can be any of the CRUD operations that are implemented in JSON and signed by the holder/issuer’s public key. Each of these transactions is batched together and stored in a batch&nbsp;file.</p><p>The number of transactions that can be stored in the batch file is limited by the file size. So, developers can determine the size of the batch file depending on the average rate of transactions in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Next, this batch file is connected to an anchor file that has a Merkle root. Here, a Merkle root is something that’s commonly used in cryptography to ensure that data blocks that are transmitted between peers are unaltered. In this implementation, the Merkle root also verifies that a particular transaction was included in a batch file. These anchor files, in turn, are attached to the anchoring networks.</p><p>As you may have guessed, the anchor file is the only thing that’s associated with the network and the rest of the implementation are ledger-agnostic. So, depending on the ledger you choose, the anchor file will&nbsp;vary.</p><p>An important aspect to note is that the JSON operation is signed by the entity’s public/wallet key while the signed ledger transaction is signed by the sidetree node that’s performing the anchoring operation.</p><p>So, this is how a sidetree protocol&nbsp;works.</p><p>Now comes an important question — how do you access the contents of your DID document?</p><p>Simply reverse the&nbsp;process!</p><p>Start with the ledger and get the hash for the anchor file. From here, get the hash for the batch file, and in it, you can find all the operations related to your DID as they get grouped and are replayed in the order in which they were recorded. From this, you can navigate to your DID document.</p><p>If you look at this reverse anchoring process, the indexing on the anchor file is the key aspect as it helps to weed out corrupted or bad batch files. In fact, the overall process and workflow greatly reduce the chances of&nbsp;errors.</p><p>Next, we’ll explain a bit about how this is implemented in Affinidi.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of the Sidetree&nbsp;Protocol <p>At Affinidi, we implement sidetree protocol using SidetreeJS, the JavaScript implementation of the Sidetree protocol v0.1.0. Though we did consider using element-api methods, they were deprecated, so we decided to go ahead with SidetreeJS. Also, the fact that it is easier to implement, added to our list of reasons for going with SidetreeJS.</p><p>Our infrastructure consists of SidetreeJS integrated into the DID registry with IPFS as the content addressable storage. On top of it, sits the MongoDB as the long term cache while the Ethereum Ledger via ChainStack is the ledger&nbsp;address.</p><p>To learn more about Affinidi APIs, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">Decoding the Sidetree Protocol</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 What Are Stock Tokens? 
<p>As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Binance has been aggressively pursuing and exploring a wide range of services for its users. Its latest initiative is to allow users to trade ‘stock tokens’ that represent shares of publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The transactions are settled in stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD). Since 12 April, Binance has released stock tokens for Tesla, Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Apple and Microsoft. This is a milestone in the tokenization field as it opens up the security tokens to the masses. In fact, Binance is not the first company to do this, as FTX and Bittrex, two other cryptocurrency exchanges, started tokenized stocks trading back in late 2020.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that all of these tokenized stocks are mirrors of securities, meaning that the tokens are not shares and only give exposure to the underlying shares. In other words, investors don’t have direct ownership of the shares, and the tokens are not transferable between investors. The digital asset marketplace (Binance, etc.) is the issuer, controlling the tokens for its token holders. It is a delegated system.</p>
 So Why Does It Concern Regulators? 
<p>Binance has also declared that holders of their stock tokens will qualify for economic returns on the underlying securities, including potential dividends, making the tokens securities. As those familiar with legislation on security tokens, tokenization doesn’t change the fact that they have to comply with securities regulation, especially when they are distributed to the public. Digital securities must be issued as permissioned tokens to comply with international regulations.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>Permissioned tokens apply compliance checks during transfers to make sure that only eligible investors can hold the security tokens. And Binance’s stock tokens don’t appear to have been issued as permissioned tokens. They control the stock tokens for their users. No surprise that it didn’t take long for BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, to knock on Binance’s door. On 28 April, BaFin has published <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/weitere/2021/meldung_210428_binance_deutschland.html">a note</a> on its website warning Binance that they are selling shares in Germany in the form of stock tokens without offering the necessary prospectuses. This could result in a 5-million-euro fine or a forfeit of 3% of Binance’s 2020 turnover.</p>

		 
	 
          BaFin has grounds to suspect that Binance Germany is selling shares in Germany in the form of 'share tokens' without offering the necessary prospectuses.  BaFinGermany’s financial regulator         
	 
		 
			 Security Token Protocols Are Getting Traction 
<p>It’s essential for securities issuers to choose a resilient infrastructure and the right security token protocol to issue securities on blockchain in order to properly enforce securities regulation. This infrastructure should provide solutions for issuers to natively tokenize shares with compliance rules embedded in the security token smart contracts. There are plenty of open-source protocols in the market that can provide these services, such as the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol</a>, the most adopted one used for tokenizing securities, having issued over&nbsp; €8.5 million assets to date. Here, we compare the differences between delegated security tokens and native security tokens issued via T-REX Protocol in the table below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Issuers also need to keep in mind that they must be authorized by regulators to distribute securities. In Binance’s case, there are certain documents such as prospectuses that need to be provided to investors. And these documents should be easily accessible by investors.</p>
<p>Binance is not a regulated exchange for securities, but they have apparently chosen to distribute securities to their users and to keep their security tokens in custody. It is not hard to see why regulators are looking into them. Unlike unregulated exchanges, broker-dealers, ATS, regulated exchanges, asset managers, and many other players are already allowed to distribute securities to their clients. These entities should launch <a href="https://tokeny.com/whats-the-purpose-of-a-digital-asset-marketplace/">Digital Assets Marketplaces (DAM)</a> and be sure that they only accept native security tokens in order to remain compliant.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 What are the key components of a security token marketplace? 
 
 Select serious securities issuers; 
 Onboard investors and verify their eligibility; 
 Distribute security tokens with documents required by regulators; 
 Issue and allocate permissioned security tokens to investors’ wallet; 
 Authorize transferability in P2P. 
 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			<p>With the right protocol, marketplace operators will be in line with lawmakers, allowing their investors to benefit from fractional and direct ownership, while receiving all the rights that directly associate with that securities.</p>
<p>Overall, we are pleased to see the progress that has been made in the tokenization market, as well as the attention it has recently attracted. Now, the technology is ready, and mass adoption will come as soon as institutions start to move and choose the right infrastructure.</p>

Implementation of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonld-signatures">JSON-LD Signatures</a> specification is used to create Linked Data Proofs.</p><p>The TypeScript types which are exported from the library are built with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-ts">json-schema-to-ts</a>, so in addition to receiving static analysis, you can use the verify functions to leverage these schemas at run time.</p> EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019 &amp; EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019 <p><code>@bloomprotocol/ecdsa-secp256k1-signature-2019</code> and <code>@bloomprotocol/ecdsa-secp256k1-verification-key-2019</code> implement the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ecdsa-secp256k1-2019/">Ecdsa Secp256k1 Signature 2019 specification</a>. These can be used to sign and verify VCs and VPs with the <code>@bloomprotocol/vc</code> library above.</p> Element DID (Legacy and Non-anchored) <p><code>@bloomprotocol/elem-did-legacy-non-anchored</code> is a small library for creating and resolving legacy Element DIDs. Bloom is currently using an older version of the Element spec. We will be updating to the latest version in the future but first, we want to ensure that integrators can handle the DIDs of our users.</p><p>You can create an Element DID with key pairs or a mnemonic phrase, or you can simply generate a fresh DID.</p> WACI Core &amp; WACI jose <p><code>@bloomprotocol/waci-core</code> and <code>@bloomprotocol/waci-jose</code> are libraries for the WACI spec, which Bloom has recently donated to DIF. (Look for a blog post about WACI soon!) waci-core &nbsp;exports TypeScript types and schemas to be used by any other implementation, and waci-jose uses waci-core to sign and verify JWTs with<a href="https://github.com/panva/jose"> jose</a>. A library that uses <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken">jsonwebtokens</a>, in lieu of jose, would also be able to use waci-core.</p> WACI Kit React <p><code>@bloomprocotol/waci-kit-react</code> is the UI part of the WACI flow. Those who have used our old (now deprecated) <code>@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react</code> will find this interface familiar. This library renders either a QR Code or a link, depending on the platform, that starts an interaction with our mobile app.</p><p>Get the mobile app <a href="https://go.onelink.me/9Fr3/bf30b5a3">here</a>!</p> Presentation Exchange <p><code>@bloomprotocol/presentation-exchange</code> contains TypeScript types and JSON schemas for the different objects in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> specification. In the future, this library will also contain implementations of the behavior aspects of the spec (e.g. filtering credentials, pulling credentials out of a Presentation Submission, etc.)</p> Credential Manifest <p><code>@bloomprotocol/credential-manifest</code> contains TypeScript types and JSON schemas for the different objects in the frozen working copy of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/wallet-and-credential-interactions/versions/v0.1.0/#credential-manifest-working-copy">Credential Manifest</a> specification. Once the Credential Manifest specification is finalized, this library will be updated.</p> Future Work  EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2020 &amp; EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2020 <p>While the 2019 versions help to ensure that we have better future interoperability, we still must implement the 2020 versions. In the more current version, key pairs are encoded in the "multibase" format rather than in base58. Beyond this, little has changed between the two iterations.</p> VC Taxonomy <p>This library will provide TypeScript Types, JSON-LD contexts, and JSON schemas for specific types of VCs, as well as for building on top of VC.</p> Documentation <p>We need proper documentation setup. We want to create a<a href="https://docusaurus.io"> Docusaurus</a> package within the SSI SDK repo and host it on GitHub pages. The package will include walkthroughs, examples, and any other resources &nbsp;that we believe can help integrators. If you have any ideas for how to enhance this documentation package, please share your thoughts <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/ssi-sdk/issues/6">here</a>.</p>

Under lockdown and unable to access brick and mortar, as usual, we’ve warmed to the idea of using e-commerce for everything, from grocery shopping to financial transactions. Consumers are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that their future customer interactions will be digital in&nbsp;nature.</p><p>What we’ll see, even post-vaccine is an increasingly omnichannel society in which the physical and digital worlds will come together in a way that makes it much easier and convenient for people to buy and access the services they&nbsp;need.</p> So what does this mean for identity proofing? <p>Simply put, every customer interaction with your products and services should be carefully considered and purposeful.</p><p>This starts with deeply understanding people’s attitudes and behaviours regarding digital identity and accessing services online. We must take time to understand our customers, their needs, motivations and the challenges they face when using our products and services.</p><p>We know this because our team at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/onfido/">Onfido</a> invests significant effort into talking directly to our users and observing them using our products. As a result, we’ve been able to tailor and improve our user experience to meet a diverse set of needs, environments and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>In doing so, we’ve made a surprising observation: A truly frictionless experience is not necessarily the optimal outcome when it comes to identity.</p><p>When removing friction compromises other usability constraints such as user security and safety, it can actually be harmful to both users and businesses, especially when designing highly critical&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Adding strategically architected friction can guide users in an intended direction, better prepare them for success, and ensure that your business gets the strongest signals on which to make security decisions. <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/good-friction-for-great-ux-5151bace3bfa">In our own work at Onfido</a>, we’ve directly observed the benefits of adding purposeful and thoughtfully designed moments of friction to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>There’s a great example of this called the Locksmith Paradox:</p><p>When a locksmith is new, they are slow. But as they get more skilled, they can look at the lock and open it in 5 seconds flat. But doing that will impact the customer in three&nbsp;ways:</p>  There’s an Emotional impact: The customer will be embarrassed it was so easy, and they wasted the locksmith’s time.  It changes the customer’s perception of value: They will immediately get annoyed that they have to pay so much for five seconds of&nbsp;work.  It impacts their sense of security/trust: They will never feel safe with that (or any other) lock ever&nbsp;again.  <p>The combination of these three things means that customer satisfaction actually goes down the better at your job you&nbsp;are.</p><p>Experienced locksmiths quickly learn to take their time — They might poke at the lock with various tools from their toolkit or blow into the lock with compressed air (which accomplishes nothing), then “click!” it comes open, and the client is SUPER GRATEFUL.</p><p>By adding purposeful and deliberate friction to the experience, locksmiths have improved outcomes for themselves and their clients. Our digital experiences are precisely the&nbsp;same.</p><p>So, when evaluating and optimising for friction on your own platforms, I’ll leave you with three pieces of&nbsp;advice:</p><p>First, we must respond to the seismic shift in customer expectations.</p><p>How you handle identity is not only important at onboarding but throughout the entire customer journey. The onboarding phase is critical because if you get that part right, you have a lot more confidence in your customers on your platform. This shift to digital that we’ve been talking about is a massive opportunity to meet our customers where they are and to add tangible value to their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Secondly, exceeding customer expectations starts with deeply understanding your customer’s needs. Take the time to observe them using your products in real environments, and you’ll start to see patterns emerging around the friction they experience and what you can to do&nbsp;respond.</p><p>Finally, look for that balance when designing experiences in ID proofing, consent and authentication. As our Locksmith taught us, it is helpful to distinguish between negative friction — the kind that makes your customers frustrated and annoyed — and positive friction, the type that offers tangible benefits to people. Being mindful of this will help you manage their perception of your value and improve their security and emotional response to your&nbsp;brand.</p><p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/onfido">See our open roles on&nbsp;Lever</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/improving-user-experience-in-identity-proofing-4e812f06c4d5">Improving User Experience in Identity Proofing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology partners with <a href="http://rocki.app">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain, to provide decentralized identity (DID) solutions to its&nbsp;users. <p>Ontology is proud to collaborate with ROCKI, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain. We aim to provide decentralized identity (DID) solutions to ROCKI’s music creators and users to ensure they are authentic and&nbsp;secure.</p> Why the NFT Market Needs&nbsp;DID <p>The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/youngjoseph/2021/03/29/nft-market-rages-on-nfts-market-cap-grow-1785-in-2021-as-demand-explodes/?sh=2f7dac317fdc">Forbes</a>, since the start of the year, ‘the combined market cap of major NFT projects has increased by 1,785%.’ These projects, which specialise in the creation and sale of tokenized images, songs, virtual real estate, and other artistic creations, are now valued at over $400&nbsp;million.</p><p>NFTs offer creators a novel way to monetize their creations. Unfortunately, there have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art">reports</a> of artists having their artwork sold by impersonators. This is, in part, due to popular NFT platforms lacking a robust verification process for determining a creator’s identity.</p><p>The potential for fraud in the growing NFT market recently attracted the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fatfs-new-guidance">attention</a> of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the inter-governmental watchdog that establishes standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, which is currently drafting new guidance proposals for both DeFi and NFT&nbsp;markets.</p> How Ontology Empowers ROCKI’s&nbsp;Userbase <p>Ontology’s Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration Management SDK will enable ROCKI to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs. Ontology’s DID technology relies on global trust anchors to verify user credentials that can then be used to establish a digital identity across multiple blockchains (e.g. Ontology, BSC, Ethereum, OKExChain).</p><p>ROCKI intends to have all creators on the platform go through an initial KYC/AML process to verify their identity. Upon completion of the verification process, creators will receive a public stamp of approval, similar to Twitter’s blue checkmark.</p><p>Initially, the verification process will be used to verify national ID credentials. However, there are also plans to enable users to verify social media accounts such as Spotify and Instagram.

Awards such as FinTech Australia’s Finnies are a testament to Australian innovation. Australia is often considered as a great test market. Despite the relatively small population compared to the USA or Europe, the high adoption of new technologies makes Australia a great market to test, validate and chart a pathways for solutions to take off globally. 




 




Indeed, Australia is proudly home to a lot of innovative start-ups, which makes the start-up industry in particular worth considering. The synergy of technological shifts, market opportunities and a vigorously growing digital culture has developed several <a href="https://planetmedia.com.au/blog/unique-innovative-companies-that-have-reached-unicorn-status/">FinTech</a><a href="https://planetmedia.com.au/blog/unique-innovative-companies-that-have-reached-unicorn-status/"> Unicorns</a>.



In October 2020, Meeco was the proud recipient of the FinTech Australia Finnie for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxRkChGHa8k&amp;list=PL4ITSyTPE_Itre7yk5wSinhYGVxE_IhsM&amp;index=12">Excellence in Industry Collaboration &amp; Partnerships</a>, for our push into Belgium and collaboration with KBC Bank. So we are more than thrilled to keep the momentum going when we received news that we are been shortlisted again this year.




 




We are proud to announce we made it to the <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/fintech-australia-is-proud-to-announce-the-2021-finnies-finalists/">finalists for FinTech Australia’s Finnies 2021</a>. This year, Meeco was nominated in the Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger category, for the development of our decentralised identity wallet.  Contenders for the award this year include AgUnity, BOULEVARD Global, CommChain, Hutly, Oxen, Pellar Technology and RelayPay.




 





 “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” finalist 





 




Meeco’s submission results from our work in collaboration with with <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au">eftpos</a> and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a>. The Australian payments giant eftpos recently announced joining the Hedera Governing Council after successfully conducting tests to determine the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37360/australias-eftpos-to-set-up-hedera-hashgraph-node-for-micropayments">feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments</a>. Meeco plays an important part in this world-leading initiative as the wallet provider for the proof-of-technology. 




 



<blockquote>
“When we were running the eftpos micropayments PoC with Hedera Hashgraph, we needed a wallet partner. We had had great experience of working with Meeco on our connectID PoC and needed aspects of digital identity for the micropayments PoC too, so they were a natural fit.

This enabled us to combine the provisioning of an eftpos debit card, identity credentials and a stable coin in one wallet. The PoC was very successful and resulted in a technical platform that demonstrates micropayment capability in a way that no other payments provider has. Our next phase is to look at ways to commercialise this capability.” 

Rob Allen, Entrepreneur in Residence, eftpos
<p></p></blockquote>



 





 Everything will be Tokenized 





 





Earlier this month, Meeco was invited to share our vision of a tokenised work at an <a href="https://fsclub.zyen.com/">FSClub</a> webinar hosted by <a href="https://www.zyen.com/">Z/Yen</a>‘s Chairman, Professor <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mrmainelli">Michael Mainelli</a>. Meeco’s CEO and Founder, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a> delivered the presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">Everything Will Be Tokenized: The Future of Identity</a>. Katryna shared some of the exiting things we have been working on along with where the tokenised world is heading. 




 





<blockquote>“We’re on track towards a world where everything can be tokenized. Tokenization plays a critical part in enabling more equitable value creation for people, organisations and things. Providing the means to issue and store value, trace provenance, and most importantly achieve consensus to instantly trust. 

In order for this tokenized world to emerge we will need the infrastructure for people and their digital twins to participate. This will include digital identity, verifiable credentials and payments.”

Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder, Meeco</blockquote>





 




Since 2012, Meeco has been pioneering the access, protection and value exchange of personal data and identity. Over the past year we have been working towards making much of this possible, and this webinar featured some of the use-cases and practical steps along the way, such as:




 





  Meeco’s wallet leveraging OpenID &amp; W3C standards, designed to incentivise collaboration between stakeholders whilst maximising privacy  eftpos Australia determining feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments  Hedera Hashgraph: the fast, fair, secure and stable Distributed Ledger Technology ensuring decentralised governance at scale.  





 





 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">Watch the webinar</a> 
 





 




Over the past year, we have been working in conjunction with Hedera to launch a multi-purpose wallet that will enable decentralised identity, verifiable credentials, micropayments and tokens. The wallet will be available as a white label solution, with SDK and supported by Meeco’s Secure Value Exchange credential solution. We look forward to sharing more news soon along with updates to our <a href="https://www.meeco.me/developers">developer portal</a>.




 




In the meantime, the category winners for the FinTech Australia Finnies 2021 will be announced in-person this year&nbsp;on&nbsp;9 June, 2021&nbsp;at The Forum, Melbourne. 




 




From all of us at Meeco, huge congratulations to all the finalists. 




 




In closing, a very special thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roballennodl/">Rob Allen</a> at eftpos and <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/mchalet">Tim McHale</a> at Hedera, for enabling us to stand on the shoulders of giants. It’s an honour to be counted in such great company, thank you!

One artist, Joanie LeMercier, calculated that the sale of six of his pieces consumed <a href="https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/">more electricity in ten minutes</a> than his art studio had consumed in the previous two years.</p>Source: https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/<p>Granted, determining blockchain’s real ecological cost is not simple. Some argue that kilowatts per transaction is the <a href="https://medium.com/superrare/no-cryptoartists-arent-harming-the-planet-43182f72fc61">wrong equation</a>. Others claim that roughly <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019">three quarters</a> of the electricity used to mine blocks comes from renewable sources (though still others say it’s <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/36672/renewable-energy-not-as-prominent-in-cryptocurrency-mining-as-previously-claimed">more like 40%</a>, and most of the remaining power comes from coal and natural gas). Finally, proponents claim that cryptocurrency <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf">drives adoption of renewables</a> and might be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-energy-consumption-is-far-more-efficient-and-greener-than-todays-banking-system/">a lot greener</a> than the global banking system.</p><p>But as blockchains become more popular and their tokens increase in value, more miners get in on the game, increasing the total electricity consumption. Even if you use the more favourable figures, with non-renewables accounting for only 25%, 25% of a lot will still be a lot.</p><p>Public blockchains consume so much electricity because they have a lot of entropy to deal with. In thermodynamics, entropy is noise, waste, meaninglessness. The problem blockchain is trying to solve — dishonest agents trying to corrupt the global ledger — certainly fits that description.</p><blockquote>Any time you have too much entropy, you’re going to need to spend a lot of energy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mgjfkn/eli5_what_is_negentropy/gstkwly/">moving it somewhere else</a>. My hot take: Bitcoin is basically converting dishonesty into CO₂. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory">simple physics</a>.</blockquote><p>We get it. Bitcoin is burning the world. Ethereum is burning the world. NFTs are burning the world. There are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">planet</a>-<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/">friendly</a> <a href="https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-vs-hashgraph-vs-dag-vs-holochain/">consensus</a> designs out there, along with <a href="https://medium.com/the-capital/layer-1-vs-layer-2-what-you-need-to-know-about-different-blockchain-layer-solutions-69f91904ce40">layer 2 protocols</a> to ease the burden, and I appreciate these innovations. If the world is gonna use blockchains, it ought to figure out ways to make them greener.</p><p>But I think it ignores two important questions: Regardless of the consensus mechanism used, is consensus even necessary? And more importantly, could we be doing better things with that electricity?</p> Consensus: an irrelevant starting point? <p>Programmers love a ‘single source of truth’, a canonical representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">system state</a> that everyone can rely on. That naturally led people to look for a way to get everyone to agree on the contents of one single, shared ledger of events.</p><p>This problem — reaching consensus among all honest agents in a low-trust system — is big. And the solutions are brilliant. As an engineer, I love them. But they all feel like answers to the wrong question.</p><p>What if we started with different questions?</p><p>Moving one step backwards, do we really need consensus on everything? The real world seems to do just fine without it, for the most part. And I’d like to move backwards even further and ask, what are we actually trying to achieve?</p><p>We just want to interact with each other on the internet without having to constantly worry about getting cheated. That’s a simpler framing, and it opens the door to novel solutions.</p><p>Evolution has been working on this problem for a long time. And it’s come up with lots of great solutions (you could call them games) that all share three simple meta-rules (you could call this the meta-game of living systems).</p>  Everyone knows and agrees to the rules of the specific game they’re playing.  Each participant takes responsibility for following the rules.  If anyone sees anyone else breaking the rules, they take action against them and spread news of what they saw.  <p>We see this meta-game popping up over and over again — in ecosystems, bee colonies, flocks of birds, and even human social structures (though we seem to pick really terrible games and break the rules a lot). Considering the small energy input, it’s a surprisingly robust defense against threats.</p><p>The human immune system is a great example: the rules of the game are encoded in each cell’s DNA, so each cell knows how to play nicely with the other cells. If any cell acts up — maybe it goes cancerous, maybe it’s infected with a virus — special immune cells recognise it as a bad actor and trigger an immune response. The body protects itself without spending a lot of energy, simply by launching a small, targeted response against the rule-breaker.</p><p>That’s how a Holochain application’s network works. Each user has their own application cell, with a chunk of code (we even call it a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#layers-of-the-application-stack">DNA</a>) that defines the rules of the game. They’re responsible for the actions they take, which get written onto their own <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">personal ledger</a>. Each action is witnessed by a small set of randomly chosen peers, who <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">store its data,</a> <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/">check it</a> against their copy of the rules, and broadcast an alert if they see anything wrong.</p><p>With this arrangement, you can get 'good enough' security with a fraction of the effort that full consensus would require.</p><blockquote>Holochain makes a bold claim: Consensus is unnecessary for most of the things blockchain is interested in doing.</blockquote>Two Holochain networks with different proportions of dishonest users. At 50%, each piece of data only needs 7 witnesses to achieve 99% integrity. Even with 90% dishonest users, the number of required witnesses is still only 43. Adding more doesn't improve integrity that much.<p>With such a lightweight approach to security, a Holochain network can scale almost infinitely. Even as the number of users go up, each user is still only responsible for witnessing a small portion of their peers’ data.</p> Making sense of the energy costs <p>So what does this all mean for energy consumption? This is a hard question to answer, because blockchain's consensus and Holochain's peer witnessing are such different approaches. But I'll try my best.</p><p>In the graphs below, I attempt to show how three different systems – proof-of-work consensus, proof-of-stake consensus, and Holochain – perform compared to each other. To make things simple, I assume that every single user is perfectly average; they all want to make the same number of transactions per day. Don't think too hard about these graphs, though; they're 'napkin scribbles' that show the character of these systems' performance, not actual precise measurements.</p><p>The first graph shows how many average users each system can comfortably handle. Higher numbers are better. Blockchains don't get any faster as you add more machines; in fact they get slightly slower. The cloud industry would probably describe this as 'anti-scalability'. Holochain, on the other hand, keeps climbing roughly linearly in its ability to serve users, because each user takes care of their own business and helps validate a small portion of everyone else's. As with blockchain, performance drops slightly at larger network sizes, but it's more like 'doesn't climb quite as fast anymore'.</p><p>The other graphs show energy consumption, where lower numbers are better. The second shows the total system energy overhead, or 'cost to keep the thing running'. For all three systems, this grows linearly as the network grows. But for PoW blockchains, the mining overhead is massive — regardless of how much useful work is actually getting done.</p><p>Lastly, let's look at the marginal energy cost per transaction, or the energy it takes to commit data beyond the system overhead. All three systems get exponentially more expensive as the network grows, because each machine needs to talk to more peers in order to complete a transaction. But in Holochain that number grows much more slowly, because the number of witnesses you need to submit your transaction to is capped at 5, 10, 50, 100, whatever the network requires. (For the comp sci nerds, insertion time complexity for blockchain is <code>O(n^2)</code> while Holochain is <code>O(n log(n))</code>, where <code>n</code> &nbsp;is the number of nodes in the network.)</p><p>This means that Holochain can serve more users with less energy. Why does it perform so much better? Two really simple reasons (and please forgive me for repeating myself):</p>  Consensus is expensive, while peer witnessing is cheap.  Consensus forces everyone to behave like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Single-threaded_vs_multithreaded_programs">single-threaded program</a>, while agent-centric peer-to-peer is highly parallel.   Closing loops and extending lifecycles <p>So Holochain appears to be faster and less energy-intensive than blockchain. But there are two other ecological advantages that are easy to miss.</p> Heat: waste or resource? <p>Blockchain miners and cloud servers usually live in a data centre somewhere. In this building, hundreds or thousands of machines spend all day thinking about math and logic. That generates a lot of heat — so much heat that <a href="https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/">up to 50% of the electricity goes to cooling</a>.</p>Source: https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/. Note: 'chiller', 'CRAC', and 'humidifier' are all part of the cooling system.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Permaculture</a> designers say that waste is just a resource in the wrong place. All that heat could be put to good use — say, to heat my home in the winter. But there’s no practical way to do that.</p><p>Because Holochain apps run on our own devices (or on someone else's device, if we're accessing them via the <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting</a> network), that heat is automatically spread out across the world and captured in our homes and offices. (Fun fact: Holo hosting first caught my attention because I saw the possibility of keeping my greenhouse lemons warm during the cold Canadian winters!)</p> It's about the hardware too <p>Every time I use a blockchain or cloud-hosted app, I’m leaning on faraway hardware and thousands of miles of network infrastructure. This seems wasteful when I have a supercomputer in my pocket and all I’m trying to do is talk to my dad on the other side of town. My precious devices take <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2013/08/01/whats-in-a-life-cycle-assessment/">a lot of energy</a> to make, with <a href="https://friendsofthecongo.org/coltan/">blood</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566445/pdf/envhper00514-0024-color.pdf">toxic chemicals</a> spilled along the way. Knowing this, I’d like to use them to their full capacity before I start making demands on other devices.</p><p>Once again, Holochain apps run on our own devices. And even with the Holo hosting network, where the apps are hosted elsewhere, the hosting software will eventually be available for desktops and laptops. This means we're getting more use out of the machines that already exist.</p><p>That all sounds pretty green to me.</p> From ‘less bad’ to ‘more good’ <p>It's probably pretty clear that I think Holochain could replace blockchain for a lot of the crypto applications we see today. As we've seen, a well-designed Holochain app can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">deliver the same safety guarantees</a> as blockchain, with better performance, at zero cost, for a fraction of the resource consumption.</p><p>That excites me. I see a lot of creative things happening in crypto space, and I think Holochain could fill those niches in a way that’s gentler on our planet.</p><p>And I’m also curious about what’s next. As wonderful as these things are, can we do more? Can we go from ‘gentler on our planet’ to regenerating damaged ecosystems, sharing our common wealth more equitably, and preserving the dignity of our fellow humans? And does Holochain have unique features that can help us get there?</p><p>I invite you to explore these possibilities with me in an upcoming blog series about projects that are doing exactly that — starting with <a href="https://redgrid.io">RedGrid</a>, who want to <a href="https://youtu.be/7Gq_jIQWgYg">help</a> the world become carbon neutral by 2030.</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to start prototyping your dApp on Holochain, head over to the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">developer portal</a> and sign up for the upcoming (free) <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">DevCamp</a>!</p><p>(Side note on the cover photo: yes, I know that's probably not the Satoshi who created Bitcoin. But I had to put something there. Poor guy will never get any peace.)</p>

<p>Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers may feel like one of those invisible processes that go largely unnoticed yet have become essential to everyday life, especially in business. When you received your last paycheck through direct deposit to your bank account, that was made possible through an ACH transfer. When you paid your utility bill directly from your checking account, you likely used an ACH transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re already passively benefiting from ACH transfers, imagine the positive outcomes that could come from actively leveraging the ACH network. Here are six fundamentals to get you started.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is ACH? 
<p>“ACH” stands for “Automated Clearing House,” which is a payment network built by the National Automated Clearing House Association (Nacha). An ACH payment is an electronic bank-to-bank payment enabled through the ACH network, rather than through a card network. ACH payments are also frequently called ACH “transfers” or ACH “transactions.” The ACH network is used in the United States, but there are also International ACH Transactions (IAT).</p>
<p>Banks and other financial institutions use the ACH network to aggregate transactions for batch processing. In a given year, the ACH network processes around <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/what-is-ach">25 billion transactions</a>, likely including your paychecks and monthly bill payments. There are three types of transactions:</p>
 
 Direct Deposits: These transactions are any electronic transfer made from a business or government entity to a consumer. Direct deposit transactions may include:&nbsp;
 
 Paychecks and other employee expense reimbursements, bonuses, and commissions 
 Social security payments and other government benefits 
 Pension/401(k) disbursements 
 Annuities 
 Tax refunds 
 Interest payments 
 
 
 Split Deposit: This transaction enables deposits to be split into different accounts. For example, an employee could have a percentage of their paycheck deposited into a savings account while the rest is put in checking. 
 Direct Payments: If you’re sending money through the ACH network, then you’re making a direct payment. Payment solutions can enable any consumer to make these kinds of payments with their bank account:
 
 Charity donations 
 Bill payments 
 Tuition payments 
 Send money through social payment apps 
 Send money to friends and family 
 Make ACH-enabled purchases 
 
 
 
 How Do ACH Transfers Work? 
<p>The ACH transfer happens in two key steps: initiating the payment and receiving the payment. Before you can initiate the transfer as the payment originator, a customer must first give the business approval to initiate the transfer. This approval usually happens by signing an ACH authorization form or through verbal agreement. During this initiation process, the customer can set up one-time payments, recurring payments, split deposits, and so on.</p>
<p>Once the customer has authorized the transfer, your bank account will “pull” the payment from the customer’s bank account. If your customer has insufficient funds, then the payment can “bounce” just like a paper check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pulling” money from an account is known as an ACH debit transaction. An ACH credit transaction, on the other hand, allows you to “push” money from one bank account to another.</p>
 What Are The Benefits Of Accepting ACH Transfers? 
<p>More and more businesses are leveraging ACH transfers in their business transactions. That increasing adoption has likely come as more businesses realize the benefits of ACH transfers for both them and their customers:</p>
 
 Low cost: ACH transfers tend to be a cost-effective method of moving money. We’ll cover more on costs below. 
 Open and inclusive: As long as you have a bank account, you can pay and receive money through the ACH network. No need to worry about having a credit or debit card. 
 Fast and easy: ACH transfers are much faster than delivering checks through snail mail, and you don’t have to worry about losing payments in the mail or dealing with paper check deposits. 
 Better customer experience: Since ACH transfers can be customized for recurring purchases, customers don’t have to worry about receiving and paying a bill, which reduces friction between them and your business. ACH transactions are also easier than customers filling out a check, which may additionally increase the chances of converting prospects. 
 
 What Are The Costs Of ACH Transfers? 
<p>ACH transfers will save your business much more than processing fees or wire transfers (which we’ll get to in more detail shortly). The <a href="https://gocardless.com/guides/ach/ach-fees-how-much-does-ach-cost/">median cost per transfer</a> is $0.29, but that number can rise or fall depending on:</p>
 
 The average transaction size 
 Volume of transactions you submit 
 Whether or not a bank uses same-day ACH 
 Size of the bank 
 Other incidental or bank fees 
 
 What’s The Difference Between ACH Transfers and Wire Transfers? 
<p>In many instances, ACH transfers have replaced more traditional wire transfers. But that doesn’t mean that wire transfers have completely lost their utility. For example, wire transfers happen in real time, which means they can process within minutes or hours, where ACH transfers could take a few days. However, wire transfers cost more, typically between $20 and $30 for the customer, and the recipient frequently has to pay a fee as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line: wire transfers are likely better for large-sum, international, or time-sensitive transactions, where ACH transfers are more appropriate for smaller, more frequent transactions that can stand to take a little longer to process.</p>
 How Does Finicity Enable ACH Transfers? 
<p>What does all of this have to do with Finicity? On March 19, <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">Nacha implemented a new WEB Debit Rule</a> that requires account validation with the first use of an account number, or following changes to the account number. The purpose of the rule is to reduce the chances of fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help businesses satisfy Nacha’s new operating rule, Finicity delivers an instant account validation solution as part of our Finicity Pay solution set. In fact, Finicity is a <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">Preferred Partner</a> of Nacha for using instant account validation to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner and balance checks to make ACH payments even simpler. The speed and security of our open-banking-powered validation solutions also empower consumers with a streamlined, easy, digital-first experience.</p>
<p>ACH transfers are an innovative way for both businesses and consumers to move money while also cutting costs and saving time. Learn more about how <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity is enabling secure and less risky ACH transfers</a>.</p>

					<p>As the title of the event suggests, Riley and Travis discussed the state of adoption for verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity (SSI). Travis started the conversation by stating that critics of SSI claim adoption will be a hurdle too high to jump for any SSI platform or product to be successful at scale. Riley agreed that adoption is the most important hurdle to overcome, and explained that early technologists building SSI technology didn’t build tech that was easy to adopt. Today’s SSI approaches, partially pioneered by Trinsic, are now being built so they are adoptable today and not just in a fully decentralized, 20-year Web 3.0 future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Riley went on to more specifically address where verifiable credentials are at in terms of adoption. About a year and a half ago, there was essentially zero real-world adoption. Today, there’s between 100,000-300,000 verifiable credentials being used by real end users. In the last 18 months, demand has skyrocketed and there have been strong adoption signals, but the adoption of verifiable credentials is still very early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic is addressing this adoption problem for its customers with the recent launch of its enterprise-grade product—<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-ecosystems/">Trinsic Ecosystems</a>. Riley explained how Trinsic found that a large subset of its customers were wanting to use SSI to enable secure, privacy-compliant data sharing between multiple organizations and customers (or in other words, within an ecosystem). Trinsic Ecosystems is an out-of the-box solution that enables just that with all of the governance and technical tools to make adoption within any ecosystem easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Travis and Riley then focused on what role the COVID-19 pandemic has had in impacting the adoption of verifiable credentials. Riley explained how the pandemic has greatly accelerated interest and demand in verifiable credentials, but it is yet to be determined whether the recent uptake of verifiable credentials adoption is causation or correlation. However, the pandemic has created a major emphasis in creating a solution for digital health passes where health information (like COVID-19 test results or vaccination records) can be shared in a way that abides by data privacy regulation, safeguards the individual, and is standardized.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Travis brought up that health passes related to COVID-19 will eventually not be needed as the world fully recovers from the pandemic. Riley expressed that he looks forward to that day because that means we have beaten the pandemic. Until then, for jurisdictions and businesses that do have policies around COVID-19 test results and/or vaccinations, verifiable credentials provide a good way to enforce those policies in a standardized way, while putting the individual in control of their data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With that being said, if Riley had to make a prediction of what will be the next big use case for verifiable credentials, he said that it would be around taking the identity verifications that are done by Onfido, Passbase, Jumio, and others and simply codifying them in a way that can be reused by the individual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They ended their conversation talking about the future of Trinsic. Riley said that Trinsic’s biggest priority right now is adoption and because of that, they are buckling down on refining the Trinsic Ecosystems product for the foreseeable future.</p>

					<p>Q: What verifiable credentials use cases are enterprise and businesses using Trinsic for?</p><p>A: From the enterprise side, we are mostly seeing customers want to use Trinsic to make data sharing secure, privacy-preserving, and standardized between multiple organizations and their customers. Essentially, instead of disjointed systems having to build and maintain a custom API to share data, with Trinsic, the customer becomes the API, enabling a seamless data sharing process that puts the customer in control of his or her data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does self-sovereign identity reduce costs?</p><p>A: Because credentials can be reused by the individual, organizations no longer have to go through the costly and time-consuming process of re-verifying their customers and their data and can instead do it instantaneously. Additionally, SSI reduces costs for credential issuers in that issuing companies no longer need to be “on call” to vouch whether or not the information is accurate or not, and they no longer need to outsource that role to companies like Equifax and give them access to their database.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How involved are governments in deploying SSI?</p><p>A: Governments are some of the most active proponents of SSI. The USA, Canada, various governments in Europe including the UK and the EU, as well as Asian governments are all investing money in SSI projects. Smaller governments such as state or large jurisdictional governments are also deploying SSI at a surprisingly rapid pace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Do you think that we will have one wallet containing all our credentials or separate wallets by use case based around health, employment, identity, etc.? In the UK, the covid passport is being built around the NHS app, for example.</p><p>A: I think in the near-term we’ll see separate wallets by use case (actually, I think they’ll be by ecosystem). That’s the signal we’re seeing strongly from the market with interest in our Wallet SDK and Ecosystems product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does this differ from Civic’s&nbsp;<a href="http://identity.com/">identity.com</a>&nbsp;(open source ecosystem providing access to on-demand, secure ID verification)?</p><p>A: There are a variety of differences, but the primary one is that <a href="http://identity.com">identity.com</a>, to my knowledge, is an identity verification solution, whereas Trinsic is infrastructure for creating such solutions. Trinsic’s customers span not just identity verification, but government, B2B, and IoT use cases as well. <a href="http://identity.com">Identity.com</a> is also a solution built around the CVC cryptocurrency and leverages smart contracts, whereas Trinsic uses blockchain only as an optional dPKI for organizations. See more about how blockchain fits <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How do you get people to care about adoption? How do you talk about decentralized identity outside of enterprises to encourage people to take action?</p><p>A: People will adopt something if it has a clear benefit to them. It’s too much to expect people to pick up a random SSI wallet from the App Store and start using it throughout their lives. The adoption process will be gradual and may be happening without end users really knowing what’s going on under the hood. For example, a digital health pass might just appear in an app on their phone. The user probably thinks about it in terms of the ability to travel that it affords, not in terms of self-sovereign control over their data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Do you see a use case around account takeover for financial institutions?</p><p>A: Yes, account takeover is one of many use cases we’ve seen financial institutions look into. One of the most challenging parts of securing an account is the different authentication methods for different channels. For example, calling-in uses security questions while in-person uses a physical ID card. Verifiable credentials are an ideal solution for omni-channel authentication, meaning the same factors of authentication can be used in any scenario (login, drive-through, ATM, etc.).

<p>With ongoing developments in the field of smart citiies and digitalization in general, data is becoming a driving factor and value stream for new and existing economies alike. However, there exists an increasing centralization and monopolization of data holders and service providers, especially in the form of the big US-based technology companies in the western world and central technology providers with close ties to the government in the Asian regions. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) provides the technical building blocks to create decentralizied data-driven systems, which bring data autonomy back to the users. In this paper we propose a system in which the combination of SSI and token economy based incentivisation strategies makes it possible to unlock the potential value of data-pools without compromising the data autonomy of the users. </p>

				  Business-critical decentralized identity product demonstrations now have a dedicated platform at Indicio.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation providing hosting and build services for decentralized identity ecosystems, today announced it has launched a new decentralized network to support business-critical demonstrations. The Indicio DemoNet joins the<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/"> Indicio TestNet</a>, which is used for developing new technology releases, and the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, which hosts mission-critical products and services. With the DemoNet, Indicio now provides a full suite of networks for decentralized identity development and deployment.</p>
<p>“The DemoNet completes our network offerings, filling an important gap in the journey from proof of concept to pilot to deployment,” said Heather Dahl, Indicio CEO. “Companies and organizations need a dedicated platform to demonstrate and showcase their technology before it makes the leap to public and commercial release. This is a critical moment for development teams, and Indicio has their back.”</p>
<p>Typically, a company will develop on the TestNet, demonstrate on the DemoNet, and then launch on the MainNet. Unlike the TestNet, which is subject to repeated resets, the DemoNet provides the stability needed for product demonstrations. Indicio’s ecosystem of networks speeds up the time to launch—everything is in one place and supported by our industry leading team of engineers.</p>
<p>The launch of the DemoNet comes after Indicio’s recent announcement of Cardea, a complete open-source project for verifiable health credentials that is now housed at Linux Foundation Public Health. Indicio now provides businesses and organization with a full ecosystem of decentralized identity products, all built on the Hyperledger community’s open source tools, a dynamic, collaborative Node Operator community supporting its networks, and a wide range of training and support services.</p>

<p>It’s RSA Conference week again, and while we’re still functioning in the virtual realm for the time being, some things don’t change. One of those things being executives searching for the best technologies to protect their data and IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/security/the-5-most-innovative-cybersecurity-startups-from-rsa-conference/5">CRN surveyed</a> a number of those executives, asking them to identify the cybersecurity startups they believe best poised to bring to market “innovative ways to protect data, cloud workloads and open-source software”. Here at HYPR, we’re thrilled to crack that Top 5 list, and we couldn’t be prouder to be rubbing shoulders with such unicorns as Orca Security, BigID, Snyk, and BitSight.</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless Authentication is providing a platform for companies to accelerate their MFA initiatives — many mandated by government or insurance regulations — and allocate that budget into a passwordless MFA initiative. As Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s EVP of Cybersecurity Strategy writes, “Most breaches involve either human error or compromised credentials.” Passwordless MFA eliminates the target, and solves the desktop MFA gap.</p>
      
<p>Something I’ve always shied away from as a marketer is submitting my company (or product or C Level executive) into “pay for play” award opportunities. Occasionally there’s decent optics for these, a splashy logo advertising a Best in Category Winner to highlight in a social post, for example. But this? Being named in the Top 5 is the kind of organic win I like to write about: an independent organization surveying executives anonymously, and being grouped with Unicorns. That old adage about being as good as the company you keep certainly rings true here.&nbsp;</p>

 25+ Proof of Concepts (PoCs) for Verifiable Credentials <p>Earlier, we had posted a possible list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">25+ use cases</a> where you can use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) to enhance the security and trustworthiness of a transaction.</p><p>Today, we proudly present another 25+ Proof of Concepts for VC implementation. These use cases are a compilation of the <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">submissions</a> (in no particular order) made by the participants of the Affindi PoCathon&nbsp;2021.</p> AED Access <p>CPR devices provide chest compression during a cardiac arrest to resuscitate a patient and can be a lifesaver in emergencies. However, it must be used only by those trained in CPR to prevent unwanted complications.</p><p>Currently, in the US, companies are worried about the liability of having an untrained person use the CPR device in an emergency, and hence, are wary of making them available to the general public, thereby creating a possible void in emergencies.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-mckay/">Dave McKay</a> came up with the idea of using VCs to solve this problem and implemented the PoC using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs. Here is the workflow of his solution.</p>  The organizations that provide training on CPR and AED devices can issue a credential to people who pass the course and are certified to use the&nbsp;device.  Organizations can place the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/aed-access">AED devices</a> in a locked&nbsp;cabinet.  On the cabinet will be a QR code for a VC proof&nbsp;request.  The VC holder scans the QR code and sends their&nbsp;VC.  The VC triggers a message to the cabinet to&nbsp;unlock.  <p>Thus, a life is potentially saved.</p> YouNo <p>Alan Wang decided to use VCs to solve a social problem that is sometimes even considered taboo to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>He came up with the idea of <a href="https://devpost.com/software/you-no">using VCs</a> to empower sex workers and to protect them from the spread of sexually transmittable diseases. Alan’s implementation aims to share the details of sexually transmitted diseases confidentially and in a trustable way, such that it can only be verified when two people physically meet in&nbsp;person.</p><p>Here, the issuer is a clinic that issues VCs detailing the presence/absence of sexually transmittable diseases in an individual, who is the holder. This VC can be shared by the holder while meeting a sex worker in person, and this worker will verify the VCs before deciding the next&nbsp;step.</p><p>This PoC built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs goes to show how even small steps in technology and innovation can create a big social impact, especially on the marginalized sections of&nbsp;society.</p> Daver Proxy <p>Alex Varabei, Arthur Pinchuk, Александр Годун, Jus1x, Constanine Agapotov, Andrey Kozlovskiy, and Eugene Bogatyrev came together to address the problem of corporate authorization.</p><p>Banks, brokers, and counterparties often request the authorization of a representative to perform certain actions such as bank account opening, contract signing, etc. But this still didn’t solve the problem of trust because the proxy could be revoked at any time. Notary verifications were a hassle due to their cost, time consumption, and complexity of dealing with apostille (not all states joined the Hague Convention).</p><p>To tackle this problem with an SSI-based solution, the team leveraged the timestamping provided by the Ethereum blockchain and used Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs. This solution has three operational roles: Manager, Board Members, and Counterparty (the legal entity that has a stake in ensuring that the proxy is valid to avoid financial risks). VC Issuer is not present on the interface but participates in the process of credential verification. The manager seeks the approval of the proxy by Board Members and the proxy authorizes the Manager to sign a contract on behalf of the company with the counterparty.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/daver-proxy">detailed implementation</a> of this&nbsp;PoC.</p> RippleFund <p>RippleFund by Carey Lai and Callista Chang is a VC-based crowdfunding idea built on Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>It aims&nbsp;to,</p>  Make crowdfunding accessible to and trusted by the public (MAS- and SAF-backed)  Protect crowdfunding backers from con artists and&nbsp;scams  Build trust and engagement among Singaporean startups and crowdfunding backers  Promote entrepreneurship as well as innovative methods of capital raising in Singapore  <p>Click here for a <a href="https://vimeo.com/547835578">demo video</a> of this&nbsp;product.</p> TransportHub <p>Priyanka Pol, Nita Hinge, Madhusudan J, Tanvi Lokhande, and Mandar Tawde decided to ideate the possibility of using verifiable credentials to revolutionize the future of trucking and logistics. They envision TransportHub as a marketplace with verifiable credentials for all parties using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to increase transparency and information flow.</p><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/transportation-hub-lorry-receipt-issuer">TransportHub</a> is a marketplace that would digitize the documents such as lorry receipts, driver information, consignee, consigner, and transporter to give participants visibility to the entire process with digital authentication.</p><p>Here,</p>  Issuer is a startup company called TransportHub that would collect the details from the consignor (the person sending the consignment) and would issue the VC. Some possible information contained in the VC can be related to the consignor, consignee, goods, freight charges, driver, and vehicle&nbsp;details.  Holder is the consignor  Verifier is the consignee (entity receiving the goods), drivers, and others who can use these credentials to change the status of the trip in their respective systems.   The Hospitality Manager <p>Created by Arnav Ladkat and Aamir Miyajiwala, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-hospitality-manager">The Hospitality Manager</a> uses Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to protect the identity documents of travelers and to reduce the possibilities of identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>This project is developed from the perspective of a company that issues VCs that can be verified during hotel check-ins. It verifies user-submitted data and accordingly, issues the VC that can be shared by the holder during his/her&nbsp;travel.</p> Empowering Migrant&nbsp;Workers <p>Another social issue that was addressed was the problem of migrant workers. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/yhgt">David Bensandon</a> came up with this idea where domestic workers can use VCs (reference letters, work permits, etc) to build up their careers, get better salaries, and share them to easily sign up for third-party services.</p><p>In this prototype developed using Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs, a domestic worker will submit a reference letter or a work permit. The agency would verify the validity and authenticity of these documents and issue the VCs accordingly. The domestic worker could then share the reference letter with a job portal, third-party service providers, or any other&nbsp;agency.</p> Patient Health Data Distributed Interface (PHDDI) <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/affinidifabric">verifiable credential PoC</a>, Kent Lau uses Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to record the provision of goods and services by healthcare professionals to an insured patient. The VC gets endorsed by the patient and shared with the insurer for swift reimbursement.</p><p>This is a simple scenario where a patient interacts with several healthcare professionals (issuers), who would be reimbursed by the health insurer (verifier). The patient would hold the VCs in a wallet and share them with the insurer when&nbsp;needed.</p> Pharma’s League <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/pharma-s-league">VC prototype</a>, Carey Lai proposes using Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to eliminate counterfeits in the pharma industry that has been grappling with counterfeit medicines worth $89&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Here, the issuer is the pharma company that can issue a digitized VC for approved merchants looking to resell their products. The holder is the reseller while the verifier is the Pharma’s league, a trusted marketplace. This way, buyers don’t have to worry about the legitimacy of the drugs and the pharma companies will face no losses from counterfeit medicines.</p> Decentralized Clinical&nbsp;Trials <p>With the raging COVID19, decentralized trials are gaining steam because of the speed and efficiency with which they can be performed. At the same time, there are concerns about the trustworthiness of these trials, and Leon Mak aims to address them with VCs built on Affinidi’s SDKs and&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>This <a href="https://devpost.com/software/apply-remotely-for-decentralized-clinical-trials">portal</a> will allow patients to check if they are eligible to participate and remotely share their credentials with those who are conducting the research. Especially when vaccine trials fail to report ethnicity data, having patients participate in trials using verified credentials with such information can help understand how diverse a trial was, and increase the confidence in the drug’s effectiveness.</p> CREDucate <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/creducate">CREDucate</a> by Saundarya Kumar and Pratik Savla is the platform where institutions can issue educational credentials to students who have registered under them and verifiers(other institutions) can request and verify those credentials.</p><p>This platform, built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, can ease the application and verification process in today’s job market. It is envisaged to help students to quickly and securely share their credentials with multiple entities and could provide a way for prospective employers/educational institutions to verify the credentials of the applicants.</p> RxChain <p>Olusegun Usman Quadri, a trained pharmacist and software developer from Nigeria, imagined the possibility of using VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to prevent imitation drugs, cosmetics, and foods that can impact the health of unsuspecting consumers.</p><p>His PoC, called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/rxchain-zr1j9x">RxChain</a>, aims to help pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food companies protect their products by issuing a verifiable credential for each batch of products. This can be verified by the end-users. With this technology, end users can be assured of the source of the products they are taking and can stay away from imitations that can impact their&nbsp;health.</p> Helping Hand&nbsp;SME <p>Many SMEs tend to have cash flow issues despite doing good business due to pending invoices, Since these SMEs play a significant role in every country’s economy, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/helping-hand-sme">Hemanth Ankerla and Manoj Kumar</a> came up with the idea of using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to convert the pending invoices into VCs, so the same can be used as collateral for&nbsp;loans.</p><p>They believe that this idea can be extended to other services like insurance as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Identifier for Traveller <p>Richard Xiang Qian Ong came up with an idea to redefine the check-in process for travellers in the post-pandemic world using verifiable credentials. He believes this would avoid the long waiting times during check-in, the hassle of handing over physical documents during the check-in process, and the danger of COVID-19.</p><p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/global-identifier-for-traveller-using-affinidi-api">PoC</a>, he proposes using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create a verifiable credential that can digitalize the check-in process to make it a safer and hassle-free process for travellers.</p> VaccinationVC <p>Zong Yu Lee wants to use VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to streamline the process of vaccination, especially while traveling. His VC will allow trained personnel who issue the vaccines to sign up for an account and log in, to issue and sign the vaccination certification to those passengers who are eligible for it. The holder can then use this VC to prove their vaccination status to airlines, hotels, AirBnbs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>He foresees <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vaccinationvc">VaccinationVC</a> to be a useful application in a post-COVID19 world where people would want to start traveling after getting their vaccines.</p> Immigrant Verifier <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/vaccinationvc">Immigrant Verifier</a> by Nestor Campos is a PoC that aims to use verifiable credentials built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to help immigrants validate their situation in a specific country, with the help of their governments by validating their data through verified credentials.</p><p>He believes that his solution will allow people to create their credentials, with data that identifies them (passport, national document, and photograph, as well as other data), so that an institution in their country of origin can sign the document and prove the holder’s identity, Later, the holder can present this VC in any part of the destination country to qualify for government benefits, jobs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Employment Certificates <p>Rohit Patil wants to use Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create <a href="https://devpost.com/software/employment-certificates">VCs for employment verification</a> where employers would issue employment certificates that can be easily verified by recruiters with a few simple&nbsp;steps.</p><p>His PoC has three components, namely,</p>  Employee: The employee will apply for employment certificates to his/her employer.  Employer: The employer can see requests submitted by employees and can approve if the submitted information is&nbsp;correct.  Recruiter: Employee can share a link/QR Code of his/her employment VC after storing it in his/her wallet. The recruiter can verify the authenticity of the certificate either by entering the URL or by scanning the QR&nbsp;code.   Power of VCs in a Pandemic Stricken&nbsp;World <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-power-of-vcs-in-a-pandemic-stricken-world">Hao Ze Chok</a> aims to use VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create a validated list of healthcare product suppliers so that nations could quickly engage with them during times of national emergency to commence export operations immediately.</p><p>His idea was born from the recent Covid pandemic that stressed the global supply chain of healthcare and medical products due to the sudden surge in demand among&nbsp;nations.</p><p>In his PoC, an issuer will check the products for their quality and will create a VC for the same. The holder is the seller who can then share this VC through an e-commerce platform for B2C transactions or through email with other B2B transactions. The VCs can be verified on a central platform on each country’s assurance portal.</p> DefenShe <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/defenshe-women-s-emergency-alert-system-gts3yj">DefenShe</a> is an initiative to bridge the gender disparity and empower women’s security by leveraging VCs.This is a real-time women’s emergency alert system built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs and backed by dynamic geofencing and cloud notifications. The currently existing apps consider reporting the emergency only to the official in proximity, which might not ensure a quick response to the alert, since the official might not be near the woman who called for the&nbsp;alert.</p><p>DefenShe solves this problem by considering the public around the woman, which increases the probability of the alert being addressed by a thousand-fold. Moreover, to serve them better and to increase the probability, DefenShe plans to use a credit system that completely revolves around Affinidi API Service to authenticate, authorize, and verify the users for claiming the monetary benefits. DefenShe is envisioned as a self-sustaining application that would generate revenue based on the advertisements powered by Google AdMob and use this for the DefenShe credit system to pay for the users who help a woman in&nbsp;need.</p> KYC Data <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/kyc-data-as-verifiable-credentials-for-policy-documents">PoC</a>, Ian Lim came up with the idea of using an AI chatbot-enabled messaging platform to facilitate the transfer of Know-Your-Customer data as Verifiable Credentials and performing KYC verification before releasing sensitive policy documents. His idea was inspired by Telegram’s integration of its payment service to the messaging platform and uses Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>In this PoC, he explores the possibility of using chatbots to retrieve a user’s insurance policy document. As insurance policy documents are sensitive, his chatbot would use the policy holder’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data as Verifiable Credentials (VC) to perform a KYC check before sending over the document to the policyholder.</p> Banker’s Guarantee <p>Kishan Reddy aims to pave the way for safe and secure global transactions through his VC-based <a href="https://devpost.com/software/safe-trade">Banker’s Guarantee</a> PoC built using Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>In this idea, the business owner would apply for the Banker’s guarantee. The issuer/bank will check the agreement details from the concerned parties and issue the Verifiable Credential as financial security.</p><p>The two parties (holder and verifier) can use this VC to secure the deal. If the payment is not made after the deal, the payment is made by the Bank and this gives the verifier the financial confidence to enter into a business agreement with the&nbsp;holder.</p> Health Wallet <p>As the name suggests, the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/health-wallet-a1ke0t">Health Wallet</a> PoC by Shraddha Kandpal that was built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, would contain the verifiable credentials of a holder related to his/her health and could include health records like prescriptions, reports, medical bills,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When needed, the holder can securely share this information with the concerned parties such as healthcare professionals, insurance companies, and&nbsp;more.</p> Easy Loans <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/easy-loans">Easy loans</a> by Ramya Parthiban is a VC-based loan approval process that could speed up the loan approval process as it won’t entail the collection, submission, and verification of physical documents.</p><p>In her PoC created with Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, all the proofs required for the loan process are verified by trusted third-party financial institutions, and the verifiable credentials are accordingly issued to the borrower. So, the bank can directly verify the Verifiable Credential and approve the loan without having to spend time and resources for the whole process.

When the user votes, the vote will be verified by the verifier which is again a governmental organization.

<p>These two posts point out some common Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that all organizations should be on the lookout for as indicators of attack:</p>
 
 Password spraying against Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices. Legitimate user credentials found and used. 
 Malware exploits against SonicWall VPN (disabling Multi-Factor Authentication). Vulnerability has been patched. 
 Use of phishing emails for initial compromise. 
 Creation of domain accounts for attacker use. 
 Use of Mimikatz for capturing more credentials and escalating privileges. 
 Use of Cobalt Strike, BEACON, BLOODHOUND, TeamViewer, RDP, and F-Secure Labs' C3 (a red teaming tool) for recon, lateral movement, and C2 comms. 
 Use of rclone to exfiltrate data to cloud hosting locations. 
 Deletion of backups and Windows volume shadow copies. 
 Use of ESXi to disable cloud snapshots. 
 Use of PsExec and PowerShell to encrypt victim files. 
 Use of NGROK utility to allow remote access through defenses.

			<p>One of the key benefits of tokenization is that investors get direct ownership of their assets. Through tokenization, they can directly control their portfolio or delegate the management to third-party service providers. As the assets are controlled by smart contracts, it is important to understand the roles and permissions of each of the parties in order to ensure digital asset custody whilst allowing efficient asset management.</p>
<p>Usually, marketplace platforms enable issuers and investors to manage security tokens across the lifecycle by providing web interfaces reflecting the blockchain states. If the digital asset marketplace helps issuing tokens on a public blockchain, they can also provide ways for their users to connect their blockchain identities and/or wallets to secure the access to smart contracts and token keys. Indeed, issuers and/or their agents need to perform administrative and corporate functions by signing blockchain transactions.</p>
 Safekeeping of private keys and authorizing agents 
<p>Marketplace operators must not propose wallet services to issuers. Issuers must be in control of their securities as they are the liable counterparty. They can delegate some responsibilities, but they must be able to manage their service providers. Concretely, the issuer must be the technical owners of their smart contracts, and be able to appoint the relevant smart contracts functions to their agents depending on their roles and delegated responsibilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issuer needs a wallet that’s set as the owner and controller of the smart contracts and one that can be used to grant certain permissions to its agents. This wallet will therefore not be used on a daily basis and can be easily secured with a multisig or in cold storage.</p>
<p>Everytime a function of a smart contract is triggered, a transaction is sent to the blockchain, and an authorized wallet must sign it. In order to respect the roles and permissions, it is important that each stakeholder manages the access of its own wallet. To reduce risks, these wallets must always be replaceable and this is only possible if the wallets are linked to a blockchain identity. For example, a smart contract owner should be able to change its agent(s) at any time, and the agent should be able to recover the lost tokens of an investor and so on.</p>
  
 Agent roles and marketplaces 
<p>Issuers are obligated to perform a range of administrative tasks and functions after the primary issuance of their assets. In traditional markets these functions are typically performed by agents. The marketplace, with its own wallets, can act as an agent and combine different roles such as KYC agent (add proofs of KYC on the blockchain, whitelist Investors, etc.), paying agent, transfer agent, registrar, etc.</p>
<p>These tasks could be performed on the blockchain directly but of course, a web platform triggering the blockchain functions is more suitable and easy to use. Therefore, in order to perform these functions, issuers, or the agent they instruct, should ideally access an administration panel linking the blockchain data with confidential information such as the names and addresses of the Investors.</p>
<p>The marketplace, by leveraging the security token standard they use, should provide a servicing platform in order to manage the lifecycle of the assets. This part of the platform needs to enable the agent or directly the issuer to perform operations on the tokens (like mint/burn, pause/unpause, force transfer, etc.) and to manage investors status and access their identity information. At the minimum, the platform should provide the following set of features:</p>
 
 
 
 Asset control and oversight to force and block transfers between their investors. 
 Maintain complete and transparent logs of data. 
 Run position reports immediately. 
 View their cap table that’s automatically updated throughout the lifecycle. 
 To perform the recovery process for investors if they have lost their wallet information and access to their security tokens. This can be performed securely through identification of the investor.

 Platform provider enriches IDnow AutoIdent with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to create even better user experience 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, May 20th 2021, IDnow, a German based leader&nbsp;in&nbsp;platform-as-a-service&nbsp;identity verification, today announced the implementation of NFC reading capability into IDnow AutoIdent. This will offer users an even smoother and quicker verification process.</p>
<p>The new solution will support all identification documents globally that follow the ICAO 9303 standard like ePassports and NFC supported ID cards. All the user needs are an ID card with a RFID chip (radio-frequency identification) as well as an NFC-enabled smartphone. The IDnow App recognizes the availability of an RFID chip, reads the personal data and biometric information (photo) that is contained on the chip with integrated privacy protection and compares the biometric information retrieved from the chip to a video selfie and a liveness check.</p>
<p>IDnow has seen that users increasingly value quick and easy identification and appreciate the freedom of choice when selecting their identification method. Different user groups prefer different methods, and businesses&nbsp; can see large increases in their conversion rates if they offer users a choice. Therefore, IDnow offers a comprehensive platform, that includes identification methods from offline to online, from automated methods to procedures carried out by identity specialists, available flexibly online, offline in branches and even by a courier at the user’s doorstep.</p>
<p>“The NFC capability for our AutoIdent product is a significant step in order to further augment our platform and create a smooth user journey for everyone. Our customers value this freedom of choice for their user and see high conversion rates with seamless, easy processes”, says Vikas Seth, CPO at IDnow. “Through the application of NFC-based RFID chip read out in the IDnow AutoIdent product, you don’t need to compromise, but get the best of both worlds – a high level of security and a convenient onboarding process at high speed”, he adds.</p>
<p>The principle of reading out an ePassport via NFC is successfully used by airports with ePassport gates, places with an extremely high security requirements. By adding this feature to IDnow AutoIdent, IDnow is empowering banks, insurance providers and other businesses to get the same level of protection from fraudsters and identity thieves through a method, that is already well established and understood by their end users, completely automated and built to improve conversion rates.</p>
<p>For high security use cases IDnow is also offering a variant that can check the authenticity of the RFID chip and validate it on a secure server with digital certificates to ensure that the RFID chip itself is not compromised by fraudsters.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond simply offering individual ident methods and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year.</p>
<p>In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers for on- and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

<p>It’s official:&nbsp;only&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;US&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;want apps to track them across the internet for targeted advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means&nbsp;95% of&nbsp;US&nbsp;consumers are saying&nbsp;‘no way’&nbsp;to&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking with Apple’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT)&nbsp;feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verizon Media’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">Flurry Analytics</a>&nbsp;is monitoring&nbsp;daily&nbsp;US and worldwide&nbsp;opt-in&nbsp;rates&nbsp;for&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;following&nbsp;the ATT release,&nbsp;and it’s&nbsp;abundantly&nbsp;clear&nbsp;most consumers&nbsp;like the&nbsp;control&nbsp;ATT&nbsp;gives them over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 5% stat we quote here was posted at 10 am Pacific Standard Time on May 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flurry Analytics is&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;answers to&nbsp;the&nbsp;privacy question,&nbsp;Do you want&nbsp;us to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites?&nbsp;which now appears when&nbsp;a&nbsp;user opens an app for the first time after the iOS 14.5 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flurry Analytics&nbsp;says it has&nbsp;aggregated insights across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">2 billion mobile phone devices</a>&nbsp;per month. As well as&nbsp;the ATT&nbsp;opt-in rate in the US and worldwide,&nbsp;Flurry is&nbsp;also monitoring the share of users that apps cannot ask to track (‘restricted’ status) in both the US and worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&nbsp;shows&nbsp;the worldwide opt-in rate is higher than the US rate, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">13%</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;10 am Pacific Standard Time on May 8, 2021, but as they&nbsp;say&nbsp;over at&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">Ars&nbsp;Technica</a>, this global number is still below some ad companies’&nbsp;opt-in&nbsp;estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT will&nbsp;likely&nbsp;sucker punch ad tech&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree with Flurry Analytics when it describes iOS 14.5 as “the most industry-impacting iOS release to date”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stats are rapidly confirming early fears from ad tech&nbsp;that ATT will be very bad for business — which is why&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;has&nbsp;pushed&nbsp;back so hard&nbsp;against&nbsp;it for 12 months and with&nbsp;extra&nbsp;gusto recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The media is having a field day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-14-5-users-opt-out-of-ad-tracking/">Mashable</a>&nbsp;starts its article about the&nbsp;low US&nbsp;opt-in rate with “Sorry, Facebook.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over at&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">Ars&nbsp;Technica</a>&nbsp;they’re saying: “Some of the first data on user behavior exceeds advertisers’&nbsp;worst fears.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are, of course, going to watch this space. In the meantime,&nbsp;we recommend that you answer ‘no’ to the ATT privacy question. Disabling cross-app tracking is good for your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read our article&nbsp;“Apple’s New ATT and Why Facebook Is Pushing Back Hard”&nbsp;if you want to understand ATT better. Importantly, remember ATT doesn’t stop tracking within a single app (it’s only for cross-app tracking). You still need&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized and protected</a>&nbsp;across different services.

<p>Securing high-value physical asset NFTs requires the dynamic and scalable approach to distributed risk protection that UNION&nbsp;provides</p><p>The DeFi (decentralized finance) space has seen explosive growth over the past couple years as numerous protocols have emerged to power an open financial infrastructure for borrowing, lending, liquidity provision, stablecoin issuance, and other services in this uniquely composable network. At the time of writing, the current<a href="https://defipulse.com/"> total value locked</a> (TVL) in DeFi protocols has exceeded $55 billion in digitally-native crypto assets. Yet throughout this stratospheric growth in DeFi, several high-profile protocols have been hacked or exploited, compromising tens of millions in crypto-assets and causing cascading effects throughout these interdependent protocols.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>’s core mission is to build the legal and technical systems that can bring the trillions of dollars in underutilized and illiquid physical assets into the crypto economy, which begs the question: how do we safeguard against systemic failures throughout all parts of the protocol&nbsp;stack?</p><p>Our recently announced partnership with<a href="https://www.unn.finance/index.html"> UNION</a> will provide the dynamic and scalable approach to providing risk protection which will integrate seamlessly with Mattereum Asset Passports and associated Real-World Asset NFTs (rwaNFTs).</p><p>Here’s a brief overview of the DeFi insurance landscape, UNION’s unique approach to risk protection, and how the UNION and Mattereum integration will work in practice.</p> The Current State of DeFi Insurance <p>Insurance is a vast and complicated topic, and this is certainly true in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, insurance is about mitigating and protecting against possible risks which can befall an individual, group, institution, or system. Risk protection is packaged and purchased in various forms in the marketplace and is activated when someone makes a claim to offset or cover costs stemming from the particular event in question (accident, medical care, etc.). Managing risk in commerce and life is, shall we say, a messy business.</p><p>However, crypto, being a global financial network powered by decentralised, interdependent protocols and a largely pseudonymous and in some cases anonymous user base, complicates the notion even further. How do we protect assets in this Rube Goldberg financial infrastructure in which we often don’t know the other&nbsp;players?</p><p>Risk protection and insurance-like platforms in the blockchain world have covered mainly two areas: smart contract cover and transaction risk.</p>  Smart Contract Cover: Individuals purchase cover in relation to a particular smart contract underpinning a DeFi protocol. If the smart contract was exploited and funds were lost, the individual could then make a claim once said hack has been verified by an oracle. This sort of cover is notably provided by Nexus Mutual (NXM). Yearn Finance creator Andre Cronje later created a workaround of NXM’s KYC requirements and built yInsure, a means of buying smart contract cover underwritten by NXM and packaged as&nbsp;NFTs.  Transaction risk: As the term denotes, this form of risk protection is focused on singular transactions rather than ongoing operations in DeFi protocols (e.g. liquidity provision, staking, etc.). An example of one approach to risk protection at this scale can be found in VouchForMe, a peer-to-peer insurance protocol that leverages a “social proof” system for individuals to establish their trustworthiness with one another. Alice puts her reputation and some financial stake on the line by lending credibility to Bob, vice versa, and across a network of peers, establishing a bottom-up trust framework to secure confidence in commercial transactions.  <p>Currently, the available platforms lack the magnitude or dynamism that can provide a more layered risk protection at all levels of the protocol stack, from the base-layer blockchain to smart contracts moving billions in value every&nbsp;day.</p><p>So if the current systems are inadequate for the scale of DeFi, how does UNION’s design provide the necessary guard rails for safely bridging DeFi to the physical world through the Mattereum Protocol?</p> UNION: Decentralized, Full-Stack Risk Protection for&nbsp;DeFi <p>UNION is a platform which provides bundled risk protection, decentralized governance and inclusion, a liquid secondary marketplace for sharing risk, and a multi-token model that is altogether capable of covering the myriad risks in this uniquely open, interconnected, and global financial system. Let’s unpack this statement:</p>  Bundled risk protection: UNION can provide risk protection to various activities and operations within the crypto economy throughout the entire protocol stack, including possible systemic fallouts from base-layer exploits, smart contracts, and applications. Most blockchain insurance projects focus mostly on smart contract&nbsp;cover.  Day-one decentralized governance: The platform will be powered by a combination of the community of stakeholders and the UNN DAO. The former are UNN holders who can participate in governance (direct or delegated). The latter is a virtual organization composed of larger UNN stakeholders, the UNION Foundation, and industry experts voted into the DAO which altogether work toward ensuring that UNION remains secure, fair, and transparent. All without KYC requirements.  Liquid marketplace for risk-sharing: UNION has adapted battle-tested pricing models in the traditional financial and insurance industries to the DeFi markets, allowing the unique composition of stakeholders in the blockchain industry to better distribute risk and create a safer environment for digital commerce and&nbsp;finance.  Multi-token model: UNION uses a three-token model. UNN is used by community stakeholders for strictly governance processes (voting, conflict resolution, protocol adjustments). uUNN tokens give protection buyers rights to a particular policy. pUNN are issued to writers of protection policies, representing a percentage share of the protection pool. This three-tiered structure specifically separates governance tokens from protection tokens to prevent conflicts of interest or clashing market dynamics. Bundling multiple utilities within one token can create critical problems down the line, such as when Nexus Mutual (NXM)<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/nexus-mutual-just-ran-out-defi-coverage-heres-why/"> ran out of DeFi coverage</a> in September 2020 from a third party’s botched liquidity mining&nbsp;scheme.  <p>UNION’s composable and adaptable design is quite suited for integration with the Mattereum Protocol. Here’s how it will&nbsp;work:</p> Mattereum &amp; UNION: Risk Protection for the Digital-Physical Economy <p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Real-World Asset NFTs, and Trust Communities. Here’s how the protocol works, in&nbsp;brief:</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the<a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/"> Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p>  Asset Passports are a bundle of legal warranties tied to a particular object. Essential warranties include identification (data points provided by the owner and subject experts which describe and authenticate the asset), confirmation of the presence and capabilities of verification technologies such as NFC tags, and establishing the pairing of an asset with a particular Real-World Asset NFT (along with the terms of purchase and ownership of the&nbsp;same.)  Real-World Asset NFTs (rwaNFTs) are unique digital tokens that denote the right to take physical custody of a particular object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an underlying physical asset, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability to create trust in&nbsp;trade.  Trust Communities are the network of expert certifiers that will accrue around an object (artwork, memorabilia, precious metals) throughout its lifetime. All expert certification of an object is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment.  <p>In practice, the Mattereum Asset Passport will integrate with UNION as a warranty with a plain-English prose agreement that features a pointer to the specific UNION risk protection pool and vice versa, dually-integrating the two systems. This is how we bring insurance into the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>The UNION protection pools can also facilitate the indemnified certification process that form an object’s Trust Community, providing tiered coverage for appraisers with liquidity sourced from UNION protection pools.</p><p>From zero history to storied&nbsp;value</p><p>With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for decades. Our partnership with UNION provides a key piece of the puzzle: a decentralized yet robust platform for full-stack risk protection that can provide some peace of mind for participants within the Mattereum Protocol and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-union-risk-protection-for-the-digital-physical-economy-628371e4cf8a">Mattereum &amp; UNION: Risk Protection for the Digital-Physical Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Avoid costly industry deadlocks and gatekeeping with a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized collectible grading and authentication services with the Mattereum Protocol</p><p>On March 30, 2020, the collectible sports card world was shaken by the news that the gold standard card grading and authentication service,<a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/10367/psa-customer-update-april-2021"> PSA</a>, had decided to close its doors to new submissions following a vast uptick in demand in recent months that had created an insurmountable backlog. Competing firms may enjoy a new wave of users from this new demand, but as they operate on the same business model and processes — accepting incredibly steep submission and grading fees and using trained in-house personnel — this new window of profitability and growth may inevitably lead to the same path as PSA: incapacitation and immense loss of&nbsp;value.</p><p>How can the collectible card world achieve and sustain a level of scalability, resilience, and quality in the expert certification process that can adapt to the ebbs and flows of a growing, global industry?</p><p>Enter the Mattereum Protocol, a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized grading and authentication firms that elegantly brings assets from zero history to storied value with built-in legal warranties and dispute resolution.</p><p>Before diving into how Mattereum addresses these issues, let’s first unpack the incumbent business&nbsp;model.</p> Monopolies | High Fees | Gated&nbsp;Markets Monopoly Mural photo by BP Miller via<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Sgb3OmpipWY">&nbsp;Unsplash</a><p>Grading companies wield immense monopolistic power. A small number are held as industry standards. A favorable grading from them is much sought after. An unfavorable grading from them is fairly damning. A high rating by a firm like PSA can be the difference between a card valued at $500 versus $50,000 or more. Most of the card sales that make headlines with multi-million dollar auctions feature a PSA grade. In fact, a profitable cottage industry of specialist companies have arisen to offer predictions of what the PSA rating for a card may be. Occupying this indispensable position, grading companies can charge what they like for their services, comfortable in the knowledge that collectors and dealers will pay&nbsp;it.</p><p>There is a fundamental imbalance in power here. Disputes over a grading, while not impossible, are very difficult as grading companies are insulated by their Ts&amp;Cs which state that grading conforms to THEIR standards and that graders are authorized to exercise their judgement within these bounds. This is a double edged sword. While it ensures judgement by established criteria, it also grants their objective opinions on certain matters a great deal of&nbsp;weight.</p><p>In the legal world, we call these sorts of arrangements contracts of adhesion, situations in which a single, powerful firm takes charge of the contract drafting process and is able to bend the agreements to their favor. This a common instrument (among others) wielded by companies with monopolistic and gatekeeping tendencies.</p><p>Yet, despite the value and reputation these firms have in the collectibles industry, the actual mechanics of their business are difficult to scale which can be a stated justification for egregiously high fees. And so it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>We propose a different way of doing&nbsp;things.</p> The Mattereum Protocol in&nbsp;Practice <p>Peer production of goods, services, and infrastructure has become a powerful phenomenon in the 21st century. With the monumental success of peer-produced operating systems (Linux), encyclopedias (Wikipedia), and financial infrastructures (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains), it is not a stretch to imagine other industry verticals that could benefit from a similar paradigm shift. The ecosystem that has built around collectible card grading and authentication is certainly ripe for disruption in a way that encourages economic decentralization and genuine market efficiency.</p><p>To accomplish this, the Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Trust Communities, and Real-World Asset&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the<a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/"> Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>. For purposes of this article, we will mostly highlight the certification process.)</p> The Mattereum Asset&nbsp;Passport <p>In short, an Asset Passport is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary in accordance to the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification (with data points provided by the owner). Other warranties that may accompany an asset like a sports card may include a reference to the particular tagging system used for in-person authentication of the item (such as scannable NFC chips affixed to the object) or the token smart contract if the card has been tokenized and “uploaded” to an NFT marketplace. In practice, the Asset Passport aggregates warranties and object information using established best practices.</p><p>The Asset Passport provides the basis for securing an object’s provenance and value over time through protocols rather than firms. The following are some of the benefits this structure provides for the sports card industry.</p>  Skin in the&nbsp;game  <p>All expert certification of a card is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Even if they are not employed by one of the big grading companies (and wouldn’t this be a great arrangement for former staff of these organizations?), the fact that these experts are willing to put skin in the game and put their own money behind their assessments will not be overlooked by serious collectors.</p><p>2. Trust Communities</p><p>By virtue of Mattereum’s method of bringing together multiple third-party sources of information on objects, it is possible for a card’s Asset Passport to contain several independent assessments of its authenticity, provenance, and condition. This would enable buyers to get a broader perspective not limited to centralized firms. Experts can also hold each other to account to safeguard against erroneous claims. Through this distributed framework of crowdsourcing expertise, trust becomes a feature powered by community, not simply a risk to be mitigated.</p><p>3. Dispute Resolution</p><p>Buyers of the card have much clearer and impartial paths of recourse through the Mattereum Protocol if they have doubts about any information in a card’s Asset Passport. Our dispute resolution procedures ensure that suitably knowledgeable arbitrators will decide each case, and that these arbitrators will be neutral rather than defending the interests and reputation of a company. Fortunately, this mechanism is globally enforceable across 150+ countries by the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration.</p><p>4. Composability</p><p>A Mattereum Asset Passport is more than just a grading.

<p>After this post you’ll know exactly what it means to use blockchain technology for Identity Management.</p>



<p>Blockchain is one of the 3 pillars of <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (alongside Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers) and we’ve spent the past 4 years building&nbsp;<a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/">Self-Sovereign Identity solutions</a>&nbsp;for organisations such as&nbsp;The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs&nbsp;and&nbsp;The United Nations Development Programme.</p>



<p>In this blog our team of experts examine what blockchain is, what benefits it brings to identity management, the role of cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, why it’s a terrible idea to put personal data on the blockchain and much more.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in.</p>



 



 What is Blockchain? 



<p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), commonly simply called “Blockchain Technology”, refers to the technology behind decentralised databases providing control over the evolution of data between entities through a peer-to-peer network, using consensus algorithms that ensure replication across the nodes of the network.<br></p>



<p>More simply put:</p>



<p>Imagine a book (or ledger) that anyone could obtain, free of charge, where anything written on its pages would be there forever, and at the same time, would be cross-referenced with the other books to check whether what was written to be valid and true; this is the essence of DLT.<br></p>



 



 Why was Blockchain created? 



<p>Digital assets have a problem. How does one avoid that an asset, such as digital money, is copied and used by several people? That was a problem that always plagued the adoption of digital currency.&nbsp;</p>



 



 



  



 



<p>Banks allow trust between people exchanging funds. The bank withdraws the funds from person A and assures it’s deposited on B’s account. Both parties trust the bank to perform the operation.<br></p>



<p>But if one intended to create an ecosystem where there is not a single entity controlling the flow of information, where a user could send money directly to another user without it going through a central entity, this was a problem. How could the people involved in this financial system trust that the money had left A’s account and deposited on B’s? How could it be avoided that this digital money was copied and double (or triple) spent by A?<br></p>



<p>This problem was solved by the person, or entity, known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.</p>



 



 Why is a Blockchain secure? 



<p>What makes blockchain&nbsp;secure&nbsp;is the fact that each block where data is recorded cannot be changed. One can only write to the blockchain after the&nbsp;consensus of the majority&nbsp;of the network. Meaning that for a piece of information to be changed, all the blocks created after it would have to be changed and 51% of the network would have to agree on that change. Since blocks are being created every moment, changing those and the blocks preceding it until reaching the one we intended to change, would require enormous computing power. Also changing a block will result in creating a new branch of information which will be considered the source of truth, but the existing data also remains in a different branch, this process is called&nbsp;forking.<br></p>



 



 



  



 



<p>Satoshi created blockchain to solve the double-spend problem of digital currency and to act as a ledger, a registry, of the transactions of Bitcoin. Each person that transacts Bitcoin acts as a node in the network, registering a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This makes it decentralized, as no central authority is needed and each person in the network can write on the ledger, and allows for consensus in the network without the need of a middle-man. The more people are in the network, the more difficult it is for a majority collusion in order to subvert the veracity of the information on the blockchain.<br></p>



<p>With a public, immutable, registry, managed by collaboration and collective altruism, this digital currency users could easily verify transactions and be assured that the funds were being transferred only once and not digitally copied infinitely.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>A Blockchain is also considered a system with high Byzantine Fault tolerance. A Byzantine Fault is an occurrence on decentralized systems where it may appear, for one user, that the system is working perfectly and, to others, that the system is failing.</p>



 



 How does a Blockchain work? 



<p>The units where information are registered, the “pages” of this ledger, are blocks. Each block contains hashed information.<br></p>



<p>A hash is a function widely used in cryptography. It’s a mathematical algorithm that transforms a piece of information into a string of alphanumeric values: the “hash” or “hash value”. If the same information is introduced in the input, it will always deliver the same hash in the output. If there’s even the slightest change in the input information, the output hash will be widely different (this is known as the avalanche effect). Avoiding any correlation between hashes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s a “one way function” because using the hash value in the output to find what was the information in the input is extremely difficult.</p>



 



  



 



<p>An Example of the hash and how the avalanche effect alters the output with even the slightest change in the input. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">(Graph Source)</a></p>



<p>Each block is linked to the next block through a cryptographic hash, and so on. Creating a chain. Thus, the blockchain.</p>



 



 Permissioned or Permissionless Blockchains 



<p>Blockchains can be Permissioned or Permissionless.<br></p>



<p>Permissionless, like the most digital currency blockchains, allow all users to write on the ledger. There’s no permission needed from anyone to become a node on the network.<br></p>



<p>To become a node on a Permissioned blockchains, one would need authorization from one or several parties. An example of a Permissioned Blockchain is the <a href="http://www.sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> one. Sovrin is governed by a set of Stewards who act as nodes. This is done to preserve the integrity of the information, in this case related to digital identity, that is written on the ledger. Stewards are trusted and vetted by The Sovrin Foundation.<br></p>



 



 What is Identity Management? 



<p>Also known as “identity and access management”, or IAM, identity management comprises all the processes and technologies within an organisation that are used to identify, authenticate and authorize someone to access services or systems in that said organisation or other associated ones.</p>



<p>Examples of this would range from customers and/or employees accessing software or hardware inside a company/enterprise – and the level of access, privileges and restrictions each user has while doing so – or, in a governmental setting, the issuing and verification of birth certificates, national id cards, passports or driver’s licenses (that allow a user/citizen to not only prove his identity but also access services from the government and other organisations). </p>



 



 The problem with current Identity Management Systems 



<p>Identity has a problem. If it’s paper-based, such as birth certificates sitting idly in a basement of a town hall, it’s subject to loss, theft of fraud. </p>



<p>A digital identity reduces the level of bureaucracy and increases the speed of processes within organisations by allowing for a greater interoperability between departments and other institutions. But if this digital identity is stored on a centralised server, it becomes a target for hackers. Since 2017 alone, more than 600 million personal details – such as addresses or credit card numbers – have been hacked, leaked or breached from organisations.</p>



<p>Most of the current identity management systems are weak and outdated.<br></p>



 



  



 



<p>Identities need to be portable and verifiable everywhere, any time, and digitization can enable that. But being digital is not enough. Identities also need to be private and secure.</p>



<p>Several industries suffer the problems of current identity management systems:<br></p>



  Government: The lack of interoperability between departments and government levels takes a toll in the form of excess bureaucracy. Which, in turn, increases processes’ times and costs.  



  Healthcare: half of the world’s population does not have access to quality healthcare. The lack of interoperability between actors in the healthcare space (Hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, doctors, pharmacies, etc) leads to inefficient healthcare and delayed care and frustration for patients.  



  Education: It is estimated that two hundred thousand fake academic certificates are sold each year in the USA alone. The difficulty in verifying the authenticity of these credentials leads to hiring of unqualified professionals, brand damage to the universities and the hiring companies.  



  Banking: the need for login details such as passwords decreases the security of banking for users.&nbsp;  



  Businesses in general: the current need to store clients’ and employees’ personal data is a source of liability for companies. A personal data breach may result in huge fines due to GDPR infringement – such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48905907">British Airways case</a> – or simply due to customer trust loss and consequential damage to the organisation’s brand.  



 



 Models of Digital Identity Management 



<p>The first model of digital identity management was a siloed one. Each organisation issued a digital identity credential to a user to allow them to access its services. Each user needed a new digital identity credential for every new organisation he engages with. That&nbsp;provided a poor user experience. Just remember all the websites you had to register and create new passwords and login details for.<br></p>



 



  



 



<p>The second model of digital identity management is called the “Federated” one. Because of the poor user experience of the first model, third parties began issuing digital identity credentials that allow users to login to services and other websites. The best examples of this are “Login with Facebook” and “Login with Google” functionalities. Companies “outsourced” their identity management to major corporations who have an economic interest in ammassing such large databases of personal data. This, of course, raises privacy and security concerns.<br></p>



<p>Facebook, Google and others became the middlemen of trust.<br></p>



<p>The emergence of&nbsp;Blockchain&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;Decentralized Identifiers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;allowed the creation of a third model of identity management: <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>



 



 A Blockchain based Identity Management Solution 



<p>As conceptualised and standardised by the W3C, the three pillars of <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> are the Verifiable Credentials protocol, the Decentralized Identifiers protocol and Distributed Ledger Technology (or Blockchain).</p>



 



 The relationship between Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials and Blockchain in identity management 



<p>According to W3C, “Verifiable credentials represent statements made by an issuer in a tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.” <a href="https://tykn.tech/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, in essence, allow for the digital watermarking of claims data through a combination of public key cryptography and privacy-preserving techniques to prevent correlation. The effect of this is that now, not only can physical credentials safely be turned digital, holders of such credentials can selectively disclose specific information from this credential without exposing the actual data (imagine proving you are above the age of 21 without having to show your ID card!), where third-parties are instantly able to verify this data without having to call upon the issuer.</p>



<p><a href="https://tykn.tech/decentralized-identifiers-dids/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> are globally, unique and persistent identifiers. They are entirely controlled by the identity owner. DIDs are independent of centralised registries, authorities or identity providers.</p>



<p>When an organisation issues you a <a href="https://tykn.tech/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credential</a>, they attach their Public DID to that credential. That same Public DID is also stored on the blockchain, an immutable record of data. When someone wants to verify the authenticity/validity of the Credential, they can check the DID on the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party.</p>



<p>The Blockchain acts as a verifiable data registry. A “phonebook” that anyone can consult to verify what organisation a specific Public DID belongs to.</p>



<p>In identity management, a distributed ledger (a “blockchain”) enables everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who attested to the validity of the data inside the credential, without revealing the actual data.</p>



 



<a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/"></a>



 



 The 3 actors in Identity Management with Blockchain: Owners, issuers and verifiers 



<p>When talking about leveraging blockchain technology for identity management, it’s important to note that there are three different actors in play: identity owners, identity issuers and identity verifiers.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The identity issuer, a trusted party such as local government, can issue personal credentials for an identity owner (the user). By issuing a credential, the identity issuer attests to the validity of the personal data in that credential (e.g. last name and date of birth). The identity owner can store those credentials in their personal identity wallet and use them later to prove statements about his or her identity to a third party (the verifier).<br></p>



<p>A Credential is a set of multiple identity attributes and an identity attribute is a piece of information about an identity (a name, an age, a date of birth).&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Credentials are issued by second parties whom attest to the validity of the data inside the credential. The usefulness and reliability of a credential fully depends on the reputation/trustworthiness of the issuer.<br></p>



 



  



 



 How Blockchain brings privacy and security to Identity Management 



<p>Through the infrastructure of a blockchain, the verifying parties do not need to check the validity of the actual data in the provided proof but can rather use the blockchain to check the validity of the attestation and attesting party (such as the government) from which they can determine whether to validate the proof.</p>



<p>For example, when an identity owner presents a proof of their date-of-birth, rather than actually checking the truth of the date of birth itself, the verifying party will validate the government’s signature who issued and attested to this credential to then decide whether he trusts the government’s assessment about the accuracy of the data. </p>



<p>Hence, the validation of a proof is based on the verifier’s judgement of the reliability of the attestor. </p>



<p>Leveraging blockchain technology, like Tykn‘s <a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/">Self-Sovereign Identity solution</a> does, establishes trust between the parties and guarantees the authenticity of the data and attestations, without actually storing any personal data on the blockchain. </p>



<p>This is crucial as a distributed ledger is immutable, meaning anything that is put on the ledger can never be altered nor deleted, and thus no personal data should ever be put on the ledger.</p>



 



 Blockchain Identity Management Red Flag: Does personal data go on a Blockchain? 



  Putting personal data on the ledger&nbsp;puts the privacy of the users in danger&nbsp;(as it will constantly be subject to hacking and data breaches). It could always be hacked (if not now, probably at some point in the future)  It violates current privacy regulation (e.g.&nbsp;GDPR;&nbsp;right to be forgotten);  it is also not efficient as an&nbsp;identity is dynamic&nbsp;(attributes can change over time e.g. house address or number of children).  



<p>When working in digital identity and identity management with blockchain, it’s extremely important to always keep in mind that:</p>



<p>No personal data should ever be put on a blockchain.</p>



 



  



 



 When using a Blockchain Identity Management system what exactly goes on the Blockchain? 



<p>Only references and the associated attestation of a user’s verified credential are put on the ledger.</p>



<p>Privacy can be ensured through non-correlation principles via&nbsp;pseudonymisation. So, instead of storing actual private information, the only things stored on the ledger (for the purpose of verification) are:</p>



  Public Decentralised Identifiers (Public DIDs)&nbsp;and associated&nbsp;DID Descriptor Objects&nbsp;(DDOs) with verification keys and endpoints.&nbsp;   DIDs are a new type of unique identifiers for verifying digital identities, and are&nbsp;entirely controlled by the identity owner. DIDs are independent of centralised registries, authorities or identity providers.     Schemas.&nbsp;   The formal description for the structure of a credential.     Credential definitions.&nbsp;   The different (often tangible)&nbsp;proofs of identity or qualification issued by authorities; such as drivers licenses, passports, identification cards, credit cards, etc. Hence, credential definitions are — as the name suggests — merely the definitions of these different credentials to be stored on the ledger.     Revocation registries.&nbsp;   An option for issuers to be able to&nbsp;revoke the claim. The revocation registry is what tells the rest of the world how the issuer will publish the revocation information.     Proofs of consent for data sharing.&nbsp;   In order to prove consent or reception of data (basically saying the data has been received and checks have been executed on it), these consent receipts (i.e. proofs of consent) let people do so.     



 



 Cryptography&nbsp;in&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;Management 



<p>Whenever we need to prove something about our identity – either our name, address or passport number – there is a process of authentication. A verifying entity confirms that the data we are claiming about ourselves is true or false. This is usually done through the verification of our identifying documents.<br></p>



<p>These identity verification and authentication processes make privacy concerns arise. Should a verifying entity requesting me to prove my name with my passport have access to the remaining information contained in my document while they are looking at it to verify that information? Does an entity that request a proof of my age need to know the day and month I was born?</p>



 



 A blockchain identity management system that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs 



<p>A Zero-Knowledge Proof is a method of authentication that, through the use of cryptography, allows one entity to prove to another entity that they know a certain information or meet a certain requirement without having to disclose any of the actual information that supports that proof. The entity that verifies the proof has thus “zero knowledge” about the information supporting the proof but is “convinced” of its validity. This is especially useful when and where the prover entity does not trust the verifying entity but still has to prove to them that he knows a specific information.<br></p>



<p>In an identity management with blockchain scenario, this allows a person to prove that their personal details fulfil certain requirements without revealing the actual details. <br></p>



<p>For example, one could prove that she is over 21, without showing her exact date of birth.<br></p>



<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs are famously illustrated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_Problem">“Yao’s Millionaires’ problem”</a>. A scenario formulated by the computer scientist Andrew Yao. Yao discusses two millionaires, Alice and Bob, who do not want to reveal how much money each has but want to know who is the richest.<br></p>



 



  



 



 Decentralized Identifiers: The next big thing in Identity Management with Blockchain. 



<p>DIDs are a new type of unique identifiers for verifying digital identities, and are entirely controlled by the identity owner. DIDs are independent of centralised registries, authorities or identity providers.<br></p>



<p>According to <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Phil Windley</a>, Chairman at Sovrin, DIDs should have the following properties:<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be non-reassignable. They should be permanent. Other identifiers, such as IP address or email address, can be reassigned to other entities by whomever is in control. This reduces privacy and security.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be resolvable. Each DID resolves to a DID Document that states the “public keys, authentication protocols, and service endpoints necessary to initiate trustworthy interactions with the identified entity” (<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">source</a>). Through the DID Document, an entity should understand how to use that DID.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be cryptographically verifiable. Through the use of cryptographic keys, a DID owner can prove their ownership of the DID. The public key contained in the DID Document can also be used to attest to the authenticity of the issuing authority’s signature associated with a credential.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be decentralized. Current identity management systems rely on centralized registries. Each of these registries ensures trust. DIDs do not depend on a central authority. Distributed ledger technology ensures trust as it allows everyone to have the same source of truth about the data in the credentials.<br></p>



<p>A new spec is coming up in W3C where you don’t need to always rely on the central service to resolve DIDs. For use cases where a DID is going to be unique. E.g in pairwise connections or closed groups you can use Peer DIDs. More info on this, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes">here</a>.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized Identifiers could then increase security, as they eliminate siloed identity management, and increase privacy, as they give the identity owner the opportunity to selectively disclose specific information about himself. Ultimately, they will turn digital identities into <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identities</a> as they allow each individual to own and control their identity without depending on other parties.<br></p>



 



 What if I need to change something? Revocation in Blockchain Identity Management 



<p>Next to checking the attesting party, verification of a credential also includes checking the validity of the attestation itself. The validity of the attestation, meaning the accuracy and&nbsp;can be validated through a so called revocation registry. </p>



<p>The registry contains the status of each credential, whether it has been revoked (deleted or updated) and hence whether this specific credential is still valid. </p>



<p>In other words, the ledger enables everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are still valid and who attested to the validity of the data inside the credential, without revealing the actual data. </p>



 



<p>The scenario<br></p>



<p>&gt;“This is my drivers licence”</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; “Says who?”</p>



<p>&gt;“Says them”</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; “Who are they and do I know I can trust them?”</p>



<p>+</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; “Do they still agree/attest to this or have they changed their judgement?”</p>



<p>&gt;“Yes they have not revoked their attestation up to now”</p>



 



<p>Revocation means deleting or updating a credential. The possibility for an issuer to revoke a credential is crucial to an identity infrastructure for the main reason that identities are dynamic. </p>



<p>Attributes can change over time e.g. house address or number of children, and some credentials should have a expiry date for example a passport or drivers licence. The fact is, however, that in order to ensure trustworthiness of the system and eliminate the possibility to defraud, credentials are immutable.</p>



<p>After issuing, no one (not even the issuer) can change the information inside the credential. Hence, when attributes change, a new credential needs to be issued and the old one needs to be announced invalid. Thus, at each proof the users needs to proof that the credentials used in the proof are still valid. The revocation registry allows him to prove this without contacting the issuing party.</p>



<p>For example, the Government issues a credential to you, that you have 3 children. A month later your family is blessed with a 4th child. Now, the Government will mark the previous credential as invalid (stating that you have 3 children) and will issue a new credential stating that you have 4 children. </p>



<p>The revocation registry is a complex mathematical concept.&nbsp;One&nbsp;that&nbsp;we&nbsp;dive&nbsp;deeply&nbsp;on&nbsp;this&nbsp;blog, written by Katja Bouman,&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href="https://tykn.tech/identity-revocation-blockchain/">how&nbsp;the&nbsp;revocation&nbsp;registry&nbsp;works</a>. <br></p>



 



  



 



 How to prevent identity fraud and identity theft if I’m doing Identity Management with Blockchain 



<p>Through identity management with blockchain technology, each user stores their digital identity credentials on a digital identity wallet – like Tykn’s <a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/">SSI Mobile Wallet</a> – on his devices (like his mobile phone). Which begs the question: what if his phone is lost or stolen?<br></p>



<p><a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-if-someone-steals-my-phone-110319.pdf">According to Sovrin</a>, there are two steps to be taken.<br></p>



<p>The first one is to revoke the device’s authorization to use credentials. Digital Identity credentials are only valid if used from a device that was authorized to do so. If a user’s phone is lost or stolen, that user could use another authorized device, like his laptop, to write on the blockchain that his mobile phone’s authorization is now revoked.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This would take immediate effect and stop anyone from using the digital identity credentials on the phone. The thief would not be able to impersonate the user even if he has her passwords, biometrics or phone because the blockchain, immutable and secure, would contain a revocation registry for the phone.<br></p>



<p>Revocation of the device’s authorization impedes the thief to impersonate the user to create new relationships. The second step impedes the thief to explore the existing relationships between the device and other people or organisations. The second step thus is to revoke the existing relationship keys (pairwise connections where each of them has a unique key).<br></p>



<p>These two steps stop an identity thief to use digital identity credentials to access new services or explore relationships with existing ones. While conveniently letting the user still use his credentials on another device.<br></p>



<p>In many current cases, if users wished to cancel a stolen identity card, they would have to physically go to the municipality or governmental department, cancel that card and make a new one from scratch. Which would take time and still would not impede an identity thief from using your data. In the case of a stolen credit card, users will call the bank (which still takes considerable time) and won’t be able to use the card until a new one is issued and sent to him.<br></p>

<p>Launch Partners Include Polkadex, Fractal, Subsocial Network, GameDAO, DeBio Network and Galaniprojects</p><p>19 May 2021, Berlin — KILT Protocol today announced SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service for regaining control over your digital identity. SocialKYC will allow users to manage, store and present their personal credentials, enabling them to select which elements of their private information are accessed by online services.</p><p>KILT is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driving licence, certificates) into the digital world, representing your identity while keeping your data private and in your possession. The KILT mainnet will launch later this year in the Polkadot ecosystem as a parachain on the Kusama network; SocialKYC will launch shortly after KILT&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Developed by KILT in collaboration with Galaniprojects, SocialKYC will be implemented by Polkadex, a decentralised cryptocurrency exchange; Fractal, a KYC and decentralised identity provider; Subsocial Network, an open protocol for decentralised social networks; GameDAO, a decentralised autonomous cooperative for video game creators and investors; and DeBio Network, an anonymous-first platform for medical and bioinformatics data.</p> How it&nbsp;Works <p>In the current Web 2.0 world, users provide personal credentials like email addresses and phone numbers to free internet services in return for access. These credentials are frequently shared between service partners and subsidiaries, and applications often bypass the users to go through these services and authenticate user credentials.</p><p>KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank or exchange, proving that you own your government-issued credentials like a passport. “SocialKYC” verifies a user’s internet identity by proving control of their social accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, Discord, Github, etc.), email address or phone number. Unlike Web 2.0 sign-in processes, SocialKYC forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. Personal data is not stored, siloed or&nbsp;shared.</p><p>To verify that the user controls their social account, SocialKYC sends a challenge such as posting a sentence on Twitter, clicking an email link, or confirming a code sent via SMS. SocialKYC then sends Verifiable Credentials to the user that remain in their sole possession and in their control. Users can present these credentials across many services — gaming, genetics labs, exchanges, media companies — when and how they&nbsp;prefer.</p><p>“In the real world you have control of your credentials. You have credentials in your wallet at all times; you decide who to share them with, and for what purpose, and when. Ironically we’ve lost this control in the digital world,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol. “SocialKYC is designed to liberate consumers, putting their digital identity back in their&nbsp;hands.”</p> Partners <p>Earlier this year, KILT partnered with Fractal and Polkadex to create a decentralised KYC system for users of the exchange. Polkadex and Fractal are implementing KILT Protocol as the underlying infrastructure for managing the KYC credentials required by Polkadex to streamline the onboarding experience.</p><p>“SocialKYC removes the need to trust the Polkadex platform for our users, as they can get verified in a truly decentralised manner. In this way, we can keep the KYC process on a non-custodial exchange simple and our users are free to choose and control what private data they want to share. It is a real step forward for the DeFi industry,” said Gautham J, CEO of Polkadex.</p><p>“SocialKYC is a forerunner in the digital identity and verification space. Together with KILT, Fractal Protocol can unlock great value in the ad market by providing a fair, open-source alternative to data duopolies ensuring a high-quality version of the free internet,” said Julian Leitloff, co-founder and CEO of&nbsp;Fractal.</p><p>Subsocial Network is a decentralised platform that offers new ways for social media users to monetize their interactions, without sacrificing their data or privacy. “Content creators on Subsocial will be able to mint their own tokens, tip posts and set up rewards. SocialKYC will help us verify these transactions across our marketplaces,” said Alex Siman, founder of Subsocial Network.</p><p>Gaming is another top use case for SocialKYC and KILT verifiable credentials, which could be used&nbsp;for:</p>  Developing registries for pairing players and tracking&nbsp;awards  Issuing educational credits and age verification for youth&nbsp;gaming  Providing KYC for rewards and payment&nbsp;systems  Tracking performance across multiple game platforms and networks.  <p>“Our cooperative of videogame creators, blockchain architects and business designers is focused on designing sustainable videogame economies,” said Marco Bahn, founder of GameDAO and ZERO Network. “Community funding instruments, secure transactions and identity verification are crucial to fostering gaming as a profession. SocialKYC aligns with our vision of improving videogame economics for the player, creator and funder by increasing engagement and participation.”</p><p>DeBio Network is working with KILT to build a mechanism for issuing revocable, verifiable credentials that ensure privacy and data security. “The decentralised nature of this SocialKYC solution, along with the guarantee of user sovereignty, supports the Decentralized Bio philosophy perfectly. It may also provide a way for us to onboard DIY labs and individual hobbyists interested in working with our data,” said Pandu Sastrowardoyo, initiator of DeBio&nbsp;Network.</p><p>“Our company became the first KILT integrator in 2019,” said Anastasia Galani, founder and CEO of Galaniprojects. “We are thrilled to be part of this initiative and develop new applications for the KILT ecosystem, so users will own their&nbsp;data.”</p> About Polkadex <p><a href="https://www.polkadex.trade/">Polkadex</a> is a fully decentralised, peer-to-peer, orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the Defi ecosystem built on Substrate, the same framework that powers Polkadot. It enables high-speed trading, high liquidity, and lightning-fast transaction speed for supporting Defi applications and services.</p><p>Press contact: Kseniia Baziian — kseniia@polkadex.trade</p> About Fractal <p>Built on Polkadot, <a href="https://protocol.fractal.id/">Fractal Protocol</a> is an open-source, zero-margin protocol that defines a basic standard to exchange user information in a fair and open way, ensuring a high-quality version of the free internet.

<p>TrustedNFT.IO will empower artists, creators, and collectors with a unique solution to the authentication of physical&nbsp;artworks</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is collaborating with <a href="http://wisekey.com">WISeKey</a> to launch <a href="http://trustednft.io">TrustedNFT.io</a>, a decentralized marketplace for physical paintings, sculptures, luxury watches, and other objects of value. The trusted NFT marketplace will include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent the physical work, combined with fungible tokens for more fluid price discovery and for staking on physical&nbsp;works.</p><p>By deploying Ocean’s data marketplace technology to the domain of physical art, WISeKey’s NFT marketplace will combine the strengths of both parties. WISeKey has developed specialized chips to link physical items with NFTs, and world-class blockchain identity technology. Ocean has developed powerful decentralized marketplace technology, with a track record in the domain of data&nbsp;assets.</p><blockquote>We’re thrilled to help WISeKey launch its marketplace for physical authenticated works of art. Before Ocean, our team built <a href="http://ascribe.">ascribe.io</a>, the world’s first blockchain-secured art platform. <a href="http://trustednft.io">TrustedNFT.io</a> will be one of the first use cases of our upcoming Ocean v4 release. The starting point is Ocean v3 ERC20 Fungible Tokens with AMMs to publish, stake and swap intellectual property licenses against base IP. V4 extends this to represent base IP as ERC721 Non-Fungible Tokens, enabling tokenization of real-world objects.</blockquote><blockquote>– Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><p>Purchasing an exclusive piece of art is an important milestone in a collector’s life, but this purchase comes with concerns that the work may be stolen, that the art itself may not be an original, or that its provenance might not be verifiable. While most high-end art collectors find it difficult to stop such acts, WISeKey’s WISeART technology takes steps to protect exclusive pieces of artwork. It combines authentication microprocessors with identity blockchain technology, which, together with on-the-ground measures, <a href="https://youtu.be/oNvhMvdchGk">can ensure the authenticity of the&nbsp;artwork</a>.</p><p>Moreover, if the art is stolen, it can be traced, making it difficult to be traded on the secondary market. This control is made possible because each artwork’s identity is stored on a blockchain in the implemented system.</p><blockquote>Like paintings or sculptures, NFTs need to be properly maintained. After all, an NFT is a record of provenance, not the artwork itself, so it’s essential that the records are up to date and always available. TrustedNFT.IO deploys a number of mechanism to provide this — for example, we use our WISeKey Swiss Mountain Vault as a backup, connected to a multitude of hosts to ensure that NFTs remain&nbsp;online.</blockquote><blockquote>– Carlos Creus Moreira, CEO and Founder of&nbsp;WISeKey.</blockquote><p>To learn more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5QyBj_91u4">watch the recent WISeKey webinar on TrustedNFT.io</a>, featuring speakers from Ocean Protocol and&nbsp;WISeKey.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/oceanprotocol">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a></p> About WISeKey <p>WISeKey is a leading global cybersecurity company currently deploying large scale digital identity ecosystems for people and objects using Blockchain, AI and IoT respecting the Human as the Fulcrum of the Internet.

<p>Near Field Communication technology permeates our day to day life. Every time, you pay contactless at the cashier of your local supermarket and unlock the door to your hotel room or office you are successfully applying NFC technology, in the form of credit card or smartphone, smart keycards or tokens. All those transactions are marked by a need for security, after all thieves and burglars are always ready to take a chance.</p>
<p>But NFC has done the trick of bringing a new level of convenience into our day to day lives, where security concerns are high. Even Airport Border Controls in many countries like the UK nowadays rely on NFC to check passports and biometry without travelers ever talking to a state officer – everything happens fully automated.</p>
<p>IDnow is committed to this advancement in convenience for users. That is why we are bringing a new feature into our automated Identity Verification product <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow AutoIdent</a>. With the help of the new NFC reading capability – available starting from May 20 – we empower you to not only scan your end-customers documents via camera, but actually read out the chip that most modern passports, residence permits, and IDs contain during client onboarding.</p>
<p>Fast lane onboarding for rewarding real customers, final stop for identity thieves</p>
<p>Worldwide, identity documents are issued that contain a chip where the personal information and often even biometric information like a photo is encoded on. With IDnow AutoIdent we now support the read out of such chips by turning the user’s smartphone into a card reader. The ID just needs to be pressed against the phone to retrieve the necessary data, providing massive benefits to you and your end users:</p>
 
 Tamper proof: Chips are extremely hard to manipulate or clone due to its security features and protocols, protecting you reliably from fraudsters. Advanced authentication checks can be added to detect forgery and manipulation. 
 Fast-lane onboarding for your customers: The data read out relies on the touch and go principle, as you might know it from contactless payment. Your customers are rewarded with a speedy process that is a conversion booster, letting them enjoy your service faster. 
 High data accuracy and quality: Typos and wrong entries by your users are a thing of the past, as data transmission is highly accurate, improving your overall data quality, while protecting the user’s privacy during transmission. 
 No chance for identity thieves: Many IDs do not only contain personal data, but also biometric information like a photo. This photo can be compared to the person running through the process with the help of AutoIdent’s selfie or video liveness module to sort out identity thieves. 
 
<p>Relying on an international standard to support your global business</p>
<p>To support your global business and heterogenous customer base, we are relying on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/icao-9303/">ICAO 9303 standard</a>, when it comes to supported documents.</p>
 
 Adapted by 188 countries 
 More than 1 bn people own a supported document 
 IDs, passports and residence permits

<p>This blog provides a behind-the-scenes look at work we have been doing for the Office of the Chief Designer in Scotland.</p><p>In Scotland, millions of people — with all of the wonderful diversity of needs and abilities those numbers imply — use various digital and traditional public services on a day-to-day basis. Spending on public services in the UK represents about one third of gross domestic product and providing services to the public amounts to around 80% of government expenditure. For the wellbeing of citizens, as well as the returns on their taxes they deserve, it’s important that the people responsible for designing and building these services deliver good services.</p><p>We have spent the past few months immersed in the world of designing public services in Scottish Government. We spent hours in conversation around their approach to designing public services, during which it became clear they share our total commitment to putting people in the&nbsp;centre.</p><p>Public design teams — like teams in any sector — need to understand what they’re designing from the citizen’s perspective. As with the Scottish approach to government more generally, the Office of the Chief Designer emphasises the need to design ‘with, not for’. And yet, it’s actually quite difficult to engage citizens in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In October last year, CivTech published a <a href="https://www.civtechalliance.org/civtech-sprint-engaging-citizens-in-designing-digital-public-services">‘sprint’ challenge</a>:</p><p>‘How can technology be used to engage citizens in designing Digital Public Services?’</p><p>CivTech is a programme of Scottish Government that connects public sector organisations with technology companies like Mydex CIC to co-create the solutions to specific challenges they’re&nbsp;facing.</p><p>This challenge was sponsored by a team from the Office of the Chief Designer and Connecting Scotland. The Office of the Chief Designer are responsible for bringing design thinking into how Scottish Government <a href="https://medium.com/the-service-gazette/the-scottish-approach-to-service-design-2a8a74725b5a">‘does government’</a>, whilst <a href="https://connecting.scot">Connecting Scotland</a> have been getting digitally excluded people online during the pandemic by providing them with devices and broadband connections. The sponsors wanted a product that would facilitate meaningful engagement with Scotland’s citizens to make sure co-design is the default approach to designing public services, so public sector organisations can build better services with, not for Scotland’s citizens.</p><p>After reading the challenge, we thought of our Inclued platform:</p>  It’s built to create a two-way, direct line of communication between organisations and citizens, so the values designed into it are already about putting citizens and organisations on a collaborative footing. It is focussed on the Scottish public and third sectors now, but it can be used by any organisation anywhere.  Inclued’s fundamental purpose is to improve access to services — influencing the design of services is another way of taking this goal even&nbsp;further.  We originally built the Inclued platform during the CivTech 3.0 programme, where we were lucky to work with some great people at Glasgow City Council as our challenge sponsors. Through this, we already knew that CivTech was an effective approach and how valuable it is to our&nbsp;mission.  The home page of the platform, including the work-in-progress extension (Digital Public Service&nbsp;Design).<p>This citizen design challenge was a ‘sprint’ challenge so it was more compressed timewise than CivTech’s usual programme, which ran alongside it. For all the reasons listed above, along with this time pressure, using the Inclued platform as a foundation and extending it made&nbsp;sense.</p><p>So, we submitted an application, got invited to the interview stage and made it through to the ‘exploration stage’ with another group. We spent an intense two weeks over November meeting various people in Scottish Government service design, mapping out where the barriers to engaging citizens were and thinking about what extensions to Inclued could potentially overcome them. This then led to us submitting an updated proposal with everything we had learnt. We were delighted when the challenge sponsors came back saying they would like to work with us to build a minimum viable product (MVP) over a ‘development stage’ between January and March of&nbsp;2021.</p>How we presented the values we wanted to design into the platform after the exploration stage<p>From January to March, we gained a huge amount of insight and lots of encouragement from a wonderful, diverse group of stakeholders, with whom we discovered the friction, effort, risk and cost involved in the current approach. Their experience closely matched our own, developed over the last 14 years working in public services. The process really validated our thinking and approach behind the Inclued platform, as well as our general approach of improving services by putting citizens in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Our challenge sponsor team was incredible at linking us to the right people. We spoke and ran virtual workshops with Scottish Government service designers, people working on the Connecting Scotland programme, accessibility experts, user researchers, the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations, digital ethicists, and citizens. We saw real alignment with and commitment to our own values of citizen-centred public services across the board, and used their knowledge and experiences to translate our post-exploration proposal into an MVP, built by our development team and staged online for everyone who helped design it to give feedback&nbsp;on.</p><p>The MVP focussed on showing the basic flow of the extension on both sides of the Inclued platform. For citizens, we showed how they&nbsp;could:</p>  go through a one-time set-up of their profiles and preferences in their personal data&nbsp;store,  review projects they have been invited to and request participation in projects that they would like to take part&nbsp;in.  The landing page for citizens who either receive invitations to join the platform or join through other activity on&nbsp;Inclued.<p>For subscribers, we showed how they&nbsp;can:</p>  create projects,  invite citizens to participate,  Streamline and make consistent a lot of routine administration, such as making sure data ethics has been comprehensively considered,  recruit citizens based on any criteria needed without anyone needing to reveal these often protected characteristics,  gain an overview of all design projects, including various metrics like participant’s feedback,  view a showcase of present and past projects in the same organisation, so they can better maintain and share best practice and past learning.  A customisable checklist used to make administration most streamlined and consistent.<p>The main benefits identified during the development stage were that the extension would reduce cost and administration in public service design, improve design teams’ adoption and alignment with the Scottish Approach to Service Design, provide access to a broader range of citizens in a safe, privacy-protecting way, and lead to subscribers consistently building a better evidence basis for designing public services.</p>A project showcase that enables large organisations to track projects, gather evidence and share knowledge more&nbsp;easily.<p>We hope to develop the MVP extensions into a full product, which we think has massive potential to transform live co-design projects in the public sector and indeed any organisation with a service design function.</p><p>For example: this sprint finished just as Scottish Government’s most recent digital strategy was published: ‘<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/a-changing-nation-how-scotland-will-thrive-in-a-digital-world/">A changing nation: how Scotland will thrive in a digital world.</a>’ In the strategy, Scottish Government outlines its aims to ‘use common operating platforms for the processes that are common across Government’ and for services ‘to be inclusive and designed around citizens’ needs, rather than the organisational structures or traditions of the organisations that provide them.’ It’s great news that co-design is an increasingly common process across government and Inclued, with this extension, is a good example of a platform that could underpin that, making co-design so straightforward it becomes the default choice for making public services work for everyone.</p><p>Our vision for Inclued is for it to become the de facto choice for two-way, secure citizen engagement that empowers citizens to not only access services but influence what is delivered to them, while giving governments and citizens insight and evidence into the value and impact of working with, not for citizens.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-citizens-and-government-for-better-designed-services-9b58205185ce">Connecting Citizens and Government for Better Designed Services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Integration testing in modern Spring Boot microservices has become easier since the release of Spring Framework 5 and Spring Security 5. Spring Framework’s <code>WebTestClient</code> for reactive web, and <code>MockMvc</code> for servlet web, allow for testing controllers in a lightweight fashion without running a server. Both frameworks leverage Spring Test mock implementations of requests and responses, allowing you to verify most of the application functionality using targeted tests.</p>

<p>With Spring Security 5, security test support provides new request mutators that avoid simulating a grant flow or building an access token when verifying method security in web testing.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will explore security mocking with <code>SecurityMockServerConfigurers</code> and <code>SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors</code>, as well as authorization tests for the following patterns:</p>

 
   Reactive WebFlux gateway with OIDC authentication 
   Servlet MVC REST API with JWT authorization 
   Reactive WebFlux REST API with OpaqueToken authorization 
 

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a> 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html">Java 11+</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>

   <a>Test a WebFlux Gateway with <code>mockOidcLogin()</code></a> 
   <a>Test an MVC Resource Server with <code>jwt()</code> Mocking and Testcontainers</a> 
   <a>Test a WebFlux Resource Server with <code>mockOpaqueToken()</code></a> 
   <a>On Mocking Features in Spring Security Test</a> 
   <a>Verify Authorization and Audience Validation</a> 
   <a>Learn More About Spring Security and OAuth</a> 
 

 Test a WebFlux Gateway with <code>mockOidcLogin()</code> 

<p>Let’s start by building and testing a Webflux API Gateway with Okta OIDC login enabled. With HTTPie and Spring Initializr, create and download a Spring Boot Maven project:</p>

   <code>http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip type==maven-project \
  language==java \
  bootVersion==2.4.5 \
  baseDir==api-gateway \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==api-gateway \
  name==api-gateway \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.gateway \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==cloud-eureka,cloud-gateway,webflux,okta,lombok

unzip api-gateway.zip

cd api-gateway
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, and reformat to YAML syntax (making sure to remove any <code>\</code> escape characters in your Okta issuer):</p>

   <code>spring:
  application:
    name: gateway
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    scopes: openid, profile, email

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: ${SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE}
</code>   

<p>Add the Spring Security Test dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;5.4.5&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.gateway.controller</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Then create a <code>UserData</code> class and <code>UserDataController</code> to expose the OIDC ID token and access token, to use in later tests.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class UserData {

    private String userName;
    private String idToken;
    private String accessToken;
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.annotation.RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;

@Controller
public class UserDataController {

    @RequestMapping("/userdata")
    @ResponseBody
    public UserData greeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser,
                             @RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("okta") OAuth2AuthorizedClient client) {

        UserData userData = new UserData();
        userData.setUserName(oidcUser.getFullName());
        userData.setIdToken(oidcUser.getIdToken().getTokenValue());
        userData.setAccessToken(client.getAccessToken().getTokenValue());
        return userData;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.gateway.security</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add <code>SecurityConfiguration</code>, enabling OIDC Login and JWT authentication:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.security;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.reactive.EnableWebFluxSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;

@Configuration
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        http.csrf().disable()
                .authorizeExchange()
                .anyExchange()
                .authenticated()
                .and().oauth2Login()
                .and().oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        return http.build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>NOTE: For this tutorial, CSRF security is disabled.</p>

<p>Before adding the tests, disable the Eureka Client to avoid exceptions that will arise because no Eureka Server is available. Create the file <code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
</code>   
<p>Update the class <code>ApiGatewayApplicationTests</code> to activate the <code>test</code> profile:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class ApiGatewayApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>com.okta.developer.gateway.controller</code> package under <code>src/test/java</code>. Add the first security tests with <code>WebTestClient</code> and <code>mockOidcLogin()</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient

                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().is3xxRedirection();
    }

</code>   

<p>By default, <code>@SpringBootTest</code> loads the web <code>ApplicationContext</code> and provides a mock web environment.</p>

<p>With <code>@AutoConfigureWebTestClient</code>, Spring Boot initializes a <code>WebTestClient</code> that can be injected into the test classes. The alternative for mock web testing is<code>@WebFluxTest</code>, which also configures a <code>WebTestClient</code>, but the test is limited to a single controller, and collaborators need to be mocked.</p>

<p>The test <code>get_noAuth_returnsRedirectLogin</code> verifies that the server will redirect to the OIDC Login flow if no authentication is present.</p>

<p>The test <code>get_withOidcLogin_returnsOk</code> configures the mock request with an <code>OidcUser</code>, using <code>mockOidcLogin()</code>. The mock <code>OidcUser.idToken</code> is modified by adding the <code>name</code> claim because <code>UserDataController</code> expects it for populating the response.<code>mockOidcLogin()</code> belongs to a set of <code>SecurityMockServerConfigurers</code> that ship with Spring Security Test 5 as part of the reactive test support features.</p>

<p>Run the tests with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test
</code>   

 Test an MVC Resource Server with <code>jwt()</code> Mocking and Testcontainers 

<p>Now, let’s create a JWT microservice for lodge listings using Spring Data REST. On application load, a sample dataset will be seeded to the embedded MongoDB instance initialized by Flapdoodle. JWT access tokens are decoded, verified, and validated locally by Spring Security in the microservice.</p>

<p>Again, add the <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency and Testcontainers’ <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/mongodb/">MongoDB Module</a> to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;

<p>Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your Okta domain.</p>

<p>Create the <code>com.okta.developer.listings.model</code> package under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add a model class <code>AirbnbListing</code>:</p>

<p>The annotation <code>@RepositoryRestResource</code> directs Spring MVC to create RESTful endpoints at the specified path. The <code>save()</code> operation is overridden to configure authorization, requiring the authority <code>listing_admin</code>.</p>

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.listings.config</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add a <code>RestConfiguration</code> class for tweaking the Spring Data Rest responses:</p>

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_noAuth_returnsUnauthorized</code> verifies that if no JWT token is present in the request, the service will return 404 Unauthorized.</p>

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_withValidJwtToken_returnsOk</code> verifies that with valid JWT authentication, the <code>/listing</code> GET returns 200 Ok.</p>

<p>The test <code>save_withMissingAuhtorities_returnsForbidden</code> verifies that if the JWT lacks the <code>listing_admin</code> authority, the save operation is denied with 403 Forbidden.</p>

<p>The test <code>save_withValidJwtToken_returnsCreated</code> mocks a JWT with the required authority, verifies the save operation succeeds, and returns 201 Created.</p>

<p>Try the tests with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test

<p>NOTE: If you see MongoSocketReadException: Prematurely reached end of stream in the test logs, you can ignore that for now. It might be because the MongoDB Testcontainer shuts down before the context.</p>

<p>Add the Nimbus <code>oauth2-oidc-sdk</code> dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>, required for token introspection, and add the  <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.nimbusds&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;oauth2-oidc-sdk&lt;/artifactId&gt;

<p>Token introspection involves a call to the authorization server, so create a client app with Okta CLI, as illustrated for the <code>api-gateway</code>.</p>

   <code>cd theaters
</code>   

<p>Run  <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and set the following content:</p>

   <code>server:

<p>The POST <code>/theater</code> endpoint requires <code>theater_admin</code> authority to proceed with the persistence.</p>

<p>Create package <code>com.okta.developer.theaters.security</code>. Add a custom <code>JwtOpaqueTokenIntrospector</code> to parse authorities from the <code>groups</code> claim in the access token.</p>

</code>   

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_noAuth_returnsUnauthorized</code> verifies that access is denied if there is no token in the request.</p>

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_withValidOpaqueToken_returnsOk</code> sets a mock opaque token in the request, so the controller must return 200 OK.</p>

<p>The test <code>post_withMissingAuthorities_returnsFodbidden</code> verifies that without the required authorities, the controller rejects the request with 403 Forbidden.</p>

<p>The test <code>post_withValidOpaqueToken_returnsCreated</code> verifies that if <code>theater_admin</code> authority is present in the token, the create request will pass, returning the new <code>theater</code> in the response body.</p>

<p>Again, try the tests with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test
</code>   

 On Mocking Features in Spring Security Test 

<p>Spring Security Test documentation indicates that when testing with <code>WebTestClient</code> and <code>mockOpaqueToken()</code> (or any other configurer), the request will pass correctly through any authentication API, and the mock authentication object will be available for the authorization mechanism to verify. The same applies for <code>MockMvc</code>. That is likely why an invalid audience, expiration, or issuer in the token attributes is ignored in this kind of test.
For example, the following <code>AirbnbListingMvcTest</code> test will pass:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void collectionGet_withInvalidJWtToken_returnsOk() throws Exception {
    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/listing").with(jwt()
    .jwt(jwt -&gt; jwt.claim("exp", Instant.MIN)
            .claim("iss", "invalid")
            .claim("aud", "invalid")))).andExpect(status().isOk());
}
</code>   

<p>In the same way, if the <code>WebTestClient</code> or <code>MockMvc</code> mocks a different type of authentication than expected, the test might pass as long as the controller injects a compatible authentication type. The test will pass depending on which method the test is expecting to be in the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>. For example, the <code>listings</code> service expects JWT authentication, but the following <code>AirbnbListingMvcTest</code> test will pass:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void collectionGet_withOpaqueToken_returnsOk() throws Exception {
    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/listing").with(opaqueToken())).andExpect(status().isOk());
}
</code>   

 Verify Authorization and Audience Validation 

<p>Let’s run an end-to-end test using HTTPie to verify both the authorization and that the audience is enforced in both services.</p>

<p>First, create a Eureka server:</p>

   <code>http --download https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  type==maven-project \
  language==java \
  bootVersion==2.4.5 \
  baseDir==eureka \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==eureka \
  name==eureka \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.eureka \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==cloud-eureka-server

unzip eureka.zip
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>EurekaServiceApplication</code> to add <code>@EnableEurekaServer</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.eureka;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaApplication.class, args);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following content:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/
</code>   

<p>Configure <code>theater</code> and <code>listing</code> routes in the <code>api-gateway</code> project. Edit <code>ApiGatewayApplication</code> to add the <code>RouteLocator</code> bean:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteLocator;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.builder.RouteLocatorBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ApiGatewayApplication {

    @Autowired
    private TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory filterFactory;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ApiGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public RouteLocator routeLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
        return builder.routes()
            .route("listing", r -&gt; r.path("/listing/**")
                .filters(f -&gt; f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                .uri("lb://listing"))
            .route("theater", r -&gt; r.path("/theater/**")
                .filters(f -&gt; f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                .uri("lb://theater"))
            .build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>docker</code> folder at the root level (same level as the api-gateway, theaters, and listings), where all services are contained. Add a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file with the following content:</p>

   <code>version: "3.1"

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:bionic
    hostname: mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_INIT_DATABASE=airbnb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - ./initdb.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initdb.sh
      - /{mongoDataPath}:/db-dump
  api-gateway:
    image: api-gateway:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

    image: listings:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
      - eureka
    environment:
      - SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE=http://eureka:8761/eureka

    environment:
      - EUREKA_INSTANCE_HOSTNAME=eureka
  theaters:
    image: theaters:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ports:

      - eureka
    environment:
      - SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE=http://eureka:8761/eureka
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=mongo
</code>   

<p>Get the MongoDB dump files <code>theaters.bson</code>, <code>theaters.metadata.json</code> from <a href="https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/tree/master/dump/sample_mflix">GitHub</a>.</p>

   <code>http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_mflix/theaters.bson?raw=true
http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_mflix/theaters.metadata.json?raw=true
</code>   

<p>Also get <code>listingsAndReviews.bson</code> and <code>listingsAndreviews.metadata.json</code> from <a href="https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/tree/master/dump/sample_airbnb">GitHub</a>.</p>

   <code>http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_airbnb/listingsAndReviews.bson?raw=true
http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_airbnb/listingsAndReviews.metadata.json?raw=true
</code>   

<p>Place the files in some location and update <code>{mongoDataPath}</code> to use it in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>Create a file <code>docker/initdb.sh</code> with the following script:</p>

   <code>mongorestore -d airbnb /db-dump
</code>   

<p>Build each service image with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
</code>   

<p>Run the services with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>, and you should see the Eureka home. (Wait for all services to register.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/userdata</code> after the Okta login, and you should see an output similar to this:</p>

   <code>{
   "userName":"...",
   "idToken":"...",
   "accessToken":"..."
}
</code>   

<p>Test the <code>api-gateway</code> endpoints <code>http://localhost:8080/theater</code> and <code>http://localhost:8080/listing</code> with your browser.</p>

<p>Now, let’s test authorization with a POST to the <code>/listing</code> endpoint. Copy the <code>accessToken</code> value from the <code>/userdata</code> output and set it as an environment variable:</p>

   <code>ACCESS_TOKEN={accessToken}

http POST http://localhost:8080/listing name=test "Authorization:Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
</code>   

<p>You will see the following response:</p>
   <code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", 
 error_description="The request requires higher privileges than provided by the access token.", 
 error_uri="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1"
</code>   

<p>This is because the <code>listings</code> service expects <code>listing_admin</code> authority to accept the POST request. The Okta Spring Boot Starter will automatically assign the content of the <code>groups</code> claim as authorities. Login to the Okta Admin Console (running <code>okta login</code> will get you the URL), create a <code>listing_admin</code> group (Directory &gt; Groups), and assign your user to it.</p>

<p>Then, add the <code>groups</code> claim to the access token. Go to Security &gt; API. Select the <code>default</code> authorization server. Go to Claims, and add a claim. Set the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>groups</code> 
   Include in token type: <code>Access Token</code> 
   Value type: <code>Groups</code> 
   Filter: Matches regex (set filter value to <code>.*</code>) 
 

<p>Open an incognito window, and request the <code>/userdata</code> endpoint, to repeat the sign-in and obtain a new access token with the <code>groups</code> claim. Repeat the HTTPie POST request, and now your access token should be accepted!</p>

<p>If it doesn’t work, you can use <a href="https://token.dev">token.dev</a> to view the contents of your access token.</p>

<p>Stop the services with CTRL-C and change the expected audience in the <code>listings</code> project’s <code>application.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    audience: api://custom
</code>   

<p>Rebuild the <code>listings</code> service image.</p>

   <code>cd listings
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
</code>   

<p>Restart the services and repeat the HTTPie POST request:</p>

   <code>http POST http://localhost:8080/listing name=test "Authorization:Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
</code>   

<p>You will see the following response:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token", 
 error_description="An error occurred while attempting to decode the Jwt: This aud claim is not equal to the configured audience",
 error_uri="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1"
</code>   

<p>You can verify the same in the <code>theaters</code> service.</p>

 Learn More About Spring Security and OAuth 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and understand more about <code>SecurityMockServerConfigurers</code> in reactive test support and <code>SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors</code> in the MockMvc test support (available since Spring Security 5). You can see how useful these can be for integration testing, as well as the limitations of request and response mocking.</p>

The model reacts to supply and demand, so “when the network exceeds the target per-block gas usage, the base fee increases slightly and when capacity is below the target, it decreases slightly”. Therefore, as demand grows, more ETH is burned than is created via new block rewards, resulting in a net deflation.</blockquote><p>On everything else:</p><blockquote>Ethereum’s large and passionate developer community has consistently shipped bleeding-edge product innovations on the network, helping it secure its status as the primary settlement layer for decentralized finance.

To get a real pair, redeem a $SOCKS&nbsp;token.</blockquote><blockquote>“SOCKS will be burned in exchange for 1 real pair of unisocks + shipping to anywhere in the world,” said Uniswap Labs when it announced the socks in 2019, so, yes, you could burn tokens for socks.[5]</blockquote><blockquote>As of 10 a.m. today, the SOCKS token was trading at about $99,000.

It’s all being done in the hopes of PayPal becoming the world’s next “super app,” akin to China’s Alipay or WeChat, India’s Paytm or Singapore’s Grab.</blockquote><blockquote>The stakes are high: If PayPal pulls it off, the company could become a bigger part of U.S. consumers’ lives than Amazon, Google or Facebook. But, in the U.S., there is no shortage of banking giants and technology firms that have tried and failed to accomplish what PayPal wants to&nbsp;do.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s difficult to become a super app,” PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said in an interview. “I think we have a chance if we execute extremely well against this. But it’s obviously a place that a lot of companies are thinking about as&nbsp;well.”</blockquote><p>PayPal clearly taking a page out of Greg Kidd’s playbook.</p> 7. What Discord is up&nbsp;to <p>Speaking of playbooks, here’s The Information on what Discord is up&nbsp;to:</p><blockquote>The San Francisco-based startup is using a familiar playbook to court creators. In an invite-only test, they will be able to sell tickets to Discord’s live audio feature called Stage Channels. Twitter recently added similar ticketing sales to its own, Clubhouse-like live conversations product,&nbsp;Spaces.</blockquote><blockquote>Discord’s move marks the first time the actors, writers and musicians who converse with their fans on the service will be able to earn money from them there. Such transactions — say selling access to a private Discord server, or chat group — often take place on the performer’s YouTube or Patreon account. In turn, those companies get a cut of the&nbsp;sales.</blockquote> 8. Everyone hates Big&nbsp;Tech <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-464635a3-739e-4411-ab95-e1e697e27870.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Americans have fallen further out of love with Big Tech, the latest Axios/Harris 100-brand reputation poll&nbsp;shows.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Even though Americans were hyper-connected to their devices throughout the pandemic, their relationship with many of the world’s biggest tech firms has continued on a downward trend, suggesting that people see their products as necessary evils, Axios’ Sara Fischer and Scott Rosenberg report.</blockquote><blockquote>Social media leaders Facebook and Twitter failed to improve their standing near the bottom of the list, despite their role in helping users stay connected through pandemic-era isolation.</blockquote>  The biggest loser among tech giants was Google, which faced PR headwinds in 2020 as the government sued it for monopolistic practices.  Amazon lost its place at the very top of the reputational roster but retained a strong positive&nbsp;rating.  Apple, which spent the last year making record profits and touting its privacy protections, was the only tech giant to substantially improve its reputation score.  <blockquote>Overall, companies that sell products and services to businesses and individuals — like Microsoft, Apple, Sony and HP — fared much better than ad-supported social media and information tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, TikTok and&nbsp;Reddit.</blockquote><p>That last sentence seems pretty key. Is it fair to say that maybe one of the drivers of a bad reputation is a very specific kind of business model involving the harvesting of user&nbsp;data?</p><p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/epics-long-game-against-apple-e955f635-c598-46fc-ba46-dde79bf30d66.html">Epic’s long game against&nbsp;Apple</a>  <p>9.

One of the biggest drivers of&nbsp;fintech. <p><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/big-banks-on-defense-after-fed-sides-with-retailers-on-debit-swipe-fees">American Banker</a>:</p><blockquote>“For nearly a decade, the Federal Reserve avoided choosing sides in the protracted, high-stakes dispute between banks and retailers over debit card fees. But after the Fed last week embraced one of the main arguments made by merchants, many observers believe that more bad news is coming for large and midsize banks. The Fed is required by law to cap the interchange fees that banks with more than $10 billion in assets can collect when consumers use their debit cards at retailers. Since 2011, the limit has been set at 21 cents, plus 0.05% of the transaction. The central bank has long ignored pleas from both sectors to make changes. But now, in light of a decadelong decline in the banks’ processing costs, the Fed faces growing pressure to lower the price ceiling.”</blockquote><p>Also, ICYMI, <a href="https://youtu.be/O80EnZCSPNw">check out Greg Kidd’s chat with Ayo Omojola</a>, GlobaliD adviser and VP of Product at Carbon Health.

<p></p>      SSI PRIMER 
  <p>In this article we will try to breakdown the concepts and terminology behind SSI, as well as the reasoning for its increasing traction particularly in Europe. Traditionally speaking human beings are identified through reference, claims made by ourselves are generally regarded as useless if there is no one to “back them up”, so to speak. As an example a statement by an individual that he is a citizen of country X is meaningless if he does not possess a passport i.e. a claim, issued to him by a trusted third party, in this case a government.</p>
<p>To combat this problem governments and later businesses started issuing attestations about certain claims. Sometimes these claims are directly tied to an individual, in which case the documents stating those claims carry a photograph of the said individual or a serial number, often referred to as a tax or personal number. Other claims simply state that they belong to the holder, in which case whoever possesses the claim is also its owner or can state that the claim refers to them. As the time passed new concepts were introduced, such as a legal person, the idea that an incorporeal construct or agreement can also have an identity. In the following text we will use the term entity to denominate both terms.</p>
                 <p>With the advent of Internet, a need arose to identify entities online and while legal persons can have their information be made public, natural persons wish to maintain their privacy which is also guaranteed by law. The traditional model taken from the physical world was transcribed into the digital and the end result is a fractured landscape in which every entity offering any services online keeps its own database of users, performs identity verification and uses proprietary ways of storing the user data. To combat this, federated identity networks were created to foster data sharing and interoperability but due to strict privacy laws these federated systems very rarely extend across borders.</p>
<p>The situation around online identity is even worse in the private space of the Internet where companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. offer federated online “identities” without actually knowing to whom that identity belongs to. In essence they issue attestations to e-mail addresses and there is no way of knowing who is controlling that e-mail address.</p>
      <blockquote>
<p>“On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” Peter Steiner, The New Yorker, 5. July 1993</p>
</blockquote>
          <p>This finally brings us to self-sovereign identity. This term is often misunderstood as meaning that an entity can self-issue claims about themselves without the need for trusted issuers. This is wrong in the sense that claims still need to be issued by someone whom everyone trusts same as before. What SSI means is that the entity carried its data with him and has control over it. This means controls over both storage and access. For example, traditionally you would walk into institution A to acquire a certain document which institution B needs in order to provide a service to you. This can be simplified in a federated system by having institutions A and B talk directly to each other but this still does not solve the fundamental problem that the entity to whom this data belongs to and about whom it actually is, does not have direct control and is dependent on the services provided by institutions A and B. The relationship is setup in a way that the entity has to ask for permission to use its data.</p>
 A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT 
<p>With SSI this model is flipped around and the entity controls the data and access to it while the institutions A and B would ask the entity to provide tem access to its data. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power between entities and service providers on the Internet. The SSI ecosystem revolves around decentralized identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), both of which are standardized by the W3C. We can think of a DID as a document identifier which is not stored centrally with some institution but rather on a distributed network, most often a blockchain. The control of the DID Document and its associated public key(s) is proved by the possession of a paired private key. Now that we have an identifier we need something for it to identify. This is where the VCs come into play. VCs are claims made about an entity which are stored in a standardized form as JSON-LD documents. Claims can be anything, from an entities name, relation to another entity, or even full documents. UNISOT through its UNISOT ID service offers a full SSI solution with a registered DID schema on the BSV ledger (did:unisot). Our solution follows the Verifiable Credential model as defined by the W3C as well as the DID specification.</p>
                 <p>The image above shows how these concepts come together. We see a traditional issuer issuing a claim (VC) to a citizen (holder) and at the same time storing the signature of the issued VC on a distributed ledger (blockchain). The holder countersigns the VC with his own private key thus creating a strong proof of ownership. Seeing as how the VC is in essence a JSON file it would be easy for someone else to get a hold of the claim not intended for them. By countersigning the claim with the holder’s private key and storing the signature on the blockchain we are creating a strong link between the holder and the VC. The Verifier, which is in essence any third part wishing to verify a claim, asks the holder to present the VC and checks the signature of the VC on the blockchain.</p>
<p>This way the verifier can be sure as to who issued the VC, who it was intended for and that no tampering has been done after the issuance. This model fosters standardization amongst data processors by having them adapt to the data format used by the holders and it can be argued is an effective deterrent against large-scale ransomware attacks. For example, ransomware attacks on healthcare institutions are very tempting due to the time sensitive nature of the data and while SSI would not be able to help with the internal data we can see that it would be very useful for an individual to have his entire medical history in personal possession alongside it being stored with medical practitioners.</p>
          <p>SSI has also been recognized by the EU as an effective way of bridging the gap between identity systems of different member states which often refuse to share data cross border to national laws. By transferring the ownership of the data into the hands of the citizen these limitations are bypassed as the citizen has the right to use the data as he sees fit. This has led to the creation of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) which aims to become a golden standard in SSI space and have the same effect for identity globally as GDPR has had for privacy.</p>
 NEW OPPORTUNITIES 
<p>If we look closely towards the BSV ecosystem and how SSI can provide new opportunities here we can see that one of the problems plaguing the blockchain space in general is the inherent user unfriendliness of blockchain addresses which are represented as meaningless strings of characters such as for example “n1aAmTXAg4o44Z9k8YCQncEY91r3TV7WU4”. In the BSV ecosystem one of the ways to mitigate this issue has been presented by <a href="https://nchain.com/">nChain</a> and <a href="https://www.moneybutton.com/">MoneyButton</a> with their <a href="https://blog.moneybutton.com/2019/05/31/introducing-paymail-an-extensible-identity-protocol-for-bitcoin-bsv/">Paymail</a> identity scheme which links BSV addresses to e-mail like naming format, for example “username@unisot.id”. The address is resolved through DNS SRV records which points to a server containing a list of supported services. While definitely a step in the right direction, Paymail ultimately still validates the “identity” of the e-mail in question and not the individual. While this can be solved by establishing the identity of the owner at the time of issuance it still leads to a serviced solution depending on DNS lookups. The schema also in essence represents a federated system based on domains. By enhancing the Paymail with SSI in the form of issuing a VC for a given Paymail address these issues can be effectively mitigated creating a synergy between the two identity solutions in the BSV ecosystem.</p>

<p>Our hearts go out to the Colonial Pipeline team working the incident response.</p>
      
<p>Using the word “breach” in a title is ubiquitous across most identity companies’ blogs right now. This is the way of any company in our space. Attacks are common enough and it’s often the same tactics: Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). In this model, profit is shared between the owners and partners who do the heavy lifting of providing access to organizations and deploying the ransomware.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>It is evident attacks have become more economical and have greater returns with less investment necessary. This leads to the ever growing number of security companies writing blogs based on current events. This specific attack hit quite a few more people where it really matters here in America. We need and love our cars.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html">FireEye</a> recently published an insightful article specifically on the DarkSide hacker group which we strongly recommend a read. The initial compromise consisted of the following:&nbsp;</p>
      
  Suspected password attacks on perimeter infrastructure  CVE-2021-20016  Malicious emails with links&nbsp;  
      
<p>This illustrates that password compromise, or acquisition was required before the hackers could move to the next step in the attack lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>One thing remains tried and true: at the heart of these attacks, it often involves a credential of a user or privileged user. The techniques deployed include Brute Force, Password Spray, Dictionary Password Attacks, Mimikatz, etc. Businesses and their IT and security teams attempt to mitigate these attacks with methods that have grown tiresome and obsolete:</p>
      
  Create a complex, 16-character password  Rotate your passwords every 60 days  Invest in a password manager&nbsp;  Implement 2FA / MFA  
      
<p>We need to stop treating the symptoms, and treat the root problem in this security oversight. The problem is the Password. There are a multitude of authentication methods your organization can employ, but not all address this problem. We’ve compiled those into an <a href="https://www.hypr.com/authentication-attack-matrix/">Authentication Attack Matrix</a>, spelling out how each type of solution addresses individual threat categories. Let’s face it, even MFA alone cannot solve this core problem if one of the factors is the password.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s mission is based on the foundation that passwords are the highest risk component in any threat model. By removing the shared secret from the enterprise, businesses reduce the economical advantages of these types of attacks.</p>
      
<p>We look forward to 2021 as the year of acceptance. Acceptance that eliminating passwords for users is viable and a growing priority for businesses.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>There is not a single vertical, sector or industry that is not affected by the ultimate threat posed by passwords. We are looking forward to the day which blogs like these are no longer warranted by identity companies.</p>
      
<p>To learn more about how a passwordless security strategy can benefit your business, we have a wealth of information available on our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/">resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			 The Era of Blockchain Interoperability Begins 
<p>A few weeks ago, we announced our partnership with Polygon, making <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX</a> the first protocol for security tokens on a decentralized, secure, fast and cost-efficient infrastructure. Polygon is a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, opening the door to cross-chain interoperability.</p>
<p>The constraints of the Ethereum network slowed the adoption of security tokens for financial institutions. The network was secure and resilient, but it was difficult to use for non-experts because of the gas fee mechanism and the relative slowness of transactions. Now, we are able to assist our clients in issuing securities on a highly efficient and scalable infrastructure.</p>
<p>Securities issuers, asset managers, fund managers and investment banks can now easily choose to issue on this infrastructure:</p>
 
 Cheap&nbsp;– Thanks to PoS, transaction fees usually cost less than 1 cent 
 Fast&nbsp;– Transactions are confirmed by the network in a few seconds 
 Scaleable&nbsp;– The network is capable of &gt;10k tx/s 
 Easy-to-use&nbsp;– Users can still use Metamask and other Ethereum wallets, they just need to switch the network to Polygon. 
 Interoperable&nbsp;– as Polygon is based on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), it means it leverages the security of Ethereum whilst being interoperable with the wider ecosystem 
 
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/5-reasons-why-we-partnered-with-polygon/"></a></p>
<p>Due to these new capabilities, we’re receiving many requests from institutions tokenizing their assets. New types of assets and projects become eligible for tokenization such as micro-loans, loyalty tokens for your employees or your customers, or even cross-border payment systems.</p>

 SingularityDAO’s AI agents will consume trading and DeFi data supplied via Ocean Market to improve their financial modeling capabilities <p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> continues its support of <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> by collaborating with <a href="https://singularitydao.ai/">SingularityDAO</a>, a leading AI blockchain project. SingularityDAO’s AI agents will consume trading and DeFi data supplied via <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, and SingularityDAO’s DynaSets will include OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>SingularityDAO is a non-custodial DeFi solution allowing members to manage dynamic token sets (called DynaSets) consisting of a bundle of utility tokens. These DynaSets are somewhat parallel to ETFs in traditional finance: tokens that have limited liquidity on their own become easier to trade when aggregated into sets. SingularityDAO makes it more beneficial and less risky to hold collections of utility tokens that individually have only modest liquidity, opening the flow of capital to innovative projects.</p><p>Our collaboration will see OCEAN’s inclusion in SingularityDAO’s index fund / investment portfolio. This means the OCEAN token will be included in SingularityDAO’s initial DynaSets, benefiting from the increased liquidity provided by their&nbsp;AI.</p><p>This collaboration will go much further, where SingularityDAO’s AI agents use Ocean data sets to benefit its members. Here’s how. SingularityDAO is designed to leverage AI at multiple levels: AI manages dynamic token-sets, executes predictive market-making strategies to provide liquidity for these token-sets on DEXs, and predictively models hedging strategies.</p><p>All this AI requires a lot of data to learn and improve, which is why SingularityDAO is a natural user of Ocean data sets — data sets published via <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> (and other Ocean-based markets) into the Ocean ecosystem. The Ocean ecosystem is host to many diverse and varied trading and DeFi data sets. These make excellent candidates for consumption by SingularityDAO’s AI agents to enhance its financial modeling.</p><blockquote>Ocean Market and SingularityNET’s data-hungry AI agents make for a natural fit. Anyone can publish &amp; trade data sets as well as algorithms for AI on Ocean Market — all of which can be utilized to enhance SingularityDAO’s AI efficacy. This collaboration will also scale the demand side on Ocean Market. As both our ecosystems grow, we look forward to ever greater synergies between the&nbsp;two.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/compute-to-data-is-now-available-in-ocean-market-58868be52ef7">Ocean Protocol recently launched Compute-to-Data in Ocean Market</a>, a means to buy &amp; sell private data while preserving privacy. Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It does so by providing a means to exchange data while preserving privacy by allowing the data to stay on-premise with data publishers, yet allows data consumers to run compute jobs on data. This will make previously inaccessible data sets available to SingularityDAO’s AI agents for learning.</p><blockquote>I’m really excited by the opportunity to work together with Ocean Protocol, one of the most respectable projects in crypto who has been constantly delivering community-driven, decentralized data solutions. SingularityDAO will constantly make use of data to train our ML and I can’t think of a better partner than Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><blockquote>– Marcello Mari, CEO at SingularityDAO</blockquote><p>SingularityDAO runs various AI agents to support portfolio management. Some, such as Portfolio Planner and Strategy Evaluator, use on-chain data, while others like the Price Predictor get data directly from exchanges. These agents consume and process vast amounts of data — all of which can be bought and sold on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data.

 Peer DIDs — An Off-Ledger DID Implementation <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a unique type of identifier that allows entities to generate and control their digital identity. Often, these DIDs are implemented on blockchains, databases, IPFS, and other Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) systems that establish a public and shared source of truth. These DIDs help the parties involved in a transaction to resolve the DID to a DID document and verify the authenticity of the information with the public keys present in the document.</p><p>That said, DID implementations don’t always have to be on blockchains or other systems that establish a public source of truth. It can also be implemented as a direct interaction between the two parties to a transaction. The way that two entities interact with each other directly without involving a network is the core principle of peer DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The idea behind creating these peer DID methods is to ensure a cheap, fast, secure, and scalable way to create and maintain private relationships between two entities. Let’s say, Alice and Bob are two entities who are interacting with each other, so only both of them care about the transaction and have a need to resolve their respective DIDs.</p><p>So, why should the other parties who are not connected to a transaction see their&nbsp;DIDs?</p><p>This is why peer DIDs could be a possible solution in cases that involve exactly two&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Also, these DIDs can connect back to a chain-based ecosystem when needed, as long as the credentials have not been revoked, and this is what makes them a flexible and versatile choice. And of course, it gives entities complete control over their digital relationships.</p> How are Peer DIDs Implemented? <p>In a traditional DID implementation, the public keys of both parties are registered on a blockchain or any other DLT, but in a peer DID, there’s no network. So, Alice creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends it directly to Bob. Likewise, Bob creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends the doc to&nbsp;Alice.</p><p>So, both Alice and Bob create their records and send the metadata of their records to each other, so one can use that metadata to look up the record of the other. This information can also be cryptographically encrypted for security.</p><p>This is something similar to the analogy where Alice creates a part of a secret and Bob creates a part of the same secret, and they exchange it with each other, so only both of them know the complete&nbsp;secret.</p><p>This brings up many questions regarding the creation, security, and storage of DID docs, so let’s delve deeper into&nbsp;them.</p> How are Peer DIDs&nbsp;created? <p>To create a peer DID, you need two things — a stored variant and a numeric&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">DIF</a></p><p>A stored variant is a DID doc that contains the keys, but not the actual DID value. The numeric basis is the 256-bit value you get when you use the sha256 hash value or any other numeric algorithm on the contents of the original&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This 256-bit string has to be prefixed with a few other values. First off, you need to mention the numeric algorithm you’re using and the standard is to use the value “1” for sha256. The second value you’ll mention is the binary transformation method used and again the standard is base58 and it is represented by z. This is followed by a bunch of alphanumeric characters that tells the receiver that this is a multi-codec value where 32 bytes are encoded using SHA256 and this is finally followed by the encoded value of the DID contents.</p><p>Add all of these to the method prefix — did:peer.</p><p>So, your final peer did will look something like&nbsp;this</p><p>did:peer:1zdksdnrjq0ru092sdfsd491cxvs03e0</p><p>The key takeaway from this is that you create a DID and run it through an algorithm to get a peer DID that can be shared directly with another&nbsp;entity.</p> How are Peer DIDs&nbsp;Shared? <p>Next, comes the question of how the peer DIDs are&nbsp;shared?</p><p>A popular choice is to use the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0116-evidence-exchange/README.md">Aries RFC 0023</a> DID exchange protocol. But you can also send a DID and a signed DID doc over a TLS session, but watch out for SSL applications between the two of you, as this can bring in an unnecessary middleman into the transaction.</p> Where are the DIDs&nbsp;stored? <p>Peer DIDs are stored in a place that’s controlled by both the parties and could be a hard drive, mobile device, data center, etc. The only key aspect is that these two entities alone should have access to this DID doc on any storage device. And as long as it is not available publicly, it is a peer&nbsp;DID.</p> Should you use Peer&nbsp;DIDs? <p>Peer DIDs offer many benefits such&nbsp;as,</p>  No transaction costs&nbsp;involved  Easy to create and&nbsp;maintain  Since these DIDs are independent of a central system such as a GDPR controller, they can be scaled as&nbsp;needed  Offers the highest levels of privacy as only the parties involved can access the&nbsp;DIDs  No uncertainties or external problems since these DIDs are not associated with any particular network  No degradation of trust throughout the entire lifecycle.  In tune with local-first software philosophies  Reduces unnecessary correlation between a verifier and an issuer of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a>.  <p>But you can use it only when exactly two parties are involved in a direct exchange of information. So, that’s something to consider when deciding if peer DIDs are the right choice for a transaction.</p><p>We hope this was a good starting point to kindle your interest in peer DIDs and the world of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>At Spruce, we’re building the most secure and convenient way for developers to share authentic data. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Tezos Profiles &amp;&nbsp;Kepler <p>Tezos Profiles (TZP) is an in-development web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms. It allows users to create portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over their public social media accounts, and by associating self-attested basic profile information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Tezos Profiles uses <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler">Kepler</a>. Kepler provides an IPFS-like storage system bucketed by “orbits”. An orbit is a logical store of content with access permissions and replication that is bounded by an authorization model defined by the orbit commander. Over the past month at Spruce we’ve implemented a Kepler MVP with initial support for the Tezos ecosystem, along with a TypeScript Client which integrates with the Beacon Wallet tool suite to provide decentralized storage for Tezos DApp users and developers.</p><p>We’re currently in the final phases of testing to enable users to access two credential workflows:</p>  Basic profile: self-attested information that contains a name, description, website, and&nbsp;logo.  Twitter account: users tweet a signature message that can be verified using a CloudFlare worker to associate their Twitter account to their Tezos&nbsp;account.  <p>After receiving credentials, users then are able to take the following actions:</p>  Upload their credentials to a Kepler Orbit specific to that user and under their control. It can then be replicated to Kepler hosts authorized by the user to hold those credentials.  Deploy their own smart contract which references the content stored in the Tezos Profile, and contains content hashes to prevent any tampering. A reference, hash, and content type are all the information stored on-chain, which allows deletion of claims to still be privacy-preserving.  <p>We’ve also developed a TypeScript SDK to manage Tezos Profiles directly, along with more general tools for the management of the base smart contract if a user wishes to repurpose the content-validation features for other applications.</p> DIDKit <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a> is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  Published DIDKit to PyPi, now available through pip&nbsp;install.

			 Sarà ottenibile con una semplice procedura da remoto, &nbsp;o presso uno dei partner InfoCert o ancora più rapidamente per i possessori di Firma Digitale o CNS.&nbsp; 
<p>Roma, 17 Maggio 2021 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, annuncia la disponibilità di SPID Uso Professionale – il cosiddetto SPID di tipo 3 – l’identità digitale dedicata a chi deve utilizzare l’account SPID prevalentemente per scopi lavorativi, magari per esigenza dell’eventuale organizzazione di appartenenza.</p>
<p>SPID Uso Professionale è accettato da tutti i portali della Pubblica Amministrazione e dai siti privati che già consentono l’accesso con SPID Persona Fisica – ossia lo SPID di tipo 1 rilasciato ai cittadini per l’utilizzo personale.</p>
<p>“L’utilizzo di SPID è cresciuto esponenzialmente nel 2020, tanto da registrare oltre 20 milioni di identità attive, rispetto ai 5 milioni registrati a fine 2019.. Per i cittadini è ormai uno strumento indispensabile per richiedere bonus governativi, consultare posizioni previdenziali e contributive, ottenere il Cashback di Stato, accedere all’APP IO e molto altro – commenta Pasquale Chiaro, Head of Product Marketing di InfoCert – La possibilità di disporre di un account professionale semplificherà l’operatività di imprese e professionisti in molteplici contesti lavorativi – come già dimostrano diversi casi d’uso nei reparti amministrativi di grandi aziende o all’interno di studi associati di avvocati, commercialisti e consulenti del lavoro – accelerando ulteriormente la diffusione di uno strumento capace di generare valore per l’intero sistema Paese. Finalmente le organizzazioni non saranno costrette a richiedere ai dipendenti l’uso di uno strumento privato, quale è SPID personale, e di avere comunque la garanzia di usabilità su tutti i portali.”</p>
 Ottenere SPID Uso Professionale 
<p>È richiedibile di persona presso gli InfoCert Point e i partner convenzionati, oppure da remoto e completamente online nelle modalità già previste da InfoCert per il rilascio di InfoCertID, lo SPID Persona Fisica per uso privato e cioè tramite il video riconoscimento web con l’assistenza di InfoCert, oppure in completa autonomia per chi già possiede una Firma Digitale o una Carta Nazionale dei Servizi (CNS).</p>
<p>Grazie alla nuova app MyInfoCert è peraltro facilissimo gestire, contemporaneamente e da un unico punto, i propri account SPID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per ottenere SPID Persona Fisica, SPID Uso Professionale e per conoscere le promozioni attive: www.identitadigitale.infocert.it</p>

<p>“Play a game, hang out, stack. Up to 1M sats¹ up for&nbsp;grabs!”</p><p>Yes, Bitcoin is now a medium for rewarding microtasks. It’s one of the most exciting applications of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://earncarrot.com/">Carrot</a> launched as a platform designed for people to earn bitcoin rewards simply by supporting the projects and brands they love. Built by the team at <a href="https://b.tc/">BTC Inc</a>, the media group behind <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/">Bitcoin Magazine</a>, Carrot is novel on two fronts: the platform not only gives creators <a href="https://medium.com/earncarrot/four-use-cases-for-carrot-133f1dbc29fa">efficient ways</a> to reward supporters directly, but also creates a critical new avenue for getting bitcoin into the hands of more people worldwide.</p><p>Powered by Magic authentication, Carrot is hitting record growth — with tens of thousands of users and counting.</p> Auth to reach a wider&nbsp;audience <p>Bitcoin’s meteoric rise made headlines all throughout last year and in turn, has helped bring crypto to the&nbsp;masses.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tylev?lang=en">Tyler Evans</a> is at the center of it all, as the co-founder and CTO of BTC Inc, one of the first Bitcoin-focused media and product companies in the world. Carrot is the latest product from the portfolio company, and it offers fun challenges, surveys, and the like to incentivize users with the chance to earn satoshis, the smallest units of Bitcoin currency.</p><p>Tyler summarizes Carrot’s mission into one word: hyperbitcoinization.</p><blockquote>“We built Carrot to be the economic engine of hyperbitcoinization, letting the next billion people earn their first&nbsp;bitcoin.</blockquote><p>To achieve this mission, the app needed to scale beyond the world of Web 3.0. The Carrot team knew authentication would play an important role in catering to a more mainstream user base. Rolling auth from scratch was not a viable option, given the cost of resourcing their lean team of engineers on non-core product work. So, they turned to auth solutions that valued privacy, security, and user experience.</p><p>According to Tyler, what differentiated Magic was the robust security benefits and seamless login flows, “all with crypto principles built-in.” Leveraging blockchain-based, public-private key cryptography, Magic identity aligns with the standard of trust within crypto communities.</p> Intuitive onboarding, plus peace of&nbsp;mind <p>The key to hyperbitcoinization? “A frictionless way to onboard mainstream users is a must. That’s where Magic comes in,” Tyler emphasized.</p><p>From a UX perspective, magic links were a friendly onboarding experience for people regardless of their familiarity with the crypto space. The team was confident that passwordless was the best path forward, based on their own experience using magic links through Slack and&nbsp;Medium.</p><blockquote>“Magic offers the easiest, lowest friction way to sign up, especially if you’re entirely new to&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote><p>What impressed them further was how easy it was for their developers to get up and running with Magic, thanks to the clear documentation.</p><blockquote>“Magic is a complete toolset that safeguards accounts, comes with well-designed emails, and gives peace of mind on the security side. That’s key for Bitcoin because money is at&nbsp;stake.”</blockquote> Fueling hyperbitcoinization <p>From alpha, beta, and beyond, Carrot is climbing to all-time highs for total users. Since the start, Magic has powered authentication and identity, scaling seamlessly across multiple phases of rapid&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Web 3.0 presents tremendous opportunity for innovative decentralized applications and business models. There’s more excitement with Bitcoin rewards around the corner — Carrot’s new mobile app is launching soon.</p><p>[1] Sats or satoshis = smallest bitcoin unit, equal to 100 millionth of a&nbsp;bitcoin</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-magic-helps-carrot-reward-the-next-billion-users-in-bitcoin-c06acba8a3e4">How Magic helps Carrot reward the next billion users in Bitcoin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Dutch government drafted a legislative proposal for the Remote Gambling Act and after a long parliamentary process, this Act was passed by the Dutch Senate in February 2019.</p>
<p>After being put back the act finally entered in force on April 1st 2021 meaning operators had until the 15th April 2021 to apply, and then launch of the licensed market on October 1 2021.</p>
<p>KSA received 28 applicants, with all applicants paying the stand alone 48,000 EUR fee.</p>
<p>4 types of Online/remote games of chance:</p>
 
 Casino games in which the players play against the licence holder (roulette and blackjack, for example). 
 Casino games in which the players play against each other (poker, for example). 
 Bets on events occurring during a sporting contest or on the outcome of a sporting contest 
 Bets on the outcome of horse racing and harness racing 
 
<p>Player Verification.</p>
<p>KSA say that Player verification takes place before allowing players to participate in games. The verification process includes identity verification, the decree states that the following information is required for purposes of player registration the surname, given names, date of birth, gender, place of birth of the person and, if available, the citizen service number appearing on the identity document of said person. The physical address and contact details of the person, including at least email and phone; and the contra account number or other unique identifier of the contra account, and the name on said account.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the act, is that there will be a Central Register of Exclusion of Games of Chance, Cruks for short.&nbsp;Before a player can gamble, the gambling provider must check whether the player is registered.&nbsp;If so, the player should not be allowed in.</p>
<p>From KSA “Cruks is an important tool to combat gambling addiction.&nbsp;Providers of risky games of chance – physical and online – must join Cruks.&nbsp;The current schedule is that Cruks&nbsp;will&nbsp;enter into force&nbsp;on&nbsp;October 1, 2021&nbsp;.&nbsp;Providers of games of chance can&nbsp;test their affiliation with Cruks&nbsp;earlier”.</p>
<p>Probably fair to say the Dutch government has made sure it’s up there with most demanding regulations, and the operators must abide by the parts of the Remote Gambling Act concerning addiction prevention and consumer protection.</p>
<p>IDnow has a long history of complying with complicated regulations world wide, especially in such a sensitive industry as gambling and online betting. Players of our global and local clients such as GVC, Lottoland, Tipico, Kindred and others.</p>

  As workers become more mobile and workloads move into the cloud, the traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter becomes ineffective.

We may have an idea of what goes into maintaining an identity (things like names and passwords), but no real knowledge of the inner workings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But digital identity is all around us in daily life, and understanding how it works can help us think about identity in a new way and gain insight into how digital identity concepts can relate to one another. So, as someone who thinks about identity (a lot), I was struck by how identity concepts bear a striking resemblance to models and concepts found in physics.</p>

<p>World over, there’s a greater push towards data protection and privacy. In the EU, in particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been a big step forward in this direction.</p><p>One of the primary goals of GDPR is to give individuals complete control over their personal data including with whom and how they are shared. In simple terms, the two important data protection and privacy principles of GDPR&nbsp;are:</p>  Giving users complete control over the transactional aspects of their digital identity including its monetization  Free movement of data across the union to enable commerce.  <p>While this may sound simple, in reality, it requires a whole new way of storing and managing personal data, and many of the technologies we use today are not conducive for it because they were created at a time when security and privacy were afterthoughts.</p><p>Before going into whether SSI is the answer for GDPR, let’s understand the provisions of GDPR with respect to the data owner’s&nbsp;rights.</p> GDPR Provisions <p>Articles 13 to 22 of the GDPR describe the rights of the data subject concerning the collection and sharing of the subject’s data. Let’s briefly look into each of these articles to thoroughly understand GDPR in the context of data protection.</p><p>Please note that here, the data subject is the owner of a piece of data while a controller is the one using the owner’s data for monetization or any other&nbsp;purpose.</p>  Article #13 — When data is collected with the knowledge of the owner, the controller must give information as to how it will be&nbsp;used.  Article #14 — The onus is on the controller to provide information to the data subject on how the data will be used and when it was collected without the subject’s knowledge.  Article #15 — The subject has the right to know how the data is being processed and even get access to the same at any&nbsp;time.  Article #16 — The data subject has the right to rectify inaccurate personal data and has the right to complete any inaccurate piece of information  Article #17 — The data subject has the right to erase data and the controller must comply with&nbsp;it.  Article #18 — The data subject can restrict the controller from processing his or her personal data, provided it is inaccurate, unlawful, and illegitimate.  Article #19 — The controller has to communicate any rectification or erasure of personal&nbsp;data  Article #20 — The data subject has the right to obtain personal data in a structured and machine-readable format and can transfer the same to another controller at any&nbsp;time.  Article #21 — The data subject has the right to object to the grounds on which his or her data is being processed, especially when it is used for profiling purposes and marketing through&nbsp;it.  Article #22 — The data subject has the right to oppose any decision that’s based on automated processing, including profiling, that can create legal or any significant impacts  <p>A common theme among all these provisions is to empower the data subject and put him or her in complete control over personal data including the way it is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>Now, it’s time to see if Self-sovereign identity (SSI) addresses each of these provisions.</p><p>SSI is a form of digital identity where an entity owns and controls its information completely, including who can see what parts of the personal information and how they are shared. Here’s an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">interesting article</a> that compares SSI and Federated Identity Management.</p><p>There are many ways to implement SSI, and in this article, we will be looking at the idea of using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> for implementing SSI. At the most basic level, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.  <p>Here’s a list of the possible list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">VC use-cases</a>.</p><p>When you examine SSI implementation through VCs, you can visualize VCs to be the replacements for physical documents while SSI is the technology/platform that allows a subject to host his or her data and control the way it is shared and&nbsp;handled.</p> Does SSI meet the GDPR requirements? <p>Let’s examine how SSI meets each of the articles from #13 to&nbsp;#22.</p>  Article #13 — Since the data subject (called the owner/holder) owns and controls the data, he or she can decide to whom to share it with, and how the same can be&nbsp;used.  Article #14 — The data holder is the one who shares the information, so there’s no question of collecting any data without the owner’s knowledge.  Article #15 — Again, the holder shares the data with chosen entities, so it is completely aware of how the PII is being processed and where it is&nbsp;used.  Article #16 — The data holder can reach the issuer in case of any corrections before sharing them with the verifiers.  Article #17 and #18 — While it is not possible to completely erase the data, the access for the same can be revoked or a VC can also be deactivated if&nbsp;needed.  Article #19 — The data owner and controller are the same entity, so the owner can revoke or update at any&nbsp;time.  Article #20 — VCs are in a machine-readable format for easy&nbsp;sharing.  Article #21 and 22 — The data owner can revoke access if it was used for purposes besides which it was shared by the&nbsp;owner  <p>As you can see, the VC-based SSI implementation meets the GDPR requirements, so this could be a potential way to achieve GDPR compliance.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>This guide was prepared by your Telegram admin &amp; Ontology Harbinger, <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>.</p><p>I decided to create this guide to ensure that everybody knows how to obtain ONG without asking for donations. We have an awesome community which is always helpful to those in need, but requests for ONG encourage spam that harms our community chats and threads. Some users also expose their wallet addresses. Wherever you are based, there is a way to get your first ONG, so let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p><p>First, let’s recap Ontology’s dual token&nbsp;model:</p><blockquote>The Ontology dual-token design uses ONT for staking and ONG as gas. ONT is used as the staking tool, and the time cost of staking and the operating costs of the nodes are considered to be inputs, with ONG distributed as revenue. ONG is the utility token used as a value anchoring tool for on-chain applications <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-breakdown-of-the-ontology-dual-token-model-16b322795c01">(source)</a>.</blockquote><p>In short, you can get ONG as a reward for staking ONT. However, you also need 0.05 ONG per transaction on Ontology’s chain. The same goes for staking or claiming staking rewards. So the question you might be asking yourself is, “Where do I get my first ONG tokens to start staking or to just move my stuck ONT&nbsp;tokens?”</p> Where to get&nbsp;ONG?  1. Centralized Exchanges (easiest) <p>You can always check available markets at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/markets/">coinmarketcap</a> or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ontology-gas#markets">coingecko</a>, but the most popular option is definitely <a href="https://accounts.binance.cc/en/register?ref=27915785">Binance.</a> With Binance, you can buy any amount of ONG and withdraw it to your wallet with only a 0.1 ONG withdrawal fee. Binance does not require KYC and for unverified accounts offers a 2 BTC daily withdrawal limit. The easiest method is to deposit some crypto (listed on Binance) and trade it for&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>If you cannot access a centralized ONG market due to your geographical location, see the alternative methods&nbsp;below.</p> 2. ONTO Wallet&nbsp;(easy) <p>(This solution is good for users who are unable to buy ONG at centralized exchanges but can buy and withdraw&nbsp;ONT)</p><p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO </a>is the official Ontology mobile wallet which has a built-in swap function enabling users to swap ONT for ONG without paying gas fees. It was designed specially for users who have ONT but run out of ONG. A step-by-step guide on how to perform this swap can be found <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/assets/swapping-ont-for-ong">here</a>. To learn how to download, install, and set-up your ONTO wallet, click&nbsp;<a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/app-basics/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet">here</a>.</p><p>How to send your ONT tokens to ONTO if you store them elsewhere:</p><p>a) If you have ONT tokens on an exchange, withdraw them to your ONTO wallet (On the Assets page, click on ONG, press Receive and copy the&nbsp;address)</p><p>b) If you have ONT tokens in a third party, non-custodial wallet such as Trust wallet, export your mnemonic phrase or private key and import it into&nbsp;ONTO.</p><p>To import the address, install ONTO and create a new ONT ID wallet first. Once you have your wallet set-up, click in the upper right corner on your profile picture, select Manage wallets and then at the bottom press +Add new wallet and then Import wallet. In the Import wallet window select Import other wallet and from the list select ONT Wallet. It will show you all of the supported import&nbsp;options.</p><p>c) If you struggle to import your third party wallet to ONTO, you can still use option a) workaround, just buy some ONT on any exchange you can access and withdraw it to your ONTO wallet. Then swap 1–10 ONT for ONG and send them from ONTO to your third party wallet. This workaround is valid also for US based users who can, for instance, use <a href="http://binance.us">binance.us</a> to buy and withdraw ONT to ONTO&nbsp;wallet.</p> 3. Other wallet swaps&nbsp;(easy) <p><a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus wallet</a> currently offers ONG swaps. Unfortunately, it seems that the value of each swap has to be at least approximately $215. You cannot use an Exodus mnemonic phrase to import to ONTO, it will result in a different wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p><a href="https://atomicwallet.io/">Atomic wallet</a> should have available ONG swap pairs currently, so you can use this wallet to get some ONG as well. The minimum swap value is $15. You will need to create a new wallet and deposit some assets which can be swapped for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 4. Decentralized approach via ApeSwap or PancakeSwap (hard) <p>(This solution is a good option if you have Binance Smart Chain BNB. You can use it to buy ONT in a decentralized way, which you can then swap for ONG inside ONTO&nbsp;wallet)</p><p>Currently you cannot directly trade ONG on BSC (Binance Smart Chain), but you can get ONT which you can then swap to ONG within your ONTO wallet, based on the steps described above. If you are familiar with BSC’s ecosystem, it should be easy for you. All you need is a multi-token wallet app which supports BSC and ONT, such as <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a>. Create a new wallet if you don’t have one already and deposit some BNB (BSC). Then open ApeSwap or PancakeSwap (based on your preference or available liquidity). Here, you can trade BNB for ONT (BSC version).

<p>Anybody who has used Ethereum smart contracts recently is aware that it has
gotten expensive. There are a large quantity of
complicated and clever techniques each with their own trade-offs
that are collectively referred to as "layer 2 solutions" (see <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#resources">further
resources</a> for more information about these). This is in contrast to
the base computational layer of Ethereum called "layer 1", which is what constitutes most Ethereum usage and where <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Urbit ID</a>’s smart contracts currently exist.</p>
<p>Tlon has always covered gas costs for Urbit ID up to a set limit, and this was easy a couple of years ago when the cost of transactions required to get a <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/planet/">planet</a> up and running came out to less than a dollar. Unfortunately the ongoing Ethereum gas crisis, along with the rising price of Ethereum itself, has made this impossible. We’ve seen gas costs to set up a planet as high as several hundred US dollars at time of writing!</p>
<p>In response to the gas crisis, Tlon has spent the last several months developing
a simple, in-house layer 2 solution which we anticipate will reduce typical gas costs by 65x or more.</p>
<p>This post is primarily a short non-technical explainer of the end-user experience of our solution aimed at planet and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/star/">star</a> owners and those in the market for one, as well as a status update on where we're at in development. At <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">the end</a> we give some minimal technical details and resources to help you dig deeper should you wish. 
This is also primarily aimed at those who currently self-host or plan to self-host their
urbit. For anybody utilizing a hosted service, this matter will all be handled
by your provider. There is a <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#stars">separate section</a> addressed specifically at star owners, and another <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#rollers">section</a> for those who wish to set up their urbit to accept and submit layer 2 transactions. We’d like to emphasize that this system is 100% opt-in—if you are satisfied with the current experience of Urbit ID, then nothing changes for you whatsoever.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pressing question held by anybody reading this is—when will
it be ready? It's not reasonable to give a timeline on difficult engineering
work, but rest assured that completing this upgrade is a top priority. Much
of the back-end is approaching completion, and we are confident in a release before the end of Q3 and hopefully much sooner.</p>
 Naive rollups 
<p>Our layer 2 solution, designed primarily by Tlon lead engineer <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code>,
is known as "naive rollups" and we will be using this term interchangeably with
"layer 2"—though it is important to note that there are many layer 2 solutions
utilized by projects other than Urbit. As we're avoiding technicality here, we’re focusing primarily on the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing our layer 2 solution, and how that affects the management of your <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ship</a>.</p>
<p>Very briefly, a rollup is a way to combine many transactions into one, and we
are building infrastructure so that any Urbit ship may be utilized as a "roller". A
roller will collect layer 2 Urbit ID transactions, confirm their validity, and
post them to the Ethereum blockchain. More detail is given <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">at the end</a>. Anybody may set up a
ship to <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#rollers">act as a roller</a>. Tlon will be launching our own publicly accessible roller, but as Urbit is a decentralized network, by no means will we have a monopoly.</p>
 Pros and cons 
<p>The primary advantage to using naive rollups is that the gas cost for Urbit
ID-related actions will be dramatically reduced. It will be reduced sufficiently that we expect that a few transactions per ship per week (plenty for ordinary usage) submitted to Tlon's roller will not cost the end user anything. There are no gas costs associated with submitting a layer 2 transaction to a roller, and Tlon will bear the gas cost of posting the results to the blockchain. That means that the cost you see for a planet on a market that utilizes Tlon's roller ought to be
the final cost.</p>
<p>There are a few trade-offs for this, but none of them really sacrifice the core
value propositions of Urbit ID.</p>
<p>The most substantial one is that ships on layer 2 are essentially completely isolated
from the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem. They can no longer interact with smart
contracts designed to work with Urbit ID or non-fungible tokens (which are how Urbit IDs are represented) in general. It is also not possible to write new Ethereum smart contracts that work with layer 2 ships.</p>
<p>Compounding that factor, the journey to layer 2 is one-way only—at
least for now. There are theoretical ways a ship may be moved back to layer 1, but they do not yet exist, and we cannot promise that such a thing will be available in a timely manner. Anybody moving a ship to layer 2, or buying a ship on layer 2, should assume that they will
remain on layer 2 for the foreseeable future. We do not expect this to be
permanent, but it is perhaps the most significant drawback for the time being.</p>
<p>Another one is that transactions may no longer be "instant". Effectively, this
was already the case on layer 1—unless you paid a lot of gas, you could wait
hours or even days for your transaction to clear. But the way we are saving on
gas is essentially by "bundling" or "rolling up" many transactions into one, and
submitting them as a single transaction. The more transactions in the rollup,
the better the savings. This bundling is not the only factor at play here
though—costs are reduced other ways, but this is a technical detail 
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">discussed later in this post</a>. It is possible to use layer 2 to submit single
transactions (and this will still save on gas costs!), so utilization of layer 2
should not incur any delay over layer 1 when utilized in this fashion.</p>
<p>Tlon has not finalized the details on how our roller will work, but it will
probably involve waiting until a sufficient backlog of transactions have been
submitted to make it economical to bundle them up, or just submitting every set
time period, whichever arrives first. We do not see this as a big issue—we
view Urbit ID as "digital land", and a few hours to acquire land, or waiting for
your new personal computer to be delivered, is still lightning fast in
comparison to the real world. We also have ideas on methods that will allow you to get on the network before the transfer has been confirmed, but that is outside of the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Our layer 2 preserves the main value proposition of Urbit ID, which is that your ship 
belongs to you forever, and that this is assured by very strong cryptographic methods and
game-theoretic arguments comparable to the ones that exist on layer 1. We
consider this principle to be uncompromisable, and maintaining ultimate
sovereignty over your ship was totally central in choosing our solution.
We summarize the new security model <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">below</a>, and <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code>
goes into greater detail in the <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#resources">resources</a>.</p>
 Changes to User Experience 
<p>The primary way one manages their Urbit ID, namely performing tasks such as
transferring ships, setting networking keys, or setting
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/proxies/">proxies</a>, is with a web interface called
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/bridge/">Bridge</a> found at
<a href="https://bridge.urbit.org">bridge.urbit.org</a>. If you already own a planet,
you've probably used Bridge before - perhaps only a single time.</p>
<p>Bridge will be getting a facelift to enable easy interfacing with layer 2,
including loud warnings about what is being gained and lost by doing so. From
here you will be able to transfer your ship to layer 2, and once there,
perform all the usual actions you can on layer 1.</p>
<p>The main difference for layer 2 transactions on Bridge will be the additional
choice of a roller to submit transactions to. Tlon's will be free for ordinary, non-time-sensitive usage.
You could use your own ship for a fast single transaction for a little more gas. We expect that planet markets and stars may wish to set up their own rollers as well.</p>
<p>Every planet has a sponsor star, which distributes <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA
updates</a> to their sponsored planets and assists with peer discovery. Both layer 1 and layer 2 planets will be able to be
sponsored by either layer 1 or layer 2 stars, meaning that nothing will change
in terms of how sponsorship works.</p>
<p>When you buy a ship, any reputable seller will inform you whether or not it is
on layer 1 or layer 2. Anyone running an urbit will be able to verify this information, and we expect for tools to exist to make this information publicly available (see <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/bounties/1101665172-network-explorer-data-pipeline-http-api">this grant</a>).</p>
<p>And that's it! If you'd like to know how things will be changing for
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#stars">stars</a>, what goes into <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#rollers">setting up a roller</a>, and additional
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">technical details</a>, read on.</p>
 Changes to stars 
<p>Both planets and stars will be able to move to layer 2.
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/galaxy/">Galaxies</a> must remain on layer 1 for technical
reasons, and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/moon/">moons</a> and
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/comet/">comets</a> never interacted with Ethereum anyways, so
they are completely out of the picture.</p>
<p>Stars will be able to remain on layer 1 with no action required. For star owners
that wish to take advantage of the cheaper gas costs, there are two possible
modes: ownership of the star on layer 2, or setting the spawn proxy to layer 2
with ownership remaining on layer 1.</p>
<p>The first mode—a star which is owned on layer 2—has the same advantages and
disadvantages as a layer 2 planet. Planets spawned by a layer 2 star will also
necessarily be on layer 2 - there is no way to spawn a layer 1 planet from a
layer 2 star, though any planets which were spawned on layer 1 before the
star migrated to layer 2 will remain on layer 1.</p>
<p>The second mode—ownership on layer 1, with spawn proxy on layer 2—is only slightly more complicated. Such a star will change its networking keys, transfer
between wallets, and set its management proxy all on layer 1, with the
corresponding higher gas cost. However, it will be able to spawn planets on
layer 2—and only on layer 2—with the corresponding layer 2 tradeoffs. Like
moving ownership to layer 2, this will be a one-way journey for now. Planets
spawned before moving the spawn proxy to layer 2 will remain on layer 1, but
from then on, all planets spawned by that star will live on layer 2. Finally, stars in this second mode may transition to the first mode, but not vice versa.</p>
 Creating a roller 
<p></p>
<p>Rollers are urbit nodes which users submit transactions to to be "rolled up"
into a bundle to be submitted to the Ethereum blockchain. The business logic for
a roller runs on the urbit node itself. Thus, anybody with an urbit ship may set
it up to act as a roller. While the details of how rollers work are still being
hammered out, one should expect that one can either set transactions to be
submitted at regular intervals, once a sufficient number of transactions have
been received (as more transactions means greater savings), manually, or some
combination of the above.</p>
<p>Tlon plans to release documentation on how to set up your own roller concurrently with
the release of our layer 2 solution.</p>
<p>Malicious rollers could potentially exist, but the worst they ought to be able
to do is simply not submit your transaction. The security factors for rollers
are briefly addressed <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">below</a>, and elaborated upon in the
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#resources">resources</a>, but you can expect full technical documentation on
these factors to be included in the roller documentation.</p>
 Changes to Azimuth 
<p><a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Azimuth</a> is the set of Ethereum smart contracts
governing Urbit ID. They will require a few changes to accommodate the new
system. Some of this has been implicit above, but to be clear, we will only be
making a couple minor alterations:</p>
 
 Once a star's spawn proxy is set to the layer 2 address, it can't be switched
back, and they can no longer spawn layer 1 planets. 
 Galaxies and their proxies cannot be deposited to layer 2.
Some other minor details are yet to be worked out, but again, nothing will change for those who wish to remain on layer 1. 
 
 Technical details 
<p>What's really going on behind the scenes here? Briefly, only the data of the Urbit ID transactions will be posted on-chain, while computation and state storage will now happen on your ship.</p>
<p>In layer 1, the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> guarantees the validity of state transitions, while for layer 2 transactions, each Urbit node guarantees the validity of the state transitions.</p>
<p>Changes to the state of Urbit ID on layer 1 works as follows:</p>
 
 A transaction is posted to the Ethereum blockchain. 
 The EVM calculates the resulting state transition and checks its validity, then updates the state. 
 Your urbit downloads the new state from an Ethereum node. 
 Your urbit makes the final decision on whether the new state is valid. 
 
<p>In practice, the fourth step is never used in layer 1. The primary change to our
security model is that we are cutting out step 2 and beefing up step 4. Your
ship will now perform validation of the transactions posted to the Ethereum
blockchain, rather than the EVM.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Urbit OS</a> is deterministic, and Hoon has some nice formal
properties, it turns out to be a great language for writing smart contracts. Thus we are effectively swapping the Ethereum smart contract with a “Hoon smart contract” run locally on your ship. </p>
 Further Resources 
<p>We want to keep this post brief and non-technical, so that's all we'll say about
it for now. To find out more, you have a few directions to go on. We held a
<a href="https://urbit.org/events/developer-call-scaling-azimuth/">Developer Call</a> where
<code>~wicdev-wisryt</code> outlines the design in much more technical detail, and also
explains why we decided to utilize our own design rather than other known layer
2 solutions such as <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/">Optimistic
rollups</a>,
<a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK-rollups</a>,
etc, or other blockchains. He also plans to do a more technical walkthrough video sometime before release. For those who would rather read, see

<p>We’re excited to share that the transition of the Dock blockchain to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus is expected to take place in June 2021. In preparation for this major milestone, the team is now actively seeking parties that are interested in participating in the PoS network as a validator.</p><p>In charge of producing blocks (processing transactions) and validating blocks produced by other validators, Dock validators form an integral part of the Dock ecosystem. Validators will earn token rewards for participating in the network. Before we get into what this step means for validators, it would be remiss not to mention what this milestone means for the entire Dock community. </p><p>Of course, transitioning to Proof of Stake, or Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) to be precise, provides more than a new way for Dock nodes to agree on the state of the network. It introduces profound and fundamental changes to the network and the Dock ecosystem. Firstly, once NPoS is incorporated into the Dock mainnet, the network will become more decentralized. The number of validators will increase from the current 11, to potentially several hundred candidates all competing for the 50 slots, and these validators will not be chosen by Dock - rather, they will be selected by the network based on how much stake the validator has accumulated.</p><p>Furthermore, this hugely important milestone will further decentralize governance of Dock as community members will now be able to make and vote on proposals, as well as vote on candidates they wish to oversee the ongoing management of the network on the Dock Council. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=join-dock-network-as-a-proof-of-stake-validator">This blog post</a> articulated our plans for decentralized governance, and it is recommended for the additional context it provides while also showing the evolution the network has undergone since the mainnet was launched in September of 2020.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>The individuals interested in serving as Dock validators should contact our team by emailing us at <a href="mailto:marketing@dock.io">marketing@dock.io</a> or reaching out to us via social media. When NPoS begins, the candidate validators will be able to stake (lock up) their own tokens, and/or be nominated by other token holders (nominators), who can back candidates by locking tokens on the candidates’ behalf. The network algorithm will automatically choose candidates with the most stake to become validators. There can be at most 50 validators at any given time. </p><p>As the validators produce and validate blocks, they (along with their nominators) will earn rewards in the form of Dock tokens. After each epoch (10 days), 40% of the rewards, consisting of emission rewards and transaction fees, will be distributed among validators based on their contributions in that epoch. Then for each validator, the network will divide up the rewards among the validator and their nominator(s) according to the validator’s commission and how much they have staked compared to one another.</p><p>Each year Dock will release at most 25% of the remaining token supply as emission rewards. The release schedule for the next 25 years, as well as further details about the validator selection and rewards, can be found in our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">token economics documentation</a>. General information about the Dock network’s ecosystem, token utility, governance, and consensus can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">here</a>.</p><p>How to Get Started</p><p>Any cloud provider can be used to run a Dock node cost at minimal expense. The technical requirements for validators are as follows:</p>  1 or 2 publicly accessible machines  At least 4 GB of RAM  At least 50 GB of SSD  Bandwidth of 10 Mbps over WAN  Some familiarity with provisioning machines (either cloud or on-prem) and some familiarity with Linux command line is needed to run the provided scripts to generate keys and deploy node. Dock currently supports Ubuntu 18.04.  <p>If you’d like to participate as a validator, please contact us by any of the following channels so that we can keep you updated with the latest information:</p>  Email: <a href="mailto:marketing@dock.io">marketing@dock.io</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">@docknetwork</a>  Riot: <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#!KpPIERdKQjLTTwsOkn:matrix.org">Join the chat here</a>  <p>We will run a testnet in the first instance, and our plans are to launch NPoS on the Dock mainnet in June 2021, further to a successful security audit. At this point the validators will be able to start earning rewards.</p>

<p>So, what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do? We’ve just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">a Technology Overview video</a> that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY"></a></p>

<p>As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s">entropy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s">seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s">keys</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s">airgaps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s">multisigs</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s">secure storage</a> to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s">CBOR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s">CRC-32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s">Fountain Codes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s">QRs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s">SHA-256</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
</p>
 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s">Bytewords</a> are a text-encoding method for binary data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s">Uniform Resources</a> support self-describing data that can be used interoperably. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s">LifeHash</a> allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s">SSKR</a> provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets. 
   The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s">Torgap</a> architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services. 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">Technology Overview video</a> discusses all of this and more.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources: An Overview</a> explains how URs are put together, and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md">A Guide to Using URs for Key Material</a> looks at <code>ur:crypto-seed</code>, <code>ur:crypto-bip39</code>, and <code>ur:crypto-hdkey</code> as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)</p>

<p>The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">video</a> to see how some of our technologies can help you.</p>

<p>You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor at GitHub</a> or by making a one-time donation <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">at our BTCPay</a>.</p>

<p>Are you following the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-04-29/apple-iphone-tracking-operating-system-update-facebook-privacy/100100172">brouhaha</a>&nbsp;in big tech?&nbsp;Apple made a serious privacy change and Facebook is hitting backhard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On&nbsp;April 27, 2021, Apple introduced&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature&nbsp;as part of its iOS 14.5 update.&nbsp;Knowing there would be pushback, Apple announced the ATT feature a year ago but delayed the launch to give app developers&nbsp;time to adjust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT&nbsp;forces&nbsp;apps to ask users, clearly and up front:&nbsp;Do you want&nbsp;us to track your activity across&nbsp;other companies’ apps and websites?&nbsp;The app can&nbsp;briefly&nbsp;justify its reasoning for tracking and, most importantly, the user can say yes or no.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">Facebook is&nbsp;going blue in the face</a>&nbsp;arguing the move will hurt&nbsp;everything from&nbsp;its&nbsp;bottom line to&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">small business</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;free market economy.&nbsp;It&nbsp;tried using&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">“educational screen”</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;implied it would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking">charge a fee</a>&nbsp;tousers who&nbsp;say no to&nbsp;tracking, and even put&nbsp;its case in&nbsp;full-page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-04-29/apple-iphone-tracking-operating-system-update-facebook-privacy/100100172">ads&nbsp;in major newspapers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook isn’t the only app affected by ATT, but it is the&nbsp;most&nbsp;affected. Let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p>



 What does ATT do?&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>ATT puts user consent&nbsp;to&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;up front for the first time and gives the user unprecedented&nbsp;control&nbsp;over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every time a user opens an app for the first time after the&nbsp;iOS 14.5&nbsp;update,&nbsp;a&nbsp;pop-up privacy prompt&nbsp;will&nbsp;tell them&nbsp;the app wants to track&nbsp;their activity&nbsp;across the internet, give a brief justification,&nbsp;and&nbsp;ask their&nbsp;permission&nbsp;to allow it.&nbsp;Thenevery app that has asked permission&nbsp;will appear&nbsp;in a tracking menu in the iOS privacy settings so the user can review and change their choice at any time, for all apps or certain ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saying no to the privacy question stops cross-app tracking. This means the app can no longer use the user’s IDFA (ID for Advertising) or other identifiers such as hashed email addresses to aggregate data&nbsp;about the user across&nbsp;other&nbsp;apps and sites on the internet. The IDFA is&nbsp;a unique number Apple has been assigning since 2012 to each user’s device to knit together their data and activity&nbsp;across web sites and apps&nbsp;and build a highly detailed user profile for&nbsp;personalized advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the app, a ‘no’ answer will mean&nbsp;turning off the&nbsp;data&nbsp;tap&nbsp;that&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;its&nbsp;targeted advertising and losing a revenue stream if they sell the aggregated data to others, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>.&nbsp;And they’re&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">not allowed</a>&nbsp;to restrict access to features for those who opt out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Facebook’s case, a user saying&nbsp;‘no’&nbsp;to tracking&nbsp;would have&nbsp;no effect on Facebook tracking what a user does on&nbsp;its own platform, but it&nbsp;would stop&nbsp;Facebook aggregating data about&nbsp;that user&nbsp;across&nbsp;other&nbsp;apps&nbsp;and sites.&nbsp;Clearly,&nbsp;it’s this&nbsp;aggregated data product&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;extraordinarily&nbsp;valuable to Facebook’s ad revenue because&nbsp;it shows advertisers exactly what users are browsing and buying. (See&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">Signal’s&nbsp;recent&nbsp;hilarious targeted ad campaign</a>&nbsp;proving this point, which Facebook shut down.)&nbsp;Of course&nbsp;a user&nbsp;saying&nbsp;‘yes’&nbsp;to tracking&nbsp;would mean&nbsp;the&nbsp;app&nbsp;can&nbsp;continue its free-for-all&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance</a>&nbsp;on the user’s devices.&nbsp;Situation normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Importantly, the users who opt out will still&nbsp;see&nbsp;ads, just not as&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">spookily relevant</a>&nbsp;ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to&nbsp;ATT,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;had to click on a link&nbsp;in their phone settings&nbsp;to reset their IDFA,&nbsp;which would&nbsp;interrupt data tracking.&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;ATT effectively&nbsp;randomizes&nbsp;the opted-out users’&nbsp;IDFAs&nbsp;and&nbsp;breaks&nbsp;the tracking.&nbsp;Under iOS 14.5, if a user selects ‘Allow apps to ask’ under Settings &gt; Privacy, each app&nbsp;they use&nbsp;gets to implement the&nbsp;ATT&nbsp;privacy prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Highly charged emotional responses to ATT&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>With&nbsp;ATT,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;allows&nbsp;apps to make their case to the user:&nbsp;why we’re asking for your permission for cross–apptracking.&nbsp;And it’s interesting to see how different companies are&nbsp;doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Apple first announced the change, Facebook was the most vocal dissenter&nbsp;and still is.&nbsp;Although an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/ios-14point5-apple-iphone-software-leads-to-german-antitrust-complaint.html">antitrust complaint filed in Germany</a>&nbsp;against Facebook is serious stuff too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook argues&nbsp;ATT will&nbsp;be bad&nbsp;for not only&nbsp;its&nbsp;business&nbsp;but&nbsp;small businesses everywhere that rely on targeted&nbsp;(arguably&nbsp;more&nbsp;effective)&nbsp;advertising.&nbsp;They said&nbsp;it was&nbsp;a hit to&nbsp;the&nbsp;free market economy.&nbsp;And&nbsp;they even&nbsp;implied the possibility of a fee&nbsp;for&nbsp;users&nbsp;who&nbsp;opt out of&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;—&nbsp;a&nbsp;bullying tactic that many&nbsp;experts&nbsp;agree&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">won’t come to pass</a>and a statement&nbsp;that&nbsp;Facebook has since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">clarified and denied</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Electronic&nbsp;Frontier&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;(EFF)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">calls&nbsp;Facebook’s pushback</a>&nbsp;“a laughable attempt&nbsp;…&nbsp;to distract you from its poor track record of anticompetitive behavior and privacy issues as it tries to derail pro-privacy changes from Apple that are bad for Facebook’s business”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes,&nbsp;Facebook will take a hit from ATT but&nbsp;it will&nbsp;still make ad revenue and&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">plenty of it</a>.&nbsp;Absolutely, less relevant ads&nbsp;will&nbsp;mean fewer clicks, fewer sales and less revenue. But, like&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">Google</a>, Facebook still has&nbsp;loads of&nbsp;first party data from which to profit,&nbsp;which explains why the&nbsp;<a>EFF says</a>&nbsp;“Facebook’s&nbsp;laughable&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;against Apple&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;against&nbsp;users and&nbsp;small&nbsp;businesses”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Requiring trackers to request your consent before stalking you across the Internet should be an obvious baseline, and we applaud Apple for this change. But Facebook, having built a massive empire around the concept of tracking everything you do by letting applications sell and share your data across a shady set of third-party companies, would like users and policymakers to believe otherwise.&nbsp;Make no mistake: this latest campaign from Facebook is yet another direct attack against our privacy and, despite its slick packaging, it’s also an attack against other businesses, both large and small,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">EFF article notes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course&nbsp;Facebook’s&nbsp;is&nbsp;just&nbsp;one perspective&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;companies are using various emotive techniques to justify tracking and&nbsp;to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;(bully?)&nbsp;users into selecting ‘allow’&nbsp;at&nbsp;the ATT privacy prompt.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">Copping heat</a>&nbsp;right now&nbsp;is&nbsp;Canada’s&nbsp;Weather Network&nbsp;app&nbsp;that’s using&nbsp;fear without any justification&nbsp;to make users agree to tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Our position on ATT&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>With ATT,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;is giving&nbsp;users more visibility about tracking and more power to opt out.&nbsp;We feel these are legitimate steps by Apple to enhance consumer privacy. They’re in touch with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer mindset</a>&nbsp;around privacy&nbsp;and they’re responding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;of course&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;also&nbsp;has the luxury of making this change without disrupting its own revenue streams.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a primarily&nbsp;hardware business,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;can readily choose&nbsp;this as a battleground.&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;may be&nbsp;doing this to&nbsp;disrupt&nbsp;Google,&nbsp;and Facebook is just&nbsp;hefty&nbsp;collateral damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What the early&nbsp;opt-out&nbsp;stats say&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Early stats from&nbsp;<a href="https://branch.io/">Branch Metrics</a>&nbsp;on Twitter&nbsp;say,&nbsp;of the people&nbsp;who had the “Allow apps to request to track” box checked&nbsp;in iOS 14.5,&nbsp;only&nbsp;4% of users allowed tracking. That means 96% of people&nbsp;didn’t want&nbsp;tracking. For those who argue that&nbsp;generally&nbsp;users want tracking, these stats are strong rebuttal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What&nbsp;we recommend&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We’ll always recommend that you answer ‘no’ to the ATT privacy prompt. Disabling cross-app tracking is good for your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>. Do it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT is clearly a huge leap for data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;but it doesn’t stop tracking within a single app&nbsp;(remember, it’s only for cross-app tracking). You still need&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized and protected</a>&nbsp;across different services. Take&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">90 seconds</a>&nbsp;to learn how.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<p>In the previous article, we have discussed <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-3-services-digital-asset-marketplaces-provide-to-issuers/">three services a Digital Asset Marketplace (DAM) can provide to security token issuers</a>. Now, let’s dive into the benefits it can offer to security token investors. Before going into the details, we have listed the standard structure that a DAM provides to investors in this chart below:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 1. Access to curated offerings 
<p>For investors, the main benefit of a DAM is to easily discover curated investment opportunities. The marketplace operator selects issuers of securities depending on its positioning and the value they offer to Investors.</p>
<p>With this selection of investment opportunities, the investor can now access curated offerings and participate in projects that meet their preferences and ensure they only subscribe to projects based on their level of quality. And the whole process is fully digitized, from subscribing to offerings, to making payments, to signing digital signatures. Not only does it facilitate the process, but also provides a smooth digital experience for investors.</p>
<p>A DAM must be compatible with the most adopted blockchain identification systems used on the market. So it allows Investors to directly use their Blockchain Account to prove who they are without submitting the same information for each token. As a result, investors can access various offerings without having to repetitively provide the same information, for example for KYC/AML checks.</p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Primary Market Interface     
	 
		 
			 2. Manage their digital asset portfolio  
<p>The DAM also provides a real-time view of their digital assets through the investor dashboard, enabling investors to better manage their portfolios. Investors can utilize this data to develop a cohesive investing strategy based on their goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. In addition, a built-in communication tool can help investors easily track the announcements and status of their securities on the platform, which helps investors better allocate their assets and adjust their investment strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>For each security token, investors can access the details of the asset, his positions, transaction history and other information.</p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Portfolio Interface     
	 
		 
			 3. Improve liquidity 
<p>Being able to manage digital asset portfolios is important for investors, but equal importance is the transferability of these digital assets. After analyzing the portfolio, investors can then go to the secondary market on the DAM to rebalance their portfolios by selling and buying digital assets on a peer-to-peer basis. Depending on the services fee set by the DAM, the transfer fees can be as little as a few cents and take only a few seconds to execute, compared with days or weeks in the traditional financial world. </p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Secondary Market Interface     
	 
		 
			<p>Ultimately, DAMs bring better liquidity and transferability to their investors through an easy-to-use interface that is also friendly for non-blockchain investors. This is crucial for investors because, with the recent hype about digital assets, more and more investors are turning their eyes to this market and are getting ready to participate. Now more than ever, there is a need for a non-crypto newbies-friendly marketplace. Such a platform makes it easy for traditional investors to take part in the new era of investment to subscribe, manage and transfer their security tokens.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to explaining more in the next article. If you can’t wait, this is an excerpt taken from the ebook we published with CoinTelegraph, <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-era-of-digital-asset-marketplaces/">download here</a>.</p>

  The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the way customers engage with brands and led to increased digital interaction. But this has increased the incidence of fraud during the account creation process. As a result, businesses now face the challenge of verifying customer identity and verifying that those entities interacting with their brand are human and who they claim to be.

As a result, businesses now face the challenge of verifying customer identity and verifying that those entities interacting with their brand are human and who they claim to be.

  <p>When thinking about the C-suite’s priorities, people tend to focus on growth, security, digital transformation or, more recently, keeping a remote workforce running. All of these aspects are important to keep the business profitable, remain at the forefront of innovation, maintain shareholder satisfaction and ensure that employees are safe, equipped and content. Yet, there is something that underpins every one of these priorities: digital trust. And without it, every area of the business would cease to function.</p>
<p>Digital trust is a concept no business leader can ignore today. With most of the world working online, digital trust is vital in order for CXOs to trust that employees are doing their jobs, that the workforce is keeping security threats at bay, and that trust is cultivated with customers.</p>
 The fundamentals of trust in an evolving cybersecurity landscape 
<p>Trust will always be intangible and requires belief in three key aspects: reliability, truth and ability. We need to have belief that someone or something will deliver on the promises made, can be relied on to be truthful, and is capable of what they set out to achieve in order for us to place our trust in it. The issue of digital trust has come to the fore for CXOs amidst the challenges presented by the pandemic in the last year, as we have shifted to a remote working structure.</p>
<p>In this context, it is even more vital that organisations are aware of which employees, partners and customers they can trust to access their data and systems. Vice versa, these employees, partners and customers must trust that an organisation can protect any personal data they share.</p>
<p>Effective security tools and policies, especially those focused on seamlessly managing the identities of users, help to drive stakeholder trust. And an organisation with stringent security in place can trust that each stakeholder only has as much access to business systems as required.&nbsp; This symbiotic online relationship between organisation and stakeholder is digital trust.</p>
 How organisations can cultivate digital trust through their security policies 
<p>Business and IT leaders must be transparent about the cybersecurity measures and policies they are implementing to foster trust and staff buy-in.</p>
<p>We have seen an increase in the number of cyberattacks during the lockdown period as malicious actors attempt to take advantage of the increased threat vectors. F5’s <a href="https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/2020-phishing-and-fraud-report" title="2020 Phishing and Fraud Report">2020 Phishing and Fraud Report</a> saw a 220% increase in phishing attacks during the pandemic compared to the yearly average.</p>
<p>Okta’s <a href="https://www.okta.com/uk/resources/whitepaper-the-digital-trust-index/" title="Digital Trust Index">Digital Trust Index</a> found that 34% admit to not knowing if their employer has done anything to protect them from cyberthreats, indicating that businesses need to do more to communicate and educate employees.</p>
<p>This is problematic for CXOs, because user uncertainty around cybersecurity measures puts the business at greater risk. If employees are unclear about what is and what isn’t protected by the organisation’s security platforms, they are unable to apply best practice online, so are less able to identify issues when they arise. CXOs must improve their communication with employees to ensure they are effectively educated on their organisation’s cybersecurity measures.</p>
 The importance of education 
<p>Security must always be the first layer of trust. For employers, partners and customers, it is vital they feel secure sharing their data. And for trust to be cultivated by organisations, education is crucial.</p>
<p>Amidst the need for better education, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly evolving, with new tricks and methods tried out frequently. CXOs have a responsibility to ensure that this education is a continuous process. Since the shift to mass remote work, many office workers have become more aware of phishing, data breaches and new risks such as deepfake fraud. But businesses must also ensure they are staying ahead of the game as much as they can in order to combat these new threats with new approaches, and engaging in ongoing conversations with employees while doing so.</p>
<p>In the enterprise, it begins with a Zero Trust approach focused on validating identity before trusting anyone in the digital realm. The ultimate strategy puts identity at the heart of digital security, and invokes risk-based access policies and continuous and adaptive authentication, meaning identity validation is required for user access to be granted. As enterprises move towards this, it is vital that users are kept afoot with the evolving nature of the cybersecurity policies in place. The growth in knowledge across all levels of the business will lead to improved understanding and a stronger belief in the reliability, truth and ability that together form the basis of digital trust. When this is applied effectively, this trust from employees, partners and customers will not only mitigate harm, but will ultimately drive loyalty, revenue and value for organisations. Whether they are aware of it or not, digital trust reinforces each priority on CXOs’ agendas, and will continue to grow in importance as we delve deeper into a digital world.</p>

<p>Covid 19 has impacted the way many businesses work today, and one of the key factors that changed for many of our clients at IDnow were reported spikes in remote verification. The pandemic impacted how we onboard users. The biggest question that came up was how do operators’ onboard players remotely and can IDnow handle the capacity of the volume spikes?</p>
<p>Since March 2020 Covid 19 not only transformed the world and how we operate, but also player behaviour. This is exactly the transition we have observed in online gambler behaviours. Data shows that the online market increase by 29% active users and 7% of players were made up of inactive accounts. What brought on this change?<br>
Businesses adapted very quickly to respond to the pandemic however there were some businesses that unfortunately suffered for not planning; and therefore, some operators were able to leverage this advantage more than others. There are clear differentiators between reactive and proactive business behaviours. Player behaviour changed as bets went up by 12% due to operators creating longer-lasting online slots i.e., longer than an hour.</p>
<p>In May 2020, operators who were active in regulated markets were instructed to perform extra checks including affordability checks, the prevention of reverse withdrawals, and restrictions on bonus offers which came into play eventually on October 31st, 2020.</p>
<p>In a webinar we held with Martin Lycka, SVP Compliance at GVC-Entain, he was able to share his views on responsible gambling:<br>
“Like any other market responsible gambling is critical to its long-term sustainability and this will be the case in Germany. Operators such as Entain and others have rolled out very sophisticated responsible gambling processes, policies and protocols.”</p>
<p>In the run-up to the planning for the Euro’s, there are many other factors that were considered from the end-user experience.</p>
 
 How to keep fans engaged while they are unable to physically attend matches at stadiums? 
 How to create a safe and engaging environment for supporters? 
 How to enable youth and amateurs to keep playing and enjoying football? 
 
<p>Euro 2021 football tournament is expecting a spike in volume by up to 5 to 10 times more than usual. The excitement is visible as the absence of last year’s Grand National also had a clear impact, with only the virtual race running in 2020.<br>
Grand national this year broke records shared from sportsbook apps and across exchanges, with £92.8m traded on the big race, which made up 71% of the £131m bets across the three-day Festival. This represented a 28% increase from 2019.<br>
Cheltenham Festival broke records with £210m in total betting volume; with more bettors at home, the online betting industry is experiencing spikes more than ever before.</p>
<p>Sports has had major setbacks by pausing plans for the partial return of fans to stadiums on the 1st of October 2020 and this due to the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases. It will continue to add growing fears that clubs could go out of business due to potent spikes, and we might continue to see this with the ease of lockdown.</p>
<p>IDnow is prepping for the Euro’s focusing on the user experience and rising cases of fraud. From an operator’s perspective, how does IDnow ensure that players are verified satisfactorily while maintaining the operator’s player conversions? There was a lot of effort made by gambling operators to stay on top of constant changes in online gambling regulations with new guidelines. They have shared that KYC providers like IDnow are seen as a positive influence and KYC facilitator.</p>
<p>IDnow is an identity verification company and has been serving customers with their compliance requirements in some of the most heavily regulated markets with a platform of secure and efficient products. IDnow has seen processes move forward by developing close relationships in Germany with the youth protection ministry. We have worked diligently to ensure our products are compliant with KYC requirements.<br>
Players also can take comfort in knowing that appropriate measure are being put in place for their safety.</p>

   Reactive APIs are a powerful way to handle and serve large amounts of data and large numbers of requests in a web application. They rely on a “server-side event” model in which the client (e.g. your browser) subscribes to “events” on the server, and the server “pushes” events to the client as they become available.

  <p>Reactive APIs are a powerful way to handle and serve large amounts of data and large numbers of requests in a web application. They rely on a “server-side event” model in which the client (e.g. your browser) subscribes to “events” on the server, and the server “pushes” events to the client as they become available.</p>

<p>For simple CRUD applications this is not very useful. However, in situations with millions of “subscribers” it can offer improved performance versus the standard “request-response” paradigm.</p>

<p>Spring Boot 2.0 provided reactive web technology by integrating with <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/reactive-rest-service/">WebFlux</a>, a framework built on top of <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. Using WebFlux you can create reactive APIs easily in Spring Boot. However, because most Spring Boot applications are CRUD-ish and are backed by relational databases, reactive APIs may not provide much benefit because the underlying database transactions (querying, updating, etc) are synchronous/blocking.</p>

 What is R2DBC? 

<p><a href="https://r2dbc.io/">R2DBC</a> is an API which provides reactive, non-blocking APIs for relational databases. Using this, you can have your reactive APIs in Spring Boot read and write information to the database in a reactive/asynchronous way.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you will develop a Spring Boot application that:</p>
 
   Communicates with an H2 database using R2DBC 
   Integrates with Okta for security using OAuth 2.0 
   Serves reactive streams of data to a secured web page 
 

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<p>Prerequisites: <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Java 11</a></p>

 Create a Spring Boot Project with R2DBC 

<p>Click <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.5.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.dev&amp;artifactId=okta-r2dbc&amp;name=okta-r2dbc&amp;description=Spring%20Boot%20App%20for%20Okta%20%2B%20R2DBC&amp;packageName=com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc&amp;dependencies=lombok,data-jpa,data-r2dbc,webflux,okta,h2">this link</a> or go to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and select the following options in your browser:</p>

 
   Project: <code>Maven Project</code> 
   Language: <code>Java</code> 
   Spring Boot: <code>2.4.5</code> 
 

<p>Under Project Metadata, set the values to the following:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.dev</code> 
   Artifact: <code>okta-r2dbc</code> 
   Name: <code>okta-r2dbc</code> 
   Description: Spring Boot App for Okta + R2DBC 
   Package: <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc</code> 
   Packaging: <code>Jar</code> 
   Java: <code>11</code> 
 

<p>Select the following dependencies:</p>

 
   Spring Data JPA 
   Spring Data R2DBC 
   Spring Reactive Web 
   Okta 
   H2 Database 
   Lombok 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Generate to download the project files. Unzip the file and import the project files into your favorite IDE.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect Application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



 Configure and Secure Your Reactive Spring Boot Application 

<p>Open your IDE and edit your application’s configuration file at <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://MY_OKTA_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId=CLIENT_ID
okta.oauth2.clientSecret=CLIENT_SECRET

spring.data.r2dbc.repositories.enabled=true
spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:h2:mem://./testdb
</code>   

<p>Make sure <code>MY_OKTA_DOMAIN</code>, <code>CLIENT_ID</code>, and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> are replaced with values from the Okta CLI.</p>

<p>Open the Java class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add the <code>@EnableWebFlux</code> and <code>@EnableR2dbcRepositories</code> annotations to the main class:</p>

   <code>@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>@EnableWebFlux</code> enables the reactive API, and <code>@EnableR2dbcRepositories</code> configures the application to use reactive database repositories via R2DBC.</p>

<p>Create the persistent entity representing an application user:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;

@Data
public class UserEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;
    private String email;
    private String name;
}
</code>   

<p>Define a reactive <code>R2dbcRepository</code> to manage this user entity:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

import org.springframework.data.r2dbc.repository.R2dbcRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends R2dbcRepository&lt;UserEntity, Long&gt; {
    Flux&lt;UserEntity&gt; findByEmail(String email);
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>R2dbcRepository</code> interface abstracts away much of the complexity of managing reactive database connections, but some major differences between this and the non-reactive <code>JpaRepository</code> should be noted:</p>
 
   Methods like <code>findById()</code> which return one entity will instead return a <code>Mono&lt;&gt;</code> object. 
   Methods like <code>findAll()</code> which return lists of entities will instead return a <code>Flux&lt;&gt;</code> object. 
 

<p>A thorough explanation of these reactive types is outside the scope of this tutorial. For a more thorough introduction you can check out the official documentation <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono">here</a>. For now it is enough to know that these reactive types represent data that is changing or not-yet-whole, and it is the responsibility of the caller to “react” to the results as they become available.</p>

<p>Next you will create an OAuth-enabled <code>UserDetailsService</code> which will manage our user authentication and security with OAuth 2.0. Create a file at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain.UserDetails</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain;

// imports omitted

public class UserDetails implements OidcUser {

    private final String email;
    private final OidcIdToken oidcIdToken;
    private final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    private final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; attributes = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

    public UserDetails(String email, OidcUserRequest oidcUserRequest) {
        this.email = email;
        this.claims.putAll(oidcUserRequest.getIdToken().getClaims());
        this.attributes.putAll(oidcUserRequest.getClientRegistration().getProviderDetails().getConfigurationMetadata());
        this.oidcIdToken = oidcUserRequest.getIdToken();
    }

    @Override
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getClaims() {
        return new HashMap&lt;&gt;(claims);
    }

    @Override
    public OidcUserInfo getUserInfo() {
        return new OidcUserInfo(getClaims());
    }

    @Override
    public OidcIdToken getIdToken() {
        return oidcIdToken;
    }

    @Override
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getAttributes() {
        return new HashMap&lt;&gt;(attributes);
    }

    @Override
    public Collection&lt;? extends GrantedAuthority&gt; getAuthorities() {
        return Collections.singletonList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("USER"));
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return email;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This <code>OidcUser</code> object represents the authenticated user and loads user information from the various claims provided by the OAuth identity provider.</p>

<p>Create the user service at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain.DbUserService</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain;

// imports omitted

import java.util.Map;

public class DbUserService implements OAuth2UserService&lt;OidcUserRequest, OidcUser&gt;, ReactiveUserDetailsService {
    private static final String CLAIM_NAME = "name";
    private static final String CLAIM_EMAIL = "email";

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public DbUserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public OidcUser loadUser(OidcUserRequest oidcUserRequest) throws OAuth2AuthenticationException {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; metadata = oidcUserRequest.getIdToken().getClaims();
        String email = (String) metadata.get(CLAIM_EMAIL);
        String name = (String) metadata.get(CLAIM_NAME);

        Flux&lt;UserEntity&gt; userLookup = userRepository.findByEmail(email);
        UserEntity userEntity = userLookup.blockFirst();

        if (userEntity == null) {
            userEntity = new UserEntity();
            userEntity.setEmail(email);
        }

        userEntity.setName(name);
        userEntity = userRepository.save(userEntity).block();

        return new UserDetails(userEntity.getEmail(), oidcUserRequest);
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails&gt; findByUsername(String username) {
        return null; // not used
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>DbUserService</code> handles requests from OAuth 2.0 to automatically load users into the database. The user’s information will be created or updated on each login via the reactive connections provided by <code>UserRepository</code>.</p>

<p>Secure the application by creating a configuration file at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.config.SecurityConfig</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.config;

// imports omitted

@EnableWebFluxSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public ReactiveUserDetailsService userDetailsService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        return new DbUserService(userRepository);
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain configure(ServerHttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeExchange()
            .pathMatchers("/", "/index").permitAll()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2Login()
            .authenticationSuccessHandler(new RedirectServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler("/protected"))
            .and().build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>@EnableWebFluxSecurity</code> annotation secures the application according to the settings defined in <code>configure()</code>. There are some small differences between this and the normal security configuration classes usually seen in non-reactive Spring Boot apps, but it should appear familiar. To note:</p>
 
   The home page (<code>/</code> and <code>/index</code>) is exposed and not protected by authentication. 
   All other requests/pages are protected 
   OAuth 2.0 login behavior is enabled by <code>.oauth2Login()</code> 
   After a successful OAuth 2.0 login, the user is redirected to a protected page: <code>/protected</code>. 
 

<p>Now to create the web pages. Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/pages/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Home&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is the main page for the application and does not require authentication to access. Next create a file at <code>src/main/resources/pages/protected.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Protected&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Okta login successful!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>For serving these pages with WebFlux you will create an application router that maps HTTP requests to resources in the codebase.</p>

<p>Create a Java class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.ApplicationRouter</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@Configuration
public class ApplicationRouter {

    // (1)
    @Value("classpath:pages/index.html")
    private Resource indexHtml;

    // (2)
    @Value("classpath:pages/protected.html")
    private Resource protectedHtml;

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction&lt;ServerResponse&gt; route() {
        return RouterFunctions
            // (3)
            .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/index"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))

            // (4)
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/protected"), request -&gt; pageResponse(protectedHtml));
    }

    private static Mono&lt;ServerResponse&gt; pageResponse(Resource page) {
        return ServerResponse
            .ok()
            .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_HTML) // (5)
            .body(DataBufferUtils.read(page, new DefaultDataBufferFactory(), 4096), DataBuffer.class);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In this class you can see the following:</p>
 
   The page resources created above are injected as <code>Resource</code> objects at (1) and (2). 
   A mapping to the unprotected <code>index.html</code> page is defined in (3). 
   A mapping to the protected <code>protected.html</code> page is defined in (4). 
   (5) When creating the server response (which is a reactive <code>Mono</code>), the <code>TEXT_HTML</code> content type is specified. This makes sure your browser renders the content as an HTML page and not plain text. 
 

<p>One more step is necessary to get the application running. R2DBC does not automatically generate the database schema, so you must do it yourself.</p>

<p>Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/schema.sql</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>CREATE TABLE USER_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR2,
    name VARCHAR2
);
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>@Bean</code> which will automatically detect and execute this script on startup. Open your main application class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add a <code>ConnectionFactoryInitializer</code> bean:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean // added
    public ConnectionFactoryInitializer connectionFactoryInitializer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        ConnectionFactoryInitializer initializer = new ConnectionFactoryInitializer();
        initializer.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        initializer.setDatabasePopulator(new ResourceDatabasePopulator(new ClassPathResource("schema.sql")));
        return initializer;
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>initializer.setDatabasePopulator()</code> will pick up the <code>schema.sql</code> file and execute it to create the <code>user_entity</code> table on startup.</p>

<p>Open your command line tool and run the application:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/okta-r2dbc-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and you should see the unprotected index page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/protected</code>. You should be prompted to log in with Okta, and after successfully authenticating returned to the protected page:</p>

<p></p>

 Stream Data to a Webpage Using R2DBC 

<p>You’ve successfully implemented R2DBC in your Spring Boot application, but the behavior is still non-reactive: querying and saving users during authentication is still a synchronous, blocking process. Now you will implement a non-blocking API endpoint which reads from the database using reactive techniques.</p>

<p>Create a persistence entity at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database.HeartbeatEntity</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

// imports omitted

public class HeartbeatEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;

    private Long timestamp;
    private String username;
    private String text;

    // getters and setters omitted
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>@Repository</code> for this entity at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database.HeartbeatRepository</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

@Repository
public interface HeartbeatRepository extends R2dbcRepository&lt;HeartbeatEntity, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Open the initialization SQL file at <code>src/main/resources/schema.sql</code> and add the table definition for <code>HEARTBEAT_ENTITY</code> so it looks like this:</p>

   <code>CREATE TABLE USER_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR2,
    name VARCHAR2
);

CREATE TABLE HEARTBEAT_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR2 NOT NULL,
    text VARCHAR2
);
</code>   

<p>The database model for <code>Heartbeats</code> is complete, now you’ll create:</p>
 
   A service to generate and save heartbeats to the database 
   An HTTP endpoint routing to serve a reactive stream of heartbeats 
   Simple JavaScript to display the stream on a web page 
 

<p>Create the heartbeat service at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.service.HeartbeatService</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.service;

// imports omitted

@Service
public class HeartbeatService {
    private final HeartbeatRepository heartbeatRepository;

    @Autowired
    public HeartbeatService(HeartbeatRepository heartbeatRepository) {
        this.heartbeatRepository = heartbeatRepository;
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000) // 1 second
    public void create() {
        HeartbeatEntity heartbeatEntity = new HeartbeatEntity();
        heartbeatEntity.setTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        heartbeatEntity.setText(randomString());
        heartbeatEntity.setUsername("system");
        heartbeatRepository.save(heartbeatEntity)
                .log()
                .then()
                .subscribe();
    }

    private static String randomString() {
        int lower = 'A';
        int upper = 'Z';

        return IntStream.range(0, 10)
                .mapToObj(i -&gt; {
                    double range = upper-lower;
                    char charIdx = ((char)(lower + (range * Math.random())));
                    return new String(new char[]{charIdx});
                })
                .collect(Collectors.joining());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>create()</code> method is marked with Spring Boot’s <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation, which will cause the method to be called asynchronously on a schedule you define. Specifying <code>fixedRate = 1000</code> means the method will execute every 1000 milliseconds (i.e. one second).</p>

<p>To enable scheduling, you must also add the <code>@EnableScheduling</code> annotation to a configuration class. Open the main application class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add it:</p>

   <code>@EnableScheduling // &lt;-- added
@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }

    // other code omitted
}
</code>   

<p>Open your application router at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.ApplicationRouter</code> and modify the <code>route()</code> method to add a routing for <code>/heartbeats</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@Configuration
public class ApplicationRouter {

    // other code omitted

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction&lt;ServerResponse&gt; route() {
        return RouterFunctions
            .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/index"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/protected"), request -&gt; pageResponse(protectedHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/heartbeats"), request -&gt; {
                Flux&lt;Long&gt; interval = Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
                Flux&lt;HeartbeatEntity&gt; heartbeatEntityFlux = heartbeatRepository.findAll();
                Flux&lt;HeartbeatEntity&gt; zipped = Flux.zip(heartbeatEntityFlux, interval, (key, value) -&gt; key);

                return ServerResponse
                    .ok()
                    .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM)
                    .body(zipped, HeartbeatEntity.class);
            });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Within the <code>/heartbeats</code> routing you are:</p>
 
   Defining a <code>Flux</code> named <code>interval</code> which will publish a <code>Long</code> object every second (the value of the <code>Long</code> is not important here, just that it publishes every second) 
   Defining <code>heartbeatEntityFlux</code> which is a <code>Flux</code> of all <code>HeartbeatEntities</code> in the database 
   Creating a “zipped” <code>Flux</code> which interpolates items from the two <code>Flux</code>. An item will be published from <code>interval</code>, and then one from <code>heartbeatEntityFlux</code>, and then one from <code>interval</code>, etc. 
   Returning this stream with a <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>text/event-stream</code> 
 

<p>Open the protected HTML page at <code>src/main/resources/pages/protected.html</code> and modify it:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Protected&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        $(function() {
            var cnx = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/heartbeats');
            cnx.onmessage = function (e) {
                var data = JSON.parse(e.data);
                var htmlText = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.id+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.timestamp+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.text+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
                $( "#heartbeatTable &gt; tbody" ).append(htmlText);
            };
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Okta login successful!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heartbeats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table id="heartbeatTable"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Timestamp&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The JavaScript function:</p>
 
   Opens a streaming connection with the <code>/heartbeats</code> endpoint defined above 
   Creates an HTML table row whenever new data is received from the stream 
   Appends that table row to the body of <code>heartbeatTable</code> 
 

<p>Start the application again:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/okta-r2dbc-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/protected</code>. When the page loads you should see a streaming, constantly updating list of heartbeats.</p>

 Introduction &amp; Digital Trust Challenges 
<p>Mathieu: I wanted to start the conversation today, John, by making the statement that achieving digital trust is difficult. Some background to this, and showing in trends overall, is that businesses, governments, and organizations, are adopting digital mediums to interact with their customers, their employees, their vendors, and their citizens. Everyone’s on a digital transformation journey today. Secondly, people are demanding more privacy in all their activities nowadays, and I think we’re seeing the best signals for this coming from the largest companies in the world. Apple is a very good example of this; they’re using privacy as a feature inside of their marketing, but they’re implementing capabilities inside of their operating system and their ecosystem to really push user-centric consent and privacy. At the same time, the laws around privacy are changing rapidly, and everyone’s trying to adapt to these. That brings us around again to the statement I started off with; achieving digital trust is difficult. I think people realize it’s tough to achieve today, and there is a great deal of fraudulent behaviour and other issues that seem to get in the way of people conducting businesses online.</p>
<p>This takes us to where we are today, in the internet era where there is a trust gap. To illustrate my comment about fraudulent behaviour; a very straightforward example of this that occurs frequently is phishing attacks that happen online. It’s quite easy for someone to gain access to my email address, which is a central point for me to interact with all sorts of different organizations. It’s very easy for someone who gains access to that to reset my passwords for various accounts that I have all over the place. Once they’ve reset my password, then they are able to take over my account. This happens every day, because it’s very easy for people to impersonate other people on the internet. That’s one side of it, and then there’s another side; there are just tons of things that aren’t possible to do on the internet today at all. When we start talking about more high-value, high-risk transactions, these are situations that are the most challenging. Most of the value that’s generated out of the internet today comes from advertising or e-commerce, but high-value high-risk transactions still rely on this real-world or paper credential era. As we’re looking to move from the current internet era towards this new era of digital trust, I think it would be helpful if you were able to give an overview of how we got here. Perhaps we can take a step back, before the internet era, and discuss the paper credential era — I think that sets a good framework for where we’re going with these new digital trust models.</p>
<p>John: Sure. Thanks for that introduction, Mathieu; it’s good to be here. That’s a lot of material to work with there, so I’ll give it a crack.</p>
<p>First, we’re talking about digital trust and trust in general. That’s a very high-level idea, so let’s break that down a little bit. When we talk about trust, generally speaking, we’re going to focus on a relationship between two parties. For example, perhaps between me and another individual like you; or between me and a business that I’m going to do something with, or a business to a business. My full-time job is with the province of British Columbia, and there’s a trust model between the government and its citizens. In all of these cases, I’m talking about a relationship between two parties. The determination of trust is a combination of things; do I have some type of method of conveying trust between those two parties in the context of a transaction, and do I have an understanding of why I would trust that other party?</p>
<p>In the case of a business to a business transaction, we tend to develop relationships through human interaction. We find each other’s business, we’re going to become a supplier or a customer, and then we tend to have a mechanism by which we formalize that relationship. We call it a contract, and contracts are everywhere. That’s one of the key mechanisms we have in society for establishing a formal relationship, and defining the boundaries of that relationship. If somebody goes outside of those boundaries, it’s governed by the contract. And, what is the contract governed by? Well, it’s governed by law, that has been set forth by a democratically elected society, in our case. Those laws set out the boundaries for what can happen between businesses, between people and businesses, and between governments and people, and governments and businesses. That is the nature of our society right now.</p>
<p>Essentially, personal identity is given to you by the government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are. Rather, the fact that you can say that your name is John Jordan, and your age and so forth; those attributes or characteristics of you are attested to by the government, based on an administrative process of registration and their authority to manage that. In the same way for businesses, we have business registries, and they have a process for creating legal entities. It is these sources of truth, or these administrative authorities, which allow us to enter into contracts. We know who that party is, and we have physical evidence of this through an identity document, such as the BC services card, which we commonly call a driver’s license. Or, contracts such as the legal contracts that are drawn up and can be referenced, like articles of incorporation and so forth.</p>
<p>Back before these things we call computers were around, it was difficult to create or recreate these documents, because printing presses were big and expensive, and there were techniques that could be deployed by them to prevent fraudulent copies of these things. Because things happened at paper speed, the risks were relatively low in terms of the wide-scale ability to defraud.</p>
<p>So, that’s in a way the foundation of our society: we have Acts; those Acts create powers in the government to identify persons, including humans and legal entities, and the rules by which those entities can interact. We formalize those rules and contracts, and that’s how the world effectively operates, in a lot of ways. However, now in the era of the web, we don’t have a way to convey that architecture into the web. In turn, the web has introduced a new actor, that we don’t have an equivalent for in the physical world. On the web, we have this idea of ‘login’; there’s an intermediary between me and another person, or between me and the business I’m trying to do something with, and so forth. This intermediary has no defined role in any of our legal structures; there’s no such thing as ‘the login service’ in the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia. Likewise, in the Freedom of Information and Personal Protection Act, there’s no concept of ‘login’; there are only ‘persons.’ Because we have this login service, there’s a sort of ‘middle person’ in between our relationships, which has some very significant consequences.</p>
<p>One of the consequences is that it means that none of my relationships online are confidential: meaning that they’re not known only between me and the party I’m trying to interact with. If I go to the gym, or I go to rent a car, or I go to the doctor or the lawyer or whatever, that interaction that happens is private. It’s not known, generally speaking, by any other entity, including the government. If all of my relationships were known, then we would be very unhappy — we call that surveillance, and that would be an erosion of our privacy.</p>
<p>As a result, we don’t even have the conditions on the web for privacy. By the very architectural structure of it, there must be a login service in order for me to connect to another party. By definition, that means it’s not confidential. Often, the information or data that I exchange with that other party is subject to loss; that other party I’m talking to gathers a lot of information about me, and if they don’t protect it well, it can be stolen. Then, the really bad side effect occurs, which is that personal information that has been stolen about me can be replayed. It can be used by a malicious third party that has gained access to it through possibly poor stewardship of it by the business that I did business with, or worse; they sell it. A bad actor can replay that information and pretend to be me, and we call that identity theft. I think I’ve outlined here the two big, unforeseen consequences of the login architecture of the web, which is that a) none of my relationships are confidential and b) the data that is exchanged through that non-confidential interaction can be lost and replayed without my permission and knowledge, and therefore I can be impersonated.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I covered all of your domains, but to me, these are the fundamental flaws. It’s not as if that concern was foreseen 20 or 30 years ago; it was simply the way we built computer systems. Computer systems were expensive, and we needed a way to share them. The way to share them was to provide access to that computer system, which we accomplished through a new ceremony or ritual called login. To use a funny word, there’s no analogue of that digital ritual in the physical analog world. So, this is where we find ourselves, in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s so much to unpack there. I love the focus on relationships over and over again between two parties. When you think about login being this new party that shows up in the middle there; at the end of the day, there’s a reason why it showed up — to try to make things more secure or make it actually happen. However, they inherently ended up removing value from the system altogether. It seems as if there’s a back and forth in technologies, where things go from distributed, to centralized, to back to distributed. It feels as though in the real world, or in the paper credential era, it’s really a distributed way of doing things. There’s nothing centrally stored: everyone has their credential or their ID, and they use it how they wish, with the relationships that they interact with. Whereas, in this internet era, you lost that direct connection or direct relationship with the entities that you were interfacing with.</p>
 The Credential Trust Triangle &amp; The Role of Trust over IP 
<p>Mathieu: People are always curious about this when they’re looking to move into this next phase — let’s call it the digital trust phase. They play inside of the model, and the model has been represented in different ways. The one that’s gotten the most traction, is this <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/WP0010-toip-foundation-whitepaper/trust/vcred_trust_triangle/">Credential Trust Triangle</a>. There’s another model which looks like a diamond, so I could call it the Credentialed Trust Diamond, which is otherwise known as the Government’s Trust Triangle. Is that type of model similar to the model that existed in the paper credential era? How is this model being replicated or ingested into this new digital trust era?</p>
<p>John: I discovered the Trust Triangle, as we call it, in around 2017. As we started to understand it, we said, “But, this is how we do things already in the real world.” Sometimes, I talk about, “Let’s just forget this really awful nightmare of the last 40 years of computing and remember how we did it back in the old days, when we developed relationships with our friends, our business partners and so forth, and we had the underpinning of the government.” You know, the government is there; we don’t always know it or acknowledge it, but I described how the government underpins the ability for us to establish these trusted relationships. We can go back to that now.</p>
<p>When we talk about the trust triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today. We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions. To give an example: let’s use the business registries because I’ve been doing a lot of work with BC Registries over the years. Originally, we would say that BC Registries is going to be a Verifier. It’s going to take on the Verifier role; you’re going to show up at BC Registry’s door, and you’re going to say, “I’d like to incorporate a business.” They say, “Great, tell me some things about yourself, so that I can understand who I’m doing business or working with. And then, what is it you want to do?”</p>
<p>They’re verifying this information. They have a business process to approve it, and when they approve it, they become an Issuer. What they issue to you, are your Articles of Incorporation and perhaps other documents (I don’t dive into the super gory details of the corporation). The ultimate expression of your successful administrative act of creating a corporation is your Articles of Incorporation. You would take those Articles of Incorporation; you might go down to the bank and open a bank account with them, using proof of your identity, proof of your Articles of Incorporation, and proof of you being an officer in that company. At that point, the bank has been acting as a Verifier, and then they issued you a bank account. All the while, you as the individual, and you as the individual representing the corporation, are what’s called the Holder.</p>
<p>So, the Holder is the person or entity that receives things from Issuers, and presents them to Verifiers. This is extremely common. As soon as you put the jargon aside, you realize that this is exactly what happens in any trusted interaction — all of them. The fact that you play all three roles; it depends on where you are in a particular process what role you might be playing. You might not always play all three, but you’re likely going to play a couple of them. That’s the way we’ve always organized things, and it has simply taken a while for the computing world to come to a place where we recognized that there is a way to replicate that set of relationships using digital technology.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the role of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip/">Trust over IP Foundation</a> is trying to do, which is to introduce a couple of things. One is to bring a little more structure to the set of technical capabilities that allow us to do this, and the second, (and this is really a key differentiator of the Trust over IP Foundation mission) is that it recognizes that there are actually two parts to trust. There’s the technical or mechanical aspect of trust, which I referred to earlier as contracts. Those are technical documents, that are highly structured and understood and recognized by law, and in the paper physical world. And then, there’s a set of governing authorities and aspects that make that contract enforceable. That’s why I talked about the Business Corporations Act — it’ll be named different things in different jurisdictions, but it’s always there. That’s exactly the legal framework, under which a contract is even valid. That’s what makes it possible to have a corporation, or a non-profit society, or different legal entities that can be recognized in a court and able to enter into agreements, and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>That’s the governance framework. In fact, in the digital world, it’s the same. It’s just that we have no way, digitally, of representing a contract, or an agreement, or even a relationship, in some legally recognizable way. That isn’t something that was foreseen by the technical model of the web, so yeah, that’s the mission of the Trust over IP Foundation. The uniqueness of it, is this bringing together of the business/legal aspects, combined with the technical aspects, that allow us to create the conditions for trusted digital relationships. We hope that if there’s broad adoption of this, the big vision is that if parties choose to have any contractual relationship possible, using the internet as the communications mechanism and essentially replacing the web model, then there would be no logins. Relationships will be peer-to-peer, and there would be trusted interactions between those peers. Ideally, privacy laws and other laws would recognize those interactions as equivalent to what we have today in the physical world. Contracts would be upheld, and all the correct legal terms would be able to be upheld in the court systems of your jurisdiction. It’s a big vision, but I think that’s where we want to go. I think that would be a fair representation of the goals of the members.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I would agree with that. Having had many interactions with several dedicated and smart members of the Trust over IP, I think that that’s everyone’s goal. The internet has done such incredible things and created so much value. But now, to take it to that next step; it’s about creating this other layer that gives us this digital trust. You’ve described perfectly the trust triangle model of the Issuer, Holder, and Verifier, where today, the Verifier in scenarios is often referred to as the ‘Relying Party.’ In that model, they’re relying on data from someone. Whereas, today, they don’t have to rely on anything specific. Whatever they’re given at the point of a transaction can be verified against its source. It can be verified that it’s reliable, that it’s authentic, and its provenance; there are transparency features with this too. All of this is made possible, and the whole model fits within the dual stack architecture that you just described. That is, the governance and the technical layers, where you have the business, the legal, and the tech, on the technical side.</p>
<p>To finish off this dialogue, John; right after this discussion, we’re going to have some working group leads have a conversation with us, to talk a little more about the different working groups and different layers within the dual-stack architecture. Would you mind giving listeners of the podcast, who might not be familiar with this, what are these four layers? How do they play together? And, why do they matter so much in this model?</p>
 The Role of Working Groups in the Community 
<p>John: Sure. As I mentioned, the idea of the Trust over IP model or stack is that it has two sides. One side is concerned with the technical means by which to establish trusted digital relationships. That is, peer-to-peer connections, with protocols that can work through those peer-to-peer connections. In particular, protocols that allow for what we call <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">verifiable credentials</a> to be issued to Holders, and for Verifiers to be able to request from Holders cryptographically protected proofs that they’re holding these credentials, and sharing the data that’s held with them under the control of the Holder.</p>
<p>The other side is the governance side, which says that the services and means by which these technical capabilities are offered actually have a set of rules and actors behind them, that you can inspect. You can decide if you like how they’re operated, and therefore, make a determination about their trustworthiness. The working groups are structured in similar fashions: we have working groups who are focused on the technical stack, and we have working groups concerned with the governance stack.</p>
<p>Essentially, the first set of working groups looked at creating a community of practice around how we create governance artifacts, and decided to have a community of practice around how we create technical artifacts. Then it was decided to have a group where we understand what it would take if we want to put these things into practice. So, we have the Governance Stack working group, and the Technology Stack working group, both of which are more concerned with creating the generalized tools, documents, standards, and so forth. And then, we have the Ecosystem Governance working group, and the Utility Governance working group. I might be messing up the names; I apologize, they’re not in front of me right now.</p>
<p>However, these are communities of practice, where practitioners come together and share their expertise and their experiences so that they can help others create new ones, faster and better, with less friction. We can learn from each other, and it’s been just about a year that we’ve been together. I think the real value that we have right now in Trust over IP, is this idea that there’s a community of practitioners out there who are learning together, sharing with each other, and creating outcomes. Whether it’s implementation guides, or blueprints, or other kinds of knowledge-based artifacts, they can codify how to create digital ecosystems or communities, where there’s a common set of trust interactions that they want to be able to describe to their members.</p>
<p>I think that is really an important part of the Trust over IP organization, and is something that’s new and different. What I’m really happy about, and what I think is going to be our area of growth, is that we are bringing people into this world who would never have been involved in the more technical communities out there. We have organizations, that are not technology-based organizations. They obviously use technology, and they recognize the importance of trusted digital relationships to their business. They want to learn more and participate in the growth of that, and they see it as a competitive advantage to their businesses, to be able to understand how to do that. I think that’s clearly the direction that we want to continue; to keep growing that community. And, more and more, helping others understand why it’s important that they have <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">trusted digital relationships with their customers</a>, with their citizens, and with their friends and family, for that matter.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think it’s incredible to see the number of ecosystems that have been popping up over the past year. New ones that are popping up, as well as existing ecosystems, are coming into the Trust over IP for guidance on how to build with digital trust in the core of their <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">digital transformation strategy</a>. I think it’s been over the past year since the Trust over IP has been active; the popularity around verifiable credentials is growing like crazy. I think everyone is interested in it.</p>
<p>Once people get their beaks wet a little bit with verifiable credentials, they begin to be aware of all of the other activity that should be taken seriously: the governance pieces that we’re talking about at the core, and the peer-to-peer communication channels that totally disrupt the way we do things via APIs today. Once people start realizing this stuff, they begin to see the value beyond the simple economic efficiencies, or the checkbox compliance stuff that people use these tools for, today.</p>
<p>The last comment is that I really echo your thoughts of the community. The community is strong; it’s vibrant, and it’s growing. You and everyone else have done a fantastic job of bringing these people together. As you alluded to, it’s so interesting to see people from different areas that you would never talk to in your day-to-day life, but you’re able to learn from them. The power of these open communities, is that you could build on top of what’s happening, in order to really leverage the learnings and the failures of other projects, and build on top of that experience. I think in this digital age, or in the age of digitally native people and products, the value ultimately comes from community. Whoever has the strongest communities is going to create the strongest digital value. So, I love how the Trust over IP is set up to really push this forward. A huge thank you, John, for what you have done to move this forward. It’s incredible to see the community growing around this.</p>
<p>John: Well, thanks, and really it’s the members that do this, so thank you for this as one of our members. To all the other members who are working hard and well, I look forward to the next year and seeing where it goes.</p>
 Introduction to Working Group Leads 
<p>Mathieu: Hey guys, thanks for doing this. Some of you may be new to the audience listening to this, and some of you have been on existing podcasts before. What I wanted to do today with each one of you is to have you give a brief introduction on yourself; your background, what expertise you bring to the Trust over IP, and what interested you in the Trust over IP, to begin with. Let’s start with a newcomer to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7EbSvsNpYPKK1WVAXANGWo">podcast</a>; I’ll throw it over to Karl; if you want to open it up, Karl? </p>
<p>Karl: Thanks, Mathieu. My name is Karl Kneis; I’m the COO of idRamp. Our background is in building enterprise ecosystems, solving complex identity problems, and service delivery for multinationals. Our interest in Trust over IP, particularly, was based on our experience working with corporations and business organizations solving ecosystem development problems. We find that the need for repeatable design patterns and open source standardized frameworks helps our customers save time and money. These features simplify adoption of the new <a href="https://northernblock.io/">technology around verifiable credentials</a>, so Trust over IP was very much a natural fit for idRamp. We joined up as founding members, and I’ve been working on hosting the Ecosystem Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you, Karl; we’ll get to the Ecosystem Foundry in a few minutes. Maybe I’ll shoot it over to someone who’s participating in another foundry working group; André Kudra. André, you’ve been on the podcast before, talking about identity and access management, and how verifiable credentials and the Trust over IP stack could be used for those use cases. I know Karl is familiar with what you guys do as well, but, André, would you mind giving a brief introduction for any newcomers, on yourself, your expertise, and what brought you to the Trust over IP?</p>
<p>André: Absolutely, Mathieu, thank you for the opportunity to be here again. My name is André Kudra; I’m the CIO of Esatus AG in my day job. In my night and weekend job, I fill various roles in SSI community groups. I’m a trustee of the Sovrin Foundation, and my company Esatus is a founding and steering member of Trust over IP. I am also a board member of the Teletrust IT Security Association in Germany, with more than 340 members. I try to promote Self-sovereign Identity everywhere in these groups. Since 2015, when we first ran into SSI, I saw that this is the way ahead. Last year, when the community convened to form Trust over IP as the organization that will deliver the missing trust layer in the network world, we said, “Well, we absolutely have to be part of this group, and we have to be part of the community in this new foundation, Trust over IP.” From the European perspective, since we are based in Germany, we want to bring the European angle into the works. Since the beginning, I’ve proudly been serving on the steering committee and as the co-chair of the Utility Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you, André; it’s fantastic to have you back on here. Now, I’ll throw it over to Scott. Would you mind giving a brief introduction on yourself and what brought you to the Trust over IP?</p>
<p>Scott: Thanks, Mathieu. I’m Scott Perry; I’m an auditor in the identity and cybersecurity space, and I’ve been doing that for my whole career. I became very focused on the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) area about 15 years ago, when I was working with the US Federal PKI. We were creating standards around how you can interoperate identity credentials in that ecosystem. I am also a licensed WebTrust Auditor and a player in that ecosystem, where you exchange secure certificates that get attached to websites. So, I have worked with several different governance authorities. I was seeking fairness by actually participating in the rules that are established between interoperable trust. I got involved in the verifiable credentials in the SSI space about five years ago, working to establish the governance framework for the Sovrin Foundation. I have architected the Trust Assurance Framework for Sovrin as well. I’m a co-chair of the Trust over IP Governance Stack working group, and it’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, Scott. Last but not least; someone who’s been on the podcast before, with quite a popular episode. Paul, a lot of people are interested in what you’re bringing to the community, but for those who don’t know you: would you mind giving a brief introduction on yourself and what brought you to the Trust over IP community?</p>
<p>Paul: Sure. I’m Paul Knowles; I’m the head of the Advisory Council of the Human Colossus Foundation. At the foundation, we have combined expertise in three synergistic domains; decentralized authentication, decentralized semantics, and decentralized governance. We sit at the centroid point of those domains. My background is with clinical trial data management and statistical analysis, and in that domain, they have 25 years of very rich semantic experience. At Trust over IP, when it was first developed, there wasn’t a space specifically for semantics; at Trust over IP, they work with a dual stack model of governance versus technology, which doesn’t mention semantics at all. So, I approached the leadership group and suggested, “Why don’t we set up a semantics group so that we can talk about how data can geometrically and semantically fit together?” This is something you need to do for good machine learning, and analytics, and stuff. At Trust over IP, I’m the convener of the Inputs and Semantics working group. The Input side is more about authentication, and the Semantics side is more about deterministic semantics. I’m happy to be here and looking forward to the chat.</p>
 Trust over IP – Working Groups Overview 
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; What I’d like to do now, is jump into the day-to-day of what’s happening inside of the Trust over IP. There are tons of activities happening throughout various working groups within the Foundation. For background; when the Foundation came to be just over a year ago, there were four initial working groups that were established. There were two working groups that fell within a ‘Stack’ category and two that fell within ‘Foundry’ categories. The two that fell within the Stack category, were the Technical Stack working group and the Governance Stack working group. The two that fell within the Foundry category were the Utility Foundry working group and the Ecosystem Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Throughout the past year, as Paul described, he, and others, realized that there was a gap in the work that was happening. A new working group was created — the Inputs and Semantics working group — which fell inside the Stack category, as well. We’re going to go through each of these working groups to give a better idea to the audience of what’s actually happening within the Trust over IP. I think an exciting one I would like to start with is the Ecosystem Foundry working group, which sits at that top layer of the Trust over IP stack. Karl, you’re very lucky to have visibility into this and to be a chair of this working group. Could you give a bit of background of why you got into the Ecosystem Foundry within the Trust over IP? Why you took that leadership position, and how things have evolved, and what’s happening within the Ecosystem Foundry? </p>
<p>Karl: Well, part of my background included over 20 years of working with enterprise architecture, solution architecture, service delivery, and in that ecosystem development space. When the opportunity came up to form the Ecosystem Foundry working group, I was very eager to volunteer to chair that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: What happens from session to session, now? Are you seeing the rise of more ecosystems that are using the Trust over IP stack? What direction is this going in?</p>
<p>Karl: The Ecosystem Foundry working group is focused on acting as the ‘front door’ of that business layer of the Trust over IP stack that you saw in the introduction. As that front door, we help business organizations and consortiums incubate their governance frameworks and their ecosystems. We want those aspects to be shared as open-source, repeatable design patterns, for whatever or whoever their stakeholders may be.</p>
<p>We have a diverse community that is growing at a pretty regular and rapid pace. For example, we have the Yoma ecosystem that’s sponsored by UNICEF, focused on helping youth in Africa up their skills and promote themselves for employment opportunities. We have the Global Legal Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), which has been acting as a pioneer in adapting verifiable credentials as global legal identifiers. The Good Health Pass ecosystem that was recently formed as a working group within Trust over IP, is working with ID2020 in the World Health Organization to create interoperable solutions working with many different providers. I think that ecosystem alone has roughly 80 people that I’ve seen in some of those meetings, all from different organizations; medical, private consultants, government folks — very dynamic.</p>
<p>There’s another ecosystem sponsored by Identidad and the United Farm Workers, that’s focused on helping migrant farmers have an identity and use identity in their food distribution networks. We have education ecosystems, and the list goes on. There are so many; I couldn’t easily go through the whole list. But, at the end of the day, what we see is that businesses have a need for a standardized architecture and a standardized approach to these governance questions, that they can reproduce and repurpose to help them do business. Some of the discussion in the industry around governance is a little bit confused because governance is often perceived as a blocker or a bureaucratic inconvenience. In the Foundry working group, we can see that we’re leveraging all the great thinking that comes out of the Stack working groups to incubate and form these business models, and help accelerate adoption of this new technology. First and foremost, we’re standardizing trust across different business communities and business objectives.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, Karl. Scott, since you’re a co-chair or the chair of the Governance Stack working group, are the Foundry working groups’ customers’ to the work that you’re doing? How do you collaborate with the Ecosystem Foundry working group? I know this is probably the broadest question I could ask, but could you perhaps give a bit of background on what governance is in the context of digital trust? </p>
<p>Scott: Sure. You’re exactly right in what you’re saying, as far as the way that Karl’s group and my group interrelate. Karl’s group is out there, doing the outreach and working with a diverse group of needs in the marketplace. Karl needs standard specifications, recommendations, templates, white papers, and tools, so that he can provide that outreach for his customer base. So, that’s what the Governance Stack working group is focused on; where you start.</p>
<p>If you’re building a house, you have got to have a blueprint. If every builder that’s building a house has a standard set of how blueprints look — they have certain colours, certain notations, certain categories — then, when they get that blueprint, they know exactly how to build a house. Likewise, you have to start with the blueprint of what a governance framework looks like, and so we’ve spent time and energy on putting together what we call the ‘governance meta-model.’ That is, the standard set of categories and requirements that every governance framework needs to have. It also needs to have the structure so that when they become interoperable, you know exactly where to find certain pieces of information. Certain pieces of information are required in every governance framework, and it also has to have the flexibility to be able to work with a variety of different risk models associated with it. Some ecosystems are dealing with lots of requirements due to the mitigation of risks; some don’t have those constraints. So, we need to be able to provide all of the options in order to serve a wide variety of different needs.</p>
<p>We do have very focused areas that we’ve already invested in; we have a scope. You have to define what the ecosystem is, what are the boundaries of it, what the components are, and the players and actors that participate in it. Who governs it, whether there’s an authority or a designated party that drives the requirements that are listed in ‘must’ statements, or ‘should’ statements, or ‘may’ statements. These outlined requirements drive the directives that happen from the governance authority: what are the principles that are operating within that governance authority. Certainly, the Sovrin Foundation has advanced many of the principles of SSI, and some of those are actually baked into some of the governance frameworks that we’re seeing. So, we also need to have objectives within those governance frameworks. What are they? What are the outcomes they’re trying to achieve? It obviously needs to be risk-based to drive the mitigation, because, in the broad spectrum of things, governance frameworks try to reduce risk in some way, shape, or form and should include privacy and security by design.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Awesome; we’ll get back to governance a little later on in the conversation. I’d like to hop over to the other Foundry working group.</p>
<p>André, I think it’s interesting, and Scott described this too, that they’re serving the Foundry working groups. You obviously want to make sure that you’re serving it with a purpose, so having the business requirements being driven down from the Ecosystem working group is really pushing where a lot of the innovation and standards need to happen throughout the rest of the stack. André, you have a similar experience to Scott through the Sovrin Foundation. Additionally, you have quite a nice lens, in that you are not only working on an ecosystem solution through IDunion, but you’re also co-chair of the Utility Foundry working group, which is on Layer One of the Trust over IP stack. Would you mind giving a little more background on the activities that are happening at Layer One at the Utility Foundry working group, and how you look at the collaboration with the rest of the organization?</p>
<p>André: Absolutely, Mathieu. I think we need to start off by getting a better picture of the utility we are talking about. Everyone is talking about utilities. These are the fundamental things that are laying the foundation for everything else that’s happening on the dual stack. A utility is something that everyone has a different understanding of. To try to put it in layman’s terms; we are building an infrastructure that is comparable to things like a mobile telephone network. With a utility, we’re essentially creating the trust infrastructure where you can have the cryptographic trust mechanisms in our network that everyone can use. The utilities are building the fundamental block of infrastructure upon which the use cases are based. These are then defined by ecosystems, with the governance in place.</p>
<p>This is what the Utility Foundry working group is dealing with. We help everyone who wants to embark on their own utility journey, with getting up to speed and getting started. In more practical terms, what we do is that we give them a guideline, based on which they can execute their own journey. This is the six-stage model that we have laid out, which is called our Utility Project Lifecycle Management Guide. First, you gather your information in the ‘learn stage,’ then you convene to get the people who want to do it, to get together and build your utility. Then, you define the management and governance scope, and the methods and tools that you want to use, and then you actually create. So, before that, that’s all data gathering and getting up to speed. In the ‘create’ stage, you actually get together and establish a legal entity, which you may want to have. In the ‘implement’ stage, you implement the governance model, and onboard the members. Then, you maintain everything, which means you run the ledger, the utility, the infrastructure, on which the trust layers above are built. As I’ve mentioned, you have to have some kind of governance framework, that is, in fact, governing the network, and the utility, and the actors of the utility, and the participants in the network</p>
<p>This is what we helped people to understand, and to traverse through these stages to ramp up their own utility. As an example, IDunion is a very major initiative in Germany, and it is both a utility project as well as a project that is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in Germany to implement use cases. This is precisely what we are doing; getting through these stages and making it work on this example. Sovrin has been the pioneer in that round, having done all that without the Trust over IP stages being there to guide them.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Wonderful. I think we share the same thought, André. I’ve repeated this over and over again; people tend to overlook this layer sometimes, as it’s not the most attractive aspect from an outside perspective. However, the need to have this root of trust under the stack is crucial, and I think the work that the Utility Foundry working group is doing to provide that base for everything to function is tremendously important.</p>
<p>André: I don’t want to forget to mention that this is obviously something that is not only driven by me; I have great help there. Dan Gisolfi from IBM has been the co-chair all along, and obviously, you, Mathieu, are doing a tremendous job with supporting all the activities and throwing in many work hours. So, let’s take this opportunity to thank you, also, for being there.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Right, that’s why I talked it up! Thanks, André.</p>
<p>Paul, how do you see your work in the Inputs and Semantics working group being inside this? As a Stack working group, you’re also functioning as a supporter to the Foundry working groups. The way I look at the activities that your working group is doing, is that for this stack to take off and for adoption to really pick up, a lot of the stuff you’re doing is going to facilitate that. What’s the output that’s coming out of the working group, and how are you collaborating with the various ecosystems?</p>
<p>Paul: As you mentioned, it’s a different lens than the other stack groups. Where they look at governance versus technology, we look at data inputs versus semantics, or data entry versus data capture, if you like. Because we’re still obviously a very full space without having to specify where people are in the four-layer stack, it’s turned into a bit of an innovation space. That is, people who are working with centralized solutions and everything, still have a space in this whole ecosystem to be able to express what they’re doing, and their needs. They are bringing all of their expertise within their domains into this rich space.</p>
<p>I would say, for anybody new coming into Trust over IP, the Inputs and Semantics working group is a nice entry point from a centralized space. They can come in, they can learn about decentralized technologies, and then, when the time’s right, they can be pushed into the ecosystem side, or the utility side, or the technology, or the governance. I think it’s a nice place to enter the space.</p>
<p>We work on a vertical structure and a horizontal structure. When I say a horizontal structure; we’ve got a bunch of task forces underneath that. We have the Notice and Consent task force, the Privacy and Risk task force, and the Storage and Portability task force. All of these discussions happening in those groups feed back into the Inputs and Semantics working groups so that we can start thinking about how some of this stuff knits together. We’re building this huge amount of expertise. For example, in the Storage and Portability task force, we’ve had people from Inrupt talking about solid pods; next week, they’re talking about authentic chain data containers. We’ve got all these new technologies coming into this space. As a group, we find out what the best bits of those are, and we try to work together to get a nice, interoperable solution for all of those things.</p>
<p>We work on a vertical structure, as well. We’ve got a Healthcare task force, and underneath the Healthcare task force is an FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) focus group. Those guys have been super busy at the moment, because of the Good Health Pass Collaborative. I co-chair the Common Data Models and Elements group. In that group, the EU and the World Health Organization have said that FHIR is the common data model that they want to use, so obviously, all the work they’re doing in the FHIR focus group is super important for that whole initiative, as well. It’s a very active group, and it’s pretty unrestrained with the stuff that can come into it. I hope that answers your question.</p>
 Selling Digital Trust to C-Level Executives 
<p>Mathieu: That was fantastic. I really love that all of you have showcased the collaborative aspect of the Trust over IP; how the Foundation is able to work with different communities, and people are able to come in, people are able to share stuff. You mentioned Inrupt just now, Paul; and Karl, when talking about the Good Health Pass earlier, you mentioned a couple of other organizations. I think that’s not talked about enough: how friendly the community is, and how easy it is to work together and learn from each other. Everyone has the same goal of driving digital trust forward, and that benefits everyone. It’s more about growing the pie together.</p>
<p>From that perspective, I think what we would like to do now, is maybe open it up and have a little more of a discussion. We’ve covered the different working groups, and I have a few topics here that I’ll throw your way. I’ll throw the first one towards you, Karl. Anyone else, please feel free to jump in, as I’m sure you have thoughts of your own, and experience around this as well. The first thing I would like to ask, Karl, is: how has your experience been, selling the Trust over IP stack to enterprises or to C-level executives? How do you approach these conversations?</p>
<p>Karl: Well, our enterprise customers come to us with enterprise stacks, right? A typical enterprise already has a pretty robust, and usually complicated, governance and their own conglomeration of technology that’s architected together. What we do, is show them how Trust over IP can be used to augment those existing investments in existing ecosystems, to help amplify standardization, amplify interoperability, and ‘future-proofability’ (I think that’s not a proper word). We help them to adopt incrementally things like verifiable credentials and great new utilities, like the ones you’re hearing about in this session. Again, these things are a toolset for the Trust over IP stack to help organizations. Most of our customers are established enterprises, so they come with all of that baked in, and that’s my day-to-day reality. However, in Trust over IP, we also have what we call ‘green-field ecosystems,’ meaning that they’re starting from scratch, and they don’t have to traverse all that. To use your term, the way it’s ‘sold’ is to say, “You have a hundred questions; well, here’s a hundred answers.” It’s a simple way to help answer repeated problems around creating trust in a digital and distributed ecosystem, if that answers it.</p>
<p>André: If I may add a bit to that: obviously, people have often heard a variety of things about&nbsp; SSI, and the missing trust layer on the internet, and so on. They don’t have a defined understanding of what’s going on and what this can do for them. In fact, the dual stack model helps very well, to slice and dice the problem and illustrate connecting points for the solution, and for their understanding. You effectively can use the model to pick people up where they are standing, and traverse through the dual stack and make it more tangible to them. Then, in the end, you can come to an understanding, where you tell them, “Look, if you embark on this journey, you have the potential of cutting your own complexity.”</p>
<p>It’s exactly what you’re talking about, Karl. The complexity and conglomerates of infrastructure, which has heterogeneous governance and processes that are not well aligned, so you can help them portray a better future. In this new model, they can reduce the complexity and use the modules that Trust over IP with its technology components is delivering, to solve this and get to a leaner organization that is more future proof. That’s exactly the same way that I perceive the situation. Trust OIP is a great vehicle for transporting all these messages in a concise and consistent way.</p>
<p>Scott: Mathieu, I think one of the things that’s key, is that, as Karl had mentioned, people come with their own sphere of control. If they issue credentials, they can manage what it is. However, we’re dealing with situations where an ecosystem creates and issues credentials, whether it’s for SSI or for other purposes. Other ecosystems that are not related need to be able to rely on that. Where are they going to go to create that transitive trust between ecosystems?</p>
<p>That’s what we’re trying to define within our organization. We see that, for example, with the Good Health Pass, where you have health credentials that are very focused and very health-related. But, these individual credentials are being used for travel — a totally different industry — and they have to be able to work together to compare the requirements between those needs, between the issuers and the verifiers, in order to benefit the populace.</p>
<p>Paul: I’d also add that in a truly decentralized economy, or a dynamic data economy, we call it; there are three main domains that need to be truly decentralized. There’s identity management, there’s data management, and there’s access management in those spaces. You’re in a data life cycle; you can think of it as data entry, data capture, and data exchange. In those three spaces, it’s really about authentication, in that what you enter into the system comes from an authentic source. There are deterministic semantics, meaning that once data has gone into the system, you have to capture and structure it. You want to know that those items that you’re capturing are deterministic, meaning that no matter how many times you copy it across various networks, that same hash always equates to the same thing.</p>
<p>The last piece is decentralized governance, and that’s all about access management and authorization; that’s more the data exchange part. When you talk about decentralized governance, you want to make sure that there are no roadblocks getting in the way of those sorts of access issues. It’s quite rich; it’s not only focused on verifiable credentials. I think a lot of people come into this space and think it’s all about authentication, but it’s actually broader than that. It’s about authentication, determinism, and authorization. We can handle all of that somewhere in the organization, or within the foundation.</p>
 ToIP Governance Models 
<p>Mathieu: Just to riff off of the comment about the fact that if you’re creating credentials within an ecosystem, you don’t necessarily know how they’re going to be used in the future. With the comment about health credentials being used for travel, this comes back to ensuring that when you are creating a supply of credentials inside an ecosystem, you want to make sure that it’s good quality data. It’s the same thing over and over again: if you have garbage in, there’s garbage out. You want to make sure that what’s coming in, is high quality.</p>
<p>Scott, some of the stuff when you’re talking about building governance models, and maybe working with the Good Health Pass to do these things — what are some of the components that you take very seriously within the governance models, if it comes to registries? How do you look at that whole concept?</p>
<p>Scott: Well, there are a variety of ways that you can get transitive trust. You start with the cryptographic layer; making sure that we’re all using the same cryptographic tools. We have machine-readable rules engines, and the rules need to be built, and everyone needs to have agreement on what rules need to be put into these engines, and on the output. There are requirements, but also you have great disclosure. As Paul was mentioning, you have to have clarity on what the payloads are in transactions. Finally, you need to have clarity on the requirements: what do you require when I issue a credential? What am I getting, when I get the credential? What was built into the credential? What verification was done when the credential was issued? What’s included in the payload of that credential so that it can be used outside of its potential sphere? We’re focusing mostly on disclosure and clarity of requirements to allow others to actually use it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: When an external organization comes in, and there’s been quite a few that come in through the ecosystem foundry and directly to the foundation, as well for consultation. The Ontario government is a good example of one that came into the Trust over IP, and I know the UK government had come in as well. Anyone could jump in here, who was involved with these consults, but how does the Trust over IP guide these public sector groups? Are there differences between guiding the public sector versus the private sector? </p>
<p>Scott: Well, I could start it off because I have been working with the UK, and I was involved in the Ontario activity. These are interested communities; they want to promote digital life, digital communication. We’re still in the midst of a pandemic, and we’ve changed our focus around how digital life is. We want to improve digital life, and we want to foster trusted communication, because our lives have been restricted over the last 14 months or so. How do we create the communication and interoperability standards, to allow these communities to foster more trustworthy online communication? They’re interested parties, but they’re basically incubating the ecosystems that would fall more into Karl’s realm.</p>
<p>Karl: You have the side question there, about, how did we convene that? How did we respond? It’s an open community, where we all collaborate. We say, “Okay, there’s this call for a response: is this worthy of the community, to put together different resources, to try to articulate a response?” When something like the BC Government project comes up, it’s a great opportunity to educate a large group of people on best practice approaches to decentralized architecture, decentralized design, and all the principles around trust. The way I like to discuss it with some of my customers, is removing the need for trust. That’s the problem: the fact that if I need to trust you, to me, that’s a problem. Personally, I’d rather just not have to trust you. What is it you say, Paul? Assurance, not trust.</p>
<p>Paul: Yes,&nbsp; cryptographic assurance, right!</p>
 Digital Trust Ecosystems &amp; Collaborations 
<p>Mathieu: André, I think that what’s happening in Germany is extremely exciting, where people are taking this architecture and this viewpoint very seriously. How does Germany go about approaching this whole thing, really looking to adopt the Trust over IP architecture?</p>
<p>André: Yes, I think we still need to pull them in a bit more to Trust over IP, so I’m trying my best here to make that happen. I think it’s good, that at the higher political levels in Germany, at least they have an understanding of what’s going on there in the world. They are leveraging the great momentum that the SSI community has built throughout the last few years. We are very happy that, on the highest political levels, the understanding is now there that with Self-sovereign Identity, and with the European ecosystem of leveraging Self-sovereign Identity, they can have a distinction against ‘Big Tech.’ Plus, they can have an interoperable and open ecosystem that will help to drive European interests and organizations forward.</p>
<p>I think this is now well-known, and the momentum is ever-growing. In fact, this month, coming from the Chancellery in Germany, there will be a project that has been driven for the past month. The first pilot will become public, and then I think we will see a lot of stuff happening. This is on top of the IDunion initiative, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, so there are lots of different streams working in the same direction in SSI. I think this is based on the understanding that this is a global topic, which Trust OIP is helping to shape, and build, and make more understandable and digestible for everyone who wants to get on the journey.</p>
<p>Trust over IP has such a great resource pool of talented people who are thought leaders and experts in their fields. Trust over IP is a great point where you can tap into this knowledgeable resource pool. This is exactly what we see happening with Good Health Pass and the government transportation works that have already been done. This wouldn’t be happening if there wasn’t the notion that the thought leaders of the world are getting together to work on these topics, and everyone sees the benefit of tapping into that. I totally see the value and the advantage that the Trust over IP is providing there.</p>
<p>Paul: It’s a nice place to incubate new collaborations between the people that are interested in decentralized technologies without necessarily being at the government levels. I’ve seen a lot of people that are working in spaces, and then they think, “Oh, I love what you’re doing, we’re doing this. Oh, that’s cool.” They collaborate, and they build some kind of new technology, so that’s really nice to see — it’s very organic. It’s not all about Trust over IP; they can shoot off and do their own side projects and then come back to Trust over IP and explain what they’ve done and what kind of things they’ve solved. So, in that way, I think it’s a super organic space.</p>
<p>Karl: I think André hit a really important point for me in the day-to-day; the value of Trust over IP is that you’d be hard-pressed to find any community that has such a diverse set of very well-informed and intelligent members on the subject. I don’t think most budgets could support paying, even on a consulting basis, to get this diversity of skill and diversity of perspective. For me, personally, that’s the day-to-day value that’s really immeasurable when you consider the commitment to the community. The reciprocal value back to me, is simply learning from all these fascinating minds, and these projects like the IDunion project and all the LISSY work out there, that in turn, is inspiring ecosystem and utility envisioning in the United States. I know that US senators, for example, have been discussing the great work that André’s been talking about.</p>
<p>Scott: To add to Karl’s point, the Good Health Pass joined with Trust over IP in solving a global problem. They marshalled nine drafting groups together, and there’s been a concerted effort in the last month to put documents out. We have 150 pages right now; very well constructed recommendations. It’s just a tremendous amount of effort that could not be done, unless you have an organization putting them all together.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s tough to keep up with all the momentum that’s happening in the space. I echo your thoughts, Karl, and everyone else. With the number of intelligent, hard-working, well-intentioned people that are going in the same direction, it’s tough to keep up. It’s interesting that as more projects or ecosystems are popping up, they’re laying the foundation for others. Something you maybe didn’t think was possible yesterday, is today, and you have the blueprint in front of you to create a project based on that.</p>
<p>Karl: Another wonderful aspect is that you also have competitors — companies that are competing directly in the same space, doing the same thing — joining their minds together and coming up with better and more powerful solutions for their customers, because of that reciprocal benefit. It’s something you hear about with newer members: sometimes they’re shy about their own Intellectual Property or their own companies. But quickly, as you start to participate in the community, you’ll see that there are very fluid and agile ways to share ideas and really improve your own commercial objectives while improving the greater objectives around digital trust and interoperability.</p>
<p>Paul: For all of this to work, there’s an interesting space that’s going to be developing over the next couple of years in the data governance authorities, at the jurisdictional level, and even more for the trust ecosystems within those jurisdictions. You’re forcing this sense of collaboration, for people that are trying to solve a common problem or working for a common purpose. I think Trust over IP is just a fantastic framework to start noodling these spaces, which are becoming inevitable for the whole thing to work. It really is a fantastic space to be noodling in.</p>
<p>Mathieu: One aspect that excites me quite a bit, and I know André brought this up in the past, too, is that there’s so much momentum behind verifiable credentials as a whole. If you take the bigger umbrella, the whole digital identity space is understanding some of the benefits that come with verifiable credentials. But, one of the underappreciated innovations that I think is going to disrupt so many things is the API-less aspect to it. I could completely disrupt spaces and be significantly more agile than others, by being able to leverage services without needing to do an integration.</p>
<p>André: Totally. This is one key part of my speeches these days. We call it Self-sovereign Identity, and the ‘identity’ word implies we are dealing only with identity, but in fact, it’s so much more. SSI is a key enabler of any type of digitalization effort, because we’re able to pass on trustworthy data, without ever having agreed on an interface before. Obviously, this requires our understanding of the data model and the semantics, which is totally Paul’s domain. This is the key requirement that we have to pass on with each credential, but then the whole merit of a data-driven economy can unfold without APIs being specified upfront. I think this is the real game-changer.</p>
<p>So, even though it’s called Self-sovereign Identity — this is the term that has been coined, and I know that many people don’t like it — it’s so much more. It’s an enabler for transporting trusted data across the network world. This is brilliant, and this is the reason why everyone’s going to like it and love it at some point. It’s an inevitable piece of all the digitalization efforts.</p>
<p>Karl: That perspective matches our day-to-day with our enterprise customers. As soon as they understand the concept of a verifiable credential, password-less login, data privacy, data minimization, and all that, they love all those ideas. However, that’s just scratching the surface.</p>
<p>We talk about digital transformation; think about all the analog processes that are still moving around. All the papers are still being pushed for verification and any kind of business process. For example, we had one education customer in a public sector engagement, where they wanted to issue payslips as verifiable credentials, to be interoperable with loans, and in getting real estate and housing for their students and their alumni. I think that digitization is where you find the full depth and the breadth of the value of this technology. The credentials, the password-less login, that’s all great; the market’s seen a lot of that, but there’s real depth in answering the call to digital transformation, that the enterprise has been trying to resolve through several generations of technology. We finally have some very important quantum leaps forward to improving the digital trust experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Paul: There’s another important aspect, as well. We’re talking a lot about the transient objects with verifiable credentials, but I’m really interested in where the source of that data is coming from. That’s another nit that we’re working on; not just in this community, but across a number of communities. Finding out the persistent records in a database — when I say a database, it could be a database that’s held in a personal data store, that’s under your control — but that’s your root of authenticity, if you like. From there, you can build your verifiable credentials and stuff.</p>
<p>It’s a super interesting space, because you can think of it as the control being totally right back with the citizen with all of this. They have access to their data; they can create credentials from that; it’s got an authentic source that’s been certified by certifying authorities. The important thing is that the data throughout all of that can flow from peer-to-peer, being safe and secure using verifiable credentials, semantic containers, good semantics, and all of that stuff. You’re working peer-to-peer, and it’s totally secure. The whole ecosystem will just unfold and be an amazing place for safe transacting.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s fantastic. I love your point, too, Karl, where you’re only scratching the surface with use cases like password-less authentications and certain access protocols. With these types of use cases, you could 10x current processes. But, the stuff that I think excites all of us, is the hundred and thousand x possibilities that are going to grow the entire pie.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to all of you for doing this today; it was a wonderful conversation, and I look forward to part two at some point.</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-158-big-tech-gets-bigger-self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on-907543545539">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Economist on the future of banking — special&nbsp;report  Why self-sovereign identity matters in a world of&nbsp;CBDCs  BONUS: A TV show about central&nbsp;bankers  Greg Kidd: I work in regtech, not&nbsp;fintech  What magic teaches us about misinformation  Chart of the week — the creator ecosystem  This week in&nbsp;Facebook  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. The Economist’s comprehensive overview of the future of&nbsp;banking Photo: Micheile Henderson<p>A <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-05-08">great collection of articles/special reports from The Economist</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>).</p><p>First, on “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/08/a-future-with-fewer-banks">a future with fewer banks</a>,” a reminder that banking and in particular, “money” historically hasn’t been about technology much at&nbsp;all:</p><blockquote>Because technology has disrupted so many industries, its impact on banking may seem like one more example of a stodgy, uncompetitive business made obsolete by slick tech firms. But money and banking aren’t like taxis or newspapers. They make up the interface between the state and the economy. “The deep architecture of the money-credit system, better known as banking, hasn’t changed since the 18th century, when Francis Baring began writing about the lender-of-last-resort,” says Sir Paul Tucker, formerly deputy governor of the Bank of England and now at Harvard. “Which means it has not, so far, depended on technology at all, because Francis Baring was writing about it with a quill&nbsp;pen.”</blockquote><p>But technology is now coming to eat banks’ lunch. The Economist discusses <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/how-fintech-will-eat-into-banks-business">how that’s playing out</a>. Check out this&nbsp;chart:</p><p>Also from the collection:</p>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-bigger-role-for-venture-capital">Comparing venture capital to whale&nbsp;agents</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/when-interest-rates-turn-negative">When interest rates go&nbsp;negative</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/when-central-banks-issue-digital-money">On CBDCs</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/will-the-dollar-stay-dominant">The future of USD dominance</a>  <p>So where does all of this leave us? According to The Economist, it’s “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-brave-new-world-for-banks">a brave new world for banks</a>.” We’ve talked plenty about how digital wallets are disrupting the space. But it’s important to emphasize as well how fundamental banks are to how the global system works. Central banks define monetary policy but ultimately, it’s the banks that execute the plan — holding 90 percent of broad money supply in deposits.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/politics/cryptocurrency-regulation-sec-ripple-labs.html?referringSource=articleShare">the NYTimes pointed out</a>, “the value of all outstanding cryptocurrency has jumped to about $2.4 trillion — or more than the approximately $1.2 trillion of United States currency in circulation worldwide.” On the other side of things, China’s fintech giant Ant “can reach 400 million customers outside of China through its partners,” according to The Economist.</p><p>In other words, this isn’t just about fintech disrupting another industry or the furious rise of crypto — it’s about the rejiggering of the world monetary&nbsp;system.</p><p>These are uncharted waters. Back to <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-brave-new-world-for-banks">The Economist on a brave new&nbsp;world</a>:</p><blockquote>But this revolution brings with it new problems. Because they benefit from network effects, payment platforms will tend to concentrate into just one or two giant intermediaries. As more activity migrates away from banks, existing monetary-policy mechanisms may become obsolete.The risk of losing control over the monetary system has lit a fire underneath usually staid central bankers. Projects to accelerate fast payment systems have cropped up worldwide. So have e”orts to create central-bank digital currencies, a digital form of paper cash to compete with the digital payments of private giants. In China, where payments&nbsp;!rms are most advanced, more than 100,000 people are already using a digital yuan in pilot projects.</blockquote><blockquote>The roll-out of what amounts to a new monetary system thus comes with risks. Many of the issues it raises are as tricky as the financial stability and inclusion problems of old. As people move their money into cbdcs they will pull it out of banks, threatening the system developed to foster loans without overt state interference in credit allocation. The digital involvement of the central bank in everyday transactions would not only increase the risk of such interference but also be a gift to those wishing to snoop on citizens. And the concentration of the economy in digital money, whether it is run by private firms or by a central bank, could provide a new route for malicious actors to destabilise systems through cyberwarfare.</blockquote><p>So the risks of getting it wrong are high. But the risk of inaction could be even&nbsp;higher:</p><blockquote>Central bankers that run reserve currencies can head off the potential nightmare of leaving Facebook or China’s government in charge of global payment systems by issuing digital currencies of their own. If they do it sensibly, digital money could even become a force for good, not just a defence against disaster. “There is a parallel with biological evolution,” said Sir Jon Cunli”e of the Bank of England in March. Evolution is generally slow, but at times of geological or environmental change it can be rapid. A bewildering number of life forms may appear and many do not survive. This is “a helpful lens through which to look at what’s happening now,” Sir Jon suggested. When people look back at this period they will see banking in a period of very rapid change. The hope is that it may emerge in a better&nbsp;state.</blockquote><p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/generosity-is-trending-neobanks-are-tapping-into-that">Generosity is trending.

CBDCs make self-sovereign identity more relevant than&nbsp;ever <p>Something anyone who has followed GlobaliD has known for some time — here’s the FT on “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88f47c48-97fe-4df3-854e-0d404a3a5f9a?shareType=nongift">Why CBDCs will likely be ID-based</a>:</p><blockquote>“Central banks are realising CBDCs will have to be intimately linked to identity to deal with illicit finance and bank disintermediation risk.”</blockquote><p>Why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters:</p><blockquote>When money goes ID-based, one also has to consider the broader parameters of the potential data creep. Just how far should that personal file reach? What sort of non-monetary information should or shouldn’t be contained within it? To what degree should account-holders be able to refuse access to their data to third parties? Who might the government entrust to manage and operate these schemes, and how can we hold them to&nbsp;account?</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt">Google Promised Its Contact Tracing App Was Completely Private — But It Wasn’t — The&nbsp;Markup</a>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/28/1022940/slum-dwellers-india-google-plus-code-access-delivery-apps/">Slum dwellers in India get unique digital addresses through&nbsp;Google</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">Peloton’s leaky API let anyone grab riders’ private account data — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-idemia-matt-thompson-mobile-id-identity-on-the-edge-705059/">INTERVIEW: IDEMIA’s Matt Thompson on the Reality of Mobile ID and ‘Identity on the Edge’ — FindBiometrics</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRsvz6pRtZE">Edward Snowden Talks Privacy Coins at Ethereal&nbsp;2021</a>   3.

What magic teaches us about misinformation: <p>A cool piece from <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>—<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">the FT</a>:</p><blockquote>Why do people — and by “people” I mean “you and I” — accept and spread misinformation? The two obvious explanations are both disheartening.</blockquote><blockquote>The first is that we are incapable of telling the difference between truth and lies. In this view, politicians and other opinion-formers are such skilled deceivers that we are helpless, or the issues are so complex that they defy understanding, or we lack basic numeracy and critical-thinking skills.</blockquote><blockquote>The second explanation is that we know the difference and we don’t care. In order to stick close to our political tribe, we reach the conclusions we want to&nbsp;reach.</blockquote><blockquote>There is truth in both these explanations. But is there a third account of how we think about the claims we see in the news and on social media — an account that, ironically, has received far too little attention? That account centres on attention itself: it suggests that we fail to distinguish truth from lies not because we can’t and not because we won’t, but because — as with Robbins’s waistcoat — we are simply not giving the matter our&nbsp;focus.</blockquote><blockquote>What makes the problem worse is our intuitive overconfidence that we will notice what matters, even if we don’t focus closely. If so, the most insidious and underrated problem in our information ecosystem is that we do not give the right kind of attention to the right things at the right time. We are not paying enough attention to what holds our attention.</blockquote><blockquote>The art of stage magic allows us to approach this idea from an unusual angle: Gustav Kuhn’s recent book, Experiencing the Impossible, discusses the psychology of magic tricks. “All magic can be explained through misdirection alone,” writes Kuhn, a psychologist who runs the Magic Lab at Goldsmiths, University of&nbsp;London.</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">the full&nbsp;article</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">What magic teaches us about misinformation</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://caitlinjohnstone.substack.com/p/silicon-valley-algorithm-manipulation">Silicon Valley Algorithm Manipulation Is The Only Thing Keeping Mainstream Media&nbsp;Alive</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/60296d">Briefing: Facebook’s Oversight Board Upholds Trump Ban, Calls for&nbsp;Review</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/glaad-study-facebook-instagram-youtube-tiktok-8d9555b6-4cee-4db8-8b51-5b5fdad0c749.html">GLAAD finds top social media sites “categorically unsafe” for LGBTQ&nbsp;people</a>   6.

 Future Verus miners: take notice. Prepare for the full mainnet release of PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) and find great opportunities to maximize profit with your hardware. Mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. With Verus’ hardware equalizing hashing algorithm (VerusHash 2.2) you can mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even ARM devices.

The hashing algorithm uses the AES/AVX instruction sets built into most modern CPUs to boost CPU hash&nbsp;power.</p><p>Mine Verus most efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even certain ARM devices. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit#gid=10943314">Compare mining hashrates here.</a></p> Coinbase Rewards <p>1440 blocks are generated each day. On average 720 blocks go to miners, 720 blocks go to stakers (<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951">learn more on staking Verus</a>). For generating — or finding — a block, miners and stakers get compensated. This compensation is called a coinbase reward. There will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC.</p><p>If you look at the image below, you might think that the possibility of earning VRSC for miners and stakers goes down drastically. We explain next that earnings don’t stop at coinbase&nbsp;rewards.</p>Verus Coin Emission Schedule. From block height 10,080 on, all coinbase rewards of 384 and 192 VRSC were timelocked and then unlocked at random block heights. The last of those rewards were unlocked at block height 1,181,520. Earning from Economic&nbsp;Activity <p>Miners and stakers don’t just earn coinbase rewards (the reward for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees&nbsp;include:</p>  PBaaS-chain*: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain  (DeFi) Currency and tokens*: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100&nbsp;VRSC  Conversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Miners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Think about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite&nbsp;large.</p><p>*Fees are subject to change before hitting&nbsp;mainnet</p>Verus Fee Pool. Percentage is subject to change before hitting&nbsp;mainnet. Merge-Mine up to 22&nbsp;Chains <p>The example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!</p><p>And you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>All these chains have the same consensus algorithm, 50% PoW, 50% PoS, so you can also stake an unlimited amount of PBaaS-chains.</p>Merge-mine 22 chains with one&nbsp;device Happy Mining (and Staking)! <p>Everyone in the world can start mining Verus today with our low barrier hashing algorithm.

<p>How to setup a secure Kusama Validator in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>A short time ago, we as <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes</a> decided to host our own Kusama Validator. This article will help you to understand how you can set up your own Validator on Polkadot’s Canary Network. At the very least you will walk away with a basic understanding of how staking works in Polkadot and what responsibilities different roles have in the ecosystem. Let's start with the most important concepts Validators and Nominators.</p> Validators and Nominators <p>In Polkadot’s ecosystem, a node participating in the BABE Consensus is called a Validator. Such an entity has three key responsibilities:</p>  Produce blocks if asked to do&nbsp;so  Vote over the blocks (more precisely the “chain of blocks”) that still have to be finalized  Forward messages between Parachains  <p>To allow your Validator to become part of the active set that is currently validating the chain, you will need to stake a minimum of ~<a href="https://polkaview.network/ksm">4000KSM</a>. Obviously, holding or acquiring such a vast amount of KSM is only possible if you’re quite wealthy, as 4000KSM are 1.28 million dollars as of writing&nbsp;this.</p><p>A Nominator is an entity holding vast amounts of KSM, these are most likely entities involved in Polkadot for a long time. The Nominator elects different Validators to Stake his KSM. In short, this role describes someone who does not run his own node. Instead, the entity stakes their KSM most profitably by assigning their stake to a validator. Please understand that staking is risky for the Nominator, if the Validator — for whatever reason — stops running, they both risk getting slashed. The slash would ultimately affect the Nominator's stake.</p><blockquote>This mechanism incentivizes Nominators to choose Validators that charge a minimal commission fee and have a good reputation in running their nodes. Validators in return get incentivized to run their node as stable as possible. In return Validators can use low commission fees to attract Nominators.</blockquote> Controller and&nbsp;Stash <p>As we now know the two most important roles in the consensus process we can talk about the accounts you have to set up to run your Validator. Two account types are of importance at this stage — The Controller and the&nbsp;Stash.</p><p>Controller and Stash Accounts are explained quite easily. While the Stash is the entity holding the majority of your funds, the Controller is the entity having control over the Stash and the actions you take — like starting or stopping your Validator.</p>Stash and Controller [1] Setting up a Secure Validator <p>To set up your Validator you can either choose the <a href="https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama">manual set-up</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup">Secure Validator Setup</a>. As you can already guess from the subtitle we have chosen the second&nbsp;option.</p><p>Within the Secure Validator Setup, you will have two options for setting up the node. The first option is to set up your server and the Polkadot application in one run using Terraform. We decided to use the second option which is to set up your server yourself and then use Ansible to securely set up the Polkadot application.</p><p>For the following setup you will need the following:</p>  At least one Debian-based machine (preferably Ubuntu 18.04 as used in Polkadot’s Documentation) with the following specs (min. 300GB Storage, 2–8GB Memory, 1–2 CPUs) hosted with the Provider of your&nbsp;choice.  <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Ansible</a>(v2.8+) installed on your&nbsp;machine  A minimal of 3KSM depending on the amount you want to stake yourself. 0.3KSM will be needed for requesting an on-chain identity. 1–2 KSM should be held for upcoming transaction fees. The overhead can then be used to stake using your own validator. A higher amount of self stake raises trust in your validator as you project more trust on it yourself.   Preparing Your&nbsp;Node <p>Before deploying Polkadot to your remote machine you will need to prepare an additional user and ssh access for this user. Start with <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/add-new-user-account-with-admin-access-on-linux/">creating a new admin user</a> and then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2">create new ssh keys</a>. Preferably you should also disable the root login as described in the ssh key instructions.</p> Running the Secure Validator Setup <p>If you successfully opened a shell to your remote machine, you can adjust the Ansible script for your needs. First, clone the repository:</p> git clone <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup.git">https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup.git</a> <p>Now start adjusting the ansible/inventory.sample file according to the instructions given in the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">setup guide</a>. Below you can find an already edited example inventory file using placeholder values:</p><p>If you are done adjusting the inventory file to your needs you should be able to execute the playbook via the provided&nbsp;script:</p> chmod +x setup.sh<br>./setup.sh my_inventory.yml <p>The Ansible Playbook will now be executed and deploy the Polkadot service to your remote&nbsp;machine.</p><p>In case everything worked well your node should show up on the telemetry. It will now take some time until the node is in sync with the network. For us, this took nearly 7 days. Once finished you will only need to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">bond your KSM </a>and <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">set your session keys</a> to enter your validator into the “waiting” list. From there on, it is a game of building trust into your Validator so that enough foreign stake is received to participate in the active validators pool. The more trust you generate in you and your node the more steady your rewards will become in the long term. To achieve more trust in your node you can also have a look at <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-identity">on-chain identities</a>. For about 0.3KSM you can request a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-identity#registrars">Registrar</a> to verify your personal information which Nominators can then use to get more information on who is actually running the&nbsp;node.</p> Monitoring Your Validator <p>As keeping your validator up and running is key to running your node successfully, good monitoring is a must-have. For an initial layer of monitoring, you can use a <a href="https://t.me/Kusama_bot">Telegram Bot</a>. But for the more sophisticated part of the monitoring, most people will use <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. You can set these up following the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node">instructions given in Polkadot's documentation</a> but beware that some metrics might not show up in the provided Grafana dashboard as not all metrics are delivered which is what happened to us. This is why we enabled the node exporter in the Secure Validator Setup which provides additional data and can be displayed in Grafana with dashboards like&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11207/reviews">this</a>.</p> Validator Stats and Nomination <p>In the PolkadotJS-UI under <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/query">Validator Stats</a> you can browse Validators and inspect stats like rewards or previous slashes. For example, search for ESgN4sdziBpAubx2pGJ1CapGxetE2E1zUbTQCaRFbxxrW2Y and you will find our Validator. Using the displayed information a Nominator can determine his risk with a Validator. He should now be able to nominate the validator as <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot">described in the documentation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto-economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of Blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking">https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/kusama-validator-node-setup-5ddcd5e39f99">Kusama Validator Node Setup</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is delighted to announce that we sent test tokens locally from a KILT testnet to an<a href="https://acala.network/"> Acala</a> testnet using cross-chain message passing (XCMP) functionality. This is a practical example of the cross-chain composability possible within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Composability is the ability to combine various components of a software stack in different ways. The Substrate development framework, on which KILT and the majority of blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem are built, allows full spectrum composability. In other words, a range of modules can be composed, configured, and extended to create an optimised blockchain.</p><p>A huge advantage to being in the Polkadot ecosystem is that the chains in the system will also be composable with each other. This means that chains will not only be able to transfer tokens trustlessly, they will also be able exchange data and call each other’s pallet or smart contract functions.</p><p>For example, PolkaBTC (a wrapped version of Bitcoin) could be minted on Interlay, transferred to Acala, and collateralised for aUSD (Acala’s native token) all in one transaction. This would allow different platforms to build mutually beneficial relationships, benefitting from the strengths of the other and using each other’s functions.</p> From Theory to&nbsp;Practice <p>Recently, we ran a successful test of this function, sending test tokens locally from a KILT testnet to an Acala&nbsp;testnet:</p><p>We achieved this using the<a href="https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki"> Acala xtoken Substrate pallet</a>, an open-source pallet created to allow cross-chain token transfers within the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. The success of our transaction shows that the transfer of transactions across chains in Polkadot has passed the stage of theory and is possible in practice.</p> What does this&nbsp;mean? <p>Acala is an Ethereum-compatible decentralised finance hub and stablecoin. Acala aims to make it fast and easy to use or build financial applications in the Polkadot ecosystem, improving trading efficiency. The platform will offer a suite of financial primitives including a stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets like Bitcoin and liquid staking for DOT. Acala provides an open platform for finance applications to use smart contracts or built-in protocols with out-of-the-box cross-chain capabilities and robust security.</p><p>The ability to move the KILT tokens to Acala would allow us to leverage their services and exchange tokens with other currencies on the Acala chain. For example, KILT could implement aUSD as a payment option, enabling multiple use cases for a stablecoin on KILT such as gaming&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Acala aims to be composable with many teams within the ecosystem, including Moonbeam, Plasm, Interlay, Phala and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BitDotCountry/status/1380313153297285121">Bit.Country</a>, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>We look forward to further collaborations with Acala, and using composability to collaborate with other ground-breaking projects within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>

<p></p>       
<p><br>
Self-Sovereign Identity or SSI is the concept of individuals or organizations, i.e. users, having sole ownership of their digital identities, and control over how their personal data is shared and used. This adds a layer of security and flexibility allowing the users to only reveal the necessary data for any given transaction or interaction. Since identity is such a central part of society, UNISOT, through its UNISOT ID service, offers our customers control over their data. Under self-sovereign identity model users who have one or more identifiers (something that enables a subject to be discovered and identified) can present claims relating to those identifiers without having to go through an intermediary. In the following sections we will outline how SSI can change the way you interact with others on the Internet as well as in the real world.</p>
            <a href="https://unisot.com/products/unisot-id/">Go to UNISOT ID Module</a>            ENABLING NEW BUSINESS MODELS 
<p>SSI is often regarded as the missing identity layer for the internet and this hints to the great variety of use cases in which SSI can create value and, thus, its potential to give rise to new SSI-based business models. Generally speaking, SSI can enable the privacy-respecting monetization of personal data, which is in strong contrast to current ways personal data is being monetized (ad-based models). One of SSI’s most promising features is the simplification of digital interactions and transactions.</p>
<p>The opportunities range from seamless identification and authentication (without usernames or passwords), through user friendly and inclusive data management and transmissions (data transmission with a single click as opposed to filling out, scanning, sending, or even physically delivering forms), to enabling the fully digitized and automatable delivery of services which currently require time consuming involvement of citizens (in the form of paper-based applications, personal appointments during office hours).</p>
       INCREASE OF SECURITY AND DATA INTEGRITY 
<p>A major challenge related to paper-based credentials and processes is their vulnerability to security issues such as physical document forgery, identity theft or just plain errors in transcribing due to human errors in data processing. UNISOT ID increases the security and integrity of our users’ data by leveraging blockchain and technological concepts closely associated with SSI (authentication based on the cryptographic keying, material associated with DIDs, cryptographic signatures, R-puzzle knowledge proofs, Verifiable Credentials and Presentations).</p>
<p>By leveraging SSI, all types of data associated with entities and things could be digitized and converted into a secure, tamper-proof, privacy-friendly and re-usable digital format in order to solve various issues that current processes face, which are based on outdated methods.</p>
            ALTERNATIVE TO DATA SILOS 
<p>Current data management systems are built on centralized architectures where data is stored and managed centrally in a system that is usually controlled by a single organization. One of the problems associated with this form of centralized design is that each system is different, often significantly. On a technical level, this means enabling the exchange of data between such systems can be very costly and time-consuming. This data exchange usually requires the development and maintenance of complex interfaces and possibly the harmonization of technical specifications and components. As a result, most of the data belonging to individuals and organizations is stuck in systems which are not able to interoperate and communicate with other systems, hence the term „data silo”.</p>
<p>Making such data reusable for processes, interactions, and transactions that happen outside the respective silo requires cumbersome and expensive workarounds. In contrast to current systems, UNISOT ID has a completely decentralized, open, and extensible architecture which aims to offer an alternative to current data silos by democratizing control over data. With UNISOT ID, every user can decide where data is stored, based on the promise of full data portability, or with whom data is being shared and for what purpose. Instead of data being fixed within the system of a certain organization, the respective organization can simply issue the relevant data to the associated entity which can then re-use the data in interactions with other systems.</p>
              <p>Figure 1. Isolated identity providers (image courtesy of CEF digital)</p>
       INCREASE OF TRANSPARENCY 
<p>SSI can bring greater transparency to the way personal data is currently requested, accessed, and used within the public sector. This change to transparency is because persons are in full control of their data and therefore no one can access or use their data without their consent which is why they must be involved in every transaction. Even if some decide to opt into policies for automating data transmissions they can always opt out.</p>
<p>Through UNISOT ID our users have the ability of minimal and selective data disclosure which means that you can have very detailed information about what data is required and used by the other parties you interact with. For example, if an entity requests a proof of exact age, the individual may conclude that is also the proof of being older than a certain age that is being required. Requests for personal data can include metadata, such as informing about the request’s purpose and the intended use of the respective data. individuals can require that if an entity requests their data, the entity must identify itself by disclosing identity proofs together with trust assuring attributes.</p>
                COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS 
<p>UNISOT is committed to open standards and data protection at the highest level and at the current state of the art in digital data formatting and management. The number of laws that aim to regulate the way data is stored, managed, shared, and controlled is rising globally, particularly since the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 2016/679) came into force. UNISOT ID solution offers full compliance with GDPR and it appears to offer the best factual implementation to realize the will of regulators in today’s digital data society because it puts individuals in full control of their data and provides the means to support the enforcement of individual rights.</p>
<p>By being compatible with the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), UNISOT ID also offers full legal compliance in accordance with the electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 910/2014) regulation. This includes the legal equivalence of electronic signatures performed by our UNISOT ID service with handwritten signatures and full KYC solutions for substantial and high levels of assurance.</p>
         <p>Figure 2. The SSI model data sharing model (image courtesy of CEF digital)</p>
           EMPOWERMENT OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTROL THEIR DATA 
<p>UNISOT ID empowers individuals and organizations to be in full control of their data and digital identities. This is realized by providing them with the technological infrastructure required to create digital identities independently of a central authority. Next, with this system a person can enrich their digital identities with claims which are basically secure, and re-usable digital equivalents to current, paper-based, issued credentials (passports, driving licenses, healthcare records). Finally, citizens can use the provided tools to manage and utilize such claims (apps, agents). Also, all types of personal and sensitive data as well as the means required to access and utilize them (cryptographic keying material) are stored securely at the user’s discretion in so called „wallets” on their edge devices, such as Smart Cards, Mobile Phone and PC.</p>
            <p>For added security, we add a hardware wallets in the form of a Smart Card which integrates the wallet management and recovery into a card not unlike standard credit cards. We feel it is important to note here that our commitment to privacy and data ownership is complete. Once a user is on boarded onto the UNISOT ID all the data stored in our applications is theirs to keep even if they discontinue using our services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our adherence to international standards and the common European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) ensures that our clients can also transfer their data to a different service provider meaning they are in no way locked into using UNISOT offerings. We believe that our customers will choose to continue using the UNISOT ecosystem not because they are forced to but because it is simply the best option on the market.</p>
       DECREASE IN COSTS 
<p>Given SSI’s ability to facilitate faster and easier delivery of services and interactions, to digitize and streamline processes, to offer an alternative to current data silos, and to enhance security and data integrity, the potential to save significant funds is obvious. To provide an example, Dutch TNO estimates that SSI can save European governments between 10 and 100 billion Euros per year by facilitating the validation of data.</p>

<p>I remember being in Helsinki seeing QR codes everywhere. This was in 2018 I guess, and the tourism association had convinced local merchants and taxis to accept AliPay. They said it would help the rapidly growing Chinese tourism cohort, who were used to using contactless payments all the time.</p>
<p>Did it work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know. I haven’t been back and haven’t looked at the data for Helsinki and AliPay.</p>
<p>But now we are using QR codes all the time – and tapping our phones on various devices. While we used to hold menus and shove our card in a machine,&nbsp;now we’re all about contactless. What broke the pattern?</p>
<p>Apple Pay started some shifts but the pattern was simple – pay for your stuff at the counter. Most didn’t use that same ritual at the table in the restaurant or at other stores, though some did. Most resisted.</p>
<p>Banks and Credit Unions have been trying to force a shift to contactless payments but have encountered resistance – from their customers, their merchants, and even their internal teams. There wasn’t enough push behind it to break the swipe or card-in-machine pattern.&nbsp;Since I advise multiple credit unions, banks, and fintechs this lack of adoption does not surprise me. </p>
<p>People don’t like changes. They stick with what works. Until it doesn’t…</p>
<p>But COVID-19 forced a pattern to break – we no longer wanted to touch anything. So what did we do?&nbsp;We went contactless. We’re tapping all the time. Shooting QR codes for our menus and to find out more about things. Did QR codes and other contactless systems change. No. They have been around a long time in the tech world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We broke the pattern. We opened up an opportunity to try something new – because the old thing no longer worked for us. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re a software developer student looking for impactful internships or a company looking to hire from top campuses, <a href="https://www.techintern.io/">Techintern.io</a> is your go-to&nbsp;place.</p><p>Read on to learn more about how Techintern.io chose Magic for “set it and forget it” passwordless login.</p> A long-term advocate of&nbsp;Magic <p>Techintern.io is a marketplace that matches students with companies in the form of an internship. Their network of club leads at colleges and student organizations finds the best student developers interested in working at startups. These students can then opt into companies in hiring rounds once a month. This streamlines the hiring process and makes it easier to find the right match within a&nbsp;week!</p><p>When the pandemic hit, <a href="https://twitter.com/itsdjklee">Daniel Lee</a>, CTO of Techintern.io, observed that software students were losing their internships. Inspired by the helpful co-op¹ program he participated in at the University of Waterloo, he sought to build Techintern.io to unlock other opportunities for these students.</p><p>Because internships are time-bound, Daniel’s team launched as quickly as possible with a beta. The goal was to validate the need for Techintern.io. As soon as their close network expressed interest, they set out to meet their initial launch. But first, they needed a secure means of authentication.</p><p>Choosing an auth solution was an easy task. Having used the Magic SDK in previous consulting projects (and even recommending it to colleagues), Daniel considers himself a long-term advocate of&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>Thanks to helpful documentation and superb customer support, Daniel’s team went with Magic passwordless auth and was able to keep up Techintern.io’s momentum with a successful public launch on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/techintern-io">Product&nbsp;Hunt</a>.</p> Adopting Magic <p>As with all good things, Daniel learned about Magic through a connection at his previous consulting firm. Because he was interested in blockchain technology at the time, he was curious to learn more about Magic and how it uses the Ethereum blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography to generate verifiable proofs of identity and authorization.</p><p>Once he read Magic’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">whitepaper</a> and dug a little deeper into the API, he realized how cool and easy it was to integrate with. At the end of the day, he was convinced that Magic would be the alternative of his choice; not just for this consulting project, but also for other projects that came after…including Techintern.io!</p><p>If you’re a company or student looking for an internship match, take a look at <a href="https://www.techintern.io/">Techintern.io</a> and see how they can help&nbsp;you.</p> A “set it and forget it” auth&nbsp;solution <p>Since adopting Magic, Daniel and his team never have to deal with a password reset. Which is great, especially during their short, high signup volume periods when they’re launching the next round of job postings. The seamless user onboarding and logging in process guarantees that users are able to log in&nbsp;easily.</p><blockquote>“The best part about Magic, for Techintern.io, is that we don’t have to think about the authentication part.”</blockquote><p>Now, they save over 50 hours per month because Magic reduces their auth bug incident rate significantly.</p><p>Had Techintern.io built their own auth solution, they would have had to deal with automated emails (that verify user login), implementing a social login (that may be prone to errors), and more. By outsourcing their auth solution to Magic, Techintern.io can focus efforts on their mission: helping students and companies find the perfect internship match.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-magic-auth-saves-techintern-io-over-50-hours-a-month-1b5ffb4e14a8">How Magic auth saves Techintern.io over 50 hours a month</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Thinking of getting into blockchain? 6 things to consider.  In 2017, during crypto’s last bull run and after years of pointedly ignoring blockchain hype, I jumped down the rabbit hole. I began to see crypto networks as the best coordination tool we’ve ever had. I met the most passionate, curious, interesting people I’ve ever worked with. And I loved that the challenges to overcome were organizatio

 Thinking of getting into blockchain? 6 things to consider. <p>In 2017, during crypto’s last bull run and after years of pointedly ignoring blockchain hype, I <a href="https://dazuck.medium.com/joining-consensys-decentra-mania-bd37858eb2b2">jumped down the rabbit hole</a>. I began to see crypto networks as the best coordination tool we’ve ever had. I met the most passionate, curious, interesting people I’ve ever worked with. And I loved that the challenges to overcome were organizational, economic, and political as much as technical.</p><p>In the past four years, I’ve collaborated with dozens of teams, helped found <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a> (a company) and launch <a href="http://ceramic.network">Ceramic Network</a>, and worked with several DAOs. The potential, challenges, and excitement in the space are still similar to 2017. But the range of experiments, opportunities, and team types is now incredibly broad.</p> What to consider as you jump down the rabbit&nbsp;hole  1. Join a community, not just a&nbsp;team. <p>One of Plaid’s hiring criteria was “Did they read the docs?” In the crypto space, it’s “Did they join the community?”</p><p>Hop into the discord or slack, get a sense of the developers and users and how they are engaged. Picking a team without understanding the community would be like getting engaged before meeting your partner’s friends or&nbsp;family.</p> 2. Be honest about what you’re in it for, and choose accordingly. <p>The pace of activity in the space is completely overwhelming. Make sure you land in a spot where that will drive your motivation not drain&nbsp;it.</p><p>If you enjoy constant, multi-disciplinary, frenetic learning and excitement, happy hours that veer back to interesting ‘work’ topics, and the feeling of a quasi-cult-like movement — you’ve found your tribe. Look for teams that were building through the last few years’ bear market. Protocol teams, DAOs, and the early DeFi builders. Join one working on something you really care about because you’ll need deep motivation to keep focus and&nbsp;energy.</p><p>If you want more balance or stability, the bull run has given rise to more traditional companies — exchanges (the new banks), infrastructure providers (picks and shovels), and creative studios — that build on this movement but in a more familiar setting. It’s a bit more sustainable and ‘normal.’</p><p>If you are in it for the money, there are plenty of DeFi projects with millions of dollars to spend. Or consider keeping your stable income and investing it in&nbsp;crypto.</p> 3. How do you like to&nbsp;work? <p>While the world has been adjusting to remote work, many crypto teams are native to it and push organizational experiments far beyond&nbsp;that.</p>  Do you want an office with teammates? Select for this, as most are&nbsp;remote  Real-time or asynchronous? Plenty of teams work purely off PRs and tickets, gaining massive flexibility but losing face&nbsp;time.  Radically flat, traditional org structure, or experimental? Do you want the empowerment promised by new org designs or the clarity of clear structures?  <p>Could you work for a protocol?</p><p>Many projects aim to (or already have) pass most power to a DAO or community. See how Yearn Finance <a href="https://gov.yearn.finance/t/how-we-think-about-yearn/7137">describes itself</a>. Does the idea of working with complete freedom and a loose association with other community members excite you and feel like the next era of organizations? Or does it seem like the death of coherence, agility, and coordination at scale? Understand a team’s long-term plan for the company and DAO, and if/when that is in the&nbsp;future.</p> 4. How do you gauge progress? <p>Teams have different DNAs for how much to focus on technical advances, growth and sales, the long-term vision, or product adoption. This gap is wider than normal in the blockchain space because we’re so early — there’s so much green space, less obvious metrics, more delayed feedback, and some self-delusion about what’s working and what’s&nbsp;not.</p><p>Understand if teams are <a href="https://www.notion.so/Hiring-post-1dd60bc54c5d4302913951e8d126f02a">engineering, vision, or product-led</a> and what the upsides and downsides to this are, and think about whether those will match your own instincts. If you are instinctively drawn towards growth but the team holds ideology more dear, you could be very frustrated with the roadmap and strategy.</p> 5. Understand crypto compensation. <p>Startup employees are used to salary, bonus, and equity. In crypto, there are also tokens. They are more liquid, more volatile, often higher upside, and sometimes far less tax-efficient than stock options. Know your situation and what combination of income you care about, and make sure the team you join is keeping the incentives of the founders, team, and investors aligned for the long term. <a href="https://ricburton.substack.com/p/the-liquidity-liability">This article</a> offers a good&nbsp;primer.</p> 6. Principles and values matter more than&nbsp;ever. <p>Culture is what defines behavior in the absence of clear rules, and in projects with smaller teams and bigger communities, the early norms and values carry more burden than ever. Understand both what the team stands for and how they instantiate their values in their operations and their community.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1343366729427079169">As Vitalik said</a>, “Even a billion dollars can’t compete with a project having a soul.” Make sure you believe fully in the culture being created and can see yourself as one of its core carriers.</p> 3Box Labs is&nbsp;hiring <p>At <a href="http://3boxlabs.com">3Box Labs</a>, we are on a mission to transform the web’s relationship with data.

<p>Imagine if you could identify, analyze, and fix <a href="https://spike.sh/incidents">incidents</a> before customers tell you about&nbsp;them.</p><p>That’s what <a href="https://spike.sh/">Spike.sh</a> is focused on. Spike.sh helps bring clarity and transparency to incidents for faster resolve time. Without writing any code, you can get unlimited alerts via phone, SMS text, email, and Slack for any issues in your software&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Their <a href="https://incidents.sh/">newest product</a> takes this one step further, helping dev teams with a modern “days without incident” timer.</p><p>Leading up to launch, the Spike.sh team decisively steered clear of the pain and security risk associated with password-based authentication. By implementing Magic, they were able to speed up cycles, rapidly iterate on the core product, and cut time to market in&nbsp;half.</p> The high cost of passwords <p>With Incidents Timer, you can keep track of major incidents with a simple to use and beautifully designed experience.</p><p>When considering authentication and onboarding, co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/thepruth">Pruthvi Haral</a> wanted to ensure that product simplicity came through for developers and end-users.</p><p>From experience as a developer and Product Manager, he knows first-hand how complex and time-consuming building standard username and password auth from scratch can&nbsp;be.</p><blockquote>“Auth has never been something I liked to work on. The headaches just never end. Even for the smallest product, you have to deal with the signup form, login form, forgot password form, reset passwords form, email deliverability, design,&nbsp;etc.”</blockquote><p>Prior to Spike.sh, Pruthvi worked full-time on another developer-first product. That experience opened his eyes to the vast range of challenges that come with maintaining passwords. Between plaintext, hashing, and storage, password-based authentication was not worth reinventing the wheel — especially with the core product as the competing priority.</p><p>With these learnings in mind, it became clear that passwordless auth — specifically, email magic links that Slack helped popularize — provided a seamless onboarding flow without sacrificing security or&nbsp;UX.</p> Secure, passwordless login <p>Pruthvi discovered Magic through <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/">OnDeck</a>, finding exactly what his team needed to sidestep passwords. After testing it out locally, the team was immediately impressed with the slick design and smooth user experience.</p><p>Coupled with the “security specialization, dashboard benefits, and startup perks”, it was a no-brainer decision to implement magic links for Incidents Timer.</p><blockquote>“I was pleasantly surprised there was a product that simplified magic links! Magic checks all the boxes — easy to implement, founded by security experts, backed by amazing investors.”</blockquote> 2X faster time to&nbsp;market <p>With help from Magic, Spike.sh cut down time on passwordless authentication considerably — from what would have been several weeks and cycles, into just a matter of days. This win led to an even bigger win: time savings meant the team could launch their newest product into the world, 2X&nbsp;faster.</p><blockquote>“Velocity is vital for lean teams. With Magic, we could dedicate more time and energy towards launching sooner and growing our newest product.”</blockquote><p>What started as a need to solve their own pain points quickly evolved into a way to give back to the community. Incidents Timer is free for software&nbsp;teams.</p><p>This latest release strengthens Spike.sh’s goal to make it simple for developers to manage alerts swiftly and deliver more reliability for customers. Because every dev optimizes for speed. Especially when it comes to incidents.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/spike-sh-went-passwordless-with-magic-and-accelerated-time-to-market-2x-70d9d4e02e">Spike.sh went passwordless with Magic and accelerated time to market 2X</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the first of two blogs on our new White Paper: <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transformation At Scale</a>. The first blog focuses on the infrastructure challenge; the next on the need for supporting, enabling institutions.</p><p>It’s now widely understood that the way our society collects and uses personal data generates wide scale invasions of privacy, endemic risks of data breaches and fraudulent access to data, plus eye-watering imbalances of power and reward which, together, have led to a pervasive erosion of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>What’s less widely understood is that all these problems and issues are an inevitable byproduct of how the system itself is organised: its organisation-centric structure — the fact that the only entities really capable of collecting and using personal data at scale are large organisations. No matter how well-meaning new rules, policies and regulations might be, as long as this structure remains, the problems will&nbsp;remain.</p><p>New rules, policies and regulations may help to clear up the mess created by the systemic leaking bucket, but in themselves they can never fix the leak itself. For that we need structural reform.</p> An infrastructure challenge <p>Our society has faced similar challenges many times before. When the industrial revolution hit us, it dawned on people that if this new system was to work effectively, the entire population would need to be able to read and write. We needed an education system.</p><p>The rapid growth of cities created immense sanitation and public health problems: everyone needed running water and sewers. When electricity came along, letting every Tom, Dick and Harry create their own generating stations using different frequencies and distribution methods clogged the system with nightmarishly high costs and complexity. We needed a national&nbsp;grid.</p><p>In each case, it was recognised that for the good of the society, its economy and its citizens we need infrastructure that made things universally available.</p><p>The same goes for personal data. The toxicities created by our current systems can never be addressed, and the full potential of data can never be unleashed, unless every citizen is able to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, just as every citizen was previously empowered to read and write and access water and electricity for their own purposes. Doing so makes the whole system work&nbsp;better.</p> The scale of the challenge <p>To achieve such a change however, we need to get over some mountainous obstacles. At Mydex CIC, we believe we have found such a route through. Our new White Paper <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transformation At Scale</a> explains&nbsp;how.</p><p>To make any real headway we first have to overcome some formidable mental roadblocks. The biggest of these is market myopia — the assumption that the only way forward is to ‘create markets for data’. This is nonsense on two counts. First, none of the economic benefits of what Mydex CIC does around personal data come from trading data for money. They come from helping people and service providers strip out the huge amounts of unnecessary waste and cost they both experience when trying to handle data. Taking cost out of how the system works is not the same as creating a ‘market’ where data is traded or&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Closely related to market myopia is accounting myopia: the belief that the best or only way to measure the economic contribution of an enterprise is to see how big its accounting profits are. This, too, is nonsense. The social and economic value of electricity is measured by all the uses we put electricity to, not the profits electricity suppliers happen to make. (Try imagining your life without electricity.)</p><p>Only when we look past market and accounting myopia, to look at all the different ways personal data can be used to improve peoples’ lives (and the economic operations that make this possible), can we see just how big the prize of new ways of collecting and using personal data could&nbsp;be.</p><p>Practically and operationally speaking, the biggest challenge is to create a system where new ways of collecting and using personal data can operate at scale. Here, the Mydex roadmap is simple and straightforward. First, focus efforts on where the resistance is lowest and immediate benefits are highest: what we call ‘clusters’. These are situations where a number of different public and third sector organisations are all helping the same individuals in their own specialist ways, but where to create the best possible ‘joined-up’ outcomes, lots of data needs to be shared. Mydex’s personal data store infrastructure makes it easy, cheap and safe to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, in a world where despite immense amounts of bravado and rhetoric anything truly innovative is instinctively seen as ‘very risky and therefore to be avoided’, seeing is believing. So we are using these clusters to demonstrate proof points. To show, without doubt, that what we are talking about actually&nbsp;works.</p><p>Third, in serving these clusters, we have developed solutions that can be quickly and easily applied time and time again across multiple different situations — so that they can spread. Examples include being able to use previously checked and certified information to be shared safely and efficiently, or to use improved data sharing to help multiple different service providers coordinate and integrate activities. These needs arise in countless different situations across all industries and many aspects of individuals’ lives and can now be met quickly, easily and at very low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>So what we have created is something that proves in practice that it’s possible to strip out enormous amounts of friction, effort, risk and cost while opening up new opportunities; that has near universal applicability; and can be easily adopted by multiple different users.</p> Conclusion <p>It’s not enough to identify what’s wrong with how things work today. What’s needed is practical ways forward that deliver real benefits now; that once created can be reapplied and spread so that they operate at scale — thereby changing how the system itself works. It took us over a decade to find a path through the mountain range of obstacles. Our new <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">White Paper</a> maps this pathway in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>But the right sort of infrastructure alone is not enough. For this infrastructure to work and spread as it should, it needs the right institutions to support it: institutions that focus on broader social and community benefit and not just corporate benefit, and that are capable of building trust between multiple different stakeholders. That’s why Mydex has chosen to be a Community Interest Company. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/our-new-white-paper-achieving-transformation-at-scale-f97320f8447e">Our New White Paper: Achieving Transformation At Scale</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Verus Announces New Multicurrency, Multichain DeFi Protocols and Immediate Public Availability of Fully Functional, Multichain Testnet  Without any programming, you can now create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, your government, your projects, a worthy cause, your family, or your next decentralized application suite. Send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease. Even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the&nbsp;way.  A New Era of&nbsp;Crypto <p>All of these features are currently available on Verus testnet (VerusID is already on mainnet), and the community is in high gear, hardening and preparing the testnet protocols for mainnet release. The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. It is accessible from the released versions of <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop-wallet">Verus Desktop</a> and <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/command-wallet">Verus CLI wallets</a>, and it is the beginning of a new age in crypto. There are so many things you can do with Verus that you cannot with any other cryptocurrency platform, and you can try them all&nbsp;today.</p><blockquote>Capabilities which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform&nbsp;today</blockquote><p>As Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today’s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all.</p><p>The Verus testnet, available in the <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop-wallet">Verus Desktop</a> or <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/command-wallet">CLI wallets</a> as VRSCTEST, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are not available on any other decentralized platform&nbsp;today.</p><p>1. Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) with zero-knowledge privacy support (VerusID) — Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.</p><p>The Verus network and all PBaaS chains also support zk-SNARK, zero-knowledge privacy for private transactions and messages. When combined with VerusID, Verus becomes the only blockchain network in the world with zero knowledge privacy with friendly-name IDs.</p><p>2. Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault) — Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user’s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.</p><p>3. Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming — Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>4. Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets — Enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to&nbsp;100%.</p><p>The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p><p>5. Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches — Enables the launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized “bridge” converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.</p><p>Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.</p><p>6. Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge) — Enables you to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your currency, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get their pre-conversions (minus network fees) refunded.</p><p>The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as&nbsp;well.</p><p>7. An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale — Allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with seamless, secure sending of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.</p><p>8. Merge mining of up to 22 blockchains simultaneously — Lets you multiply your hashpower by up to 22x by mining multiple chains at the same time, on the same hashpower.</p><p>Verus has no limit on the number of simultaneously running blockchains across its multi-chain network, and rather than requiring more and more hash power and energy to process the scale of transactions that can be supported across all of these chains, Verus makes merge mining up to 22 blockchains easy and automatic by individuals or even&nbsp;pools.</p><p>You can discover and select your favorite projects from across the Verus network using the Verus Desktop, and mine them all, effectively multiplying your hashpower by up to 22x. Start your own project and pay some of your costs by mining other currencies as you mine your own. Each blockchain continues to run on its own independent worldwide network, yet you could make your choices to earn rewards on all or some of the blockchains and participate in their cross-chain operation. Together, Verus automatic merge mining and its 50% proof of stake, 51% hash attack resistant algorithm makes runaway energy costs for crypto mining and transaction processing a thing of the&nbsp;past.</p><p>9. Blockchain fee pools and anti-front running — Addresses MEV and more elegantly solves the EIP1559 problem with a block reward independent economy.</p><p>As DeFi protocols become the new “killer apps” for blockchain, soon to be joined by identity and future NFT models, fees earned by miners and stakers in a block can now often exceed block rewards. This is a natural outcome of blockchains being used for commerce and was a consideration of Satoshi’s as the rewards that would replace block rewards over&nbsp;time.</p><p>When DeFi protocols, VM-based applications, or other functions earning fees are completely separate from the blockchain consensus protocol, as is the case in Ethereum and most other VM-centric systems, miners and stakers often have perverse incentives to reorg the blockchain and capture the blocks with unusually large fees, even after they have been mined by another. The Verus developers consider this a fundamental security flaw in the consensus protocol and are introducing the Verus Fee Pool, which will be operable on all PBaaS chains as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The Verus fee pool is a complete solution to enabling a blockchain economy and works by simply requiring that miners put all fees into the fee pool and then take a fraction of the fee pool as their fee reward. This way, it is always more efficient to continue mining forward, as any large sum of fees will be distributed with exponential decay over the current and future blocks. In addition to the Verus Fee Pool, fees for conversions may be paid in the source currency and are automatically converted to Verus or the native blockchain currency on a PBaaS chain before being exposed to miners as transaction fees, providing an entirely new and complete solution to both the problems of large fee disruptions and integration of DeFi conversions into the consensus security protocol.</p><p>Written by miketout &amp; michaeltoutjr</p> Join the New Era of&nbsp;Crypto <p>Discuss and share ideas on your own blockchain or currency project, or if you need help come to <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">our Discord server</a>.

<p>The final week of April marked the 14th annual OECD Forum on Responsible Mineral Supply Chains — an event that took place virtually this year and brought together speakers and participants from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The week-long virtual forum offered participants a wide variety of sessions with engaging speakers, in over 40 events. With topics ranging from Blockchain in the gold supply chain, to incorporating ESG into responsible sourcing, there was something for everyone and lots to learn from the incredible speakers.</p><p>While there were too many session to attend every one, here are a few key learnings from the&nbsp;forum:</p>  Consumers are demanding more! They want to know where goods come from and expect to see best practices from the companies they purchase from; and if not, they will buy elsewhere. A speaker in one session put it well, saying, “responsible sourcing and ESG is no longer a nice to have, it is necessary.” This is more than a trend — it is becoming a&nbsp;reality.  There needs to be a holistic approach to meeting due diligence standards, and practicing responsible sourcing — everyone has a part to play! This means there needs to be engagement with the mines, customers, companies and local communities that are impacted. Engaging with local communities is important to help understand risk management on the ground and these are the voices that too often have been left out of the conversation. As one speaker said, “we can’t be at odds with local voices, we need more inclusion.”  One major takeaway from the discussions is that responsible sourcing and ESG is a process. We can’t just put programs and standards in place and expect them to work, we need engagement from everyone in the value&nbsp;chain.  Blockchain is an essential tool in the move towards supply chain due diligence and responsible sourcing.  Lastly, and probably most importantly — supply chain due diligence requires buy in from all actors and it requires significant time and effort. We can’t solve ESG problems as individual companies; we need to work together using an industry wide approach to make real change. Many of the speakers highlighted the importance of getting buy-in from suppliers, noting that we need to move from push to pull. We shouldn’t have to force suppliers to get on board. Adapting to changing demands for visibility is good business for everyone.  <p>Overall, the forum provided interesting insights and engaging conversations with industry leaders. While there is still a lot of work to be done, it feels good to hear from so many experienced people making real change in this area. One thing is certain: it is going to take commitment and collaboration from everyone to make global supply chain due diligence a reality and we are committed to being part of that&nbsp;change.</p>

<p>You know those words you see on a car’s side mirror that say ‘objects in the mirror are closer than they appear’? In spite of that warning, it’s always a bit surprising when a car comes zooming past, out of the blue, when you thought it was way back in the distance.</p><p>I had that sort of experience yesterday morning. During my weekly check-in with Alastair from the Holo hosting dev team, he was practically bouncing in his seat. The reason for his excitement, in his words, was that “Holo is ready”. Alastair normally brings a critical, analytical mind to his work. (He ought to; he’s an engineer.) So when I saw him get excited, I knew there was a good reason for it.</p><p>Before you get too excited, though, Holo isn’t going to be in beta tomorrow. He simply meant that it’s finally time to start testing the entire hosting and routing infrastructure.</p><p>There have been some big milestones in the past half year. But <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">the next milestone, hosted Elemental Chat</a>, is the one that brings all the pieces together. It depends on:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain">Holochain</a>,  The <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/envoy">Envoy</a> service and <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/chaperone">Chaperone</a> browser library (I’ll get to them in a bit),  Network plumbing to help hosts reliably punch through home firewalls, including a proxy server,  A registration flow to get hosts onto the network,  The resolver service, a ‘matchmaker’ that connects web users to hosts,  Centralised and decentralised routing infrastructure to securely deliver web users’ requests to their chosen hosts,  An <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-nixpkgs">operating system</a> that brings Holochain and the Envoy together on HoloPorts.  <p>Alastair told me that all these foundations are solid now. The routing infrastructure has been in place for a long time, Holochain’s big bugs (including <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/#keeping-bad-actors-out-of-the-network">lockups when a host fails</a> to create an app instance for a web user) have been <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/744">eradicated</a>, the proxy server and gossip protocol are getting some <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/752">performance boosts</a>, and the weird edge cases involving a user <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/#preserving-your-agency">closing their browser too soon</a> have been addressed.</p><p>If you’d gotten used to the rapid HoloPort updates over the turn of the new year, like I had, you were probably concerned by the slowdown in the following months. Alastair explained the reason for that too: during our previous release cycles, we involved testers as early as possible. This gave the dev teams a lot of insight into what was and wasn’t working, but it also created a lot of extra work. Our pre-release testers have been absolutely wonderful — they’ve dedicated big chunks of their free time to helping us chase down bugs. But it’s been a lot of work for them, and the communication and coordination have demanded a lot from our small team as well.</p><p>So for this release (and the previous minor release), the Holo and Holochain dev teams have put everything through much more rigorous testing before it even reaches internal QA. Once it passes, we expect to have a lot fewer pre-release cycles before it goes out to all HoloPorts — perhaps none at all. And then the fun begins, as all the HoloPort owners invite the web to try out this peer-to-peer chat app for the first time!</p><blockquote>We also intend to hire a QA and software delivery manager to streamline this whole process in the future. If you have experience juggling QA, community testers, and deployments, <a href="https://holo.host/careers/product-owner-release-coordinator/">this might be you</a>!</blockquote><p>I could tell that Alastair was relaxed about the future of Holo development. With this solid foundation, he said, developing and delivering new features like HoloFuel and the Service Logger app (which tracks resource usage and bills app publishers) is going to get easier and faster.</p> So what are Envoy and Chaperone? <p>Envoy is a service that lives on every HoloPort and connects its Holochain runtime to the centralised Holo routing infrastructure and, ultimately, the web user on the other end. It provisions a hApp instance for a user and asks the user's browser to sign data that Holochain is about to store and publish on their behalf.</p><p>Chaperone, on the other hand, is a library that runs in the user’s browser. It handles registration and sign-up, using cryptographic magic to keep the user's secrets (password and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#public-key-cryptography">private key</a>) from ever leaving the browser. That means they'll never get stolen in a massive database hack, and the HoloPort never has the power to do things the user doesn't want.</p><p>The Holo devs have often found themselves working against the centralised assumptions baked into web browsers and the HTTP protocol. Many of the challenges came from security restrictions that keep you safe in the centralised world, but they don’t make sense in a cryptographically secured P2P world where you’re in control of your keys.</p><p>In the process of meeting these challenges, the Holo devs came up with a final design that I think is more user-friendly. Previously you had to sign in on every new Holo-hosted page you visit, even if you’d been there before or were already signed in on another browser tab. Now your session stays active across browser tabs and even after quitting and restarting your web browser. This is <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-look-at-the-holo-testnet-coming-soon/#holo-hosting-infrastructure-nothing-special-">nothing special</a> for traditional web apps, so it’s great to see it coming to Holo. It means that dApps are finally going to start feeling pretty usable.</p><p>If you like technical details, you might want to read this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-to-break-a-holo-app/#a-look-at-how-a-holo-hosted-happ-can-break">old blog post about Chaperone and Envoy</a>. It was written when the devs were still deep into creating and debugging these components.</p> What’s next? <p>Right now we’re in internal QA testing. We expect to invite the pre-release testers into hosted Elemental Chat soon (perhaps by the time you read this) — first as users, then as hosts. We don’t expect to find any big bugs, but we hope we’ll discover edge cases that we hadn’t hit during development. If no critical edge cases show up, we’ll release hosted Elemental Chat to all hosts and invite the web to try it out.</p><p>Looking forward to seeing you there sometime soon! (If you have an invite code, of course 😉)</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@niuhang?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">hang niu</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/car-mirror?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>As we move towards a world of digital identity, many ways of sharing and verifying Personally Identifiable Information are emerging. Two such modes that we’ll talk about today are Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials.</p> What are Open&nbsp;Badges? <p>At the most basic level, Open Badges are a format for issuing digital badges and are often associated with certifying educational proficiency, skills, and job-related achievements. It is verifiable, portable, and contain relevant information such&nbsp;as,</p>  Date of&nbsp;Issue  Date of&nbsp;Expiry  Name of the&nbsp;Issuer  Name of the Recipient  JSON-LD object that describes the qualification or&nbsp;skill  Digital Signature  Badge Name  Badge Criteria  Badge Description  <p>Here is an example of Open Badges from IMSGlobal.org</p><p>Breaking this down a bit, there are three major parts in Open badges and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Assertions — Representation of a badge that is packaged as a JSON object with a bunch of mandatory and optional properties. In other words, it shares information about a badge belonging to an&nbsp;earner.  Badge — This is the actual accomplishment recognized by the issuer. There can be many skills and accomplishments in the same&nbsp;badge.  Issuer — Gives information about the entity issuing the badge, typically a university, a company, or a learning&nbsp;center.  <p>Open badges are being increasingly adopted by universities and other micro-credential organizations to issue achievements and skill accomplishments for entities. Typically, these badges are sent to the earners and in turn, the earners can hold and collect these badges, and can share them easily with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Here’s how a collection of badges looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://iite.unesco.org/highlights/open-badges-new-opportunities-to-recognize-and-validate-achievements-digitally/">UNESCO Institute</a></p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p>Verifiable credentials, or VCs in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. Verifiable Credentials are:</p>  Machine readable and verifiable  Cryptographically tamper-proof  Privacy preserving  <p>You can read about verifiable credentials <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">here</a>.</p><p>Here is how a VC looks&nbsp;like</p><p>Similarities between Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials</p><p>There are many similarities between open badges and verifiable credentials and some of the important ones&nbsp;are:</p>  The fundamental idea of both models is to allow the owners of a credential to store it safely in a digital wallet and share it with any entity of their choice. In other words, it gives holders/earners complete control over their credentials/accomplishments.  Allow the expression of a cryptographically verifiable claim involving issuers, holders, credentials, and verifiers.  Secure and&nbsp;portable  Both allow holders to compile and share their information the way they want. For example, a holder can gather different accomplishment and skill badges, combine these visual badges, and send it to the receiver. Likewise, the holder of a verifiable credential can compile all the required VCs into a verifiable presentation and send it to the verifier.   Differences between Open Badges and Verifiable Credentials <p>On the face of it, both Open badges and verifiable credentials may seem similar, but still, there are many differences between&nbsp;them.</p> Immutability <p>Verifiable credentials use the “proof” property to verify that a credential is immutable while the digital signatures prove the identity of issuers and&nbsp;holders</p><p>Open badges, by themselves, don’t have this immutable property though digital signatures are present to prove the authenticity of the issuer. Blockcerts, a blockchain implementation of Open badges, uses the timestamps of blockchains to achieve this immutability. But some implementations involving HTTP don’t have this property.</p> Applications <p>So far, Open badges have mostly been implemented in the education sector to add credibility to informal education and to endorse specific skills or experience of the holder. It is also used for employment verification to a limited&nbsp;extent.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, have a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">wide range of applications in real life</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">story</a> of how VCs can be used in real-world situations.</p> Standard Implementation <p>The implementation of verifiable credentials has been standardized by w3c.org that advocates the use of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> as the URI. Also, digital signatures help to keep these credentials secure and authentic.</p><p>Open Badges doesn’t have a standard implementation and it is left to different organizations to use a set of optional properties to create them. Though some mandatory properties must be present, there could be variations in the implementation.</p><p>In fact, Open badges have two verification methods,</p>  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#HostedBadge">HostedBadge</a> that uses&nbsp;HTTP  <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#SignedBadge">SignedBadge</a> that uses a JSON Web Signature   Visual Representation <p>Often, Open Badges are represented as a badge that contains detailed metadata such as the name, issuer, and description. All this information is baked into the image, so any Open Badge-compatible application can display this information. This visual representation is also what makes it highly portable.</p><p>In VCs, all information is encrypted and protected by digital signatures, so the information is not readily visible to everyone, except those who have the public keys to verify the authenticity of the issuer and the&nbsp;holder.</p> Verifiability <p>Open badges require third-party tools to explicitly verify whether the information contained in it. So, verifying Open badges could entail more resources such as subscription/payment for using the verification tool and dependencies on third-party providers.</p><p>VCs, on the other hand, have verifiability built in through digital signatures, so additional tools are required.</p><p>Here’s a table that sums up these differences.</p><p>In all, VCs are a defined and standardized implementation of digital identity whereas Open Badges is more open-ended where organizations can use HTTP or web signatures to implement them.</p><p>But that could change shortly as there are <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/final-documents/open-badges-are-verifiable-credentials.md">efforts</a> to use the VC specifications to implement Open Badges to make the most of the benefits in both&nbsp;models.</p> When to Use Open Badges and&nbsp;VCs? <p>Open Badges are a good choice for universities and learning centers that don’t offer a degree, but still want to formalize the efforts and accomplishments of students. Since the credentials can be baked into a badge, it can be useful when students have a web portfolio or personal websites through which they want to showcase their accomplishments to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Verifiable credentials, on the other hand, are more suited for issuers with authorities who backup a claim made by a holder. For example, when a user claims that he is over 18 years of age, a date of birth VC issued by the local city/county/state validates this claim. Since these are machine verifiable, it can be used across multiple scenarios.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

 Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, discusses how Self Sovereign Identity solutions will reshape the way we share data on the&nbsp;internet <p>Every time you click onto the internet, you add to your digital identity, creating a virtual memory of who you are, what you look at, and where you spend your browsing time. Have you ever wondered where this identity exists and who has access to it? As it stands, internet users have very little oversight over the personal information they share with different platforms and how this is managed and stored. As the world increasingly moves online to offer key services, users must strive for better protection. In order to do so, it is essential that they are equipped with the right information and&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions can help to facilitate this. Using blockchain to empower users, SSI solutions help users to take back control of their identity online by ensuring security and data management are at the forefront of every exchange.</p><p>Current limitations on data protection across the internet mean that users too often blindly accept cookies and hand over their data to renowned hoarders. Cookies are little text files that websites store on your computer in order to track your activity. Regular cookies are essential for tracking your browser preferences and settings, however, third party cookies pose a more significant threat to your privacy as they track user settings across various websites, making it possible for companies to monitor your browsing activity long after you have left their platforms.</p><p>In its most simple form, this means that companies can show you targeted ads on a platform such as Instagram for products that you may have looked at on a totally different platform weeks before. In its more sinister form, this could mean that companies are able to record, analyze, utilize, and potentially share a virtual map of everything you do on the internet.</p><p>On a macro scale, the unchecked harvesting of data as facilitated by the likes of cookies and other technologies can have significant implications for user privacy. Showcasing this, a massive data breach recently exposed the private emails and numbers of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/04/06/facebook-data-breach-heres-what-to-do-now/?sh=6e91234b5708">533 million users</a>, making it extremely easy for hackers and scammers to target users across the globe. European Commissioner <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/new-eu-laws-will-take-on-dominance-of-big-tech-1.4429055">Margrethe Vestager</a> has gone as far as to accuse tech giants of “monopolistic practices that tilt the market, perpetuating their dominance while reducing consumer choice and squeezing out competition.”</p><p>The unilateral control of virtual marketplaces by large companies, which facilitate the existence of other smaller businesses within their networks, means that they have ultimate control over what information and products are shown to which consumers. The smallest amount of consumer data can be collected and managed across internal different pools, not to mention shared across different platforms. This can then be reused and remodelled for thousands of different applications through human or systematic interference without any user knowledge. With access to myriad amounts of invaluable user data, these companies are able to shape user experiences and hone their marketplaces so that they remain on&nbsp;top.</p><p>While it would be easy to lay the blame at the feet of Big Tech companies, they are not the only ones that track the activity of their customers. Small businesses, educational institutes, and even <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/website-tracking-software">news channels</a> track users in order to learn about browsing times on their websites, what they clicked on, and various other things. This helps them to get insights about the people using their platforms and what their needs are. On the whole this process is beneficial for improving products and services based on user activity. It is when the tracking goes beyond the acceptable confines of data collection, through the likes of third party cookies, that companies’ practises must be reprimanded.</p><p>In no other industry are you unequivocally required to exchange personal information in order to enter a public domain or buy products. Imagine if before purchasing your groceries or even entering a supermarket you were asked to write down your email and hand it to an employee who would then store it within the company’s personal records. This would never be allowed — so why do consumers passively accept the same practices online? The answer is that they are lacking the necessary information and technology to guard themselves against hostile tracking of their private information.</p><p>A recent study by the <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">Pew Research Centre</a> found that 81% of participants said that t<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">he potential risks they face because of data collection on the internet outweigh the benefits</a>. This clearly suggests that consumers are not comfortable with how companies collect and store their personal information. The argument that consumers are happy to benefit from unchecked targeted advertising and tailored posts seems highly contentious in light of these findings.</p><p>Users clearly want to protect their personal information and place barriers between companies and their data where necessary. The onus therefore is on tech companies to provide them with the right tools and information to do so. Blockchain can play a major role in placing consumers back in the driving seat with data privacy, by allowing them to control the private information on a network which only approved individuals can access. Self-Sovereign Identity solutions should be implemented in order to facilitate control of personal information by consumers.</p><p>To break it down, SSI systems give users a unique identifier that they can use to manage their identity and access online services using only one ID. This provides a means of data authorization and ownership confirmation, giving respective users actual control of a particular asset. The systems use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to assure that services only access the specific data they require to verify identity, thereby ensuring privacy protection and limiting the potential for services to continue tracking users’ activity beyond the realm of what they approve or even see. Different entities can also build strong trust relationships amongst themselves through mutual authentication between entities, meaning that the sharing of information can be facilitated between parties in a way that is agreed beforehand.</p><p>As the world increasingly moves online to offer key services, whether these be economic, healthcare-based, or educational, it is essential that consumers have better oversight of how they are sharing personal information. Technology companies must move to equip users with the tools they need to effectively manage their data. Using blockchain, SSI solutions empower users to control their identity online by ensuring security and data management are at the forefront of any exchange. Going forward this system offers a pathway for a new way of operating on the internet, where users are in control of their data and how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq,&nbsp;Inc.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-solution-to-the-internets-data-hoarding-problem-a93c9f0b158f">The Solution To The Internet’s Data Hoarding Problem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce a new addition to our MATTR VII platform capabilities. As we continue to build out an extensive suite of features to support the exchange of data such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, we have now added secure <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID) messaging capabilities to enable entirely new ways to communicate using our platform.</p><p>The common and well-understood ways to interact with verifiable credentials have typically been mechanisms such as scanning QR codes or sharing deep links. In this release, we have focused on adding an option to these approaches that provides an even greater level of transparency and user control. With this new capability, you will be able to facilitate more intuitive user flows that make issuing, verifying, and communicating around verifiable credentials a seamless and efficient process for users. While utilizing existing frameworks like push notifications, secure DID messaging maintains a high level of privacy-preserving security. It does this by leveraging a decentralized ecosystem that ensures control of the data in a message remains solely with the participants exchanging the information, and no one&nbsp;else.</p><p>Utilizing the JSON Web Message (JWM) specification, this new capability allows for encrypted messages to be sent and received in a way that hides their content from all but the cryptographically authorized recipients of the message. That way, the sender of the message can be confident they are only disclosing their details and message with the intended&nbsp;parties.</p><p>There are two key pieces of information about a recipient that are fundamental to facilitating secure DID-based messaging on the platform. The first of these is the same as any messaging framework, in that an address or endpoint is needed to understand where to send the message. Unlike traditional messaging capabilities that require you to utilize centralized, service provider created, and controlled identifiers such as email and phone numbers, our DID-based messaging solution allows you to facilitate interactions between parties simply by using a Decentralized Identifier and its associated DID Document. The second piece of information you need is the recipient’s public key, which the platform obtains from the resolved DID document. This public key is then used to encrypt a message to the recipient.</p><p>These capabilities ensure&nbsp;that:</p>  a message is delivered to the correct recipient, and  only the intended recipient can view the content and other metadata of the&nbsp;message.  <p>A unique DID is also created by the wallet specifically for each unique interaction with a particular party or organization — further preserving a wallet holder’s privacy and anonymity between the various interactions they may have with issuers and relying parties&nbsp;alike.</p><p>Once the recipient’s DID is known, a message is formatted as a <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/jwm-a-new-standard-for-secure-messaging-a21d3daa4403">JSON Web Message (JWM)</a>. In this release, we have focused on adding support for 3 main types of messages:</p>  Offering a credential — rather than the user having to scan a QR code, a message can be sent directly to them that will initiate the credential offer flow within their&nbsp;wallet.  Notification about a change in the revocation status of a credential — a mechanism to ensure wallet holders are proactively informed about any status changes for credentials they hold in their wallet, even if they’re not online when the status update&nbsp;occurs.  Starting a credential verification flow (presentation request) — allows a holder to present a credential to a verifier directly, particularly useful in situations where there isn’t a co-location of parties present in the interaction.  <p>To take advantage of this capability as a wallet user, all you need to do is opt into receiving messages by enabling notifications in your wallet. At this point, a private cloud-based inbox will be created to store messages that are sent to your&nbsp;device.</p><p>Messages remain encrypted in the inbox and are only persisted in storage while they are in an unread state. Once the user views the message and its payload is extracted into their wallet, the encrypted message is removed from the inbox and only the payload itself is retained in the user’s&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>To give an example, let’s say you call up your bank and they are required to sight a form of government-issued identification in order to revalidate their anti-money laundering (AML) records. Given the bank already has an established relationship with you from your prior communications, they will likely have your DID stored in their system. Using this information, they push a message containing a presentation request to you. This request is then processed by the wallet on your phone and triggers a push notification to make you aware of the&nbsp;update.</p><p>Upon receiving the push notification containing the message, the wallet app will decrypt and extract the payload. In this instance, it contains a presentation request that asks you to select the credential to share back to the bank as proof of your identity. Once you have shared the credential presentation to match their request, the bank verifies that it satisfies their requirements giving them assurance that they are talking to the correct person and that they have met their audit requirements from an AML perspective. This allows them to continue the call with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Bringing secure messaging into our platform helps facilitate a more intuitive user experience with mobile wallets and helps simplify some of the otherwise complex issuance and verification flows that might otherwise involve scanning multiple QR codes or accessing different embedded&nbsp;links.</p><p>We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the community on the underlying messaging and security standards as well as gathering feedback from our customers and the broader ecosystem around ways to enhance and extend the different types of messages, along with ways to digest them into different kinds of interactions and experiences.</p><p><a href="https://mattr.global/get-started/">Sign up</a> on our website today to get access to MATTR VII and check out <a href="http://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/revocation/revocation-overview">MATTR Learn</a> for a detailed walkthrough to start utilizing messaging as part of a verifiable credential flow.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-support-for-secure-did-messaging-befb75a72feb">Adding support for Secure DID Messaging</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 DeBio Network Partners with KILT Protocol to Embed Credentials into Anonymous-First Platform Used By Genetics&nbsp;Labs <p>6 May 2021, Singapore and Berlin — <a href="https://www.debio.network/">DeBio Network</a> and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> today announced a collaboration to incorporate KILT Credentials into Debio’s anonymous-first platform for medical and bioinformatics data. KILT would serve as the underlying accreditation infrastructure, enabling labs and biomedical facilities to embed credentials on medical test results, genome sequences and interlab collaborations.</p><p>DeBio Network, previously known as Degenics, is building a decentralised platform that will provide synergy between medical and bioinformatics organisations while guaranteeing user anonymity and sovereignty throughout the biomedical data pipeline. The platform is powered by blockchain technology, with an added focus on privacy computing RnD to maximise user and data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>“Debio is designed to prevent genetic data misuse, privacy and security violations, and the practice of selling genetic data without consent. We are implementing transformative technologies — Substrate’s blockchain framework, KILT’s identity protocol and IPFS’s decentralised storage — to fulfill this mission,” said Pandu Sastrowardoyo, initiator of DeBio&nbsp;Network.</p><p>After building its prototype on Ethereum, DeBio shifted to Substrate to benefit from its seamless integration with Polkadot, a scalable, interoperable protocol. DeBio aims to launch a Polkadot parachain later this year and intends to partner with multiple Polkadot ecosystem projects including KILT.</p><p>KILT is a blockchain protocol that enables innovative, industry-agnostic business models around identity. KILT intends to provide DeBio with a mechanism for issuing revocable, verifiable credentials that ensure privacy and data security. Specifically:</p>  KILT would be used for issuing credentials to the laboratories performing the&nbsp;analysis  DeBio would base the credentials of the genome analysis (via a link to IPFS stored report) on&nbsp;KILT  KILT would provide DeBio Network with attestations of lab accreditations  DeBio would base the identities of the “genome owners” on KILT including the payment flow between them and the labs. The goal is to ensure anonymity for the genome owners and give them full control over their&nbsp;data.  Delegation trees would enable bigger labs to lend their trust to small labs or university labs, providing them a new business opportunity via the Token Curated Attestor (TCA)&nbsp;model.  <p>“In building an anonymous-first platform, DeBio Network is transforming medical interactions for consumers — truly a Web3 approach, which is essential for driving the digitisation of the healthcare sector,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH. “Incorporating verifiable credentials through KILT provides users the anonymity needed for such personal data, adding a trust layer that gives users control over their health information.”</p><p>Storage requirements are also a critical element for DeBio’s platform, as some genome sequencing files can reach more than a gigabyte in size. DeBio utilises IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system, in order to meet its storage and performance needs. At the leading blockchain conference ETHDenver in February 2021, DeBio / Degenics was named Winner, Best IPFS Use for Identity, and was also a United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Winner for its fully anonymous home DNA testing marketplace.</p><p>About DeBio&nbsp;Network</p><p>DeBio is an anonymous-first, decentralised platform for medical and bioinformatics data. We are building a decentralised platform for your personal medical needs, starting with genetics. Our concept allows synergy between labs of all scales, while guaranteeing user anonymity and sovereignty at every step of the genomic data science workflow — from sample collection, data storage, to report generation.</p><p>About KILT&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>KILT is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing claim-based verifiable, revocable, and anonymous credentials for Web 3.0. It allows users to claim arbitrary attributes about themselves, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. The protocol offers a simple JavaScript SDK so useful applications can be built without requiring any blockchain development skills. KILT Protocol is developed by BOTLabs GmbH in&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>Press Contacts:</p><p>Pandu Sastrowardoyo — p@blocksphere.id</p><p>Christine Mohan — christine@kilt.io</p>

 What if the platforms didn’t control your identity information, but you could carry it with you? What if identity could be decentralized? 



<p>At the last DWeb Meetup, we were invited to share our role in the German Government’s 60M Euro SDI (Secure Digital Identities) innovation project to bring “Self-Sovereign Identity” to German and EU citizens.</p>



 Why 



<p>We all need a digital identity we own &amp; control, an identity that keeps all its components secure &amp; private.</p>



<p>Such self-owned digital identity must let us seamlessly navigate the digital world while giving us full control over how &amp; which information we share with whom.</p>



 What 



<p>Jolocom is part of three (<a href="https://www.once-project.de/">ONCE</a>, <a href="http://www.id-ideal.de">ID-Ideal</a> and <a href="http://sdika.de">SDIKA</a>) out of four winning teams in a 60M Euro German innovation competition to build the SDI Projects. Developers can integrate our platform-agnostic SSI technology to reach millions of EU citizens across 40 use cases poised to scale.</p>



 Overview 



<p>A brief video introduction to use cases, strategies and challenges of the four German SDI projects:</p>

 Jolocom’s SmartWallet is available now, for everyone, as a free app for your phone. But why would you want it and what does it do? 



 



<p>Put very simply, it’s not that dissimilar to your physical wallet. It belongs to you. You can put in it whatever you want, including proof of identity. Nobody else can see what’s in it, unless you want them to.</p>



<p>But our SmartWallet is not just a digital storage facility. It’s much more.</p>



<p>Just as with a physical wallet, users of the SmartWallet will gather cards and other information over time. For example, your ID card, health insurance card, driver’s license, season tickets, gym memberships and so on.</p>



<p>And, much like a physical wallet, you will be able to use the contents of your SmartWallet to prove your identity, by showing the cards and information you carry to whoever has requested it. However, using self-sovereign identity (SSI) technology the SmartWallet goes further. It gives you complete control over who sees what, as you curate the sources of your identity.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you need new car insurance and the insurance company wants confirmation that you are who you say you are. Through one quick online transaction, the SmartWallet can share with them your driver’s license, ID card and proof of car ownership. So, there’s no more need for a scan of an ID card, or a signed PDF of paper documents that might not even be accepted digitally and have to be sent in the mail. The whole process of establishing identity is completely sped up.</p>



Our two-parts demo to test SmartWallet: receiving the driving license (<a href="https://avalon.jolocom.com/">Avalon</a>) and then using it to register to car-sharing service(<a href="https://aelondo.jolocom.com/">Aelondo</a>).



<p>As mentioned, as soon as you have any proofs of identity in your SmartWallet, it’s completely down to you how you use them and who you share them with. Again, you curate them according to the requests you get.</p>



<p>As for us, all Jolocom does is provide the wallet. Once you’ve downloaded it, we have no further connection with it. We don’t see what you put in it. We don’t see when you take it out. We don’t see what you do with it. Nothing. Just like a physical wallet, it’s yours alone.</p>



<p>If these are the benefits for individuals, the end users, what about the organizations, public and private, governmental and commercial, that work with our SSI and SmartWallet technology? Other than faster transactions with their customers, employees or clients, what do they get?</p>



<p>Essentially, using SSI technology will allow an organization to improve its processes. It will make them cheaper and more secure, plus improve their ability to preserve privacy. That means GDPR compliance can be handled much more effectively.</p>







<p>The processes built using SSI technology will give those organizations four major checks in any interaction with a user, being:</p>



  Whose identity it is  Whether it’s been changed since it was verified by a third party  Who the verifying third party is.  Whether it’s been revoked.  



<p>Not only that, but the format this data is held in is very portable, so it can be moved from one organization to another easily and without losing the context or technical interoperability. Or to put it another way, SSI technology using the SmartWallet gives organizations a lot more freedom to achieve interoperability with each other. You might compare this to the way standardized shipping containers have revolutionized international logistics. The format we use for SSI will do the same with any imaginable proof you might need.</p>



<p>In addition to all this, once users have set up a SmartWallet, further onboarding processes become speedier and less involved for the users and the organizations they are interacting with. No longer having to go through an exhaustive registration process each time something new is issued or signed up for delivers a considerably improved user experience.</p>



<p>But if this is what Jolocom’s SmartWallet does, what else is there that makes it unique?</p>



<p>Firstly, our wallet is both production-ready and fully supports GDPR compliance. That means it’s ready to be used now, and provides users and organizations with the privacy guarantees that European law demands.</p>



<p>Secondly, the app has been designed expressly with the challenge of uptake in mind. We’ve considered user experience at every step of the way to create an intuitive interface and the best onboarding flow. We want people’s experience of SSI and their SmartWallets to be fun, so we’ve made ours playful and the onboarding process a pleasurable experience rather than a chore.</p>



<p>Finally, and most importantly, at Jolocom our goal and abiding principle is that everyone should be able to use SSI technology. That’s why we’ve made our SmartWallet and other products openly auditable on Github, and as accessible as possible. Unlike many other SSI solutions, you don’t need to be a part of a specific network or grouping to use our products. Because our technology is agnostic to the separate networks, it will allow you to interact and interoperate with all of them, thus improving individuals’ flexibility and freedom. That desire to improve flexibility and freedom is what all our design decisions are made on.</p>



<p>Trying it out for yourself is easy. The SmartWallet is available now, from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/jolocom-smartwallet/id1223869062">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jolocomwallet">Google Play</a>. Once installed, visit our demonstration site, <a href="https://avalon.jolocom.com/">Avalon</a>, to give it a whirl.</p>

<p>Data publishers and consumers will be able to verify credentials while preserving privacy</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocolcom">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="http://everest.org">Everest</a> are partnering to add Everest’s global fiat on/off ramps and eKYC with identity creation &amp; credential sharing capabilities to Ocean Protocol and <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>. Everest is a device-free digital transaction protocol enabling digital identity verification for public services through the use of digital identities, electronic wallets, document management, and biometrics.</p><p>As part of the collaboration, Ocean granted funds to Everest to enable these capabilities for their community. Ocean Market users and businesses could benefit from fiat in/out, which necessitates identity verification. Similarly, data consumers want the ability to verify that users’ and business’ data truly belong to the individual or the business from whom they originated.</p><p>To truly monetize one’s data, be it a user or a business, a “real”, deduplicated identity must be associated with a wallet address. Without proof of uniqueness or humanness, a wallet address is as anonymous as a ghost. That said, users and businesses are entitled to their privacy, and thus to pseudonymity, as well as to private credential sharing. (For example, sharing a proof of address without revealing the actual address.) All of these are supported by Everest. With this combination of privacy and transparency, data suppliers and consumers can more easily exchange the value of good, verified&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>Everest’s eKYC solutions and fiat on/off ramps are a welcome addition to the Ocean ecosystem. The essence of Web3 is trust and privacy, and that is exactly what identity verification and private credential sharing are bringing to the table. If a data consumer wants to see a data publisher’s data asset, the consumer will be able to see the publisher’s linked credentials from Everest — all in a privacy-preserving manner, which is fundamental to Ocean’s&nbsp;values.</blockquote><blockquote>– Razvan Olteanu, COO at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>With Everest tools, Ocean users will be able to associate their wallet address with humanness, eKYC status, and convert fiat to crypto and vice versa. As part of a phased approach, Everest will add the ability to process transactions on <a href="https://everchain.eu/">Everchain</a>, its fast and low-cost L2 solution, and other&nbsp;chains.</p><blockquote>The collaboration is accretive to both ecosystems, where Ocean users will get the benefits of the Everest ecosystem (ID tokens staked for various services), and similarly, Everest users will be able to monetize themselves more easily using Ocean Protocol and the OCEAN&nbsp;token.</blockquote><blockquote>– Bob Reid, CEO of&nbsp;Everest</blockquote><p>Find out more about Everest’s Cloud FinTech platform at <a href="http://everest.org">everest.org</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools.

 Bogoshipo强势上线Ardor，探索链游NFT全新玩法 NFT持续出圈 

 WeChat: 近期币安宣布将推出官方NFT平台，这条消息再次引爆NFT市场，毫无疑问，今年是NFT出圈元年，我们看到了他越来越多的可能性，NFT在艺术品上链、被当成具有防伪标志的门票、资产上链、票据服务、游戏等方面均可以创造巨大的价值。 

 NFT即非同质化代币，是一种被称为区块链的数字账本上的数据单位，每个代币可以代表一个独特的数字项目，代币不能互换。设想一下，一个图片，一个gif，一段音乐，或者一个证书。都可以转化为NFT保存、收藏、甚至交易，这在以前是根本没有办法完成的，这便是NFT的魅力所在。

<p>2021 is truly shaping to be a monumental year for MetaMUI Blockchain. The year kicked off with the official mainnet launch of the MetaMUI blockchain. The launch happened on January 3rd, the same date as the anniversary of Bitcoin’s creation. The event was inaugurated by the project’s Founder &amp; CEO, Seokgu “Phantom” Yun in a video recording Titled “Rewriting Satoshi Vision”. This landmark event was crucial in the direction of the MetaMUI project progress in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The next couple of weeks saw the Pre-IEO sale of the MMUI which was an effort to introduce our project and give a chance to more investors participating in MetaMUI community. The community support was amazing as all 3 rounds of the Pre-IEO sale were oversubscribed, and the required resources were promptly secured. And now, we intend to uphold promises made to the community, the first one being the listing of the MMUI on various exchanges.</p><p>In the coming days, we’ll be revealing more information as the build-up continues towards the first official exchange listing of MMUI. It will officially be announced by the exchange the day before listing on the exchange, and we will share the detailed listing schedule. When the listing eventually happens, traders and community members can trade their MMUI and those that missed out on all the rounds of the Pre-IEO sale, will have the opportunity to lay their hands on some&nbsp;MMUI.</p><p>A successful integration will make future integrations with other exchanges more expedient, as our engineers have been through the learning curve. This will greatly scale the future listing on other exchanges around the corners of the&nbsp;world.</p> What is MetaMUI(MMUI)? <p>MetaMUI(MMUI) is a native coin of MetaMUI Blockchain and serves as fuel for its ecosystem. To store and transfer MMUI, we’ve introduced the new MetaMUI Wallet application — which is a Self-Sovereign Identity Wallet designed as a close part of MetaMUI Blockchain.</p><p>The value of MMUI (digital sovereign currency) is controlled and maintained algorithmically by a special AI-based algorithmic engine called ACB (Algorithmic central bank). The MMUI is designed and developed to maintain and increase value over long periods of&nbsp;time.</p><p>For publishing a digital currency, the central bank node of the target currency is required to deposit assets to MUI central bank node. And these assets are collected and maintained by the MUI treasury. We refer to this as project funds. The project funds are used to buy MMUI from the market and increase its demand. Once the demand is high, the MUI ACB sells the coins at a higher value in the market and increases circulation. The circulation is capped at 1 billion coins to prevent cases of hyperinflation.</p><p>SWN Global&nbsp;team</p><p>— — —&nbsp;—</p><p>More About The&nbsp;Project</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a><br>Join our <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram Community Chat</a><br>Get the latest from our Telegram <a href="https://t.me/SovereignWallet_Official">announcement Channel</a><br>Read the MUI MetaBlockchain <a href="https://sovereignwallet-network.github.io/whitepaper/MUI-MetaBlockchain-White-Paper.pdf">Whitepaper</a><br>Download the MUI MetaWallet on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=id.metablockchain.metawallet">Android </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mui-metawallet/id1546698261">IOS</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Zero Trust is a key paradigm for cybersecurity today, used well beyond the security circles. The goal is building cybersecurity that “never (blindly) trusts”, but “always verifies.” This traditionally meant verifying Who has access to What resource. In the past, the Who typically meant a human with a digital identity being given access to some application within an organization. Once the individual was given access to said application, that individual would be verified via an IAM tool’s authentication capability and then authorized based on policy and permissions while logging the transaction in preparation for an audit. This has been standard practice for many years to handle employees, customers, and partners.</p>
 A glimpse into the new world 
<p>But what happens when a digital identity represents more than a human individual and extends to machines such as IoT like devices, workloads, Robot (Bot) / RPA (Robotic Process Automation), or other types of identity in the future? What happens when access to the What resource is no longer on-premises but could also reside in the cloud, multi-cloud, or a Docker container running in Kubernetes somewhere? How do you keep up with the growing list of compliance laws and regulations like FERPA, GDPR, HIPPA, CCPA, SOX, and many others? At this point, you quickly realize that you are not in Kansas anymore (Wizard of Oz reference).</p>
 IGA sits in the middle of identities and resources 
<p>Fortunately, most modern Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions take care of the ever-growing list of different types of Who and regardless of where the What resides. With identities on one side and resources on the other side, IGA sits in the middle handling the Identity Lifecycles Management and Access Governance to resources. Identity Lifecycles Management addresses the joiner/leaver/mover processes and the ability to provision identities, access entitlements, and other identity-related information in the target systems. Access Governance supports the auditing and ensures compliance, such as the review and disposition of user access requests, certification campaigns, and access remediation when violations are found. Access Governance also handles Segregation of Duty (SoD) controls and role and policy management capabilities.</p>
 The principle of least privilege 
<p>One of the tenets of Zero Trust that fits nicely with IGA is the principle of least privilege by never granting more access than is necessary to get any job or workload done with the benefit of limiting lateral movement across the network. However, this is not easy using a more traditional model, in which managers are expected to know all of the different applications and services, roles, compliance considerations, etc. when an access request is submitted for that manager’s approval or the continual recertification of that access.</p>
 AI and Machine Learning capabilities a key differentiator between IGA vendors today 
<p>This again is where a more modern IGA solution can come to help through the use of identity and access intelligence using analytics and AI/ML capabilities, supporting a risk-based, just-in-time provisioning (and de-provisioning) of access. This is also one of the key differentiators between IGA vendors in the market today. Identity and access intelligence can assist by evaluating Who has access to What, the compliance policies under consideration, and assess the least privilege, identity risk, and scoring, perform access modeling, anomaly detection or detect identity, role, entitlement outliers, for example. These modern IGA solutions can also recommend whether to approve or disapprove access requests and, even in low-risk cases, automatically grant and revoke access.</p>
<p>To better understand the challenges of legacy IGA and how IGA continues to evolve along with business environment changes, KuppingerCole invites you to join its KCLive Event - Modern IGA Capabilities for Identity-Centric Security to hear from the experts and inform yourself on how to make the best decision possible for your organization.</p>

 Earlier this month, Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, took part in a webinar panel debate on Decentralized Identity Solutions, alongside the publication of a <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/genesis/99285/an-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-solutions">research report</a> in <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The&nbsp;Block</a>. <p>In today’s world, it is becoming increasingly obvious that managing digital identity remains a huge challenge. Every day we hear about data breaches and hacking scandals. A typical internet user manages between 70–80 different usernames and passwords, while there are on average <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jameslyne/2013/09/06/30000-web-sites-hacked-a-day-how-do-you-host-yours/?sh=3e17e31b1738">30,000</a> websites hacked every day. On the flip side, according to <a href="https://www.penalreform.org/resource/global-prison-trends-2020/">Global Prison Trends 2020</a>, 1.1 billion people in the world are unable to prove their identity, thus obstructing them from accessing vital healthcare, education, and financial resources.</p><p>The Block Webinar, “The State of Decentralized Identity Solutions”</p><p>In April 2021, Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, spoke at a panel titled “The State of Decentralized Identity Solutions” in association with <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The Block</a>, one of the leading research, analysis, and news brands in the digital asset space. Hu Ning was accompanied by experts in the field of digital identity, Daniel Buchner, Senior PM of Decentralized Identity at Microsoft, and Tobias Fox, Co-founder of Serto. The discussion delved into how digital identity applies to everything from financial services to upskilling workforces, and how blockchain infrastructure can be utilized to lay the trust framework for decentralized identity solutions.</p><p>Watch the panel discussion back&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/102427/the-state-of-decentralized-identity-solutions-brought-to-you-by-ontology">here</a>.</p><p>The Block Research Report, “An Introduction To Decentralized Identity Solutions”</p><p>In tandem with the panel discussion, The Block also released a research report titled “An Introduction to Decentralized Identity Solutions”. Read the full report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/genesis/99285/an-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-solutions">here</a>.</p> Key Findings <p>The report’s key findings&nbsp;include:</p>  Blockchain-based decentralized identity solutions are challenging centralized identity management paradigms.  Identity issuers, holders, and verifiers could all benefit from the transfer of ID management processes onto distributed ledgers and blockchains.  While the space is still in its nascency, ID holders, application development companies, and blockchain consulting companies have made exceptional progress.  <p>The Decentralized Identity Landscape, According To The&nbsp;Block</p><p>There are several stakeholders in the decentralized identity system, with numerous organizations developing frameworks for digital identity solutions. The decentralized identity industry is broken into four pillars of key players that are driving adoption: blockchain infrastructure; standards and interoperability; consulting and deployment; and wallets and verification services.</p><p>Leveraging blockchain and public/private cryptography to manage verifications of digital identities presents a whole world of new possibilities where individuals can selectively decide who their information is shared&nbsp;with.</p><p>Check out the full research report <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/genesis/99285/an-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-solutions">here</a>, or watch a replay of the webinar&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/102427/the-state-of-decentralized-identity-solutions-brought-to-you-by-ontology">here</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

<p>The <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> continues to be a central nucleus for thoughtful discussion and development of all things related to digital identity. The most recent workshop, which was held in mid-April, was no exception. Despite the lack of in-person interaction due to the ongoing global pandemic, this IIW was as lively as ever, bringing together a diverse set of stakeholders from across the globe to share experiences, swap perspectives, and engage in healthy&nbsp;debates.</p><p>One common theme this year was the continued development and adoption of BBS+ signatures, a type of multi-message cryptographic digital signature that enables selective disclosure of verifiable credentials. We first <a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">introduced</a> this technology at IIW30 in April 2020, and have been inspired and delighted by the community’s embrace and contribution to this effort across the board. In the year since, progress has been made in a variety of areas, from standards-level support to independent implementations and advanced feature&nbsp;support.</p><p>We thought we’d take a moment to round up some of the significant developments surrounding BBS+ signatures and highlight a few of the top items to pay attention to going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Over the past few months, the linked data proofs <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">reference implementation</a> of BBS+ published a new release that introduces a variety of improvements in efficiency and security, including formal alignment to the W3C CCG <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/">Security Vocab</a> v3 definitions. In addition, support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures was added to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-http-api/">VC HTTP API</a>, making it possible to test this functionality in an interoperable way with other vendors participating in an open environment.</p><p>An important element in enabling BBS+ signatures is using what’s known as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-09">pairing-friendly curve</a>; for our purposes we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. We have seen some promising signs of adoption for this key pair, with multiple Decentralized Identifier (DID) methods — both <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">did:indy</a> from <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> and <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did:ion</a> from <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> — indicating they intend to add or already have support for these keys, allowing BBS+ signatures to be issued across a variety of decentralized networks and ecosystems. This development is possible due to the fact that BBS+ signatures is a ledger-independent approach to selective disclosure, effectively no custom logic or bespoke infrastructure is needed for these digital signatures to be created, used and understood.</p><p>In addition, the Hyperledger Aries project has been hard at work developing interoperable and ledger-agnostic capabilities in open source. The method used to track interop targets within the cohort and ultimately measure conformance against Aries standards is what’s known as an <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">Aries Interop Profile (AIP)</a>. A major upcoming update to AIP will add support for additional DID methods, key types and credential formats, as well as introducing Aries support for JSON-LD BBS+ signatures as part of <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/579">AIP 2.0</a>. This will allow Aries-driven credential issuance and presentation protocols to work natively with BBS+ credentials, making that functionality broadly available for those in the Aries community and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>There have also been a number of exciting developments when it comes to independent implementations of BBS+ signatures. <a href="https://animo.id/">Animo Solutions</a> has recently implemented JSON-LD BBS+ signatures support into the popular open-source codebase <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python</a> (ACA-Py). In another independent effort, <a href="https://trinsic.id/">Trinsic</a> has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/ld-proofs-dotnet">implementation</a> of JSON-LD BBS+ credentials which they have demonstrated to be working in tandem with <a href="https://github.com/trinsic-id/didcomm-v2">DIDComm v2</a>, a secure messaging protocol based on DIDs. Implementations such as these help to demonstrate that open standards are transparent, can be understood and verified independently, and can be implemented with separate languages and tech stacks. They also set the groundwork for demonstrating real testing-driven interoperability via mechanisms such as the VC HTTP API and AIP 2.0. We are continuously looking to improve the documentation of these specs and standards so that their implications and nuances can be more broadly understood by builders and developers looking to engage with the technology.</p><p>On the cryptographic side of things, progress is also being made in hardening the existing BBS+ specification as well as expanding BBS+ to support more advanced privacy-preserving features. A significant development in this area is the work of cryptographer Michael Lodder who has been actively conducting research on an enhanced credential revocation mechanism using <a href="https://github.com/mikelodder7/accumulator-rs">cryptographic accumulators</a> with BBS+. This approach presents a promising alternative to existing solutions that allow authoritative issuers to update the status of issued credentials without compromising the privacy of the credential holder or subject who may be presenting the credential. We see this as another application of BBS+ signatures in the context of verifiable credentials that carries a lot of potential in pushing this technology to an even more robust&nbsp;state.</p><p>There was also initial discussion and tacit agreement to create a new cryptography-focused working group at Decentralized Identity Foundation. As the new WG drafts its charter, the first work item of this group will be the <a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/">BBS+ Signatures</a> spec which defines the cryptographic scheme known as BBS+ agnostic of its application in areas such as linked data signatures or verifiable credentials. In the future, this WG will likely evolve to include other crypto-related work items from the community.</p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the momentum and development building around this technology in the community. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of BBS+ signatures, especially as we gear up to tackle the next set of hard problems in this area including privacy-preserving subject authentication and revocation using cryptographic accumulators. If you’re interested we encourage you to get involved, either by contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/ldp-bbs2020">Linked Data Proofs specification</a>, checking out our <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">reference</a> <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">implementations</a>, or participating in the new WG at DIF, to name but a few of the many ways to engage with this work. We look forward to doing this retrospective at many IIWs to come, documenting the ever-growing community that continues to champion this technology in dynamic and interesting ways.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/iiw32-bbs-and-beyond-1a41634c15b0">IIW32: BBS+ and beyond</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Since launching just three months ago, <a href="https://tryshowtime.com/">Showtime</a> has grown at lightspeed, attracting a vibrant community of over 20,000 art collectors and enthusiasts. I sat down with co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej">Alex Masmejean</a> to understand how Magic helped make it all possible.</p> Tech moves fast. Crypto moves&nbsp;faster. <p>Moving fast without sacrificing user experience is crucial for any startup’s success. Alex told me that’s even more important when working in the world of crypto. “In crypto, the speed of shipping is very, very fast. There was no question — Magic was the only auth product we were going to use at launch,” said&nbsp;Alex.</p><p>Showtime is a new kind of social network, dedicated to showcasing and discovering digital art in the form of NFTs. Its soft, minimalist interface puts artwork front and center — a breath of fresh air compared to the sensory overload of sites like Facebook or Twitter. NFTs can be linked from any number of crypto marketplaces, with artworks ranging from photography to rich, looping 3D renders and everything in between. Pieces vary widely in style, many with organic micro-communities growing around them in the form of comment threads and records of digital ownership.</p><p>Alex set out to build Showtime as a social layer on top of the “otherwise very transactional world” of NFTs. The exponential growth of crypto art and collectibles throughout 2020 made it clear that NFTs were breaking into the mainstream, and a social network seemed like the perfect gateway for people new to the space. All that was left to do was build it, and build it&nbsp;fast.</p><p>When it came to user login, Alex knew that he needed a solution that would provide a simple user experience for both Showtime’s end users and the engineers who had to implement it. That’s where <a href="https://magic.link">Magic</a> came&nbsp;in.</p><a href="https://tryshowtime.com/t/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/22970">Kong 4156</a> by artist Tony Babel via&nbsp;Showtime Auth that works out of the&nbsp;box <p>As a small team getting off the ground with zero funding, Magic made it quick and easy for the founding Showtime team to bootstrap an early prototype and get their product in front of an audience fast. Alex was drawn to Magic’s easy plug-and-play capabilities and ended up sticking with it because he’s confident it enables the best login experience possible for Showtime’s users.</p><blockquote>“To me it was a no-brainer — I had to integrate Magic.”</blockquote><p>Building your own authentication from scratch can take months, not to mention the headaches and liability that come with maintaining security into the future. Showtime was able to fully integrate Magic in just a matter of hours, and they haven’t looked back since. Smirking, Alex told me he “doesn’t even know the pain of having a bad customer experience” thanks to launching with Magic on day&nbsp;one.</p> The art of frictionless login <p>Alex touts Magic as the easiest way for crypto platforms like Showtime to reach a wider audience and ultimately gain mass appeal. No wallets, browser plug-ins, or technical know-how required; visitors just provide an email address and seconds later they’re a Showtime&nbsp;user.</p><blockquote>“It’s the simplest way to onboard people who are new to&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote><p>As popular artists like <a href="https://tryshowtime.com/shavonnewong">Shavonne Wong</a> and <a href="https://tryshowtime.com/3LAU">3LAU</a> began migrating to Showtime, they brought with them large followings that repeatedly flooded the social network with new users from outside the crypto community. Magic was there to help onboard these new users in a snap, giving them a warm welcome. “It’s so simple even my parents can use it,” Alex&nbsp;joked.</p><p>From creating a rough initial prototype to helping usher NFTs into the mainstream earlier this year, Magic’s been there for Showtime every step of the way. With that reliability and peace of mind, the Showtime team has been able to spend their time on what matters most: building a home for the next generation of digital artists and their&nbsp;fans.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-magic-helps-showtime-build-community-around-crypto-art-dccd01a38927">How Magic helps Showtime build community around crypto art</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  SITA, INDICIO PAVE WAY TO SAFER TRAVEL EXPERIENCE WITH LAUNCH OF ARUBA HEALTH APP<p></p>
<p>Using blockchain, the app creates a secure travel credential that is accepted by airlines, hotels and hospitality partners without sharing private health information<br>
</p>  
			   
				
				
				 <p>ORANJESTAD – &nbsp;5 May 2021 – Indicio.tech, together with <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">SITA</a> and the Aruba Health Department, are trialing the Aruba Health App, a pilot that makes it easy for visitors to share a trusted traveler credential – based on their health status – privately and securely on their mobile device. This credential will provide access to participating hospitality sites on the island.</p>
<p>Aruba is focused on rebuilding its tourism industry in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic while ensuring that the risk of infection from people visiting the island is minimized. The island has been less impacted by the pandemic than many other countries globally and is open to most tourists. To ensure their safety, and those of the island’s residents, all tourists are required to provide a negative PCR test taken 72 hours&nbsp; before flying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Aruba Health App, visitors to the island who have provided the required health tests to the Aruba government will be issued with a unique trusted traveler credential, using blockchain technology. This credential then can be verified by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues through the unique QR code on a visitor’s mobile device without sharing any private data. The digital credential also enables the Aruba government to restrict visitors from leaving their hotel rooms until they have received a negative PCR test result.</p>
<p>Unlike immunity passports, these verifiable digital credentials are part of a technology known as decentralized identity, an evolutionary leap forward in individual privacy protection and security. It allows users to share only a trusted verification that they have the relevant documentation to complete their transaction, without having to share personal information. This credential can be used across the journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trial is yet another step towards SITA developing a more durable, secure travel credential that could combine all travel documents such as passport, visa and health information into a single credential that puts the traveler’s privacy first. This credential will provide verification that a traveler has the right documentation, making border crossings more automated, with checks done before departure.</p>
<p>Diana Einterz, SITA President for the Americas, said: “Giving travelers the ability to share verifiable health data with relevant stakeholders throughout their journey will help expedite the industry’s recovery. It is vital to ensure we open borders safely and securely, and this trial puts us one step closer to single travel token that will give passengers more control and convenience by allowing them to securely share their credentials with governments, airports and airlines from their mobile device.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent poll from IATA highlighted that 78% of passengers who took part in the survey would only use a travel credential app if they have full control over their data.</p>
<p>Heather Dahl, CEO of Indico, said: “With the decentralized identity ecosystem we’ve built with SITA for Aruba, we’ve created a path to a better future. We can reopen economies and restart travel without people having to give up their privacy. We’re not just solving a pandemic problem, we’re solving a privacy and security problem. That’s because this technology was designed from the outset to respect a person’s right to control their own data and identity. Aruba and SITA have taken a global lead on privacy-first identity technology for travel, and their pioneering efforts are laying the foundation for a fairer world to come.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dangui Oduber, Aruba’s Minister&nbsp;of&nbsp;Tourism, Public Health and Sport: “The Aruba Health App is fundamental in balancing the dual challenges of reopening our island to tourism while managing the risks of COVID-19. By providing a trusted traveler credential, we can be sure that visitors have the right documentation needed to move freely around the island while making the verification of that trusted status easy without having to divulge personal information. That is a revolutionary step forward.” </p>

<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) has been around since the early 2000s, but has experienced a real coming of age throughout the last couple of years and especially during the pandemic with broadening application. NFC technology is on the rise as it powers our smartphones and credit cards to be used for contactless payments or doors to unlock by the touch of a smart key. Many more applications are possible, many as of yet unforeseen.</p>
<p>For instance, did you know, that Near Field Communication can also be applied during identity verification?</p>
<p>Smartphones as the key to unlocking the power of NFC</p>
<p>NFC can be applied as a means to read out data for the purpose of identification and authentication. In contrast to Optical Character Recognition (reading out a document using a camera and then identifying what is written on the document), NFC reads out data from identification documents that contain RFID chips with the same personal information coded on them as the physical ID. Many are even supplemented by biometric information like a picture, fingerprints and more (biometric IDs).</p>
<p>Back in the 2000s, the application of NFC was not yet widely spread as distinct machines were necessary for operation – a hurdle for day to day usage. However, nowadays almost every person carries what is needed in their pocket, as modern smartphones typically come equipped with the necessary functionality.</p>
<p>The right counterpart – Electronic Identity Documents</p>
<p>NFC-read out obviously requires the right medium to extract information from. Thankfully, most identification documents come equipped with a chip where all relevant information is saved. Institutions like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have been the drivers of creating standards for such documents to assure that countries do not go their own way, but create an ecosystem of interoperability to accommodate the identity needs in a globalized world. The standard <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/icao-9303/">ICAO 9303</a>&nbsp; has been well established and adopted by more than 188 countries, who model documents like passports accordingly and equip them with chips to turn them into ePassports, ready for touch and go identification via NFC-enabled smartphones and other devices.</p>
<p>Security first – Everything in a nutshell</p>
<p>With such highly sensitive data encoded on the chip, security naturally is a top priority. ePassports and similar documents come with an array of security measures to stop fraudsters and identity thieves in their tracks:</p>
 
 Privacy Protection during data read out: To protect ID owners from attempts of “eavesdropping” on the data transmission (trying to skim data during the read out), security measures like the Basic Access Protocol (BAC) are integrated. 
 Measures for Authentication: RFID Chips are typically signed digitally by the issuing country. Every country has its own country certificate, which can be verified to detect forgery and manipulation. The process is called passive authentication. More advanced measures like active authentication and clone authentication are available to evaluate if a real chip has been duplicated. 
 Protection from identity theft: Many electronic IDs do not just contain personal information but also biometric data like a photo and fingerprints. While fingerprints can not be accessed through any other organization than the authorities, the biometric photo saved on the ID can be compared to a selfie recorded during identification to ensure customers are who they claim to be and avoid identity theft. 
 
 Coming soon! NFC capability for IDnow AutoIdent 
<p>IDnow is strongly committed to the NFC technology as a trailblazer for convenience during customer onboarding processes combined with security features at government-level. Besides <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">IDnow eID</a>, which uses this technology for identifying users based on their German electronic ID and government-issued PIN, we will also add NFC capability to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow AutoIdent</a>&nbsp;to integrate the fraud and identity theft detection capabilities into the AutoIdent process while providing a great user experience through speedy onboarding with a high degree of automation. Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>All of us have many unique identifiers/credentials that identify us, such as our email addresses, social media handles, usernames and passwords for different sites, driver’s license ID, passport ID, and so on. In reality, we don’t control any of these identifiers and the way they are&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Often, these identifiers are stored by third-party companies in centralized locations that could be hacked. Also, they are closely tied to the organization storing it, so if the organization bans you or becomes non-existent, so do your identifiers. A good example can be the way Donald Trump was kicked out of Twitter that led him to lose his followers and public identity overnight!</p><p>A new digital identity framework called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) has emerged to overcome these challenges and to give users complete control over how their identifiers are generated, where they are stored, and how they are&nbsp;shared.</p><p>The last few years have seen a stronger push for self-sovereign identity and this has led to the development of standards and building blocks for their implementation. Many companies like <a href="http://affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> have been creating building blocks to enable SSI across different industries.</p><p>A basic building block of SSI is Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These are a type of unique identifiers (URI) that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>These DIDs come with certain properties and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Does not require a centralized registration authority  Many DIDs use the distributed ledger technology or any other decentralized network, though it is not mandatory  It is a permanent identifier because it does not depend on a single third-party or centralized registry for its existence.  Can be cryptographically verified  They connect a DID subject (the entity identified by the DID) with a DID document (a set of data that describes the DID subject) to enable the subject to have trustable interactions.  They are interoperable and portable, provided they conform to the existing standards laid down by&nbsp;W3C  <p>So, this is how a DID looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>Here,</p>  The first part, the “did”, is the URI to identify that the transaction pertains to decentralized identifiers. This URI does not change, regardless of the implementation.  The second part, “example” is the DID method. This value is the protocol that determines where or how you’re going to find the DID. There are about 97 methods available at the time of writing this piece and this is likely to increase. Fundamentally, most of these methods revolve around creation, reading, update, and delete, but the implementation of each of these actions vary across the&nbsp;methods.  The third part, the long alphanumeric value is the DID resolution that can be understood as an algorithm or value that resolves the DID to the DID document. It is similar to the DNS address that we use&nbsp;today.  <p>A key building block of DIDs is the DID&nbsp;method.</p> What are DID&nbsp;Methods? <p>In a nutshell, DID methods are the component that helps a DID to resolve a DID document. It defines how DID documents are created, read, updated, and deleted on a&nbsp;network.</p><p>DID methods are often associated with a verifiable data registry, which is a system that brings together DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods. Some examples of verifiable data registries are trusted databases, decentralized databases, distributed ledger, and government ID databases like DigiLocker. Sometimes, more than one type of registry can be used in the same ecosystem.</p><p>In terms of implementation, a DID method is defined by its specification that precisely defines how DIDs and DID documents are created, updated, deactivated, and resolved.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an&nbsp;example.</p><p>DID: ELEM: jadjfa;j948madnfaupwmfm</p><p>Here,</p>  DID is the&nbsp;schema  ELEM is the verifiable data registry. ELEM represents the implementation of sidetree protocol on the Ethernet&nbsp;network  Jadjfa;j948madnfaupwmfm is the method-specific identifier and is the public key on a distributed ledger.  <p>Let’s now delve deeper into the world of DIDs and their&nbsp;working</p> How do DIDs&nbsp;Work? <p>Just like any other URI, DIDs are a unique identifier that associates a DID subject with a DID document.</p><p>Here, the DID subject can be an individual, entity, thing, etc, while the DID document is a JSON-LD object that contains a set of data that describes the DID subject including the cryptographic signatures, verification methods, or just about anything that will enable the DID subject to have trustable interactions with other entities on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>In essence, the DID contains a unique identifier that is used to lookup a DID document that relates to a DID subject. It is stored on one or more decentralized storage systems such as IPFS or&nbsp;STORJ.</p><p>Here, the DID resolves the DID document that in turn, describes the DID subject. To close the loop, the DID subject controls the DID and determines how and with whom it can be shared. In this sense, the DID subject is the DID controller in our example, but it merits to note that the DID controller and the DID subject don’t have to be the same entity at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>The key difference is that the DID controller has the right to change the DID document and this right is granted through the use of cryptographic keys. Due to this aspect, there can be more than one DID controller for the same DID document.</p><p>So, the workflow begins when a DID subject decides to create a DID for sharing with others.

  <p>The client credentials grant is used when two servers need to communicate with each other outside the context of a user. This is a very common scenario—and yet, it’s often overlooked by tutorials and documentation online. In contrast, the authorization code grant type is more common, for when an application needs to authenticate a user and retrieve an authorization token, typically a JWT, that represents the user’s identity within the application and defines the resources the user can access, and the actions the user can perform.</p>

<p>The OAuth 2.0 docs describe the client credentials grant in this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Client Credentials grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. This is typically used by clients to access resources about themselves rather than to access a user’s resources.</p>

   <a>Learn More About Spring Boot and Spring Security</a> 
 

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about how to allow services to securely interoperate even when there is not an authenticated user, using the client credentials grant.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this grant type is more straightforward than the other user-focused grant types. It is often used for processes such as CRON jobs, scheduled tasks, and other types of heavy background data processing.</p>

<p>You will create a simple resource server that will be secured using Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. After that, you will create a Spring Boot-based command-line client that uses Spring’s <code>RestTemplate</code> to make authenticated requests to the secure server. You will see how to authenticate the client with Okta using the client credentials grant and how to exchange the client credentials for a JSON Web Token (JWT), which will be used in the requests to the secure server.</p>

<p><code>RestTemplate</code> is deprecated, and while still widely used, should probably not be used for new code. Instead, the WebFlux-based class, <code>WebClient</code> should be used. In the next part of the tutorial, you will implement the same OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant using Spring <code>WebClient</code>.</p>

 What Is the Client Credentials Grant Flow? 

<p>The goal of the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant is to allow two automated services to interact securely. It does this primarily by replacing the old scheme, HTTP Basic, with a token-based authentication scheme that greatly reduces the number of requests that expose sensitive access credentials.</p>

<p>The primary problem with HTTP Basic is that it sends the username and password with every request. This means that each and every request between each and every service is a major potential security risk. Did the headers get leaked in a log file? Did somebody forget to force HTTPS? One mistake and credentials are compromised. Further, because usernames and passwords often don’t have expiration dates, and because many people will (sadly) reuse these credentials across services, such a leak can expose a hole the size of a barn in a system’s security barrier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OAuth 2.0, in contrast, mitigates this risk by having the client (the service initiating the request) request an access token from an authorization server. This access token is then used in the request to the other service for authentication and authorization. The primary benefit here is that the service credentials are only exposed when a new token must be requested or refreshed.</p>

<p>Further, this request is performed in a far more controlled manner, since it happens between the client and the authorization server.With HTTP Basic, in essence, every server has to act as an authorization server, with the increased security risk this poses. (Ideally a single authorization server can be hardened far more effectively than an entire network of services.)</p>

<p>The same is true when the service that receives the request validates the token. It makes a request to the authorization server, sending only the token, not exposing the username and password of the client.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another major benefit is that the tokens should expire and can be scoped. Passwords only expire when they are changed. Tokens have an expiration built into them. Further, the scope of the token and the authenticated identity of the token holder can be used to restrict the actions that the token holder is allowed to perform.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   Java 11: This project uses Java 12. OpenJDK 12 will work just as well. Instructions are found on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. OpenJDK can also be installed using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another excellent option for installing and managing Java versions. 
   HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you’ll use to test the WebFlux server. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>. 
   Okta CLI: The Okta CLI is a simple way to use Okta as an OAuth 2. 0 and Open ID Connect provider. You can sign up for a free Okta developer account, log in to an existing account, and create OIDC applications. You’ll use it in this tutorial to configure Okta as your OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. 
 

 Intro to Spring Security 5 Core Classes 

<p>Spring Security 5 changed how a lot of the OAuth flow is handled. The client credentials grant was no exception—the old method used Spring’s <code>RestTemplate</code> and <code>OAuth2RestTemplate</code>. While you can still use <code>RestTemplate</code>, <code>OAuth2RestTemplate</code> is gone and does not work with Spring Security 5. The preferred method in Spring Security 5 is to use the <code>WebClient</code>, which is part of the <code>WebFlux</code> package.</p>

<p>I’m going to take a moment to introduce some of the main OAuth Spring Security classes. If you already feel comfortable with OAuth 2.0 and Spring Security 5, or just want to see the code, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.</p>

<p>In the examples below, you’ll see that to configure client credentials need to configure Spring by overriding some of these classes through Bean definitions. If you want to get a more detailed look at these classes, take a look at <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.4.5/reference/html5/#oauth2Client-core-interface-class">the Spring docs on the subject</a>.</p>

<p>ClientRegistration: represents a client registered with OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC). It holds all of the basic information about the client, such as client id, client secret, grant type, and the various URIs. Client registrations are typically loaded automatically from an <code>application.properties</code> file. Spring auto-configuration looks for properties with the schema <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.[registrationId]</code> and creates a <code>ClientRegistration</code> instance within a <code>ClientRegistrationRepository.</code> As you will see, in the command line runner version of this, we have to re-create some of this logic manually because it is not being auto-configured for us outside of the scope of a web service environment.</p>

<p>ClientRegistrationRepository: this is a container class that holds <code>ClientRegistrations</code>.</p>

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClient: Represents an authorized client. This is a composed class that contains a client registration but adds authentication information. Take a look at the code excerpt below. You’ll see that the <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClient</code> adds three properties composed on top of the client registration: a principal name, an access token, and a refresh token.</p>

   <code>public class OAuth2AuthorizedClient implements Serializable {
    ...
    private final ClientRegistration clientRegistration;
    private final String principalName;
    private final OAuth2AccessToken accessToken;
    private final OAuth2RefreshToken refreshToken;
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository: is a container class that holds and persists authorized clients between requests. The default implementation, <code>InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code>, simply stores the clients in memory.</p>

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager: is the manager class that contains the logic to handle the authorization flow. Most importantly, it authorizes and re-authorizes OAuth 2.0 clients using an <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider</code>. It also delegates persistence of the authorized clients and calls success or failure handlers when client authorization succeeds or fails.</p>

<p>OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider: represents an OAuth 2.0 provider and handles the actual request logic for different grant types and OAuth 2.0 providers. They can be auto-configured based on property values (<code>spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.[provider name]</code>). In the case of this tutorial, you will be using Okta as your provider, so you’ll see properties with the prefix <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.</code> that are auto-configuring an associated <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider</code>.</p>

<p>Now for the code!</p>

 Build a Secure OAuth 2.0 Resource Server with Spring Security 

<p>In this section, you’re going to make a simple resource server for the clients to call. To bootstrap the project, you’re going to use <a href="http://start.spring.io/">the Spring Initializr</a>. It’s a great way to create a preconfigured Spring Boot project. Here you’re going to access it via the REST API, but it also has a pretty slick web interface.</p>

<p>Make a root project directory for the three different applications:</p>
 
   the resource server, 
   the <code>RestTemplate</code> client, and 
   the <code>WebClient</code> client. 
 

<p>Open a BASH shell and navigate to the base project directory. Run the command below to retrieve the pre-configured starter project for the server using the Spring Initializr REST API.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.4.5 \
  -d artifactId=secure-server \
  -d dependencies=oauth2-resource-server,web,security,okta \
  -d language=java \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d baseDir=secure-server \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd secure-server
</code>   

<p>This defines four dependencies:</p>
 
   Spring Boot OAuth 2.0 resource server 
   Spring Boot web starter 
   Spring security 
   The Okta Spring Boot starter 
 

<p>The Okta Spring Boot starter is a project that simplifies OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) configuration with Spring Boot and Okta. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>

<p>From within the <code>secure-server</code> project, open the <code>DemoApplication</code> class file and replace it with the following contents.</p>

<p><code>java/com/example/secureserver/DemoApplication.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.secureserver;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableGlobalMethodSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import com.okta.spring.boot.oauth.Okta;

import java.security.Principal;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
    public static class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        protected void configure(final HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http.authorizeRequests()
                    .anyRequest().authenticated()
                    .and()
                    .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        }
    }

    @RestController
    public class RequestCotroller {
        @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_mod_custom')")
        @GetMapping("/")
        public String getMessage(Principal principal) {
            return "Welcome, " + principal.getName();
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This class does a few important things. In the <code>SecurityConfig</code> inner class, it configures Spring Boot as an OAuth 2.0 resource server using JWTs and requires that all requests are authenticated. It also enables using the <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation by including the <code>@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)</code> annotation.</p>

<p>The second inner class, <code>RequestController</code>, defines a REST endpoint at the context root and secures this endpoint using the <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation. The security requires that the authorized JWT has the custom scope “mod_custom.”</p>

<p>Notice that to specify a required scope using the <code>PreAuthorize</code> annotation, you use a Spring Expression Language snippet (SpEL): <code>hasAuthority('SCOPE_mod_custom')</code>. Spring automatically prepends “SCOPE_” in front of the required scope name, such that the actual required scope is “mod_custom” not “SCOPE_mod_custom.”</p>

<p>The application code is in place. However, you still need to configure the Spring Boot application to use Okta as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. You also need to create an OIDC application on Okta.</p>

 Create an OIDC Application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create service</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OAuth 2.0 Service App in your Okta Org. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/overview/">Create a Service App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Copy the values from the generated <code>.okta.env</code> file into <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>. It should look like the following (with your own values for the issuer, client ID, and client secret) when you’re finished.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-secret=292yu98y2983e28ue928u39e82ue982ue982
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oa7km6o1AEDdbuUq4x7
</code>   

<p>Add a line to the <code>applications.properties</code> file. This changes the server port to 8081.</p>

   <code>server.port=8081
</code>   

 Test Your Secure Server 

<p>You now have a fully functioning server application. You can run it with the following command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Once that finishes starting, you can run a request using HTTPie.</p>

   <code>http :8081/secure
</code>   

<p>However, the server requires a valid JSON Web Token (JWT).</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 
...

401 Unauthorized

</code>   

 Add a Custom Scope to Your Authorization Server 

<p>Because we are using the custom scope <code>mod_custom</code> in the <code>@Preauthorize</code> annotation, you need to add this custom scope to your Okta authorization server. Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console. You may need to click the Admin button to get to your dashboard.</p>

<p>Go to Security &gt; API. Select the Default authorization server by clicking on default in the table.</p>

<p>Select the Scopes tab. Click Add Scope.</p>

<p>Give the scope the following Name: <code>mod_custom</code>.</p>

<p>Give the scope whatever Display Name and Description you would like, or leave it blank. Click Create to continue.</p>

 Create a RestTemplate Command-Line Application 

<p>Next, you will create a command-line application that makes an authorized request to the secure server using <code>RestTemplate</code>. Use the Spring Initializr to download a bootstrapped application with the following command, run from the root directory for the project as a whole.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.4.5 \
  -d artifactId=client \
  -d dependencies=oauth2-client,web \
  -d language=java \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d baseDir=client-resttemplate \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd client-resttemplate
</code>   

<p>Open this project in your IDE and a new class to hold the OAuth configuration.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/client/OAuthClientConfiguration.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.client;

<p>In the context of a servlet, much of what this file does would be accomplished automatically by Spring auto-configuration. However, since this is a command-line utility and no servlet is going to be created, you have to recreate some of the OAuth configuration. This is what the file above accomplishes.</p>

<p>The <code>oktaClientRegistration()</code> method loads the properties for the client and provider from the <code>application.properties</code> file and creates an Okta client registration using those properties.</p>

<p>The other methods create an <code>InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code> that contains this client registration and creates an <code>InMemoryOAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code>, both of which are injected into a <code>AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager</code>. This is the high-level controller class that orchestrates the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant request. A lot is going on in this, and we won’t unpack it all here. I will point out that <code>AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager</code> is a class specifically designed to be used outside of the context of a HttpServletRequest.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.4.5/reference/html5/#oauth2Client-authorized-manager-provider">the Spring Docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DefaultOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager is designed to be used within the context of a HttpServletRequest. When operating outside of a HttpServletRequest context, use AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager instead.</p>

<p>Next, update the <code>DemoApplication</code> file.</p>

</code>   

<p>This file is the standard Spring Boot application file that starts the framework. It uses an inner class that extends <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code> to configure Spring Boot for OAuth 2.0 client. The bulk of the code is in the <code>run()</code> method, which is what is defined by the <code>CommandLineRunner</code> interface and is what is executed once Spring Boot is fully loaded.</p>

<p>The <code>run()</code> method does two main things:</p>
 
   It uses the client ID and client secret to retrieve a JWT 
   It uses that JWT to make an authorized HTTP request using <code>RestTemplate</code> 
 

<p><code>OAuth2AuthorizeRequest</code> and <code>AuthorizedClientServiceOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager</code> are the classes used to configure the request for authentication with Okta’s servers and to make the actual request.</p>

<p>Before you can test the code, add some properties to the <code>application.properties</code> file. You need to fill in three values below:</p>

 
   the client ID for your OIDC application 
   the client secret for your OIDC application 
   your own Okta URI in the <code>token-uri</code> 
 

<p>All of these values can be taken from the <code>application.properties</code> file for the secure server project above.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>
   <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={yourClientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope=mod_custom
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri=/oauth2/default/v1/token
spring.main.web-application-type=none
</code>   
<p>The last property, <code>spring.main.web-application-type=none</code>, tells Spring Boot not to launch any kind of web service. Since this is a command-line app, there’s no reason to launch the default Tomcat container.</p>

<p>With that all in place, you can now try it out. Make sure your server is running (<code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>) and then run the client in a separate shell.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>If all went well, the client will show you some output that looks like the following (I’ve omitted most of the token, but you’ll see it as a bit block of characters in your console).</p>

<p>One thing I want to point out is that this client is going to request a new token on every request. This is less than ideal because the token request sequence is the most vulnerable from a security perspective. A way around this would be to persist the token between requests. You could persist the token yourself and handle the refresh logic within the <code>run()</code> method, or you could implement an <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClientService</code> that persists the token instead of using the default in-memory implementation.</p>

 Create a WebClient-Based Application 

<p>In this section, you’re going to implement a command-line client using the newer, currently recommended WebClient API. WebClient is part of Spring’s WebFlux package. This is Spring’s reactive, non-blocking API, which you can read more about in <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html">their documentation</a>. If you’re reading this and you don’t already have some idea of what non-blocking, asynchronous, or reactive coding is about, please tell me what rock you’ve been hiding under because it’s probably nice and quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p>It’s important to realize when using WebFlux within the Java servlet framework that you are mixing two different threading paradigms. Spring does a good job of handling this gracefully, but there are places (as you’ll see below) where you need to be aware of WebClient’s non-blocking nature and deliberately block it to wait for a response.</p>

<p>In this client, you will use two different methods to run tasks. First, you will use the <code>CommandLineRunner</code> interface, just as you did above. This will demonstrate using <code>WebClient</code> in a blocking context. Second, you will use <code>WebClient</code> to make requests using the <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation. This annotation allows for a variety of scheduling options, including CRON-style scheduling. It also allows the use of <code>WebClient</code> in all its non-blocking glory.</p>

<p>Here is the command to download the starter for the WebClient-based client from the Spring Initializr. The only difference between this bootstrapped project, and the previous one, is the addition of a new dependency. The dependency <code>webflux</code> is necessary to add support for the <code>WebClient</code> class.</p>

<p>Run this command from a Bash shell from the project root directory.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.4.5 \
  -d artifactId=client \
  -d dependencies=oauth2-client,web,webflux \
  -d language=java \
  -d type=maven-project \
  -d baseDir=client-webclient \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd client-webclient
</code>   

<p>Open the project in your favorite IDE and create a new class to hold the OAuth configuration.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/client/OAuthClientConfiguration.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.client;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.*;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.registration.*;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.reactive.function.client.ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.AuthorizationGrantType;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
public class OAuthClientConfiguration {

    @Bean
    ReactiveClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrations(
            @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri}") String token_uri,
            @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id}") String client_id,
            @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret}") String client_secret,
            @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope}") String scope,
            @Value("${spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type}") String authorizationGrantType

    ) {
        ClientRegistration registration = ClientRegistration
                .withRegistrationId("okta")
                .tokenUri(token_uri)
                .clientId(client_id)
                .clientSecret(client_secret)
                .scope(scope)
                .authorizationGrantType(new AuthorizationGrantType(authorizationGrantType))
                .build();
        return new InMemoryReactiveClientRegistrationRepository(registration);
    }

    @Bean
    WebClient webClient(ReactiveClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrations) {
        InMemoryReactiveOAuth2AuthorizedClientService clientService = new InMemoryReactiveOAuth2AuthorizedClientService(clientRegistrations);
        AuthorizedClientServiceReactiveOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager authorizedClientManager = new AuthorizedClientServiceReactiveOAuth2AuthorizedClientManager(clientRegistrations, clientService);
        ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction oauth = new ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction(authorizedClientManager);
        oauth.setDefaultClientRegistrationId("okta");
        return WebClient.builder()
                .filter(oauth)
                .build();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Like the corresponding file in the previous client, this file loads the Okta client registration and packages it in an in-memory client registration repository (<code>InMemoryReactiveClientRegistrationRepository</code>). This repository is specifically a reactive repository suitable for use with the <code>WebClient</code> class. This is used to build a reactive authorized client manager, which is packaged in an OAuth 2.0 filter that handles the client credentials grant exchange. Here the <code>WebClient</code> is packaged as a bean with the filter in place, and every request that uses this bean will have this filter. In the previous example, the client credentials exchange was performed explicitly in the command line runner method.</p>

<p>Update the <code>DemoApplication</code> class to match the following.</p>

   <code>package com.example.client;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableScheduling
public class DemoApplication implements CommandLineRunner {

    Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CommandLineRunner.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)
    public void scheduledRequest() {
        webClient.get()
                .uri("http://localhost:8081")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .map(string
                        -&gt; "Schedule request response: " + string)
                .subscribe(logger::info);
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        String body = webClient.get()
                .uri("http://localhost:8081")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .block();
        logger.info(body);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This class uses two different methods to trigger requests, both of which use the <code>WebClient</code> bean defined in the previous class. The <code>scheduledRequest()</code> method uses the <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation to trigger a request every five seconds. This annotation allows <code>WebClient</code> to be used in a non-blocking manner.</p>

<p>The <code>run()</code> method, by contrast, uses <code>WebClient</code> in a blocking manner. Notice the <code>block()</code> method in the chain of commands, and notice that it is returning a String value that is logged instead of using the more reactive methodology to log results: <code>subscribe(logger::info)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s it for this client. You can tell by the relative simplicity of this implementation over the <code>RestTemplate</code> implementation that Spring is moving in this direction. <code>RestTemplate</code>, while still widely used, is now deprecated.</p>

<p>Before you run it, copy the values from the <code>application.properties</code> file from the previous project to this project.</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>
   <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id={yourClientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.scope=mod_custom
spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.token-uri=https://{yourOktaUri}/oauth2/default/v1/token
spring.main.web-application-type=none
</code>   

<p>You can start the WebClient-based client using the following command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should see output like this:</p>
   <code>2021-04-08 19:22:09.658  INFO 346556 --- [           main] com.example.client.DemoApplication       : Started DemoApplication in 0.613 seconds (JVM running for 0.782)

 Learn More About Spring Boot and Spring Security 

<p>In this tutorial, you saw two different ways to implement the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow. You created a simple server application. You created a client using RestTemplate, a deprecated but still widely used Spring technology. Finally, you created a client using the newer, asynchronous <code>WebClient</code>, built on Spring’s WebFlux package.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example in our <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-client-credentials-example">okta-spring-boot-client-credentials-example</a> repository.</p>

 The Virality of Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>Mathieu: I wanted to start with a quote, Riley, from the movie Inception: from Leonardo DiCaprio’s character, Cobb. I’ve seen this quote in an article that you’ve written before, and the quote goes like this: “What is the most resilient parasite? Is it bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it’s almost impossible to eradicate.”</p>
<p>You had used this quote to refer to Self-sovereign Identity, or when you started thinking about ‘digital trust’ for the first time some years ago. Would you mind giving a background of how this has taken over your brain, and your life, and effectively, the mission behind Trinsic today?</p>
<p>Riley: Yes, that’s an awesome quote — I’m glad that you brought that back up. The first time I was exposed to Self-sovereign Identity and this concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifiers">decentralized identity</a> was when I interviewed for a job at the Sovrin Foundation when it was looking to hire its first employee. My interview was with somebody named Steve Fulling, as well as Phil Windley. Phil Windley is the founder of the Internet Identity Workshop, and he was the chair of the board of Sovrin. He’s quite a ‘guru,’ and he was very good at conveying the vision and what we were trying to accomplish. I went in for a regular job interview, and it went well, but after I left the interview, I looked everywhere around me, and all I could see were digital credentials or the lack thereof. It was as if, once I saw the way the world could operate. I’ve never been able to go about life normally again. Even small daily things; one time, UPS was shipping me a package, and I wanted to pick it up at the distribution center, but I couldn’t prove that it was actually me who bought the package. Or another example: I used to work in the solar industry, collecting people’s electricity data so that we could build them a solar panel estimate. Things like that: everyday activities that you don’t normally hear about, such as KYC (Know Your Customer), or health credentials, or the prime SSI use cases.</p>
<p>The reason I love that quote is that <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">digital credentials</a> and verifiable data can not only impact the use cases that everybody tends to think about when they think about SSI, but they could permeate our whole lives and streamline everything we do. I think that was evidenced throughout my time in this space. It seems as if people who get into Self-sovereign Identity, can’t get out. Even people that I worked with at the Sovrin Foundation; while we were there, we never ever had any attrition of employees, even though the Sovrin Foundation was a hard place to be because of funding challenges. Ultimately, those funding challenges resulted in people losing their jobs at one point, but even throughout all that, nobody ever left. We’ve seen the same thing at <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">Trinsic</a>: nobody’s ever left, unless they’re an intern, or someone moving on to their next project.</p>
<p>Mathieu, maybe you could speak to this, but I remember when Northern Block came into this space. You weren’t focused solely on Self-sovereign Identity, but it seems like you’ve leaned into this subject. I think that’s characteristic of what I’ve seen over and over and over; once this concept infects your brain, you really can’t help but go all in. I think that’s a characteristic of really promising movements: Once you see it, you can’t unsee it. In my opinion, it’s inevitable that the world is going to go in this direction.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes, it’s a similar mindset. The feelings that you had towards SSI or digital trust, or <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip/">Trust over IP</a>, however, we call it; I had a similar feeling some years before when I got into crypto, and blockchain, and decentralized technology as a whole. Having worked on many software projects that utilize some type of decentralized or distributed computing technology, the property of verifiability that comes with these verifiable credentials is something that, for me at least, was missing in the decentralized stack that we were playing with. It was cool that we were building distributed or decentralized protocols; we touched it all for you-name-the-use-case. But, it was missing the core property of verifiability. Many people were trying to use technologies like distributed ledgers or blockchains to solve every problem in the world. Still, when it came down to lack of trust in transactions, caused by issues with the verifiability of data, it was as if a light went off there.</p>
<p>As you started working at the Sovrin Foundation, I’m assuming you got more and more excited about that. What are the types of things that you did at the Sovrin Foundation in the early days?</p>
 Early Days with the Sovrin Foundation 
<p>Riley: Yes, definitely; Sovrin was a very cool place to be. First of all, from a personal development standpoint; as the first employee, there was a lot to do, and I wore a lot of hats when I first joined. I think the other cool thing about it was that, at the time, it was very early; I don’t even remember whether the Decentralized Identity Foundation was established yet; it may have been. The Trust over IP Foundation was definitely not established, and so Sovrin was the most established place to go. If you were interested in this space, it was the destination.</p>
<p>My first major undertaking at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a> was to establish the Sovrin Steward program, which is the program that the Sovrin Foundation runs to get organizations to operate nodes on the Sovrin network. Part of the governance of Sovrin is that the nodes are permissioned, but the read-and-write access was thought to be, ideally and eventually, totally public. Although the consensus protocol on the blockchain was done in a permissioned fashion, everything else would be public. Part of establishing the governance over the permissioning of the nodes that operated consensus on the network, was essentially establishing a standardized process through open governance. This would allow new stewards to join the network, add a node, and participate in consensus. That whole initial process was my first major project.</p>
<p>The first step in that process is usually to have a call with somebody who works at the Sovrin Foundation, or somebody on the committee would call the steward qualification committee. Originally, all of that was done by me. Eventually, it became much more decentralized, with different volunteers from around the world who are doing that, and it’s still being done today. But initially, it was all me. Following on to what I was saying about Sovrin being the first destination for organizations who wanted to get involved with decentralized identity, I had so many calls. My whole day would be filled with conversations with people who were interested in applying this new technology to some business problem that they had. Because of that, I got to hear, from the very beginning, about all sorts of business problems, and all sorts of industries to which people were trying to <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">apply Self-sovereign Identity</a>. Essentially, I was able to absorb all those learnings, in a way that I think was unique. I don’t know if I would have been able to have that opportunity anywhere else in the world at that time.</p>
<p>Mathieu: We can see this happening over and over again, where you see areas that foster technology startups, like Silicon Valley. They all leverage each other. In these really condensed environments, with people working in the same direction, you seem to see an ecosystem take shape. Different companies and different people can leverage each other’s skillsets for something specific.</p>
<p>Many of our companies today have a more global footprint, and we’re able to work with people throughout the world. Still, it’s quite crazy to look at Utah (where Trinsic is based) and to review the Sovrin Foundation coming out of Utah, all the SSI companies coming up there, all the Fintech companies coming out of there; it’s absolutely crazy. It feels as if there’s entrepreneurship in the mountain water that everyone’s drinking down there.</p>
<p>Riley: Yes, that’s absolutely true. I think that part of that is that, as I mentioned, once people see it, they can’t unsee it; people stay in the Self-sovereign Identity space, even if they leave their roles. If you look at all the people who were laid off from the Sovrin Foundation, I’m trying to think on the spot here, if anyone did something like leaving the space entirely: Nathan George went to Kiva. Ken Ebert and others based here in Utah started Indicio.Tech, along with <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">Heather Dahl</a>, who’s based out of DC. Evernym has a presence here in Utah, and people who’ve left Evernym have gone on to start things or integrate SSI into their own applications. Mike Lotter started a company called TrustFrame that’s based here in Utah. Of course, I came from that ecosystem and started Trinsic. So, I’m telling you that people can’t leave once they see this — it’s such an opportunity with such an open ocean. It makes sense that a lot of the initial ecosystem was built here, and that ecosystem continues to grow, and it’s very cool to see.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I agree; I honestly can’t imagine doing anything else once you’ve experienced this, and you understand how verifiable credentials could really work. I think it’s interesting because there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzTihhlSBF4">so many opportunities to use verifiable credentials</a> to turn paper-based processes into better processes, and also, to turn digitized processes into digitally valuable processes, as well.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to say that I’m digitizing a paper document, but being able to actually have verifiability and authenticity behind it, and being able to leverage the data further on, in whatever customer journey or whatever you’re trying to do, is very exciting. So, yes, I’d have to echo your comments earlier in the discussion. Once you get lost in the topic: in your day-to-day activity, you’re looking at things, and you’re thinking, “Oh my god, there are so many opportunities to use this stuff to create a better world for ourselves.”</p>
 What is the Business Value of SSI? 
<p>Riley: Yes. You spoke to a lot of business value that can be unlocked through decentralized identity; I’m sure we’ll get more into that because that’s something that I’ve been obsessed with for the last four years. Before we leave the topic, and to add to your comment there; I think one of the main reasons that people stay in the space is not only for the big business opportunity. It’s also the fact that I truly believe (and I think that most everyone else in this space truly believes) that Self-sovereign Identity is going to create a better world for people. It’s going to make basic services, that people need but they can’t currently access, accessible, and it’s going to change the power balance in the world to favour people, more than it currently is.</p>
<p>I can’t see the future, but I do know that giving individual people more privacy, and more control and transparency into the way their data is used and managed are a big part of why people stay in this space. We can have all sorts of philosophical <a href="https://anchor.fm/ssi-orbit-podcast">discussions about Self-sovereign Identity</a>. I know that for me, I would not be nearly as passionate about Self-sovereign Identity, if it was just about automating business processes, and making paper-based workflows more efficient. Although, those are very good objectives: that’s where a lot of the money is to be made today.</p>
<p>I think that in the long run, what we’re really trying to do, is we’re trying to create a digital economy that works for people and for the world. We’re trying to create trust over the internet protocol&nbsp; — Trust over IP. We’re trying to create digital tools and digital ways for people to establish trust and get access to the things that they need and the things that they’re entitled to. I certainly wouldn’t be nearly as passionate and work nearly as hard for this movement, and I don’t think nearly as many people would stay in the space if it were only about the business value of what SSI can unlock.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I’ve gotten emails from you at six in the morning Eastern time, and I know you’re a couple of hours behind. So, I definitely know that you’re grinding away at this stuff because you truly believe in it. It’s quite similar to the vision that many people have — generally those in Web 3.0 or who are focused on decentralized technology. They have a vision for a digital economy with greater balance, more transparency, more traceability, and more value for people who are actually injecting value into the system.</p>
<p>To close on the Sovrin topic: I think Sovrin is amazing. I spend a fair amount of time in the Trust over IP Foundation, more particularly today in the utility foundry working group. It’s incredible how much of a step forward Sovrin has made for everyone, because everyone trying to set up a public utility today is looking to Sovrin as a model: Sovrin is effectively shaping how the space is growing today.</p>
<p>You left Sovrin to found a startup called Street Cred at that time; would you mind talking through the early days, and the transition out of there? Was this your first startup? </p>
 SSI Toolkits for Developers 
<p>Riley: It was my first real startup. I’ve always been entrepreneurial since I was a little kid, and in fact, I started a business when I was 14. At that time, I manufactured aftermarket freestyle Razor scooter components and sold them to e-commerce stores and physical locations in the USA, and also in Australia because that’s a big sport down there. I did that throughout high school, which paid for college, so that was fun. This is my first tech startup. I would say it’s my ‘real’ startup, in the sense that it’s a startup whose goal is not to sustain my own living, but it’s a startup whose aim is to make a meaningful impact on the world, and create an organization that is significant and enduring. I’m happy to talk about the transition there. For me, Mathieu, and this might sound dumb or cliché or whatever, but it really didn’t feel like a transition; it felt as if I was doing the same thing. While I was at Sovrin, I was totally obsessed with the idea of building <a href="https://anchor.fm/ssi-orbit-podcast/episodes/3---Simplifying-SSI-for-Organizations-and-Removing-Roadblocks-for-Broad-SSI-Adoption-with-Heather-Dahl-ergjji">adoption of Self-sovereign Identity</a>. I could see the future; as I said, I was walking around, and I would walk into a restaurant, and I would walk into my university (because I was a student at the time). Everywhere I went, I saw what the world could be, and I couldn’t handle living in this world, when I knew it could be so much better, but not doing anything about it.</p>
<p>While I was at Sovrin, I was the staff lead over governance, for example. Drummond Reed from Evernym deserves so much credit for all of the work he’s done on governance over the years, as well as at Sovrin. He was an employee of Evernym, and I was the Sovrin staff employee who was working right alongside him and others on governance. The whole point there was, “How do we make SSI more adoptable?” I did a lot of work on the Sovrin Tokenomics — that was my other big project at Sovrin; Token was a big conversation at the time, and I was effectively the lead of the Tokenomics work at Sovrin. That work was focused on, “How do we potentially use a cryptocurrency to facilitate, or a utility token to facilitate adoption of verifiable credentials?” And, “How can we provide incentive mechanisms to drive that adoption?” This went all the way to starting the SSI incubator, which was an idea that I had from the beginning. The SSI incubator idea revolved around helping startups who were going to move fast, and build use cases for different industries, get funding and support that they needed to deploy this stuff.</p>
<p>Everything I was doing at Sovrin was about trying to crack the code of adoption. The other piece is the business of SSI working group, which I started and led for some time. Some good work was done there, as well, and so all of my work at Sovrin was around getting adoption. The story of how Trinsic got started (or, at the time, it was StreetCred) was that it was another continuation of what I was already doing. I was talking to people, and saying, “Why aren’t you going to production with your SSI solutions? What’s holding you back, and what do we need to do, to make it so that nothing’s holding you back?” I heard over, and over, and over, that the tools were not there, that there were no products that could do what needed to be done; the technology wasn’t mature enough, the technology wasn’t quite there, the technology was too hard to use, or hard to integrate into existing applications. For a long time, my answer was, “Okay, well, the private sector or whatever, the marketplace will solve that problem. That’s not Sovrin’s role.” That’s true, and so I really eventually thought, “Okay, I’ve done all my stuff I need to do here at the Sovrin Foundation, and now I need to try to make it easy for people.”</p>
<p>I needed to work on this other piece, which involves productizing SSI in a way, specifically, that developers could easily integrate into their applications; whether they be existing applications that are serving existing markets, or building new verticals and new use cases on top of Self-sovereign Identity, for whatever business problem that they’re solving. So, I got together with Tomislav Markowski, who wrote the first Aries framework for mobile, and then also Michael Boyd, who wrote the first Indy agent in Python, along with the rest of the working group at the time. These were two of the founding engineers, or code producers, in the Hyperledger Aries project. I said, “Guys, let’s get together, and let’s make something that makes it really easy for developers to integrate SSI into any application. Let’s try to make it as simple as Stripe made payments, or as simple as Twilio made communications, or as simple as name-your-API-based, developer-focused company made whatever thing easier. That’s what we did.</p>
<p>When I transitioned into doing StreetCred, it felt more like it was my next step in making SSI easier to adopt. Last Monday, we announced Trinsic Ecosystems, which is our new product. It’s a productized way to build trust ecosystems. This is the same next step in that same journey to make SSI adoptable and easy to use, and to successfully get digital wallets in the hands of people that have credentials, who are using them for useful purposes. That’s the summary.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Yes. I was going to hop forward, because, in the meantime, you guys have been the go-to for developer tools; that’s how we met each other. We had developers looking at the stuff, and the contributions were coming from your team. You pushed the bar forward there, and made it easy for a lot of people to <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/">start implementing Self-sovereign Identity</a>. Now, we’ve developed these tools for developers to do basic functions, such as making connections, and exchange credentials, and do verifications, and so forth. That’s the space that we are looking at, as a company. There needs to be a provider, or someone that’s going to create an ecosystem; create the rules, and create the governance. We could talk about community-driven initiatives, such as when you mentioned Tokenomics before; there’s a discussion there to be had.</p>
<p>If we take a step back, and we look at how to enable organizations or companies to successfully offer the benefits of Self-sovereign Identity to their customers, and to their employees: how do you reap the benefits from less friction, more privacy? The list goes on and on; you need to have someone kick-starting the ecosystem. Was that the same realization for you guys? And, what did you feel was necessary to make this easy for an ecosystem provider to really get going?</p>
 Focusing on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Ecosystems 
<p>Riley: Yes, we had that same journey as well. However, I think that for us, it was more around the fact that we have this developer platform, and we have this API product that’s being used by hundreds of organizations. At its core, it was an exercise of looking at the current state of our product and its growth, and the different segments. Some people are using verifiable credentials for authentication, others are using them for sharing and building these ecosystems, others are using credentials in a contained and closed ecosystem, and still others are open ecosystems. There are various different use cases for credentials, of course. Looking at our own data that we’d collected and thinking, “Where are credentials getting adoption?” That’s been the number one thing since day one, and it still is.</p>
<p>It’s going to be the main priority all the way until we’ve got a network effect established for verifiable credentials that is so strong, that nothing’s ever going to topple it. That’s going to be the thing that we’re constantly thinking about: adoption. Looking at the data that we had, credentials are getting adoption most — it’s the best use case today. The best way to get credentials into the world with real adoption has been in these ecosystems; it’s when people come to our platform, pick up the product, and use it to build an ecosystem — that’s where the best adoption has been. So, I would say that the Trinsic Ecosystems product was about talking to our customers who’d already created ecosystems, building things for them that help to solve their problems and help make it easier for them to build ecosystems, and then trying to generalize that. If we say, “Okay. These five companies need a trust registry,” for example: at a&nbsp; high level, it’s a list of issuers who are authorized to issue certain types of credentials. If these five customers need this, is this something that can be generalized to more use cases? Something I think that we’ve been very intentional about at Trinsic, is talking to the people who are actually implementing and deploying this stuff in production. Basically, Trinsic Ecosystems is our way of productizing all of those things that everybody needs if they want to <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">deploy a credential ecosystem</a>. At least, the general pieces that people need, so that they can configure an ecosystem and then deploy it out to their network that they’re trying to affect.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I love the vision. There are a lot of similarities for me, coming from a crypto/blockchain space, where people were trying to reinvent the world in so many different ways. That’s a separate conversation. Ecosystems exist today all over the place. I think that many people, when they approach something new with a new technology, they’re trying to create this new way of doing something, when things aren’t necessarily done that way. That’s not the easiest way to get people bought into doing something new.</p>
<p>If I have a business case for credentials —there are a hundred of them —it could be to reduce costs, or reduce fraud, or lower my compliance costs, or reduce friction. Whatever it is, you need an easy way for an organization or an entity that’s already trying to make their ecosystem a <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">credentials-based ecosystem</a>, to really get it going and get its existing governance, rule sets, and relationships into this new model. I think what you guys are doing there is good, and it makes it a lot easier for people to start using the stuff without throwing out what they’ve already done.</p>
<p>Riley: I think that, as you said, there are already ecosystems out there. Taking a step back again to the meta-topic of adoption; the other thing to keep in mind is that I’ve never talked to anybody in my life who has questioned the value of SSI, if we assume that there is widespread adoption already. The question is always, “How do you get to that point? How do you bootstrap the network effect?” It’s not always a great user experience to ask your customer to download a wallet, but if they already have a wallet, and already have credentials in it, then it’s an awesome user experience for them to streamline the access process through SSI. That’s just one example out of many that I could give.</p>
<p>I think that the ecosystem approach is a very pragmatic way for organizations to do something using verifiable credentials, that is uniquely valuable today. It’s something that they can do today, that’ll add value in a way that nothing else on Planet Earth can match. Of course, there are some caveats or dependencies there, perhaps, if you want to argue it. However, I think that what verifiable credentials are fundamentally good at, is portable data and verifiable data. When you have an ecosystem, verifiable credentials can be very costly and cumbersome, and not scalable when it comes to sharing data in these ecosystems. So, I think it’s an excellent way to give organizations something that they can do today, that will add value, reduce costs, and increase revenues and whatever else they want to accomplish. At the same time, they’re also keeping the door open for that eventual future, where verifiable credentials will be ubiquitous and where we will get to the more decentralized interactions that we all hope to see in the future.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Do you have concerns with the term ‘Self-sovereign Identity’ when talking to a prospect? When people are so used to doing something today, maybe self-sovereign sounds too out there, or people may have mixed feelings about it. The term Self-sovereign Identity addresses the ‘self-sovereign’ aspect, but the identity aspect is maybe not necessarily everything that it encompasses, as well. I know you have written a very good blog post, called: “SSI has an identity problem.”</p>
<p>Did you front-load Self-sovereign Identity in conversations? How do you look at that? </p>
<p>Riley: No, I don’t front-load it.; it depends on who I’m talking to. You always want to gauge your audience, so when I’m talking to you, Mathieu, I use the term Self-sovereign Identity or SSI. I’m assuming many of the listeners here are familiar with the concept, because of your other podcasts and things like that, but you’ve got to gauge your audience. One of the things that I talked about, either in that blog post or in another one I did about SSI adoption and the current state of adoption, is: “don’t talk past your prospect or your buyer or your whatever.”</p>
<p>Make sure you’re using language that’s shared. One of the challenges with any new technology is there’s no shared vocabulary. Having a shared vocabulary is the easiest way to communicate something; since we both know what a newspaper is, I can simply say the word “newspaper,” and there’s a great deal of context that we both have of shared knowledge. We can use that one word, instead of describing what it is in a bunch of words and sentences. I could try to do that here, but I’m not going to take the time to do that. I think you can see the point with SSI, right? When you already have all the context, I can say that acronym and you get a bunch of knowledge. Whereas, if you don’t already have that context, you’ve got to use a bunch of words to try to fill in that context. One thing that Timothy Ruff and I have talked about for years; we’ve been looking for a way to convey all of that context in as simple a way as possible, and, if possible, in only a few words, or one sentence. We’ve gotten close in various ways, but we haven’t gotten all the way there.</p>
<p>So, generally speaking, when talking to a prospect, it is all about the use case and the business value, and it is not at all about the way to get there or the implementation path. For example, if somebody wants to do COVID test results, and all they want is the ability to know that the COVID test was actually done by a legitimate lab. Necessarily, they want to know that; that’s their business problem. I think the way to do that successfully is if we discuss it in terms of the business problem and with the context and words that they’re familiar with.</p>
<p>As you said, I wrote a blog about all of the different names that people have tried to use for SSI over the years. There’s a new proposal, that’s not in that blog post. Maybe I’ll make an edit or update to that blog post about the term ‘authentic data,’ which I like, but again every name has its own trade-offs. I would say, generally, do I have problems with the term SSI? Yes. Do I think SSI is the most widely used, and is still the best term to convey all of that context? Yes. However, do I use it frequently with people who are unfamiliar, or with potential prospects? No.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s all about solving a business problem today for organizations. KYC is a good example. For regulatory reasons, you need to collect and verify certain information about a prospective customer before offering them financial services or whatever. My feeling is that the world of technology solution providers that are selling into these companies today, is very one-transactional.</p>
<p>Of course, in the financial world, every time you’re making a payment or conducting a transaction, there’s monitoring, there’s stuff that goes on for various policies such as anti-money laundering. However, much of the business value that people seem to be looking to get out of credentials, is that level of verifiability. I’m curious as to how you look at this, too. Is it more interesting to be talking about user-centricity, and consent-driven decisions, and privacy and better security?</p>
<p>Again, it depends on who you’re talking to. If you’re talking to someone that understands Self-sovereign Identity, then then you could talk broader than that. But, talking about these core values or aspects of Self-sovereign Identity might make it easier to get in the door, get credentials used within their respective ecosystem, and then slowly start talking about more exploration. In other words, “Now that we’ve done this thing; by the way, there’s a lot more upside that can be achieved through the reusability and portability of these things.”</p>
<p>Is my thought process similar to how you engage with prospects?</p>
<p>Riley: Yes. The other thing that I’ll say is: what you and I, Mathieu, are selling (for lack of a better term) is SSI. We’re selling decentralized identity; we’re selling the ability for companies to implement this stuff. But, what all of our customers are selling, is some specific use case or business problem. So, I think that the things I say in a conversation with a prospect will be different than the things that I think our customer will say.</p>
<p>Let’s take ‘Farmer Connect,’ for example: Farmer Connect has built a very awesome traceability solution, where you can scan a QR code on your coffee beans, and it resolves all the way back through the supply chain to an individual farmer who has a Self-sovereign Identity. That farmer can choose what data or information from all their verifiable credentials they want to share with the end consumer of the coffee beans that they grew. Then, the consumer can sort of ‘tip’ the farmer that grew the coffee beans, and it’s a very cool use case that implements SSI. Farmer Connect is not selling SSI to their ecosystem, right? They’re selling transparency, and they’re selling sustainability, and they’re selling a specific thing.</p>
<p>Whereas, somebody like Trinsic: we don’t build specific products, we work with companies who are building specific vertically-focused products. We try to be the best in the world at building those tools and the low-level stuff. So, the conversation that I might have with the prospect would be different than how I would advise a customer of ours, or an implementer of <a href="https://northernblock.io/">SSI solutions</a> directly.</p>
<p>I would think that Farmer Connect is going to talk about farmers sharing their data, in a way that’s privacy-respecting and that those farmers can use, to get access to credit and other things. They’re going to talk about the farmers; they’re not necessarily going to talk about Self-sovereign Identity. Or, at least, I wouldn’t typically advise them to do so.</p>
<p>Whereas when I have a conversation with someone, it is going to be about the tools, and the technology, and the approach. As an example, Amazon AWS is going to be talking about the cloud and the benefits of moving to the cloud; Pinterest is going to be talking about pictures, and Uber is going to be talking about rides, but they’re both built on AWS. For the end consumer, for the sake of the use case, I don’t think you need to talk about the technology that’s powering it. It totally depends on what you’re using the technology for, and it’s better to be talking about the business problem instead.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Fair enough. You wrote another great piece: “<a href="https://trinsic.id/4-keys-to-ssi-adoption/">Four Keys for SSI Adoption</a>,” and one of the findings was simply, “Don’t sell the tech.” I think you alluded to that again here, in selling the value of SSI instead. I think that your fourth key for SSI adoption, was that chicken-and-egg problem. Has your thinking advanced since you’ve written this? And, perhaps you can also talk about the survey you did, and how you approach this thing? I think it’s pretty cool that you went out there, and came up with these findings.</p>
<p>Riley: For the survey that I did, I was thinking that there are so many companies out there who are deploying SSI-based solutions. Almost all of them are using some vendor to help them, so the survey revolved around reaching out to other vendors, like us, and asking whether those vendors have any insight on their customers and their customers’ adoption. It turns out, they do; so it was more about collaborating with other vendors. There are still conversations around confidentiality there, and so that’s why all of the raw data is not shared, but at a high level, I did share what I felt like I could. I talked to all the SSI vendors that you’ve likely heard of, and got every one of them, with maybe an exception or two, depending on who you want to count in that arena as a vendor. I would say it’s perhaps not exhaustive, but it was many of the more prominent players and talking to them: “Where are your customers at? Have they gone to production? What’s essentially the scale of that deployment? What’s the approach?</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to that last component that you’re talking about, around the chicken and egg problem. Of course, if a bank is willing to accept a driver’s license and you already have a digital driver’s license on your device, and you can simply tap an NFC (Near Field Communications) reader as you walk into the bank — you can imagine really great user experiences once this stuff is widespread. But until that point, there’s a challenge with identifying where the specific value is, that verifiable credentials can add. My answer there was that there are really two ways to get around that: one is to take an ecosystem-type approach, which I think we’ve seen some successes in doing; and the other is to take a single-sided approach. That refers to the two- or three-sided marketplace that is SSI at scale. If we take one side of that, it would involve working with the Issuer, and trying to solve a problem for the Issuer. Or, to work with the Verifier, and try to solve a problem with the Verifier. In other words, you are starting with only one side of the Trust Triangle.</p>
<p>I asked approximately 30-odd people in this survey I did, and this was an hour-long interview with each of these people: I dug deep into the background behind the answers. Fifty percent of them said that an ecosystem-type approach was the right way to go, and fifty percent said a single-sided approach was the right way to go. So, really, the answer is that nobody knows what the right way is. Maybe the answer is that there is no right way; it’s whatever works for a given use case. But somehow, in order to reach the level of value that we all see in SSI, we have to get some kind of network of verifiable credential Issuers, Verifiers, and Holders to exist. Once those networks can cross-pollinate, and you can get a network of networks, or a network of ecosystems is maybe is another way to think about it: that’s when the value is really tremendous. That’s when the promises, that we all want to see happen, will be unlocked.</p>
<p>In order to get there, you’ve got to start somewhere, right? You’ve got to start with some immediate use case that can add value. The fax machine took nearly 100 years to achieve a widespread network effect. When the fax machine started out, its first initial use cases were point-to-point selling within US Military applications, because it’s very secure. So, sending confidential documentation from point-to-point within the military, that was the first use case for the fax machine. That’s a single-sided use case — it’s selling a new technology to one party, and having them implement it internally or for their own processes. Beyond that, it eventually became a way for other companies to get data from the US military and from the US postal service. That’s where the network effect was built from; it started on a single-sided adoption with one party, and then other people started building on top of that network or that initial node, and building other nodes relative to the first one, thereby creating a network effect.</p>
<p>The question I ask in that blog is, “What’s the best way to make that happen within SSI?” Is it to go after a single party, such as the Issuer or Verifier, or is it to try to tackle a whole ecosystem, and get both sides of the market there from the start? An example of that, would be something like COVID credentials, where the lab issues the credential, and some employer, or airline, or venue, verifies the credential. In those cases, there are effectively two sides; two separate parties that are interacting. I can’t speak to what’s best. What I can say, is that in our worldview, or with the people that we work with, the ecosystems have been the deployments that have seen strong initial adoption. That doesn’t mean that the other approach won’t work also; I think those models are not mutually exclusive. We created the Trinsic Ecosystems product to lean into that insight that we had on ecosystems, and to make it easier for people to bring Issuers and Verifiers and Holders into a single trust ecosystem, without a lot of custom development work and implementation. Faxes are unfortunately still used today for stuff — every time I see that, I can’t get over it. But, well, it goes to show how powerful a network effect can be. Think about the fact that faxing is still so prominent; we may not use it in our everyday life quite as much, but when you look at global volumes, it’s still a very prominent communication vehicle around the world for secure document sharing. The fact that that is true is a testament to how powerful a network effect can be. If we can create a network effect with something that empowers individuals, and gives them more privacy and autonomy and things like that, then that’s something I absolutely want to be a part of.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Riley, thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Riley: Thanks for having me; this has been an awesome conversation.</p>

 HoloSign, Anyone? <p>Recently, DocuSign CEO Daniel Springer <a href="https://qz.com/1942479/docusign-ceo-says-blockchain-is-too-expensive-for-wide-adoption/amp/">said it would never work to create a blockchain version of DocuSign</a> because it would be extremely expensive and inefficient, even though the management of electronic signatures and agreements would seem to be just the kind of use case blockchain promises to address.</p><p>He’s totally right. Storing all those PDFs on a blockchain would be ridiculously expensive, because everyone running a blockchain node would need to store a complete record of every document that’s ever been signed. Yikes.</p><p>But a decentralized version of DocuSign would be easy to create and simple to run on Holochain. We even thought about building it ourselves just to show how easily it can be done… but then we thought a better idea would be to put it out there to our developer community, since there’s a real opportunity here. If you’ve been wanting a tech business idea for a proven concept with a large addressable market and multiple advantages over the competition, now you have one.</p><p>Or maybe DocuSign, HelloSign, or DocHub want to get in on the action? You guys already have the UI and the integrations with other web services, so you’d just be building new data infrastructure, which Holochain makes completely secure and easy to do.</p><p>Imagine how elegant this would be:</p><p>PDFs are stored not on a centralized cloud server, but hosted by users themselves on their own source chains – locally stored, immutable hash chains containing all the documents they’ve ever signed as well as logs of all the actions they’ve ever taken related to those documents (created, edited, signed, sent to so-and-so, etc.). Users will value owning their own data and having control over their identity and keys – features which are not only native to Holochain’s infrastructure but also guaranteed by Holochain’s <a href="https://github.com/holochain/cryptographic-autonomy-license">Cryptographic Autonomy License</a>.</p><p>Users have the choice to install or not install a desktop app – and, later, a mobile app. (Holochain mobile support is in the future plans.)</p>  If they install the app, they’re self-hosting their data as well as shards of the distributed hash table (DHT) that serves to balance storage across the nodes of the network. The more that your user base chooses to install and run the app, the more they become a part of your hosting infrastructure, which drives down costs. So it will be good to make the app handy and friendly: easy access to all your documents at your fingertips, whether online or offline.  If they don’t install the app, they sign and access documents through their web browser, the same way that most people use DocuSign and similar products today. Their documents could be hosted on the Holo hosting network, which is a peer-hosting network for serving Holochain apps and data to users not running Holochain apps locally. Web-based users would still be able to download PDFs, just as they can from DocuSign and similar today.  <p>Documents are signed using digital signatures associated with user-owned private cryptographic keys (in addition to hand-drawn or script-font signatures), which ensures in a fully traceable way that document signatures are legitimate. The integrity of all data and operations is ensured by Holochain’s peer-validation protocols.</p><p>The DHT could ensure that a solid number of encrypted backups exist at all times (maybe 25 or 50) without being endlessly duplicated like in blockchain. This way, no single entity is holding the only copies of the data. (PS – there is probably no need to store documents as PDFs on the DHT; rich text would work just as well and be much lighter.) Alternatively, documents could be stored only on user source chains for an ultra-high degree of privacy not possible in centralized or blockchain scenarios.</p><p>Holochain is free to use. Unlike in blockchain, individual nodes are not subject to a heavy computation load, and there is no need to store all the data in each node, so there are no gas costs.</p><p>The hosting of documents may also be a cost savings relative to centralized web hosting, depending on the market price of hosting on the Holo Hosting Network.</p><p>The bottom line: a Holochain version of DocuSign would be easy to build, would empower users more than existing products, and would be far more feasible than a blockchain version… plus might be less expensive to run even than a centralized version. Electronic agreement management is a good example of a use case that blockchain is ill-equipped to solve, and a great example of a use case that Holochain is perfectly equipped to solve.</p><p>If you do take up this challenge, let us know so that we can let the world know what you are up to!<br></p>

We’re on track towards a world where everything that can be, will be tokenized.




 




Tokenization could play a critical part in enabling more equitable value creation for people, organisations and things. Providing the means to issue and store value, trace provenance, and most importantly achieve consensus to instantly trust. <br><br>However, in order for this tokenized world to emerge, we first need the infrastructure for people and their digital twins to participate. This will include a trusted digital identity and the means to be verified, present credentials and transact.




 




With the rise of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">Non-fungible Tokens</a> (NFT) and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com">crypto markets</a> at an all time high, this world of tomorrow is very much becoming part of our everyday. In March 2021, John Glen, treasury minister said the UK would focus on <a>regulating stablecoins</a> as a first priority given the possible threat to competition.




 




In April 2021, the U.K. Treasury and Bank of England announced the launch of a joint taskforce to explore the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/uk-to-explore-issuing-its-own-digital-currency-amid-bitcoin-boom.html">potential for a central bank digital currency</a>. This is in line with other central banks developing strategies whilst China is charging forward, having already carried out a number of tests with its digital yuan.




 




Then to Australia, where <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au">eftpos</a> recently announced joining the Hedera Governing Council after successfully conducting tests to determine the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37360/australias-eftpos-to-set-up-hedera-hashgraph-node-for-micropayments">feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments</a>. eftpos has been Australia’s go-to payment system since 1984, processing over 2 billion debit card transactions in 2020 worth an average of more than $300 million each day. The stablecoin project was led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roballennodl/">Robert Allen</a>, eftpos’ entrepreneur in residence, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecZbyn8AxU">shares more about this exciting project with Zenobia Godschalk</a>, SVP of Corporate Communications for <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a>.




 




Since 2012, <a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> has been pioneering the access, protection and value exchange of personal data and identity. Over the past year, Meeco has been working towards making much of this new world possible with the development of a multi-purpose wallet to enable decentralised identity, verifiable credentials, micropayments and tokens.




 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, our CEO &amp; Founder, will be a <a href="https://www.zyen.com/events/all-events/everything-will-be-tokenized-future-identity/">guest speaker at this FS Club webinar</a> and will feature some of the use-cases,  practical steps and challenges along the way to developing these technologies. Topics will include decentralised identity, tokenomics, micropayments, governance, recovery, treasury, progressive disclosure and consent.




 




Also speaking is <a href="https://www.zyen.com/about/our-team/professor-michael-mainelli/">Professor Michael Mainelli</a>, Executive Chairman of <a href="https://www.zyen.com/">Z/Yen Group</a> and The <a href="https://fsclub.zyen.com/">Financial Services Club</a>. Michael holds many prestigious positions in academia and is an award winning author of four books and dozens of papers. Michael has worked in the public sector on privatizations and strategy; in the private sector in a variety of industries (banking, insurance, manufacturing, media, retail, utilities, television, distribution, IT) on problems ranging from strategy through information systems, quality, human resources, environmental systems and R&amp;D; and in the voluntary sector on a number of assignments to improve performance.




 




You can join the free webinar on Wednesday, 12 May 2021 from 11:00 – 11:45 BST.

On the one hand, that’s exciting. Technology is enabling and empowering. In the past year, we’ve seen it unleash profound untapped potential in ourselves, in our society, and in our industry.</p><p>On the other hand, our reliance on technology can sometimes feel like a toxic relationship. Just as we’ve become more enabled and empowered by technology, that technology is, more than ever, controlled by a handful of increasingly powerful firms. Gone are the days when we viewed Silicon Valley with rose-tinted glasses. It’s become clear that power gained by Big Tech often comes at the expense of individuals, smaller companies, and society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Which is where we find ourselves today.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-tech-giants-just-keep-growing-11619841644?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The quintet set records for sales and profits.

Crypto’s compelling alternative narrative <p>I don’t think it’s any coincidence that we’ve seen the rise of crypto and blockchain in parallel to the consolidation of power at the top — first in the wake of the greatest financial calamity since the Great Depression, fueled by the rise of too-big-to-fail megabanks, and now building steam during this era of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p><p>Sure, the price swings are exhilarating. The get-rich-quick schemes are seductive. But crypto’s most compelling quality is that it offers an alternative story — that of decentralization. In other words, everything that Big Tech is not. It’s a story of individual empowerment, about not having to rely on a big corporation or a too-big-too-fail bank or government that’s got too much on its&nbsp;plate.</p><p>That’s the story at least. The reality will always be a bit more nuanced. But that story? There’s a ton of energy behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so here’s the NYTimes announcing, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/technology/cryptocurrency-mainstream.html">We’re All Crypto People&nbsp;Now</a>:</p><blockquote>The result? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/business/dogecoin-price.html">Dogecoin</a>, a joke currency based on a meme about a Shiba Inu, is a hot topic on CNBC. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/business/how-did-coinbase-stock-do.html">Coinbase</a>, a crypto exchange, is now a publicly listed company worth $58 billion.

Chart of the&nbsp;week  4. The state of self-sovereign identity <p>One of the stories borne out of crypto’s emergence was the idea that we could leverage blockchain in order to give individuals control of their digital identity (and their data) versus say, having Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook call all the&nbsp;shots.</p><p>Christopher Allen is an Executive Director and Principal Architect of Blockchain Commons a “not-for-profit” social benefit corporation committed to open infrastructure. Five years ago, he wrote, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/path-self-sovereign-identity">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p><p>Here he is, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">five years&nbsp;on</a>:</p><blockquote>It was five years ago today that I wrote The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity for CoinDesk, my foundational article discussing the history of digital identity and laying out principles for creating a new sort of identity, based on individual control and human rights. It was written to address a problem that was growing year by year: Facebook was increasingly controlling our access to the online world, and Google was increasingly correlating all of the information about us. Meanwhile, the refugee crisis in Europe was highlighting the problem that 1.1 billion people in the world were living without digital identity at all, denying them crucial access to financial, political and social&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>There are now any number of companies advancing these ideas: Self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry. There are so many that the best way to talk about them is simply through an overview of the largest communities. A variety of companies are closely aligning to the W3C specs, including members of the W3C-CCG (Credential Community Group) such as Digital Bazaar, which has persistently supported the work of Rebooting the Web of Trust; the Decentralized Identity Foundation is also working on creating a decentralized identity ecosystem, with leadership from Microsoft and Consensys; and the Linux Foundation is working on Hyperledger Indy with companies such as International Business Machines and Evernym. It’s not just a large ecosystem, but a healthy one, with a number of different voices each suggesting different ways forward and with many new voices emerging.</blockquote><p>It’s also fair to say that GlobaliD has come a long way in the past 5&nbsp;years.</p> 5. Where are the Big Tech regulators? <p>In China. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-financial-regulators-summon-big-tech-firms-11619698257?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>China’s central bank and other financial regulators have ordered 13 internet companies that operate online financial services to fix problems in their business practices, in the latest indication of how Beijing is tightening its control over the growing fintech&nbsp;sector.</blockquote><blockquote>The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission said on its website that the regulators on Thursday jointly conducted interviews with internet firms including Tencent, ByteDance, Didi Chuxing, Meituan and JD.com, as part of the government’s effort to strengthen its supervision of online financial services. The regulators pointed out widespread problems in the sector such as the lack of corporate governance, unfair competition and violation of consumer rights, according to the statement.</blockquote><blockquote>The statement comes as China’s government is stepping up its effort to rein in the country’s most powerful tech companies. Earlier this week, China’s market regulator launched an antitrust investigation into food delivery app Meituan. The regulator earlier this month slapped an anti-monopoly fine of nearly $2.8 billion on e-commerce giant&nbsp;Alibaba.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-financial-regulators-summon-big-tech-firms-11619698257?mod=djem10point">China Warns Large Tech Firms as Industry Faces Rising Oversight</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearings-congress-abafd409-fa63-4e37-9209-77f24125b231.html">What four years of high-profile Big Tech hearings have really accomplished</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/internet-industry-privacy-measures-apple-google-cb7b0117-9966-4fce-8d04-30e7b77eeeff.html">Internet industry braces for new privacy&nbsp;rules</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/algorithms-congress-transparency-hearing-9893ea60-d4d0-43b9-a5f7-e267257c8968.html">Congress drags algorithms out of the&nbsp;shadows</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/world-tech-regulation-8d96502a-1400-4439-9ca8-c73ee4594a3b.html">The world regulates Big Tech while U.S.&nbsp;dithers</a>   6. Sometimes you have to litigate to&nbsp;innovate <p>That’s something GlobaliD co-founder and CEO <a href="https://global.id/">/gregkidd</a> likes to say. It’s an unfortunate truth — particularly in the case of Big Tech where the balance of power is shifted so far in one direction.</p><p>Epic Games clearly got the memo. The trial begins&nbsp;today.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/business/dealbook/asian-american-foundation.html">Andrew Ross&nbsp;Sorkin</a>:</p><blockquote>Today, Apple and Epic Games meet in court for a trial that could have implications for the future of the App Store and the antitrust fight against Big Tech. DealBook spoke with Jack Nicas, a technology reporter for The Times, about what’s at&nbsp;stake.</blockquote><p>(The stakes are high.) Jack&nbsp;Nicas:</p><blockquote>If you’re a company that sells any digital goods or services, whether a game, music or a dating platform, you likely pay a large share of your revenues to Apple. If Epic wins here, that could eventually put an end to Apple’s commissions, or at least cause Apple to loosen its control over the App Store. So it really would upend the economics of the app industry. And beyond that, an Epic win would boost the push for antitrust charges against some of the biggest tech companies, including Apple.</blockquote><blockquote>Now on the other side, if Apple wins, it’s really only going to bolster its already strong position.</blockquote><p>There’s also going to be a lot of tangentially interesting stuff — like this little tidbit about iMessage. <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-7c7d6033-036b-4f32-8dbb-d9b712341cf1.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Epic, meanwhile, cites a bunch of internal emails where Apple, among other things, decided not to do iMessage for Android because it could make it easier for people to switch off the iPhone. (My thought bubble: Even without the emails, we know that’s what Apple decided because if they hadn’t, we’d all have iMessage on Android by&nbsp;now.)</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>One of Epic’s economic experts <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/apple-s-app-store-had-78-profit-margin-in-2019-testimony-shows">estimates that Apple’s profit margins on the App Store are more than 77%</a>. Apple disputes this&nbsp;figure.</blockquote><p>The very existence of this case says a lot about where we are in time right now. A developer taking on Apple would have been unthinkable even a year or two&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Meanwhile in Europe. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/93b91f">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Two years after Spotify lodged a complaint against Apple’s App Store commissions and rules, Europe’s top antitrust regulator has found the U.S. company has been in breach of the continent’s competition laws.</blockquote><blockquote>The European Commission announced on Friday that Apple abused its market position around the rules of the app store. The Commission’s top competition enforcer Margarethe Vestager said Apple charged “high commission fees on rivals” like Spotify and also “forbids them to inform (users of) alternative subscription options.”</blockquote><blockquote>It is a preliminary finding — and Apple will get a chance to respond to the charges — but the news will be music to the ears of Spotify and the company’s other rivals who have been publicly campaigning against the company’s app store rules for several&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/eu-apple-antitrust-spotify-5e7ae972-81dd-4438-94d6-40d401683b6e.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">EU charges Apple with antitrust violations stemming from Spotify&nbsp;case</a>   7. The life of a chill content&nbsp;creator <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-holds-a-meme-summit-cameo-opens-its-wallet">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Rick McGuire, 36, is behind two of my favorite Instagram accounts: @subwaycreatures (2.2 million followers) and @whatisnewyork (791k followers). These share funny and bizarre sightings across New York City. McGuire is also on TikTok, Twitter and&nbsp;YouTube.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s basically people watching to the max,” McGuire&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>How he got started: In 2011, McGuire commuted into New York City from New Jersey and would send photos and videos of weird sightings to family and friends. He created a website, then as Instagram started growing in 2013, he moved his content to the&nbsp;app.</blockquote><blockquote>How he makes money: A full-time operation of one, he sells merchandise, makes money from sponsored content deals with Netflix, Kayak and Coors Light, and inked a licensing deal for the videos he posts. Pre-pandemic, record labels and musicians paid him to promote pop-up concerts inside the New York City subway. McGuire is also working on a coffee table book of notes people find in New York apartment lobbies and writing a TV pilot called “What Is New York.” He generates about $100,000 in annual&nbsp;revenue.</blockquote> 8.

        <p>We are very proud to be included in this conversation with the Sudanese government!</p>
<p>“Sudan’s Governmental officials believe that Blockchain will be impactful for the country. These statements were made during the Blockchain for Government initiative visit to Sudan led by Bitcoin Association, the Swiss-based non profit organization. The visit was at the invitation and under the patronage of the Ministry of telecom and Digital transformation in Sudan.”</p>
<p>“The visit centred around Sudan’s first-ever Blockchain Summit &amp; Workshop, a two-day event held April 8-9 and led by the BSV blockchain ecosystem. The conference and surrounding meetings explored how blockchain technology can advance digital transformation as the country rebuilds and re-emerges after 30 years of isolation from much of the world.”</p>

  <p></p>
<p>One of the most striking things about Urbit is the ideological diversity between communities. The Community Spotlight blog series will focus on various Urbit communities via interviews with founding members.</p>
<p>For the first week of the Community Spotlight series, I (~tirwyd-sarmes) will be speaking with Josh Reagan (~taglux-nidsep). Josh is the founder of The Portico, an Urbit community of Eastern Orthodox Christians.</p>
<p>The Portico is a very active group with conversations taking place over multiple channels. There are channels for posting Orthodox iconography, discussing the broader Christian culture war, and just talking about Orthodoxy in general. Of particular interest is Josh’s “Euthyphro” blog series which investigates the relationship between logic and the Orthodox faith. This is a topic that Josh is well qualified to talk about: he has a PhD in Philosophy from Rice University. His dissertation on the epistemology of logic and truth-preservation was titled "Knowing Your Limits: Logic for Limited Beings”. Josh is also the co-author of a forthcoming textbook on formal logic.</p>
<p>To read Josh’s blog is to be inducted into two esoteric traditions: theory of logic and Orthodox theology. With titles like “St. Gregory the Theologian and the Liar Paradox” and “The Existence of Abstract Objects”, Josh does not pull punches.</p>
<p>Accordingly, our conversation focused on the idiosyncratic and niche community that The Portico is home to. There, you won’t find cussing or much talk about “life partners”, but you will find cutting critiques of liberalism and the best way to raise Orthodox children.</p>
<p>As other users have pointed out, Urbit is pre-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September">Eternal September</a>. In fact, there’s some hope that the very nature of Urbit, how it tries to protect the sovereignty of niche communities via decentralization, might foil the Eternal September phenomenon. If Josh’s community persists, it will be a testament to both Josh and the decentralized Urbit network. As of now The Portico is a refreshing, perhaps jarring (as Josh might say), reminder of what the internet looked like back in the early days—a place for those who are different.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take a look. Find The Portico at ~topnup-firber/the-portico.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Do you see any connection between Rod Dreher’s The Benedict Option and your community on Urbit? Dreher sees a need for American Christians to create self-sustaining communities outside of the mainstream to protect the Christian religion and culture.</p>
<p>It’s tough to say with certainty—I’ve never read The Benedict Option.</p>
<p>A few years ago, while he was writing the book, I was a regular reader of Dreher’s blog. From his descriptions there, I was never clear about what exactly he was proposing. Much of his “clarification” came by way of metaphor: don’t “run for the hills”, but stop “shoring up the American imperium”. I didn’t read his book because I didn’t have much confidence that he would be especially precise or insightful.</p>
<p><a href="https://handleshaus.wordpress.com/2020/10/06/review-of-rod-drehers-live-not-by-lies/">There is an interesting review I’d recommend</a>, however, of his later book, Live Not By Lies. I believe it accurately characterizes the scale of the threat Christians will soon face in this country.</p>
<p>My upbringing was conservative Christian and self-consciously counter-cultural. I've inherited that understanding of what it means to be a Christian in an increasingly secular world. It comes naturally to me, so I find it obvious that Christians should form self-sustaining communities. But the details matter. What do such communities look like? How do we secure the freedom to pursue such communities? How do we sustain them, when myriad external forces seek to undermine them? How do we solve the long-term problem of the declining cultural importance of Christianity (which surely erodes the plausibility of our religion to many, even to some of those with sympathies toward it)?</p>
<p>I don’t claim to know the answers to these questions.</p>
<p>One kind of answer is that we should redouble our efforts to support and maintain a religiously and morally neutral liberal political order, which leaves room for subcultures to live and self-regulate as they wish. I disagree. Those who support a kind of “neutral” liberalism view it as an attempt to go “meta” and rise above various parochial metaphysical, moral, and religious disputes. I view this as a cop-out, a refusal to grapple with the most important questions.</p>
<p>Does the liberal have metaphysically-rooted moral reasons for going “meta”? If so, then he’s just another sectarian and he should be honest about it. The only difference is that his team has had the whip hand for the last several generations. On the other hand, if the liberal claims no underlying metaphysical justification then his project can succeed only to the extent that he can arrange and adjudicate unprincipled (and therefore ad hoc) agreements between otherwise hostile moral communities. But how stable can such an arrangement really be?</p>
<p>Orthodox Christians have theologically rich, metaphysical foundations for their social and moral teachings. With these we can form healthy, thriving, and growing communities. We can do so even under actively hostile political orders. If the early Church could make it under the Romans, so can we today. But it’s going to be difficult and sound judgment is necessary. Unfortunately, we lack strong leadership and that leaves us vulnerable. If we stay uncoordinated we dissipate our energies needlessly. If we latch onto the wrong leaders we can be led astray.</p>
<p>The challenges are immense. There is no technological solution. Even so, I’m an Urbit early-adopter for a reason. Over the years I’ve come into contact with a number of Orthodox and Ortho-curious Urbit followers. Why not try to bring them together in an Urbit group?</p>
<p>As far as I know, no one in the group is clergy. We’re all just a bunch of laymen with no authority to do much of anything. But I’d like to think we can still contribute in some way. I have an academic background in analytic philosophy so my inclination is to emphasize theory, but we have room for a bit of everything. Someone in the group wrote a script to take the texts of various Church Fathers and convert them to audio using AWS Polly. Those turned out pretty well!</p>
<p>At times I entertain ambitions to do a bit more, but for now perhaps it’s better to keep expectations in check. If nothing else, we can read and discuss the Scriptures and Church Fathers together, and try to understand better how to apply and live out their teachings. As we continue to grow the community and develop a consistent internal dynamic perhaps opportunities will arise that aren’t yet on the horizon. One thing I can say is that I’m committed to keeping the group active and growing.</p>
<p>I’d like to talk about your blog on The Portico. It combines two of your main interests: logic and theology. In broad strokes, do you think theology and logic are compatible? What is the relevance of this intersection to both of these disciplines?</p>
<p>I feel obligated to answer this question in two ways.</p>
<p>(1) If by “logic” you mean “first-order predicate calculus”, then I think there’s no special conflict between logic and theology. There are certain puzzles about their relationship, but similar puzzles exist between logic and other disciplines. Theology isn't especially endangered.</p>
<p>For example, in the 1930s, Alfred Tarski proved his famous Undefinability Theorem. Crudely put, it says that a plausible truth predicate cannot consistently be contained in any formal system with axioms strong enough to model arithmetic. Superficially it seems like our options are (a) get rid of the concept of truth, (b) get rid of arithmetic, or (c) throw away parts of logic until all inconsistency disappears.</p>
<p>None of these options is appealing. Tarski came up with a solution that mostly satisfies many logicians: reduce the concept of truth to “truth in a language” and forbid any language from containing its own truth predicate. If you want to talk about truth in a language L-1, you have to do it from a “metalanguage”, L-2.</p>
<p>Is Tarski’s definition of truth in a language the definitive solution for preserving truth, math, and logic? Perhaps not many philosophers think so, and there’s a massive literature in which logicians have attempted to improve on or extend his results.</p>
<p>Sometimes people seem to think formal logic is an infallible gift from heaven that must always be right. Kant said in the Critique of Pure Reason that formal logic is essentially a completed field. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-Royal_Logic">the logic of his day</a> was an early-modern Cartesian variation of a medieval scholastic synthesis of ancient Stoic and Aristotelian logics. Roughly 100 years after Kant’s first critique was published, C. S. Peirce and Gottlob Frege independently discovered first-order mathematical logic as we know it today, inaugurating the greatest advance of logic since Aristotle. Kant was wrong.</p>
<p>Mathematical logic is a convenient, generally reliable, man-made tool that, when used carelessly in certain untamed domains, can lead one astray. Probably most people reading this are familiar with such puzzles as the Liar paradox. When one understands that logic is not a completed science, and perhaps never will be, there is less reason to worry about whether it can be used to nuke entire disciplines, like theology.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, see the blog post in my Urbit group: “St. Gregory the Theologian and the Liar Paradox”.</p>
<p>(2) There is perhaps a deeper challenge than the one I’ve just sketched. The Stoics used the term “logic” to encompass what we might today call “epistemology”. If the word “logic” is meant in some such broad and normative sense, then we may restate the challenge as one about rationality and theology. Is it irrational to pursue theology in our modern age?</p>
<p>As an undergraduate under the influence of Kierkegaard, I was attracted to a romantic, vaguely irrationalist notion of faith. Dawkins-mania was at its peak and I was disgusted by the pop-rationality (or was it empiricism?) of his annoying followers. Their view seemed to be that rationality just means “following the evidence”. The raw evidence is foundational, and theories are built atop by generalizing from the evidence. The ghost of logical positivism is with us even now.</p>
<p>I was dimly aware that Quine and others had made it difficult to sustain epistemic foundationalism. However, being unable to supply a more clear and cogent notion of rationality, I became skeptical of the idea altogether. But I went too far.</p>
<p>Instead, the proper response is to develop a superior account of rationality. Readers can probably guess where I went looking!</p>
<p>The word “logic” comes from the Greek “λόγος”. This is also the word used to describe Jesus Christ in the Gospel of John: “In the beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was with God, and the Logos was God.” This connection is not merely etymological.</p>
<p>For many ancients, the term “λόγος” meant something like “divine principle”. You might think of it as akin to a law of nature, but with stronger theological connotations. Christians appropriated this term and made it rather more exalted: the Logos is begotten of the Father, and yet somehow one with Him.</p>
<p>We are told that all things come into being through the Logos (John 1:3), giving Him an intimate relationship to the whole of creation. He gives structure and order to all created things, and in His divinity He understands them as so structured and ordered. He is also sinless, perfectly holy, and good. In Christ we have a perfect unity of the knowledge of all truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>Man was created in the image of God, which means that we bear a likeness to Christ. And we are commanded to realize that likeness with ever greater fidelity (Romans 8:29). The Church calls the pursuit of this likeness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosis_(Eastern_Christian_theology)">“theosis”</a>.</p>
<p>Thus we have the explanation of all normativity, according to Orthodox Christianity. In moral matters we must take on the holiness of Christ. In epistemic matters we aspire to the wisdom and knowledge of Christ, which includes an understanding of the whole created order. Socially we (the community of believers, i.e. the Church) are called to be in ever greater communion with God, cooperating with His work just as the Son cooperates with the Father.</p>
<p>Sadly we are conceived in sin and ignorant; hence the need for redemption by Christ.</p>
<p>Accordingly, my understanding of what it means to be rational is just to be Christ-like. The only perfect exemplar of reason, so construed, is Christ Himself. Any deviation from Him is irrational. What could be more logical than to be conformed to the Logos? But we cannot attain rationality without redemption. Hence we cannot become rational without first being saved from sin.</p>
<p>Doubtlessly many will find all of this too much to take, just too implausible. What about the development of mathematics, or the advances of the sciences? These are canonically ennobling, intellectual achievements. Jesus wasn’t a mathematician or a scientist! Nowhere in the Scriptures is He recorded as having applied Bayes’ theorem.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly my construal of rationality de-emphasizes the pursuit of knowledge by labeling it as merely one of several normative ends. To seek knowledge without seeking holiness is to be understood as dangerously unbalanced. To try to attain holiness and knowledge without communion with God is arrogant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need not exaggerate matters. St. Paul affirms the need for specialization of labor within the Church (1 Cor. 12). There is room for some to specialize in intellectual endeavors, so long as they act in a cooperative setting in which the other virtues are pursued as well. (Nor should anyone neglect the development of such virtues in himself.) Mathematicians and physicists are more than welcome in the Church.</p>
<p>According to this (all too briefly put) theory of rationality, there can be no conflict between ‘logic’ and theology. Theology is compatible with rationality because the account of rationality in question derives from a theological tradition. Naturally I’ve only given a sketch; much more could be said. But even if some readers are put off by the theory presented here, I hope it’s at least clear that there are conflicting notions of rationality. Anyone who wants to be rational confronts the task of figuring out which theory of rationality is correct.</p>
<p>In terms of community moderation, The Portico follows norms that are quite different than other online communities, often times quite drastically. For instance, living with women that you are not married to, is not something that should be talked about lightly. Can you talk about the importance of norms and how they relate to a healthy community?</p>
<p>Orthodox Christians are not commanded to “get along” with the rest of the world (John 15:18-25). We’re different, and our norms of interaction should likewise differ from those of outsiders. There is no one, monolithic “Orthodox culture”, but there are standards governing which local expressions of culture are legitimate and which are sinful. We should live in a way that enables and promotes holiness and discourages sin.</p>
<p>We have rules that may seem unusual from the outside. I don’t permit profanity, lewd jokes, or irreverent comments about God. In your question you mention a living arrangement that is prevalent in the world. Another rule I have is that we shouldn’t talk causally about sinful practices or lifestyles as if they are unremarkable parts of ordinary life. If Orthodox Christianity is true then such things aren’t minor peccadilloes. They’re spiritually destructive. The marriage-bond sanctifies activities that would otherwise be sinful.</p>
<p>If someone wants to analyze what is destructive about men and women living together before marriage, we’re open to that. But if you want to be affirmed in your sin, we’re not the place for you. Anyone of any religious creed is welcome to show up—but as a guest in an Orthodox Christian community. Hosts should be courteous to guests, but my first priority is not to make you feel good about your choices. We’re here to encourage each other, learn, and grow spiritually as Orthodox Christians. Naturally that means a little gate-keeping may sometimes be necessary if someone ever comes along who doesn’t share those goals. Being different is difficult and takes work.</p>
<p>In a way the cultural contrast is meant to be jarring. It can force you to confront moral and cultural presuppositions that you didn’t even know you had. When you become aware of the wider choices of culture available to you, you become free to look with a critical eye on the culture you’ve hitherto taken for granted. I think anyone could see how that might be liberating, even before considering the particulars of the cultures in question. Of course, as an Orthodox Christian, I think we have a good case to make about the particulars of our subculture.</p>
<p>I’ve never had to kick or ban anyone from the group. The group is relatively small (~180 people at the moment) so that probably helps. The vast majority of conversations are relaxed and friendly. Occasionally there are intense debates about one issue or another but I enjoy it, as long as it doesn’t become bitter or the primary mode of discourse. But everything ought to be done in a spirit of truth-seeking, not of one-upmanship.</p>
<p>The fact that The Portico can exist side-by-side with atheist communities on Urbit is pretty striking. On Urbit, a user is able to create niche communities and governance structures and yet still participate in a larger network. In other words, Urbit is trying to thread the needle between sameness and difference through federation at multiple levels. It seems to me that modern culture has become homogeneous due to an inability to maintain, or distinguish between, different communities. People who have nothing in common are forced to engage as if they were roommates, while those who are similar have trouble creating their own home. In other words, what is the role of community formation in the modern world and how does it connect to your critique of liberalism? Does Urbit have anything to say about this?</p>
<p>As I said in an earlier response, I see the liberal project as more or less an attempt to sidestep (not solve) difficult metaphysical and religious disputes between various distinct moral communities. Liberals have tried several methods of governance to achieve their ends. We can divide such attempts into two broad categories: centralized and decentralized.</p>
<p>Social media companies in the US confront similar governance challenges, so we can analyze them in similar terms.</p>
<p>A social network like Facebook takes a centralized approach. Zuckerberg spoke early and often of his desire to connect people and “bring the world closer together”. There was a sense that if people from various communities could get to know each other a little better, we would see how much we have in common and make progress toward some kind of universal cosmopolitan consensus.</p>
<p>But that didn’t happen. With centralized social media you’re practically guaranteed to interact with people whose moral and metaphysical commitments are sharply at odds with your own. As a result, you face a persistent, nagging risk of conflict. Without warning, a friendly disagreement can explode into an all-out flame war. Most choose one of two basic approaches for dealing with this threat:</p>
<p>(1) You live a compartmentalized life. You keep your moral and metaphysical commitments to yourself and cultivate a culturally homogenized persona for your social media activities. No one disagrees with you because there’s nothing to disagree with.</p>
<p>(2) You can enlist to fight in the culture war and display your regimental colors with pride. And because you take your smartphone everywhere you’re always on the front line.</p>
<p>These aren’t the only options, of course. With some combination of charisma, patience, and grace you can be relatively open about your beliefs without getting into too much trouble. But even if you have the talent to pull it off, it takes time and energy. Many of us aren’t willing to go to all that trouble. Social media is supposed to serve us, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Urbit is decentralized which, in my opinion, means that it isn’t really a network in the way that Facebook is. I see Urbit as more of a network platform. The users create the networks, or migrate them in from elsewhere. We’re all using Landscape and running our VMs on Nock, so obviously there can be interaction between different communities. But anyone who doesn’t want that cross-community interaction doesn’t have to have it.</p>
<p>I’ve followed Urbit’s progress since 2016, so I’m plugged into groups with other Urbit people I’ve come to know over the years. Other than that, however, I don’t know much about who’s out there. It’s not like The Portico is in one neighborhood and the atheists are in the next neighborhood over. There’s a real sense in which we’re not even on the same network—different Urbit communities share a common protocol, but a protocol isn’t a network.</p>
<p>Some people may want to see a little of everything. If atheists want to join our group they’re welcome to do so! We’ll be friendly. I don’t seek out their groups, though.</p>
<p>One virtue of decentralized social media is that it offers a totally different set of trade-offs with respect to how you share and act on your beliefs. What if you could talk earnestly about philosophy and religion without having to worry about alienating many of your friends and family? I guess that’s somewhat possible on Facebook—do they still have “groups”?—but Urbit was designed for it.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I don’t think decentralization is a panacea. Even if Urbit takes off, it will likely face problems that are difficult to anticipate now. My hope is simply that Urbit’s trade-offs are healthier than the ones we’ve had before.</p>

<p>One day at a time. That was Sam Magtanong’s mantra when COVID-19 hit, threatening not only the long-dreamed-of expansion of the <a href="https://www.mostracoffee.com/">San Diego microroastery</a> he built with his wife and two friends, but of the business itself.</p>
<p>“My vision was, if I could stay open for the next day, and if I can pay my staff one more day, and if I can serve one more cup of coffee, there’s a blessing there,” he says. “We just looked at it that way, and we kept just trying to stay open another day.”</p>
<p>For many entrepreneurs, accessing the capital they need to build their businesses can be challenging even in flush times. When Sam and Beverly Magtanong and their partners Jelynn Malone and Mike Arquines opened their first Mostra Coffee location in 2018, they struggled with cash flow and turned to <a href="https://www.lendio.com/">Lendio</a> and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a> for a loan.</p>
<p>To help small businesses get the credit they need to grow and thrive, Lendio harnesses Finicity’s open banking platform, which lets people more easily share their banking data with other banks, lenders and fintech companies. It gives lenders a more holistic view of a person or business’s finances to help them determine their creditworthiness.</p>
<p>“Eliminating financial hurdles and introducing small business owners to capital opportunities they may not know exist can extend the spirit of entrepreneurship to more people,” says Denada Ramnishta, senior vice president of Lender &amp; Partner Strategy at Lendio.</p>
<p>The pandemic hit when Mostra Coffee was getting ready to open a second coffee shop. Lendio helped Mostra Coffee obtain a U.S. Paycheck Protection loan to keep the business running, hire back staff they had laid off at the start of the pandemic, and finish work on their second location. “I went from feeling a sense of desperation to feeling a sense of relief,” Magtanong says.</p>
<p>With the newest round of PPP loans, Lendio has started working with Finicity’s open banking platform to authenticate bank statements to reduce the risk of fraud in the process. Lendio and Finicity will be bringing their joint capabilities to small businesses in the U.K. and other markets in the coming months through a new strategic agreement.

<p><a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a>&nbsp;recently invited our co-CEO and CTO,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, to give&nbsp;the&nbsp;prestigious Annual&nbsp;InformaticsLecture.&nbsp;He spoke&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and the tech driving it this&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>, particularly around identity and anonymous profiles online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;lecture&nbsp;follows Paul’s recent panel discussion on the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">rise of privacy tech</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Privacy Day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Engineers Australia, Paul covered&nbsp;three big questions:&nbsp;</p>



  WHY&nbsp;we created&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  HOW&nbsp;we&nbsp;can solve&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/12/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;crisis</a>&nbsp;  



  WHAT we’ve&nbsp;built.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



 Why we created Anonyome Labs&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Paul reinforced that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are fed up</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>, and that the popular adage&nbsp;is&nbsp;indeed&nbsp;true:&nbsp;If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product.&nbsp;Big Tech and data brokers (and even everyday brands we know and love) are scooping up our&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>&nbsp;like candy and using it&nbsp;to generate&nbsp;massive profit.&nbsp;Big data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge of user behavior and influence&nbsp;thatbehavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul told the audience that we started Anonyome Labs&nbsp;because we believe the pendulum has swing too far; that people have lost control of their personal information. Even way back in 2014 when we started the company, we could see privacy was going to be a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue&nbsp;for&nbsp;years</a>&nbsp;to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There&nbsp;is no doubt&nbsp;that&nbsp;consumers are growing louder in their calls for change to data privacy.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Recent research</a> reveals:&nbsp;</p>



  High profile, significant, and regular <a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a> have spooked consumers. &nbsp;  Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a> for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data. &nbsp;  Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can.&nbsp;  Levels of consumer trust for brands is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>. &nbsp;  Consumers will <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a> brands or <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay purchases</a> where they perceive a risk to their personal data.&nbsp;  The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers.&nbsp;  



<p>We’ve seen some&nbsp;positive news&nbsp;in the data privacy space, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>, and we’ve seen somenegative news too: think&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/">WhatsApp</a>.&nbsp;So&nbsp;the bottom line is, we need to affect real change.&nbsp;</p>



 How we can solve the global data privacy crisis&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Privacy is a complex issue, but&nbsp;clearly&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;want and&nbsp;need to regain control of their personal data.&nbsp;We believe the&nbsp;solution lies&nbsp;in empowering users to protect their personal information&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">digital identities</a>&nbsp;and the related&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/why-we-need-decentralized-identity/">decentralized</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">self-sovereign</a>&nbsp;identities—the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&nbsp;know that when&nbsp;we&nbsp;use our personal identity,&nbsp;our data is tracked, collected, correlated, and sold&nbsp;and&nbsp;oftentimes&nbsp;reveals&nbsp;highly sensitive personal information&nbsp;about&nbsp;us, like medical history, financial situation or criminal record. Companies can easily&nbsp;end up with&nbsp;a full set of our&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;and use it to influence our buying and other behaviors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when&nbsp;we&nbsp;use&nbsp;a&nbsp;digital identity,&nbsp;we&nbsp;can separate from&nbsp;our personal identity&nbsp;and, even better,&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalize</a>&nbsp;all&nbsp;our&nbsp;different digital identities in a powerfully protective strategy.&nbsp;(Compartmentalization of&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data is so important,&nbsp;it’s worth reading&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">popular article</a>&nbsp;on the topic.)&nbsp;</p>



 What we’ve built&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Labs&nbsp;has built an innovative&nbsp;digital identity concept&nbsp;called the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>.&nbsp;A Sudo&nbsp;is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>A Sudo isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity&nbsp;that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s Sudo profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the Sudo profile and manage it. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos&nbsp;are&nbsp;the centrepiece of our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In MySudo,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;can create up to nine&nbsp;Sudos and each one&nbsp;can have its own set of attributes and associated capabilities: &nbsp;</p>



  name&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;  address&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email address</a>&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a> for secure shopping&nbsp;  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private&nbsp;browser</a>&nbsp;(all your bookmarks and any cookies that sites set are compartmentalized to the browsing Sudo)&nbsp;  notification settings for phone, email and message&nbsp;  contacts and more…&nbsp;  



<p>See the full range of <a href="https://mysudo.com/features/">features</a> (and more are coming soon). &nbsp;</p>



<p>The user&nbsp;gives&nbsp;each of&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudos one or more identity attributes that are different from&nbsp;their&nbsp;legal identity.&nbsp;They&nbsp;can make&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudo identity a little different (e.g. by having a different phone number) or very different (e.g. by having a different name, email address, phone number, virtual cards, contacts, etc.).&nbsp;The user&nbsp;labels&nbsp;each Sudo&nbsp;and&nbsp;can even assign a different notification sound to each, to alert&nbsp;them&nbsp;to the context of the incoming contact (is it my kid’s&nbsp;soccer coach or&nbsp;my&nbsp;bank is calling or messaging, for instance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users&nbsp;structure&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudos to achieve the degrees of privacy, safety, organization and convenience&nbsp;they&nbsp;need. For example,&nbsp;they&nbsp;might regard&nbsp;their <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924">medical information</a> as more sensitive than&nbsp;their&nbsp;financial information, and&nbsp;theirfinancial information as more sensitive than who&nbsp;they&nbsp;know.&nbsp;The user&nbsp;decides&nbsp;what suits&nbsp;them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;might want one of&nbsp;their&nbsp;Sudos to retain some of the benefits of ‘privacy invasive’ searching and tracking online. Health information is a great example. When researching a health condition,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;may want some level of tracking in order to preserve&nbsp;their&nbsp;search history, mark favorites, set bookmarks, be offered search results relevant to&nbsp;their&nbsp;previous searching, receive discount coupons for remedies, be offered new research material, or even be referred to doctors or hospitals specializing in&nbsp;their&nbsp;condition. By using a Sudo,&nbsp;they&nbsp;can still have all these benefits, but they’re not correlated to&nbsp;the user’s&nbsp;personal&nbsp;identity.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Sudos allow&nbsp;a user&nbsp;to do many things:&nbsp;</p>



  Call people and businesses&nbsp;  Send and receive texts&nbsp;  Have private communications with family and friends&nbsp;  Browse&nbsp;online&nbsp;and decide whether&nbsp;they&nbsp;want to be tracked&nbsp;  Protect&nbsp;themself&nbsp;when shopping online&nbsp;  Assign separate Sudos for different purposes&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be as anonymous as&nbsp;they&nbsp;feel is appropriate for the situation.&nbsp;  



<p>The integration of all these&nbsp;activities, like autofill&nbsp;for&nbsp;virtual card information, is also really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access Sudo Platform&nbsp;to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions,&nbsp;they can&nbsp;use&nbsp;the Sudo as part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">menu of high value privacy tools</a>&nbsp;delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul shared with Engineers Australia that in developing the Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before.&nbsp;And that’s what the global fight for privacy will&nbsp;demand&nbsp;from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages&nbsp;with user data: out of the box thinking and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>.</p>

That means big benefits to founders, stakeholders, and investors.</p><p>Find out how the team at Fairmint is championing a stakeholder capitalism, with passwordless authentication powered by&nbsp;Magic.</p> Better, passwordless UX <p>Aligning people to the success of a company is one of the toughest challenges for organizations of all shapes and sizes. The Fairmint model is uniquely built around community alignment, putting equity in the hands of a company’s employees, customers, partners, and&nbsp;fans.</p><p>Say you’re a founder. Using Fairmint, anyone in your community gets the opportunity to invest in your company at any single time, directly from your website with an “Invest now” button. Likewise, Fairmint lets you easily reward your key stakeholders by giving them a stake in your company’s future financial success.</p><p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/thibauld">Thibauld Favre</a>, CEO of Fairmint, started to tackle authentication and onboarding, he was extremely mindful about user experience. In effort to streamline onboarding, the team decided to transition from traditional password-based login to passwordless. The shift was a game-changer.</p><p>With the rapid rise in NFTs and cryptocurrencies, Fairmint intentionally wanted to appeal to mainstream users newer to the crypto ecosystem. Crypto wallets like MetaMask are too complex for broader audiences, requiring multiple steps and upfront explanation.</p><p>Emailed magic links, however, offer the perfect bridge between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. Users can simply log in through a passwordless flow they’re already familiar&nbsp;with.</p><blockquote>“Magic is by far the smoothest UX in Web&nbsp;3.0.”</blockquote><p>Beyond major improvements in speed, design, and ease of use, Thibauld counts “easy implementation” for developers and “super proactive, responsive customer support” as other compelling reasons why he and his team are happy customers who have advocated for Magic since the beginning.</p> Non-custodial as non-negotiable <p>Another significant factor for Fairmint was staying non-custodial.</p><p>Why? The non-custodial nature of DeFi wallets ensures users can safely store their own funds without having to rely on third-party institutions to hold their assets. For Fairmint, it’s a hard requirement to align with the standard for trust amongst crypto communities.</p><blockquote>“We were confident with Magic because it’s non-custodial.”</blockquote> Support for Fairmint’s mission <p>For a mission-driven company like Fairmint, it was critical to integrate a decentralized auth solution and remain non-custodial, without compromising a great user experience. Magic not only solves auth for developers, but the team is also more empowered to achieve their&nbsp;mission.</p><blockquote>“We can only do what we do because we’re non-custodial. Magic helps tremendously with that. It’s a key part of our value, enabling customers to host the Fairmint experience on their website, without the need to become regulated.”</blockquote><p>What’s next? Scaling and growing alongside Magic. From the latest features to proactive support for modern blockchains, Fairmint is thrilled to build on the partnership with Magic and stay laser-focused on helping the world move towards an ownership economy.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/fairmint-uses-magic-to-offer-the-smoothest-user-experience-in-web-3-0-a778a4f9a997">Fairmint uses Magic to offer the smoothest user experience in Web 3.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It was <a href="https://bean.la/">Bean</a>, the design and development agency steering the web platform, that strongly recommended Magic.</p><p>For the developers at Bean, implementing Magic was “plug and play.” During a weekly All Hands meeting, the agency demoed the magic link signup flow live — already built. From that immediate impression, Austin saw adopting passwordless auth as a no-brainer that naturally aligned with their company principles and business objectives.</p><blockquote>“The more we can get out of users’ way during signup, the better. That’s a big part of the design ethos for us. Magic fit really well into that. When users want to login, they enter the one piece of data you need, and then you’re done. It’s super&nbsp;cool.”</blockquote><p>As a dual-sided marketplace, Minisocial’s goal was to optimize for conversion across customers and creators. They were clearly focused on minimizing the number of unnecessary actions users have to take before gaining value and accessing the platform.</p><blockquote>“Every time we introduce any friction, we’re turning away money. On the brand side, that means turning away work. On the creator side, the risk is losing someone along the way because they’re frustrated with onboarding.</blockquote> Migration from months to&nbsp;minutes <p>Beyond an intuitive integration and seamless signup flow, going passwordless offered another key benefit: massive time&nbsp;savings.</p><p>When the team needed to migrate a year’s worth of existing user data to the new platform, Magic provided a means for Minisocial to offer best-in-class customer support. With the ability to set up secure, email-based accounts on the backend, there was no need to ask brands and creators to re-establish their credentials. As soon as the platform was generally available, customers could simply enter in their email and proceed as if they had created the profiles themselves.</p><p>Handling customer support in addition to executing the migration could have taken months. Fortunately, with Magic it was taken care of in just an afternoon.</p><blockquote>“Magic solves problems that I didn’t even know I had. It’s been game-changing in terms of letting our team focus on what’s going to move the needle for&nbsp;us.”</blockquote> An all-in-one solution <p>Thanks to Magic, Minisocial was able to streamline user onboarding, ship faster, and migrate effortlessly.</p><p>Overall, by implementing a single solution that abstracts away the complexity of passwordless authentication, Minisocial gained back meaningful time to invest in the company’s growth.</p><blockquote>“Magic saves us time the same way Stripe does for us. If I had unlimited funds and unlimited time, I’m sure we could make a credit card processing tool that is custom-built for Minisocial. Stripe does payment processing infinitely better than a homegrown solution because they’ve invested a tremendous amount of time, money, and talent. I view Magic the exact same way. This is a powerful plug and play tool that’s going to think years ahead. And it works right out of the&nbsp;box.”</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-minisocial-saved-valuable-time-resources-and-migration-headaches-16165ddf0187">How Minisocial saved valuable time, resources, and migration headaches</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are often used interchangeably because they uniquely identify entities in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>But in reality, they are vastly different and we’ll see how they stack against each other across different aspects.</p><p>First off, let’s take a brief look at what each&nbsp;is.</p> What are Non-Fungible Tokens&nbsp;(NFTs)? <p>Non-fungible tokens are a type of token that is unique and not interchangeable. For example, if you own a $100 currency note, you can exchange it for another $100 note, and there’s no difference at all in terms of its value or appearance. Such tokens/items are called fungible.</p><p>On the other hand, let’s say you have an original Van Gogh painting called “The Starry Night”. You can’t exchange it for another painting, even by Van Gogh, as there will be a difference in both value and appearance. In this sense, this token represents a unique object, and replacing the value of this token with anything else changes the value of the token itself. Such items are called non-fungible.</p><p>When you extend it to the blockchain, an NFT is a cryptographic token that’s stored on the blockchain network and cannot be replicated. This token is used to identify the authenticity of an object and prove that a particular entity owns it. In our above example, if John says he owns “The Starry Night”, the NFT is proof that this painting is indeed the original Starry Night by Van Gogh and it is owned by&nbsp;John.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p>Verifiable credentials, on the other hand, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically to prove an entity’s identity. You can learn more about VCs&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">here</a>.</p> Similarities between an NFT and a&nbsp;VC <p>VCs and NFTs have many things in common, and this is often why they are confused.</p> Leverages the Digital&nbsp;World <p>A common thread that connects both NFTs and VCs is that they leverage the potential benefits of the digital world to give users more security, flexibility, and freedom to monetize.</p><p>NFTs, in particular, give owners new revenue streams and ways to monetize. For example, a music band can create an exclusive single and sell it as an NFT, so the new owner has the rights to all royalties arising from&nbsp;it.</p><p>VCs also leverage the digital infrastructure to eliminate the frauds that arise in the physical world by converting all important credentials into an easy-to-share digital format. A startup company, for example, can take the responsibility of converting the physical identities into secure digital ones, and in turn, charge a fee to the owner of the credential for this&nbsp;service</p> Unique Identification <p>Both NFTs and VCs are used to uniquely identify something that belongs to an entity. NFTs are often implemented to represent a unique piece of art or a collectible that belongs to an entity. It proves that a particular item is authentic as claimed and belongs only to an entity. For example, an NFT can be used to prove that Lisa is the owner of a collectible Pokemon&nbsp;card.</p><p>VCs are also used to prove that a claim made by an entity is true. This claim can be credentials such as PII, university degree, and more. In this case, a gaming club can issue a VC to Lisa to claim that she is the head of their pokemon meetup&nbsp;club.</p><p>In fact, here is a list that compiles some of the possible <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">use cases</a> and the credentials that can be verified by&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>In this sense, both NFTs and VCs prove that something belongs to an entity and this could be anything from a PII to a piece of&nbsp;art.</p> Immutable <p>The implementation of both NFTs and VCs ensures that the records are immutable, and hence, this adds another layer of security to these tokens and credentials.</p><p>Thus, these are some of the similarities between NFTs and&nbsp;VCs</p> Differences Between an NFT and a&nbsp;VC <p>Moving on, let’s look at some of the differences.</p> Implementation <p>A key difference is that VCs use public key infrastructure and digital signatures to prove a claim. There are three entities in a VC — the issuer (the entity that issues a credential), the holder (the entity that owns the credential), and the verifier (the entity that verifies the credential).</p><p>For example, an issuer issues a driver’s license verifiable credential that belongs to a holder. Both the issuer and the holder digitally sign the VC using their respective public keys, and these signatures are verified by the verifier to authenticate that the driver’s license belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>NFTs, on the other hand, are based on blockchain and are time-stamped, and this makes it easy to verify the digital ownership of the token. Any change in ownership is known to all the parties in the&nbsp;network.</p> Transferability <p>Another difference is the ability to transfer the credential that it represents. To elaborate, VCs represent the credential of an entity that will always be owned by the holder. Though the holder can decide where and how it can be shared, the ownership of a VC never changes&nbsp;hands.</p><p>NFTs, on the other hand, are transferable. For example, let’s say an NFT that represents a rare album by Michael Jackson was owned by Sony and was sold to Ashley. So, the NFT has changed hands and Ashley is the new owner of&nbsp;it.</p> Blockchain Implementation <p>Furthermore, NFTs are implemented only on a blockchain whereas VCs can be implemented on blockchain or any other Distributed Ledger Transaction (DLT) network. There are even some implementations like IRMA that stay away from DLTs altogether.</p><p>In fact, one of the disadvantages of NFTs is that it is tied to a platform as this is where the link between an NFT and its owner is established. If that platform becomes non-existent in the future, information about the NFT’s creator could be lost&nbsp;forever.</p><p>But VCs have no such dependency since they are not platform-specific.</p> Scarcity/Availability <p>The value of an NFT depends on the scarcity or availability of the digital asset it represents coupled with its fair value, so the fewer the NFTs, the greater will be its&nbsp;value.</p><p>But in the case of a VC, the scarcity or availability does not determine its value because it represents the identity of an entity and this identity never&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The VCs’ financial value depends on how it is used in a marketplace and its financial mechanics would be very different from an NFT. Eg: a VC shared can be paid for by a verifier (small amount) and part of it can go back to the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Indivisibility <p>An NFT is indivisible because the digital asset it represents has no value when divided. Imagine, can you break a sculpture into two and sell it to two different people? Makes no sense, right? While more than one entity can own an NFT, the NFT itself cannot be&nbsp;divided.</p><p>In the case of VCs, they can be divided while sharing. For example, let’s say a VC contains the date of birth and the driver’s license number of an individual. The holder can choose to share just the driver’s license number with one verifier and the date of birth alone with another. In this sense, VCs are divisible.</p><p>Here’s a summary of the differences between NFTs and&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>And a bird’s eye view of these differences.</p>NFTs vs&nbsp;VCs<p>In all, NFTs verify the ownership of an object while VCs uniquely identify an entity. However, NFT’s ability to prove authorship and identity is limited to the network in which it is implemented and VCs could be used to extend its usability beyond the&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">Here is an example</a> of how VCs are implemented in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>Dear Metadians,</p><p>Times are changing. More and more people are turning to Bitcoin and other virtual assets as an alternative solution to the current financial system. Besides, the fact that the market’s interest is centered on the institutional sector is very suggestive: it means that the real value of blockchain technology itself is spreading rapidly into our lives, moving away from the “simple” investment point of view. This also keeps the door open for blockchain technology to be used in new ways as a new market creation opportunity.</p>Metadium’s mainnet key achievements<p>With faith in the technology and overcoming various challenges, Metadium has been making steady progress in the past years. Since the launch of the mainnet in 2019, Metadium has grown into one of the representative blockchain projects in South Korea. It has created one million wallets and manages 300,000–500,000 daily transactions, which positions it in the 14th place of the world’s mainnet ranking. (You can find the details&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-turns-2-d1f20d6001de">here</a>).</p><p>In this post, we would like to share Metadium’s short-term roadmap and mid-long term goals. Furthermore, we will share a letter from our CEO to the community, where he explains the direction of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Please note that the following is a roadmap that shows the big picture and, since reacting to a rapidly changing environment is essential, some details might&nbsp;change.</p> Letter from&nbsp;Justin <p>Dear community,</p><p>Metadium launched its service as a special purpose public chain with the intention of spreading DID. By ‘special purpose’ I mean that the services implemented on the chain must have sufficient competitiveness compared to the centralized method (you can find the details&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-is-here-a6ccae631b2e">here</a>).</p><p>DApps related to DeFi and NFT, which have been hot issues these days, have shown the ideal utilization of public chains. Meanwhile, the scalability issue and the resulting volatility in gas prices are the future tasks to deal with. Another problem that comes with the nature of open sources is the scam projects which are easily reproduced. Because of these concerns, the scope &amp; definition of governance and the mainnet management team’s responsibility must be considered once&nbsp;again.</p><p>In Vitalik’s recent blog “<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy</a>”, he expresses his concerns for the development of a healthy ecosystem and emphasizes, once again, that active support from the community is more important than anything else. This is a common mission, not only for Ethereum, but for all public&nbsp;chains.</p><p>I think of Metadium as an amusement park that is visited by a lot of people due to its fun rides: developers make fun and safe rides (dApps) and people (users) actively participate in them. Now, let me explain further how this amusement park called Metadium is being made and how it will further&nbsp;develop.</p>Metadium amusement park: admission ticket (DID) + fun rides&nbsp;(dApps) 1. Making tickets: Infrastructure for commercialization of&nbsp;DID <p>Metadium is a project focused on DID (Decentralized Identifier), looking to implement the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. With this vision, Metadium blockchain has been used to develop services like MYKEEPiN, B PASS and THEPOL. The fact that recently many mainnets have implemented the DID layer into their basic infrastructure can be seen as a recognition of the necessity of DID, the admission ticket for an amusement park. Admission tickets (DID) allows you to identify yourself to access multiple rides (services) while protecting your personal information.</p> 2. Making fun rides: activation of Metadium&nbsp;dApps   Enhancing THEPOL: NFT model in&nbsp;Q2  Metadium-based NFT platform: METApie  Metadium Defi ecosystem creation (Swap, Bridge, Stable&nbsp;Coin)  <p>Metadium has been creating dApps that the general public can use and enjoy. The development and tools used for these dApps will serve as a reference for developers to create even better apps in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Metadium blockchain was used to develop THEPOL: Coinplug’s poll and survey service. THEPOL has implemented an NFT-based badge structure and it’s now growing its own ecosystem.</p><p>Reinforcing our role in the NFT world, Metadium blockchain will be used to develop a new platform that will support NFT issuance and P2P transactions: METApie. This marketplace will be operated by Coinplug and will be linked to MYKEEPiN for identification and authentication.</p><p>DeFi has demonstrated the importance of smart contracts. That’s why we’ll release a Metadium DeFi ecosystem including swap, bridge and stable coins. What will differentiate us from other DeFi projects is our DID technology, which has proved along the years its stability and reliability.</p> 3. Park enhancement: upgrading Metadium&nbsp;Mainnet   Metadium Explorer  Application of Berlin and London hard&nbsp;fork  Selection of 21 BP nodes among MYKEEPiN Alliance member companies, global partners, and the community pool  User protection with “Metadium Certificate System”  <p>As a mainnet project, management and upgrades of the mainnet are an important part of the roadmap. Metadium, based on the SPoA consensus algorithm, similar to EIP-225 (PoA), is a blockchain that restricts decentralization and enhances scalability. Based on this, we set up a short-term plan for technology advancement such as security and optimization according to the actual operation rather than to a relatively scalable technology trend such as L2 or sharding.</p><p>(Among L2 technologies, ZKP-related contents are being considered for application to DID scalability).</p><p>Metadium Explorer is scheduled for the first half of 2021. We are planning to complete the selection of Block Producers for 21 nodes within this year. We will enhance the decentralization and transparency of the Metadium network with the combination of Coinplug-led MYKEEPiN Alliance member companies, Metadium Global Partners, and a pool that allows general individuals participation.</p><p>Through advancement of the governance function, we will actively apply the Metadium Certificate System and provide guidelines for user protection. The application of this system is considered to be the minimum requirement of the Mainnet foundation.</p><p>Last year, Metadium conducted a hard fork (Istanbul) to review the EIPs added in Ethereum and adding the corresponding functions, if necessary, to Metadium. Following this, we are planning to conduct the same procedure once the Berlin hard fork is completed and its stability is verified (end of May). The key of the Berlin Hard Fork is that its four EIPs can reduce the cost of certain types of network transactions. After this, if the London fork succeeds in July, and once its stability is verified, we are planning to apply it on the Metadium blockchain at the end of September.</p><p>Moving forward, Metadium will continue working hard to develop our technology and expand our DID ecosystem. In conclusion, and referring to the previous analogy of the amusement park, we will provide more, bigger and safer rides to be enjoyed by everyone.</p><p>Thank you for your&nbsp;support.</p><p>Justin Park</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-2021-roadmap-and-a-letter-from-justin-d854e336e2ee">Metadium 2021 Roadmap and a Letter from Justin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We completed 85% of the Ontology EVM-integrated design, which will be fully compatible with Ethereum contract ecology after completion.  We also completed 75% of the latest Layer 2 technology, which explores the integration of Ethereum Layer 2 on the Ontology&nbsp;MainNet.  <p>Product Development</p>  This month we released ONTO v3.8.2, adding and optimizing the features for Ethereum private transaction and high-speed transaction.  We officially integrated the webpage plug-in version of ONTO cross-chain wallet with Wing&nbsp;Finance.  ONTO is included as a default wallet option in the popular dApp HyperJump on the Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain.  ONTO held community activities with DeFi ecosystem partners OpenOcean, Multiplier, DeFiner, MDEX, and&nbsp;ApeSwap.  <p>dApps</p>  As of April 24th 2021, there were 115 dApps launched in total on&nbsp;MainNet.  There were a total of 6,559,346 dApp transactions completed on&nbsp;MainNet.  We recorded 85,133 dApp-related transactions in the past&nbsp;month.  <p>Community Growth &amp;&nbsp;Bounty</p>  It was another big month for community growth and we welcomed 3,868 new members across Ontology’s global ecosystem. As always, we welcome anyone who is interested in Ontology to join&nbsp;us!  Dumont, Ontology’s Telegram Admin, shared the ultimate staking guide and OWallet Backup &amp; Recovery with our Telegram group, helping Ontology’s global community members to further understand and participate in community staking.

Launching its new DeFi product “Any Pool”, this provides opportunities to a much wider audience and allows for the contractualization and lending of almost anything.  Over the past month, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, has been busy doing interviews. He was featured in <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/12/investing/bitcoin-prices-coinbase/index.html">CNN Business</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-goes-for-direct-testing-of-crypto-narratives-today-9912.htm">CryptoNews</a>, amongst others, sharing his thoughts on the prospect of cryptocurrency and some of Ontology’s recent updates on decentralized digital identity.  Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, took part in a panel discussion titled “The State of Decentralized Identity Solutions”. The panel, organized by The Block, featured spokespeople from Microsoft and Serto. Ning Hu spoke about the current status of decentralized identity framework and ecosystem development and solutions.  This month, Ontology published an updated version of its DID and Data <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1383962018730835970">ecosystem landscape</a>. The latest version covers ecosystem partners from industries including public chains, supply chain, entertainment, and automotive. We are welcoming suggestions from the community on relevant projects we should consider adding to our ecosystem.    In some global news this week, the Chinese and English version of the “<a href="https://www.cabin.vc/">Digital Securities Industry Development Report 2020</a>” was published. The report was co-authored by leaders in the space including Cabin VC, Binance China Blockchain Research Institute, Gibraltar Stock Exchange Group (GSX Group), Hong Kong Digital Asset Exchange (HKBitEX), and&nbsp;UPRETS.  Ontology’s Head of Business &amp; Strategy was invited to attend the “New Form of Encrypted Assets in Grayscale Mode” online&nbsp;seminar.

<p>Apache Struts probably means little to most people outside the software realm. CVE-2017-5638 even less so. But for credit company Equifax, these terms are likely reminiscent of what the people living in Troy must have felt when a giant wooden horse appeared at the gates of their city-state. Circa 2017, some apocryphal stories claim that staff at Equifax’s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia...</p>

<p>That might be a funny question to ask right now. If you’ve been reading the Dev Pulse for the last couple years, you probably already know what Holochain is.</p><p>But for those of you who are new to Holochain, or who want to share it with your friends, we’ve just publicly released a video, <a href="https://youtu.be/EUfyHNGvnDo">What Is Holochain?</a>. It’s based on a talk I gave at this year’s <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/">FOSDEM conference</a>, and it gives a quick overview of what Holochain is all about at a level that’ll help devs understand whether it’s a good fit for them.</p><p>We’re busy building a new holochain.org website and this video will be featured there. It is fairly technical, but we hope it will build understanding for some folks even if it doesn’t quite get there for everyone. All sorts of people are interested in Holochain — builders, crypto fans, change agents, and business people. And that’s great. But it’s challenging to speak to them all at once! That’s why we’re trying to create materials that focus on specific audiences.</p><p>We’re releasing this one first because, ultimately, Holochain is a developer’s toolkit, and developers are the foundation of <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/no-hype-holos-global-adoption-strategy-f845cf563bdf">our adoption strategy</a>. If developers get it, they’ll get excited about it. That means more hApps in the world, which means more hAppy users whose power over their online lives just got a bit stronger.</p><p>(Keen eyes will notice that this video has been around for a while. It was actually an unlisted video in my personal YouTube account, but people seemed to love it so much — even non-devs — that we decided it’s good enough to put on the website for now. Expect shorter, more accessible explainer videos in the coming months.)</p> What’s happening in developer land? <p>I know I haven’t shared a lot of updates on Holochain and Holo development lately. That’s partly been because of more important content, and partly because it’s mostly been a continuation of the same work I reported last time. Here’s what’s fresh:</p>  The new proxy server is finished, support has been integrated into Holochain, and we’ve moved it into QA testing on HoloPorts.  Gossip is getting some performance tuning to reduce load on the proxy server and make data propagate through the network more quickly.  The core dev team are changing various components:  Updated versions of low-level libraries (1.x releases of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">tokio</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/wasmer">wasmer</a>)  Replacing the LMDB database engine with SQLite  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/">DeepKey has been ported to Holochain RSM!</a> Its complex data integrity rules have prompted productive discussions about validation, particularly the developer usability of validation callbacks.  Holochain finally runs on the HoloPort Nano! We’ve been able to compile it for a while, but it crashed on hApp startup. The Holo team did some experiments with wasmer 1.x and a different WASM-to-bytecode compiler, and they’re now demoing Elemental Chat on a Nano test unit. Once Holochain has officially upgraded to wasmer 1.x we’ll have regular OS builds for the Nano, and we’ll begin testing it along with the two larger HoloPorts. (If the hardware is ready before the software, we’ll ship the hardware first and the auto-updater will take care of the software when it’s ready.)  If you’re using the admin API, there are <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/pull/66">breaking changes coming to the app installation calls</a>.  <p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@birdiemcfly?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Benoit Beaumatin</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rabbit-hole?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>While 2020 was mostly focused on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, another catastrophe accelerated at an unprecedented rate — the climate crisis. From biodiversity loss and plastic pollution to deforestation and food insecurity, the events of last year only exacerbated <a href="https://earth.org/the-biggest-environmental-problems-of-our-lifetime/">the ever growing environmental issues</a> that we face. It is easy to push issues to the side when you can’t see the immediate impacts, but the climate crisis is showing itself now more than ever, often in the form of devastating environmental events. Just this past February, the <a href="https://earth.org/climate-change-is-driving-a-deep-freeze-into-texas/">freezing temperatures in Texas</a> served as a sobering example of how climate change and global warming are currently impacting us and will continue to increase the <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/extreme-weather-and-climate-change/">intensity and frequency of extreme weather&nbsp;events</a>.</p><p>Individual behavioural change is an important way to reduce our impact on the planet, but <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90290795/focusing-on-how-individuals-can-stop-climate-change-is-very-convenient-for-corporations">those who will have the greatest impact are industry and large corporations</a>. A <a href="https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240">report</a> from CDP found that “100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988” and that just “25 corporations and state-owned entities were responsible for more than half of global industrial emissions in that same&nbsp;period.”</p><blockquote>“100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since&nbsp;1988”</blockquote><p>If we want to have any chance of fighting climate change, large corporations and industry leaders need to clean up their act and create a sustainable path forward. One way to do this is through better understanding their supply chain processes and ensuring their practices do not have negative impacts on the planet. Supply chain transparency and traceability will not only allow companies to better understand their processes and work to make them more sustainable, but it will also allow them to share what they are doing with their customers, without <a href="https://medium.com/disruptive-design/what-is-greenwashing-how-to-spot-it-and-stop-it-c44f3d130d5">greenwashing</a>.</p><p>At Peer Ledger, we support companies on their journey toward greater supply chain transparency. Our <a href="https://peerledger.com/supply-chain">MIMOSI Connect </a>platform is an invaluable tool to help companies map and monitor their supply chains to ensure they are working in line with their values and brand promises. We believe that with responsible action and greater supply chain traceability, companies will step up to the plate to create a brighter and more sustainable future for everyone.</p> References   Earth.org (September, 2020), The Biggest Environmental Problems Of 2020.

 Shiv Malik, CEO of Pool Foundation, on Data Unions and the value they bring to the Data&nbsp;Economy <p>In the twelfth episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/shivmalik?s=20">Shiv Malik</a>, CEO at Pool Foundation and former Head of Growth for Streamr where he evangelized about a new decentralized data economy. During this discussion, he tells us how Data Unions work, its real-life use cases, and legislative regulations supporting the Data Union model. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>Note: The episode was recorded on April 9, 2021 — when Shiv was working with&nbsp;Streamr.</p> What are Data Unions, and how do they&nbsp;work? <p>As individuals, we all produce information in the form of data, and only a few people are harvesting and profiting from it. There is no way for ordinary people who are producing the value to retain any of that value themselves. Hence, a Data Union is a way of pooling data between various parties and monetizing it as a collective.</p><p>However, you still need an organization in the middle because this model involves reaching out to data buyers. You need to pick up a phone and speak to people — and machines can’t do that yet. Lots of people have fleshed this out academically but no one’s really done it practically. When you try and do it in practice, there are some really big stumbling blocks.</p><p>A <a href="https://streamr.network/discover/data-unions">Data Union</a> framework provides a way to bundle a user’s real-time data together with others’ and distribute a share of the revenue when someone pays to access it. On its own, a person’s data does not hold much value, but when combined in a data union, it can aggregate into an attractive product for buyers to extract insights. This is <a href="https://medium.com/streamrblog/community-products-crowdselling-big-data-iot-blockchain-streamr-fbaa794c7bc9">crowdselling</a>, and has the potential to generate unique data sets by incentivizing individuals to trade previously unavailable data.</p> Data Unions as a revenue source to&nbsp;IoTs <p>Our smartphones are powerful devices that are collecting information through internal sensors. All you have to do is create an app that collects a specific data set — and then you can imagine there’s a monetary incentive for people to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Why do we only have one map application (Google) or maybe two — and they’re owned by the same company? The reason for this is because they have a monopoly on our location and we create that monopoly by sharing our data freely — or rather we don’t have a choice. “I would like other options — but viable ones. If you take the raw data sets away from them (devices), anyone can build applications on top of the raw datasets. That’s the world we want to live in,” says&nbsp;Shiv.</p> The problems with data sets and structures <p>Expanding on the inherent issues with the data collected from mobile devices via sensors, Shiv comments, “From the data buyers’ perspective, this is terrible data too. Why do you want to collect data under the table spying on your users that you’ve buried the consent on page 70 of a contract that no one’s read? You get data just as a byproduct now of our digital lives when actually you really wanted to be the product. That is the problem Data Unions solve — if you want to create good data products, get people to create the data who actually want to be part of this and are happy to do it. It creates better data products — more rich, stable, interesting, and sustainable.”</p><p>Another problem is that data brokers go bust all the time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica</a> is the most famous. Recently, there was Jumpshot, a subsidiary of the antivirus giant Avast, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjdkq7/avast-antivirus-sells-user-browsing-data-investigation">which went under last year</a>, Vice reports. The company had $30M USD in revenue, projected to reach $70M USD with 400 employees. Vice mentioned, “An antivirus program used by hundreds of millions of people around the world is selling highly sensitive web browsing data to many of the world’s biggest companies, a joint investigation by Motherboard and PCMag has found. Our report relies on leaked user data, contracts, and other company documents that show the sale of this data is both highly sensitive and is in many cases supposed to remain confidential between the company selling the data and the clients purchasing it.”</p> Which parts of the world are more receptive to Data&nbsp;Unions? <p>In theory, every government should be pro Data Unions because they provide two benefits. One, it’s clearly giving a monetary value to ordinary people and returning it to ordinary people — as opposed to companies that are usually outside of their own country. If you’re in any way a democratic or populist government — that sounds nice. Second, it also opens up innovation, and it’s actually good for business.</p><p>You can also see rights to data portability already starting to take off in Europe. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/risk/deloitte-uk-risk-gdpr-six-months-on.pdf">According to a report by Deloitte</a>:</p>  76% of respondents are aware of the right to data portability.  9% revealed to have already submitted portability requests.  23% haven’t heard of the&nbsp;right.  24% stated that they have no intention to use&nbsp;it.  <p>Interestingly, 81% of respondents from EU countries are aware of the right to data portability.</p>  The Netherlands and France lead the way in terms of awareness, both at&nbsp;83%.  <p>Only 68% of respondents in non‑EU countries were showing awareness of this particular right.</p>  Australia and Canada recorded the lowest awareness; 60% and 62% respectively. This could be attributed to it being the only new data right that consumers have, and therefore less practiced before&nbsp;now.  <p>“Where Europe leads, I think other countries will follow, especially with respect to GDPR. We are getting good noises from the US, and I believe the UK will try and catch up because of political reasons. India, too, has a natural resonance to this kind of model because of grassroots cooperativism. It’s built into the country’s economic history in the last 100 years and it’s also a democratic country. I don’t know where China will go with&nbsp;them.”</p> Can Data Unions be acquired? Can we choose to whom we sell our&nbsp;data? <p>At the moment, we don’t have a technological way of signaling the member preferences of a Data Union. But it’s not that difficult to build that in, according to Shiv. In an ideal situation, people could say at the beginning: these are the kinds of organizations I’m interested in selling to. You could also trust a data cooperative that you believe in to make these decisions for you. A recent EU scheme is based on this fiduciary model. It says if you are a data cooperative, you have to have a legal duty of care to your members. In November last year, the European Commission released the draft of the <a href="https://medium.com/streamrblog/upcoming-european-data-governance-act-to-challenge-big-techs-dominance-over-personal-data-8a3b52d0e83d">Data Governance Act</a> which sets out a licensing and regulatory framework for data unions — or data intermediaries as they call them — which will give this nascent sector a huge boost in terms of funding, trust, stability, and assurance and advertising a direction of travel to the world. They have also announced that €2bn in funding will be made available for those seeking out to build enabling software and Data Union projects.</p><p>We are not there yet, but at some point, you will say “I only want to sell data to charities and university researchers.” This will put you in a different bucket of data, and only those buckets will be able to be bought by certain types of&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>Shiv says that if one day Google decides to buy Data Unions, that is a problem. “Obviously, that haunts a lot of people but certainly haunted me. I would love to see that you can’t force Data Union operators who come along as entrepreneurs to be cooperatives. But I would like a federation of cooperatives. If that doesn’t work, then with the fiduciary aspect of that legal duty of care — it will probably make it really difficult for Google to purchase data&nbsp;sets.”</p><p>He adds, “The token model also helps because the whole point of tokens really is that you can disassociate equity and ownership of an underlying capital asset from utility and value. And if you can do that, you can turn revenues to people and then not have to sell out your equity to anyone that also helps with the cooperative stuff. But it is difficult. All of this stuff is stuff that we need to think about. And I know why that keeps me up at&nbsp;night.”</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast: <p>2:10–5:25: Shiv’s journey from investigative data journalism to Data Privacy and Data Unions evangelist</p><p>5:25–10:59: What are Data Unions and how do they work?

 Runtime Upgrades — An Experience Report <p>Runtime upgrades are an essential feature of Substrate; perhaps even the most important feature. But at the same time, they are a feature that is easy to avoid using if your project hasn’t launched the main network or a persistent test network yet, as it is tempting to simply reset the network and start with block #0 after each update or release. However, it is essential to gain experience with runtime upgrades. After all, it’s the only way to introduce features to a live and persistent Substrate-based blockchain!</p><p>At KILT, we published a new release a few weeks ago and at the same time we did the first runtime upgrade of our test network (Mashnet). In this article we want to share our experience and solutions to problems we encountered during our runtime&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>The first thing we noticed was that it’s easier to do multiple smaller runtime upgrades than one big one, as a) it is easier to debug if only small parts of code change, and, b) Substrate removes some storage migrations after a while. Therefore it’s sometimes easier to update multiple times with smaller version increments rather than jumping to the newest version with one upgrade. Each of those smaller updates had their own challenges, which we will address individually here.</p> 1. Introducing the Session&nbsp;Pallet <p>The first upgrade we did was adding the session pallet to our runtime. We started, like most projects do, from the Substrate node template. In the template the authorities for Aura and GRANDPA are hardcoded into the genesis block and cannot be changed. Also the session keys for Aura/GRANDPA are not associated with blockchain accounts, which e.g. can hold tokens. The session pallet makes it possible to associate an author with a block. Each author can set their session keys that should be used for the next sessions. This is the very foundation of Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) because it connects the validator node to a blockchain account, which is necessary to pay out rewards. It also manages who is in the validator set for a specific&nbsp;session.</p><p>Adding a pallet is straightforward. Simply add it to the construct_runtime macro. At least, that’s what we thought! But the session pallet requires a genesis configuration. Since we add the pallet later, this configuration will never get executed! The session pallet won’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>To fix this, we had to execute the genesis config during the runtime upgrade, which is, again, easier said than done. The storage of the session pallet is private and can only be accessed from within the session pallet. There is no way around this but to fork the session pallet. We decided for a quick and dirty copy &amp; paste solution. We simply copied the session pallet into our project and made the storage public. Afterwards we could just copy the genesis configuration code and execute it <a href="https://github.com/KILTprotocol/mashnet-node/blob/23f3a363962b111796f6bda2051f4f508ecccee7/runtime/src/lib.rs#L422-L526">during the runtime upgrade</a>. Later, we removed our local copy of the pallet and replaced it with the official version. We just needed to make sure that both versions use the same pallet&nbsp;index.</p><p>DISCLAIMER: Don’t look too closely at the code! We used the current authorities to collect the session keys, which is not recommended. In a main network the runtime upgrade would probably introduce new session keys. The main problem with our approach is that the account and session keys have the same seed, which is also not recommended.</p> 2. Updating Substrate <p>Our next struggle was with updating the Substrate dependencies. First we wanted to have a list of what exactly changed between the Substrate version we were using and the version that we wanted to update to. Since we were not on a released version like 2.0.0 but a specific commit, it wasn’t that easy to get a list of changes. Especially because we were mostly interested in how the storage changed. In the end, we found you only need to execute upgrade logic if the storage&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Ultimately, we found a <a href="https://github.com/apopiak/substrate-migrations">list of storage migrations</a> done in Substrate which helped us a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>After we updated the Substrate dependencies we noticed that this was actually the easiest migration, since Substrate executed the migration automatically. But be aware that migrations might get removed after a while. If you do a too big jump with your Substrate version you might not be as&nbsp;lucky.</p> 3. Removing&nbsp;Pallets <p>Sometimes you need to remove a pallet. This sounds like an easy task and it’s tempting to just remove the module from the construct_runtime! macro. But there are several traps to fall into! First of all the order and index of modules in construct_runtime! are important. If you remove a pallet, all the following pallets will have a different index. So it’s a good idea to give all your pallets a fixed index. The second trap you could walk in to is to forget to clean up the storage that the pallet used. Removing all the storage of a pallet can be done in multiple ways. We did it using <a href="https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v3.0.0/frame_support/storage/unhashed/fn.kill_prefix.html">kill_prefix</a>(two_x128(b”Module_prefix”).</p> Troubleshooting and Miscellaneous <p>You might stumble across multiple different problems while writing your runtime migrations. Here are two things we would have liked to remember before we tested our runtime migrations.</p> Polkadot JS&nbsp;Types <p>Remember that the custom types in the Polkadot apps are most likely outdated after you executed your runtime upgrades. Also make sure to not only adjust for your own updated types, but also for those changed by Substrate.</p> Update All of the&nbsp;Node <p>After our runtime upgrades went through we had problems submitting transactions to our node. At first we thought that we had made a mistake during the update, but after we started the node with the new executable those issues were fixed. The problem was that we not only needed to update the Runtime-WASM, but we also needed to update the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/architecture">rest of the&nbsp;client</a>.</p>

<p>BTCNewz: A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange on GPS Pay lets users convert Ardor and Ignis tokens without going through a centralized platform. The app also features a decentralized NFT market, which lets users buy and sell virtual land on the Triffic Map. The Triffic Map is an augmented reality game where players hold virtual titles to real world land. The map of the world has been divided into hexagons of 62,500 sqm, equivalent to a square with a 250m side. Players can lease or buy these plots of virtual land and receive revenue from Beacons located in that territory. Ownership of the territory is denoted by a special NFT issued on the Ardor-based GPS Token blockchain, a full child of the Ardor chain.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

      
	 
		 
			<p>In the previous article, we have defined<a href="https://tokeny.com/whats-the-purpose-of-a-digital-asset-marketplace/"> the purpose and the stakeholders in the ecosystem of a digital asset marketplace (DAM)</a>. Now, we will look at the three main services that DAM Operators can implement and offer to investors and issuers in the primary market.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 1. Digital Distribution and Placement 
<p>The main value proposition of the marketplace is to bring Investors to the Issuer. Through the use of a digital platform, the Issuer is able to facilitate this and can deliver these investment opportunities to its user base.</p>
<p>Once the Issuer’s offering is created, the project is displayed to the relevant users in the marketplace. The digital platform must help Investors to discover the offering, assess the opportunity, and invest if they are eligible and interested. The Issuer receives subscription requests and it’s their responsibility to approve or reject them. In order to make it manageable, the DAM must propose a complete administration panel where the Issuer can easily view potential Investors and approve or reject them based on their validity.</p>
<p>The marketplace Operator may also be able to provide some management services and act as an agent for the Issuers. They will therefore verify the applicants of the offering to review their appropriateness in connection with the financial product. The payment of these orders need to be verified as well: even if payments are automatically reconciled, a paying agent must review them and potentially change exchange rates, proceed adjustments, refunds and capital calls. Finally, the Operator can propose direct support to Investors if appointed by the Issuer to do so. The marketplace should therefore provide communication tools between the Issuers and its potential Investors.</p>

		 
	 
    Offering detail page on the digital asset marketplace     
	 
		 
			 2. Onboarding of Investors 
<p>Issuers must collect a set of information and documentation from their investors in order to comply with legal obligations. At any point of time, they are supposed to know who their investors are and ensure that only eligible Investors hold their securities. Numerous regulations about the identification of Investor KYC and AML must be applied.</p>
<p>In traditional finance, the onboarding of investors is very manual and several intermediaries need to share personal information of the Investors as none of them works on the same IT system. Collaboration is complicated, especially with sensitive information. Online platforms can digitize this onboarding process. We saw the power of digital onboarding with the rise of Neobanks: They were able to get thousands of new clients by verifying their identities and creating accounts directly from smartphones. The rise of efficient digital KYC services aided this onboarding method. Today, onboarding solutions exist and can help Issuers or digital platforms scale their user base rapidly and drastically reduce their costs.</p>
<p>In order to deal with private securities, a DAM must verify the identity of its users, and propose to its Issuers that they can rely on these verifications. The DAM can provide the online onboarding interface, with its branding, managing different workflows depending on the type of Investors (individuals, corporate), their status (accredited, qualified, retail, etc.), and their jurisdiction. In this onboarding process, Investors fill in their information and upload their supporting documents to the platform. After this, verifications are performed to generate a risk score allowing the Issuer to decide if an Investor is a suitable owner for its securities.</p>

		 
	 
     White-labeled digital onboarding interface for investors     
	 
		 
			 3. Issuance and Allocation of The Security Tokens 
<p>In order to fully access the private markets infrastructure, the securities must be represented on the blockchain network chosen by the Issuer and/or the marketplace. This representation is performed by the deployment of several smart contracts and the generation of tokens (digital keys issued on the blockchain thanks to the smart contracts).</p>
<p>As it could be complex for Issuers to issue digital securities, and because the purpose of a marketplace is to provide the IT and regulatory framework to its users, the marketplace must provide the needed tools and services to create the security tokens.</p>
<p>More precisely, the marketplace must use, or impose to its users, a reliable and proven security token protocol. The DAM proposes fully-managed services or self-services to Issuers in order to deploy the needed smart contracts and allocate security tokens to investors.</p>

		 
	 
    Security token issuance tools for issuers            
	 
		 
			 Issuers must receive the following: 

		 
	 
      Token smart contracts  <p>These are the smart contracts that represent the Issuer’s securities.</p>
           Permission functions to appoint Agents  <p>This allows the Issuer to assign a role to the agent so they can carry out administrative operations.</p>
           Token functions  <p>This enables the Issuer to control the supply, transferability of tokens and the other required specifications.</p>
           Batch functions  <p>Gas fees can add up if functions are processed on an Investor by Investor basis, batch functions reduce these fees.</p>
           Compliance smart contracts  <p>These smart contracts enable the Issuer to enforce the rules of the offering.</p>
           On-chain whitelist of investors  <p>Issuers can validate transfers and identities on-chain, creating an immutable register of token holders.</p>
           Complete allocation to the initial list of investors  <p>Enables Issuers to digitize an existing cap table, or to allocate tokens to new Investors.</p>
           Access to its cap table  <p>Digitally manage cap tables and benefit from automatic updates.</p>

Moons are the undeveloped wild outback of Urbit, with a story waiting to be told
that promises to be as enormous in scale as the cloud personal computing story
told by planets, and possibly even more so.</p>
<p>Throughout this piece, we use "Earth" and "Mars" in the Urbit sense. "Earth"
refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud">current computing
paradigm</a>. "Mars" refers to the
perfected computing paradigm that Urbit aspires to be, but also to the current
and future state of Urbit.</p>
<p>Today we will review the prehistory of moons on Earth, give a snapshot of how
moons are being utilized on Urbit in 2021, cover existing issues with consumer
IoT and how Urbit resolves them, and speculate what the lunar locus of the Urbit
ID address space may become in the future. To keep the futurist scope limited,
we primarily speculate on the usage of moons in (industrial) internet of things
settings, especially with respect to agriculture, and how they may manifest as
the workhorse collection unit of decentralized data markets.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, moons differ from all other
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ships</a> in that they are not independent identities
with total sovereignty over their data and keys. Instead, their cryptographic
keys are issued and controlled by their parent identity. The relationship
between the keys of a parent ship and its moons are analogous to the
relationship between primary keys and subkeys in a system like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>. The parent may revoke
or change its child moons' keys at any time. A typical relationship between a
planet and a moon may be like one of a human and their smartphone. If you lose
your phone, you don't want someone to pretend they are you, operating one of
your moons, on the network. The planet can revoke the keys, and the moon stored
on the phone becomes inert, no longer able to communicate with the network.
While planets and stars also depend on their sponsor to assist with peer
discovery and software updates, these relationships rely on mutual agreement,
since either party may choose to discontinue the relationship and establish a
new one elsewhere. Moons possess no such freedom.</p>
 Lunar prehistory 
<p></p>
<p>It may come as a surprise to you that you are already very familiar with moon
identities—they've just never been explained as such because the context in
which that terminology makes sense didn't exist before Urbit. Moons, in fact, are not
a new concept at all. Virtually your entire experience of the internet in the
modern era is the experience of someone who possesses some number of moons
subordinate to planets who mostly refuse to talk to one another. The feeling you
get of constantly moving between silos, juggling accounts, not controlling your
own data, etc., is a direct result of the fact that, on Earth, you only possess
moons. No planets.</p>
<p>We're speaking, of course, of the client-server relationship. From the Urbit
perspective, the Facebooks, Twitters, and Googles of the world are planets, and
accounts held with these services may be thought of as moons subordinate to
those planets. Your account with these megacorps is only yours for as long as
they please. If you happen to step on a digital landmine, such as a virus that
causes Google's servers to believe you are a bot, you are suddenly banned from
their service, often with no recourse. All your data, your connections, your
network—vanished. We are all Mark Zuckerberg's moons, and they're armed to the
teeth with surveillance equipment.</p>
<p>There are two classes of internet users: those with servers who hold all the
power, and clients who use those servers in the way prescribed by the owners.
Running a server is theoretically accessible to anyone, but practically
difficult: server maintenance is a technical endeavor that requires specialized
knowledge and substantial time investment. Other barriers exist beyond just the
technical: for instance, if you wish to set up your own email server, you will
probably be blocked by large providers because unknown email servers are almost
always spam. The root cause of this circumstance is that the email protocol
lacks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybil resistance</a>. Urbit has
Sybil resistance built in, eliminating certain kinds of incentives for
gatekeeping such as this.</p>
<p>We seek to level the playing field by giving everyone a server. We accomplish
this by making the process of running your own server (planet) as easy as
running your personal computer today. We aren't quite there yet, but we've made
leaps and bounds over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Of course, this analogy isn't perfect—Urbit moons are servers themselves, but as
they may only act in accordance with the wishes of its parent, they are
effectively as locked in degrees of freedom as a client is to a server. The
moon's keys may be revoked at any time by the parent. To distinguish these
prehistoric moons from Urbit moons, we will refer to them later as "primitive
moons".</p>
<p>Urbit contends that moons are not the appropriate digital exocortex for a
responsible adult. They are for devices, experiments, or your children. We hope
that the dominant server-client relationship, which is the primary weapon of the
surveillance-industrial complex, will meet its end in the near future.</p>
 Moons in the early Martian era 
<p></p>
<p>In 2021, moons are mostly unused on Urbit. There's a smattering of minor use
cases which we'll describe here, but they represent only a tiny fraction of
their ultimate potential.</p>
<p>Tlon recently launched a survey bot called <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/eliza/">Eliza</a>, which was
initially a comet. We frequently got questions on whether Eliza was actually
Tlon's bot, because it could just as easily be a malicious actor posing as Tlon.
We soon plan to relaunch Eliza as a moon of <code>~zod</code>, which is the most
recognizable official galaxy of Tlon. This is to establish that the bot is
indeed official; only someone with access to <code>~zod</code> is capable of creating a
moon of <code>~zod</code>, and so a moon of <code>~zod</code> automatically carries with it a
cryptographic guarantee that you are communicating with an official digital
representative of Tlon. On Earth something like this would need to be
accomplished with certificate chains but, on Mars, this sort of authentication
is baked into the very fabric of the network, rather than as an additional layer
on top. This is a very good representative case of how moons naturally inherit
the reputation of their parent, even in the absence of any formal reputation
systems on Urbit.</p>
<p>We see folks using moons as backup identities in case they can't or don't want
to access their primary planet for one reason or another. Again, since anyone
may verify the parent of a moon, the moon inherits the reputation of its parent.
These backups could be vanity identities—for instance, every <code>~sampel-palnet</code>
has underneath it a moon named <code>~master-sampel-palnet</code><a>1</a>.</p>
<p>Some use moons to host group(s). Hosting a group inevitably means that that ship
will process more network traffic, and a heavily trafficked group may impact a
ship's performance. Thus one may wish to offload group hosting duties to a moon
to maintain a more performant planet.</p>
<p>As we currently lack a real system for 3rd party software distribution (though
see this recent <a href="https://youtu.be/XwICC6Its1E">developer call</a> on a solution in
progress), one stopgap has been to download software by syncing a foreign
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/desk/">desk</a> to your ship. This is risky, as buggy software
may make break your ship and make it difficult to get running properly again.
For this reason, testing new software on the livenet is frequently performed on
moons, so as not to risk the parent ship if something were to go wrong.</p>
 Internet of Things 
<p></p>
<p>Now we start to look towards the future by examining the problems faced by IoT
in the present and speculating on how Urbit might solve them.</p>
<p>The Internet of Things is much maligned by technologists as a privacy, security,
and maintenance nightmare. These products usually depend on phoning home to
perform their service, which is inevitably a funnel by which personal data is
harvested, an attack surface for hackers to gain access to your home network,
and a single point of failure which may render the device useless, all in one!
One need look no further than the recent <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/">Ubiquiti
breach</a>
to see all of these failure modes happening on a massive scale, and this is par
for the course. This sort of dynamic is completely antithetical to the Urbit
philosophy, so any involvement of Urbit with IoT will reject many fundamental
assumptions on how IoT operates today.</p>
<p>However, it's important to understand why the current IoT model works like this
at all. We posit that it ultimately stems from the fact that today's IoT
products are primitive moons for which you do not operate the parent planet.
Almost every IoT device operates in the Software as a Service (SaaS) paradigm
because most people don't have personal servers that could do all the processing
work actually necessary for an IoT device to operate. This is not the only
reason for this—it's also just more profitable to collect consumer data.
However, it's the SaaS aspects which make the whole thing such a catastrophic
mess.</p>
<p>Imagine a different world: if the server that your device reports to is your
own, there is no loss of control over personal data. If the device only
communicates on the local network, it will prevent remote hackers and disruption
if you internet fails. And if the manufacturer goes out of business, the device
will still work-it is not dependent on the manufacturer's servers.</p>
<p>The wants and needs of the individual are at odds with the wants and needs of
the megacorp, and that mismatch manifests as the antifeatures that plague IoT.
By eliminating the SaaS aspect, Urbit solves many of the largest outstanding
issues with IoT in a single blow. Digital personal AI assistants have long been
an anticipated science fiction prediction and their full realization is on the
horizon. But in their current manifestation, many privacy- and
security-conscious people would never consider using them at all, since they are
inevitably presented as SaaS that requires intimate knowledge of your devices
and their stored data. Recommendation engines such as the one used by YouTube
offer helpful guidance towards content you'll find appealing, but they're also
designed to keep you hooked to the service. These kinds of programs can be
useful, but they're dystopian when they come saddled with anti-consumer
subroutines. Since your Urbit belongs to you, it can never act against your own
interests without your consent. In our lunar vision, your digital personal AI
assistant will live on one of your moons, rather than on megacorp's cloud.</p>
<p>For web-exposed devices, Urbit offers the same security guarantees that it
offers for your personal computer: everything is end-to-end encrypted by
default, and signed with keys that one can easily verify as belonging to the
node sending the message.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a> has outlined the case for a
system like Urbit ID for IoT use
<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/12/232883-self-authenticating-identifiers/fulltext">here</a>.
In brief, that the Urbit ID system allows one to match public keys with devices,
bestowing devices with self-authenticating identities. This allows one to trust
the communications received from the device to whatever degree the private key
is held secure. IP addresses, GPS coordinates, MAC addresses, etc., are not
sufficient to generate high levels of trust—they're all temporary, easily
spoofed, or both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might imagine applying this to the Internet of Things (IOT) in which the
IOT device self-generates a public- and private-key pair and registers the
public key. For example, with a hub or controller so the hub can confirm it
has reached the right IOT device. By the same token, configuration of the IOT
device into an ensemble could include incorporation of the public key of the
controller into a list of valid devices that can command or obtain data from
the now-configured IOT device. Both ends can verify they are talking to the
originally configured devices, assuming no device has lost its private key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the hub or controller referred to would be your planet.</p>
<p>Urbit has many other features that make it well-suited for IoT, above and beyond
eliminating the SaaS model and providing self-authenticating identities. Many of
these additional advantages derive from the fact that Urbit is a <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/overview/#solid-state-interpreter">solid state
interpreter</a> and that
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ames/">Ames</a> is a network of solid-state interpreters
equipped with cryptographic identity. We explore this in the next section.</p>
 Future lunar cosmotechnics 
<p></p>
<p>We now polish off the old crystal ball and imagine future uses of Martian lunar
technology. Particularly, how the tech may develop over time once it becomes
widely exposed to the evolution-inducing forces of industry and culture. This
section is pure speculation, and I only aim to offer a small glimpse of a
potential future, rather than an exhaustive one. This picture will necessarily
be biased by my personal proclivities and expertise, or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Any discussion on the future of moons is incomplete without mentioning the
possibility of <a href="https://urbit.org/faq/#more-planets">lunar emancipation</a> in
order to increase the number of planets. This fascinating topic sees regular
discussion in the Urbit Community group, but is outside the scope of this
article.</p>
<p>In order to respect the reader's time, I'm narrowing our scope to a particular
topic: the agriculture industry. I'm also assuming a future with specialized and
increasingly small hardware to run Urbit. Right now, a 4 GB Raspberry Pi is the
standard for "small Urbit". If someday there are CPUs specifically designed for
running <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/nock/">Nock</a>, one could imagine going much smaller.
Ultimately, I'm going to assume that there will someday be <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/iot/#ssi">solid-state
interpreter</a> microcontrollers - so the inclusion of Urbit on a device may
require nothing more than a couple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology">surface-mount
devices</a> on a larger
chip.</p>
<p>Urbit is intended first and foremost as a personal computer. When I unravel its
potential usage in industry, I adopt the forecast of a drastic increase in the
manufacturing capacity for individuals and small groups. Agriculture is a great
microcosm of this long-standing trend; less human input is needed to produce the
same amount of food, whether it be crops or livestock. The modern era is
distinguished by the fact that small numbers of people can manage enormous farms
which produce food for vast populations. Thus, computation on modern automated
farms may be thought of as existing at the intersection of both personal and
industrial scale, and show how computerized and mechanized workflows add to the
amazing productivity of modern farms and demonstrate that individual-sized
inputs are able to create industrial-sized outputs. I predict that the set of
trades for which this dynamic holds will only increase over time.</p>
<p>Agricultural automation has been a primary engine for the growth of
civilization, but it has been hampered by the downsides of IoT elaborated in the
previous section. One bellwether of this dynamic is the right to repair one's
own equipment. <a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2020/03/its-payback-time-right-to-repair-movement-targets-john-deere/">John
Deere</a>
has long been at the center of this controversy. Farmers have lost the ability
to repair their own equipment due to vendor locks and a dependency on remote
servers. Furthermore, any suite of sensor products designed to gather important
data such as genomics, hydrology, soil health, weather, etc., inevitably only
cooperate with other products by the same vendor. It's the same story all over
again—you are a client of a megacorp server. Or in Urbit terms, you have a bunch
of primitive moons belonging to different planets held by megacorps, and no
planet to call your own.</p>
<p>Again, Urbit resolves these issues in the same fashion as above. One might argue
that using Urbit is another form of vendor lock-in—but this is evaluating Urbit
at the incorrect level. Since Urbit is an open source operating system, its
functionality may be extended and modified arbitrarily by any party. Some
computational infrastructure is necessary— that fact can never be escaped. But
you can escape from closed source software that does not permit you to modify,
to open source software that allows you to tinker at will. Thus we do not
consider open source software to be a form of lock-in, or at least, it's a much
milder form of lock-in compared to something like Apple's walled garden.</p>
<p>So let us focus on the additional meritorious aspects of Urbit (or more
generally, solid state interpreter networks) that make it not merely a band-aid
to the broken IoT system but a permanent and sound replacement.</p>
 Solid state interpreter networks 
<p></p>
<p>Urbit is the world's first solid-state interpreter (SSI). This concept is
summarized in the <a href="https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf">white paper</a> as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine it as a chip. Plug this chip into power and network; packets go in and
out, sometimes changing its state. The chip never loses data and has no
concept of a reboot; every packet is an ACID transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly, an SSI is an interpreter which is also a database. In more depth, an
SSI combines three properties: uniform persistence, source independent packet
networking, and high-level determinism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do not wish to segue into a lengthy examination of what this really means—
that's what the white paper is for—but we will attempt to explain why these
properties are of great benefit in an industrial IoT context such as
agriculture. We'd also like to predict that Urbit will not be the only SSI.
Other sorts of SSI's specialized to various tasks may one day roam the planet,
and these may be better suited for particular IoT tasks than
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Arvo</a>. However, this article will be couched in terms
of SSIs communicating with an <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ames/">Ames</a>-like networking
protocol and Urbit ID-style cryptographic identity, rather than Urbit in
particular.</p>
<p>For a SSI, losing power is less of a catastrophic event than it is for ordinary
computers with volatile memory. Knowing that you can never lose any state is a
powerful guarantee on the integrity of your data. Loss of power will always mean
loss of any data potentially collected while power is down, regardless of the
device you use, but with a SSI you at least have assurance that you will never
lose data that was collected before it could be transferred from the cache to
the disk. Of course, this is actually the sort of guarantee that <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/overview/#acid-database">ACID
transactions</a> have—it is
just that this set of guarantees emerges naturally as a consequence when you
have a SSI. Put another way, every SSI is a database; having every device be a
database is a major boon in situations where enormous quantities of data are
being collected across a distributed network. The standard today is that data is
only collected at hubs, and any data that doesn't reach a hub is irretrievably
lost.</p>
<p>SSIs are also deterministic at a high level. While all computers are
deterministic at the CPU level, interruptions to power can result in an
undefined semantic state and result in the random erasure of half of its brain.
This determinism is what begets ease of maintainability of Urbit—problems
generally only need to be solved once by experts and the solution propagates to
the rest of the network via <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA updates</a>. We
addressed this maintenance issue previously—we only remark now that this
property is derived from being a SSI, rather than something particular only to
Arvo or Urbit. When one has hundreds or thousands of devices to manage, the
guarantees on ease of maintenance provided by determinism are extraordinarily
convenient.</p>
<p>Packet routing on SSI networks is source-independent, and in the context of an
Ames-like networking protocol, are always delivered exactly once and in a
precise order due to the fact that nodes on an Ames network are in a permanent
session. Source-independent means that the identity that originated a packet
does not need to be the one to deliver it—packets are facts, and the truth of
a fact does not depend on who you heard it from. This means that it is possible,
for instance, to send instructions to a moon before it even exists and be
guaranteed that that moon will receive them and perform the tasks given, even if
the device that originally sent the packets no longer exists. As long as
somebody has kept the packets on hand, they will eventually be delivered. So,
one could imagine transmitting directions to a crop harvesting robot into which
a moon will be installed before the robot has even been purchased, know that
once it is delivered it will automatically begin its task, and know that those
tasks will be completed in the correct order, without any accidental repeats.
Taken to the limit, one can imagine preplanning the automated tasks for an
entire farm before a single device is purchased, with powerful guarantees on the
integrity of those instructions no matter how much time elapses between sending
and receiving.</p>
 P2P data markets 
<p></p>
<p>As was mentioned above, today's IoT devices ferry all sorts of your personal
data to megacorp, where they package it and sell it to the highest bidder.
Though personal data in aggregate is quite valuable, the value of a single
individual's data is quite low. On the other hand, industrial scale data such as
that collected on digitized farms could be quite valuable. Here we briefly
examine how Urbit can be utilized to populate and facilitate a market for data.</p>
<p>All data collected by your moons may be digitally signed by that moon,
certifying the exact origin of that data. This is one advantage of having
cryptographic identity baked into the core of the operating system and
networking protocol. One could imagine collecting large amounts of such data and
packaging it for exchange with other local and regional farmers. This can, of
course, already be done in principle with current systems. But current systems
do not automatically come equipped with the sort of provenance, immutability,
and reputation that comes for free when you make use of SSI networks.
Manipulated or faked data becomes easier to spot, and you'll know who it came
from, so supplying such data puts one's reputation at stake.</p>
<p>One major issue facing conjoining data gathered from disparate sources is simply
how to do it. Data arriving in random order, from different software versions,
running different hardware, is all very difficult to bundle into a good
dataset - and indeed wrangling this sort of task forms a large part of the data
scientist profession. As devices in SSI networks utilizing an Ames-like protocol
are engaged in permanent sessions, leading to properties such as exactly-once
delivery and well-ordered message sequences, issues about the order in which
data arrives are dramatically simplified. I do not wish to get mathematical
here, but I personally have confidence that the emerging discipline of
<a href="http://math.mit.edu/%7Edspivak/informatics/">categorical informatics</a>, as well as
the relevance of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5505">low-dimensional topology to data
fusion</a>, resolves many of these issues. I
promise to explain this in more detail in the future. For now, it suffices to
say that SSI networks seem well-positioned to utilize these techniques.</p>
<p>Cryptographic techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">(composable) zero-knowledge
proofs</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">secure multi-party
computation</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature">ring signatures</a>, and even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a>
offer a variety of ways in which data may be shared in an IoT context with
mathematical guarantees on what sort of privacy is maintained. This is perhaps
less relevant in the context of agricultural IoT, where personal private data is
largely absent, but we mention them here to invite further speculation from the
reader about the possibilities of IoT and SSI networks.</p>
<p>We end our discussion with an adaptation of a scenario borrowed from my brief
time working on <a href="http://ceptr.org/">Ceptr</a> that begins to show how a lunar
IoT-connected world evokes properties of a hypothetical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain">"global nervous
system"</a>. This example is
purposefully mundane to illustrate how deficient our Earth systems are, and
while it is possible to accomplish in theory, it is impractical on a wide scale
due to the numerous problems with IoT. Imagine that you suffer headaches from
low atmospheric pressure. You'd like to know when a low-pressure front is an
hour away from you so that you can pre-emptively take aspirin to prevent the
headache. Your personal digital assistant, running on Urbit, can then
periodically query the moons of sensors in your region for weather data to
predict whether or not you will soon be passing through a low pressure front.
This could be a free service or paid for automatically with cryptocurrency
microtransactions. On Mars, this task will be trivial, and is merely a stone's
throw away from a vast and undiscovered universe of other possibilities unlocked
by SSI networks.</p>

<p>Of course, all moon names have four words, not three. What the fourth word
needs to be for only three words to display is a matter of Urbit lore that
is more fun to discover yourself than have it told to you, so we won't spoil
it here.</p>

<p>Faster and less complex integrations</p><p>Since Dock’s mainnet launch last year and the completion of the token migration last month, Dock is now full steam ahead in growing adoption of the network. As part of this business outreach, we have developed relationships with a number of organizations and have started working on trials and proof of concepts with some of these entities. These collaborative efforts demonstrate how they can integrate with Dock and provide an insight into whether their Dock-based solution can meet their objectives, prior to producing a full commercial product.</p><p>While our open-source SDK provides access to the widest range of Dock’s features, and is supported by <a href="https://docs.dock.io/build/sdk">documentation</a> and developer <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorials.html">tutorials</a>, it can be challenging to understand and implement without prior blockchain knowledge. While some of the teams we work with are comfortable developing with blockchain, others are quite unfamiliar with some of the technical concepts behind it, but still require access to its many benefits. In Dock’s case, partners are looking to access blockchain solutions for the creation of decentralized identities and the issuance and management of verifiable credentials.</p><p>Flattening the curve</p><p>These development teams can of course spend time learning new concepts, but learning curves can be a barrier to adoption whereas fast and less complex integrations are certainly preferred by organizations. For these reasons, Dock is going to be making some of the network’s features available via an API, which is in effect a HTTP wrapper of our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk">SDK</a>. The API will initially be available in JavaScript and developers will be able to generate their own API keys via our <a href="https://www.dock.io/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock_to_release_verifiable_credentials_api">website</a>. Furthermore, the API removes the requirement for Dock tokens to process network transactions, and payment for API usage will be made in fiat. The API will be made available in the next few weeks for trials and tiered price plans will be available at a later date once further refinements and improvements have been made. </p><p>If you’re interested in our API or working with our team on a trial, please don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.dock.io/contact?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=dock_to_release_verifiable_credentials_api">get in touch.</a></p>

In the 1960s, US President John F. Kennedy’s moonshot thinking&nbsp;guided&nbsp;NASA’s human spaceflight efforts and inspired&nbsp;a generation of Americans to exercise the freedom to choose their destiny rather than have it chosen for them.&nbsp;Now,&nbsp;the time has come for Europe to exercise the freedom to choose its destiny in terms of data.




 




This moonshot thinking requires a&nbsp;groundbreaking approach and a radically different way of dealing with data in the future – a way that establishes trust, allowing people and organisations to share data effortlessly whilst staying in control.




 




It is therefore important that policymakers and decision-makers include the right governance framework in the final version of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">Data Governance Act</a> (DGA), the pending regulation that will set the ground rules for how we can build a strong and equitable digital economy.




 





<blockquote>To secure our digital rights and build a more prosperous future, we need to put in place today, the architecture required for the digital Europe we want tomorrow.<p></p>Katryna Dow, Meeco</blockquote>





 




<a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>, in partnership with its members <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData </a><a href="https://mydata.org">Global</a>, <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a>, <a href="https://www.sitra.fi">SITRA</a>, <a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org">International Data Spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.innopay.com/en">INNOPAY</a> will be hosting a live webinar on 25 May 2021 (from 15:00-16:30 CET) to discuss:




 




– Why is the European Data Governance Act (DGA) important in terms of how data will be shared in the future?&nbsp;<br>– How can data sovereignty be anchored in the DGA?<br>– Why is it time for some&nbsp;moonshot thinking in relation to data?




 





 





 The moonshot 




Hosted by moderator Rikka Kampi of MyData Global, this webinar is an ideal chance to learn more about the role the DGA can play in the balance of power over data, the evolution of the digital economy, data sovereignty, data spaces and digital soft infrastructures. It is also your opportunity to engage in the discussion and participate in some moonshot thinking.




 




How can Europe&nbsp;take a groundbreaking approach and define a radically different way of dealing with data in the future – a way that establishes trust, allowing people and organisations to share data effortlessly whilst staying in control?

<p>Passwords are a constant headache in any organization, but especially in settings where IT departments and helpdesk teams are already overworked and understaffed.</p>
      
<p>You may require employees to do bothersome, periodic password resets. You might also mandate more difficult ways to log in. You plead with them not to reuse passwords from other websites. And still, employees fall victim to credential stuffing, password reuse, fraud and phishing attacks.</p>
      
<p>If you thought using multi-factor authentication (MFA) would solve your password problems, it probably didn’t. In fact, most support calls are still caused by access management issues.</p>
      
<p>So what are some of the helpdesk headaches caused by password-based MFA?</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Complex Password Chaos 
      
<p>Businesses have been mandating stronger access policies, such as the enforcement of 14-character complex passwords.</p>
      
<p>For the end-user, these are an inconvenience.</p>
      
<p>For the helpdesk, complex password policies can be a nightmare.</p>
      
<p>Employees write them down, reuse them, share them, and forget them – but guess who really feels the pain? Your helpdesk and support staff. When forced to update their password, almost half of employees reuse the same password with a slight change.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 <a href="https://www.hypr.com/hypr-password-study-findings/">2019 Password Usage Study</a> 
      
<p>The rollout of complex password policies has increased strain on IT departments while causing a mess for end users.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 Multiple Multi-Factor Apps = MFA Fatigue 
      
<p>Your employees have many ways to log in these days. Passwords, hardware tokens, smartphone apps, Windows Hello, SMS, Touch ID, Face ID… the list goes on. The authentication landscape has become much more complex and businesses are finding it difficult to maintain a consistent user experience.</p>
      
<p>In addition to juggling multiple passwords, employees are often forced to use different MFA apps.</p>
      
 Fragmented Identity Experiences &amp; MFA Fatigue 
      
<p>Users often complain about their login experience: the pitfalls of complex password management, a sense of reduced productivity from too many requirements, and what some call “MFA fatigue.” The inconvenience burdens users and creates operational headaches for the helpdesk and IT staff.</p>
      
<p>The need to administer multiple MFA flows requires additional training and resources. Even troubleshooting becomes more complicated. Is a user really locked out? Are they just not using the right app? </p>
      
<p>The lack of a unified approach to user login can lead to gaps in MFA adoption, fragmented user experiences, and ultimately a steady growth in helpdesk call volume.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 The Glaring Cost of Password Resets 
      
<p>Yes, the somewhat benign password reset flow is the #1 cause of support headaches. </p>
      
<p>Ask your helpdesk team what the most common request from employees is and you will hear the same answer time and again: password resets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/hypr-password-study-findings/">2019 Study on Password Usage</a> found that 57% of respondents required a password reset in their work life within the last 90 days. According to Gartner, between 20% to 50% of all helpdesk calls are for password resets.</p>
      
<p>Password resets may seem like an easy problem to solve, but the volume of requests makes them a surprisingly time-consuming—and expensive—task. Forrester Research states that the average helpdesk labor cost for a single password reset is about $70.</p>
      
<p>The process for resetting a password is by no means a quick fix. First, employees must contact the helpdesk, which then generates a support ticket. Next, they reset the password, notify the employee, and finally close the ticket.</p>
      
<p>The combination of forgotten complex passwords, MFA apps and account lockouts are a waste of admin resources – for both frustrated employees and the overwhelmed helpdesk staff who valiantly assist them.</p>
      
<p>So, what can be done to address this pain point and lighten the burden for everyone?</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 The ROI of Password-less MFA 
      
<p>If the biggest issue is forgotten passwords, why not eliminate them? No passwords means no more password resets. We’ve made it easy for you to uncover the glaring cost of password resets. Find out how in our Passwordless ROI Calculator. </p>

					  <a></a>Section 1: Pre-Launch – Intro by John Jordan, Executive Director of the Trust Over IP Foundation (April 16, 2020) <p>Darrell:&nbsp; They certainly can, and we’re starting to see that right now. John and I are both pushing forward to make sure of the interoperability; that my credit union app will work with a generic wallet, that also works with the health application. We’re helping to define these requirements. The Government of BC is a founding member of a new foundation called the Trust Over IP Foundation. We’re starting to set those standards, so that we don’t have to reinvent how to ask for credentials.</p><p>A digital wallet is really great if you can put everything in it, but if you can’t ask to see something in it, it doesn’t help me. It’s just a database. You need to have an electronic way of saying, “Could I please see that prepaid visa card?”</p><p>John, perhaps you could speak a little bit about the Trust Over IP Foundation, because that’s really what that’s all about so that we don’t all have to reinvent the wheel. We can show the patterns: here’s how you get a driver’s license, here’s how you show a corporate registration, and so on. Do you want to talk about Trust Over IP, John?</p> <a></a> Trust over IP <p>John: Sure. I also wanted to provide an example, so I’m going to share my screen here.</p><p>I want to give a coming real-world example. We’re working with the Law Society in British Columbia and the BC Court Service. The challenge there, is that, as a result of a Supreme Court ruling a year ago, bail review hearings must be held every 30 days, no matter what. They were taking too long, and it was violating the constitutional rights of folks who are being held without bail. It’s going to create extra demand on the court systems, and it requires the lawyer who is representing the defendant to have access to the audio recordings that the government holds in their systems, to do the research they need. So, they need to get access to that online if they currently don’t have it, and the government only wants to provide a lawyer with that information.</p><p>How do I prove I’m a lawyer, online? Even if I have strong digital identity systems and I know your name, it doesn’t mean you’re a lawyer. Who’s the authority on who’s a lawyer? It’s the Law Society. They have a mechanism called the Practicing Certificate in Law, which they issue to a lawyer in good standing. What if we could give the Law Society the ability to issue these things digitally? That’s what we’re working with them for.</p>  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:11:00  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:12:21        <p>Province of BC: John Jordan</p><p>They will add us this print driver to go to their member portal.</p><p>A member can log-in and request the credential, and hold it in a wallet. For me, I’m going to show right now that I have a verified person credential, but this could be my Law Society credential. In order to gain access to the new site, I simply go to the new site and say access site — I’m going to use a credential to get in.</p>  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:12:26  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:12:47        <p>Province of BC: John Jordan</p><p>I’m going to scan that code, which is requesting my lawyership-ness. Here it is, I present it, and I’m in. That’s the kind of experience we’re looking for, right?</p><p>There was no integration between the Law Society and the BC court service. That’s certainly a technical option, but what happens when the next service wants to provide access to lawyers? The Land Registry, the BC services registry, the registry in Alberta; getting access to a BC lawyer. Is every service that needs to prove a lawyer going to call up the BC Law Society and integrate with it? Not very practical. If we give the lawyers something that they can carry with them and provide evidence, and it is trusted at a technical and governance level, we’re in good shape. That’s a little preview into that.</p><p>Here’s another share. We’re not going to go into this in detail, but here’s the logo for the Trust Over IP Foundation. The job of the Trust Over IP Foundation is to facilitate the global adoption of this model.</p>  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:13:50  Video Clip Time Stamp: 00:14:15        <p>Province of BC: John Jordan</p><p>We need a way for businesses to understand what’s being offered, that there’s a clear and certain pattern that’s being followed, and a way to evaluate technical and governance solutions that are being offered to them. That’s what this stack is about.</p><p>In technology, we like to organize things so that we have the ability to evaluate things, such as the components of an overall system. That’s what this diagram is getting at. It’s a bit technical, not a nice graphic design version, but it provides the ability for somebody to evaluate the different aspects of an overall solution. What’s really important here that I’m very pleased about as we bring this to the market, is that it puts governance at an equal footing to technology. That is where we’ve fallen down with respect to the Internet. We’ve relinquished control of things, because we didn’t pay attention to the fact that whoever owns the account service, actually owns the relationship. That’s a governance failure not a technical fall down.</p><p>With each of these layers illustrated, there’s an opportunity to deploy a technical solution. There’s an opportunity to govern that solution, there’s an opportunity to define what interoperability means, and in the end, enable fast ecosystems of applications and services that can interoperate. That’s the vision. We have a number of organizations that are founding this, including the government of British Columbia, MasterCard, Kiva, Large Social Enterprise Service, IBM, Evernym (which is one of the startups in this space. In addition, we have Esatus, which is a German company specializing in information security and working closely with the government and banks there. We have dozens of other organizations that were actively engaged in discussions to launch this organization on the 5th of May. I should also say that it is a Linux foundation organization, which is really important to us. They provide world class governance for open community building.</p><p>Mathieu: That’s awesome. Thanks, John.&nbsp; If people want more information on this, how could they find out? or find you?</p> &nbsp;

					 <p>Today, Northern Block and 28 other founding member organizations launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2020/05/cross-industry-coalition-advances-digital-trust-standards/">Trust over IP Foundation</a>, a new project hosted by the Linux Foundation to enable the trustworthy exchange and verification of data between any two parties on the Internet.</p><p>The ToIP Foundation’s mission is to provide a robust, common standard that gives people and businesses the confidence that data is coming from a trusted source, allowing them to connect, interact, and innovate at a speed and scale not possible today.</p><p>The ToIP Foundation&nbsp;is being developed with global, pan-industry support from leading organizations with sector-specific expertise. Key contributors include Accenture, Cloudocracy, Continuum Loop, CULedger, esatus AG, IBM Security, IdRamp, Kiva.org, Lumedic, Mastercard, MITRE, and the Province of British Columbia. The Linux Foundation was chosen to host the Trust over IP Foundation due to its legacy of fostering open-source collaboration and innovation for some of the largest projects in the world.</p> What Challenge Does It Answer? <p>Businesses today are struggling to protect and manage digital assets and data, especially in an increasingly complex enterprise environment that includes the Internet of Things (IoT), Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and much more. This is compounding the already low consumer confidence in the use of personal data and is slowing innovation on opportunities like digital identity and the adoption of new services that can support our daily, hyper-connected lives.</p><p>Without a global standard for how to ensure digital trust between any two peers — just like the Internet’s TCP/IP standards ensures a network connection between any two peers — these trends are bound to continue. The ToIP Foundation will use the new W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (DID) standards to leverage interoperable digital wallets and credentials to address these challenges and enable consumers, businesses and governments to better manage risk, improve digital trust and protect all forms of identity online.</p> Which Privacy Acts Does the ToIP Stack Comply With? <p>The ToIP stack has incorporated Privacy by Design from the ground up. This means that it can be used to implement solutions compliant with all major global data protection regulations, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It can also be used to meet strict privacy and security protection regulations such as the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p> What Does the ToIP Stack Look Like? <p>The “Trust over IP Stack” combines technical interoperability with policy interoperability to create a complete digital trust architecture:</p><p>For an overview of verifiable credentials, an important part of the stack,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjbN9ulHXIU">see our explainer video on it</a>.</p><p>Trust over IP defines an Internet-scale solution for creating and maintaining trusted relationships between any two peers on the Internet: people, organizations and connected things.</p><p>The unique “dual stack” design — combining the ToIP Governance Stack for human trust and the ToIP Technology Stack for technical trust — is a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital trust because it combines both cryptographic trust at the machine layer and human trust at the business, legal, and social layers.</p><p>This enables the ToIP stack to address key problems experienced by every enterprise engaged in digital communications and commerce today: password fatigue, form fatigue, customer onboarding, KYC, secure messaging, data portability, business process automation, privacy management, supply chain provenance, GDPR compliance — almost everything a Chief Security Officer, Chief Privacy Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer are looking for.</p> Has COVID Accelerated the Need for a ToIP Stack? <p>COVID-19 has become a clarion call for the need for digital credentials for many different use cases: doctors’ and nurses’ passports, immunity certificates, essential worker credentials, deep cleaning credentials. For these digital credentials to be interoperable both at a technical level and a policy level is a crystal clear example of why we need the ToIP stack.</p><p>In response to multiple calls to action within the identity community, Northern Block joined the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID Credentials Initiative</a>&nbsp;(CCI), a global movement to deploy&nbsp;Verifiable Credential&nbsp;(VC) solutions aimed at mitigating the further spread of COVID, while enabling global societies to return to&nbsp;normal&nbsp;in a controlled, measurable, and most importantly,&nbsp;privacy-preserving way.</p><p>This crisis is a perfect example of why digital trust infrastructure is needed to establish confidence at both ends of the interaction. Each party needs to be confident that the party at the other end is who they say they are in order to trust the business they will transact. If people don’t trust it, they won’t use it. That’s the measure by which new technologies succeed or fail.</p>    <p>It was a straightforward decision for Northern Block to join the ToIP Foundation as a contributor.</p><blockquote><p>Northern Block is committed to empowering the mass adoption of digital verifiable credentials, which we believe won’t be possible without robust and common standards. The launch of the ToIP Foundation is the beginning of a new chapter for any organization who has been working diligently to enhance trust in life’s experiences. We look forward to supporting increasing participation in trusted ecosystems and burgeoning innovation in consumer experiences through digital trust,”&nbsp;said Mathieu Glaude, CEO at Northern Block.</p></blockquote>    <p>You can find more information at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trustoverip.org/">www.trustoverip.org</a>&nbsp;or by following the Trust over IP Foundation on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/trustoverip">@trustoverip</a>.</p><p>Section 2 Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblockca.medium.com/northern-block-founding-member-of-the-trust-over-ip-foundation-69c82e5c2984">https://northernblockca.medium.com/northern-block-founding-member-of-the-trust-over-ip-foundation-69c82e5c2984</a></p>

<p>Public beta brings Algorithms and Compute Jobs to Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p>Ocean is proud to release the integration of Compute-to-Data into <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.</p><p>This enables buying &amp; selling of private data, while preserving privacy.</p><p>Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It does so by providing a means to exchange data while preserving privacy by allowing the data to stay on-premise with data publishers, yet allows data consumers to run compute jobs on data — all through the Ocean Market interface.</p><p>Therefore:</p>  Data owners can monetize data while preserving privacy &amp;&nbsp;control;  Yet data buyers can create value from it with analytics jobs, AI modeling, and&nbsp;more.  <p>Data publishers approve algorithms to run on their data and then the Compute-to-Data environment orchestrates remote computation and execution on data while preserving the privacy of the data. The blockchain-based smart contracts ensure that every data publisher / AI practitioner can verify proper execution of their algorithm.</p><p>Users can benefit from this technology in a number of&nbsp;ways.</p>  Data owners can monetize their data while maintaining privacy and&nbsp;control.  Data consumers can access private data without liability of directly seeing private&nbsp;data.  AI practitioners &amp; data scientists can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models to improve research and business outcomes.  AI practitioners can also publish their own algorithms,allowing them to earn passive income every time their algorithm is downloaded or run as part of a Compute Job. They can even retain privacy of the algorithms themselves.  Businesses and entrepreneurs can quickly launch their own data marketplace for their vertical, and leverage Compute-to-Data to preserve their sellers’ privacy and support more compute &amp; AI&nbsp;flows.  <blockquote>This release makes Ocean Compute-to-Data available to be more widely used via Ocean Market, building on backend support and private enterprise frontend work that goes back almost a year. The learnings from these initial deployments all fed back into this release. We’re very excited to take another big step towards realizing our vision of data as a new asset&nbsp;class.</blockquote><blockquote>– Alex Coseru, VP of Engineering at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>This launch is a major milestone in our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2021-6875bc1f804f">2021 Product Roadmap</a>. It greatly enhances privacy protection and breadth of applicability in Ocean Market and other Ocean-powered marketplaces..</p><blockquote>We’re excited to give our first Compute-to-Data implementation in Ocean Market into the hands of our community. We invite you to try out, to explore, to stress-test, and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/issues/new/choose">to give us feedback</a>, because the beauty of open-source is that our code and work process is public for all to see and utilize. And with key Compute-to-Data user flows now directly integrated into Ocean Market, developers can use the code as a boilerplate for their own flows or integrations.</blockquote><blockquote>– Matthias Kretschmann, Designer &amp; Developer on Ocean&nbsp;Market</blockquote> Data Sets &amp; Algorithms <p>With Compute-to-Data, data sets are not allowed to leave the premises of the data holder, and with that we’re introducing a new asset type: algorithms.</p>Visual distinction between a public algorithm and a compute data&nbsp;set.<p>Algorithms are small (or complex) scripts that are allowed to run on data sets under certain conditions within an isolated and secure environment. They can be either public or private, and just like data sets, they can have a pool or a fixed price to determine their price whenever they are used. An algorithm set to public can be downloaded for its set price, while an algorithm set to private is only available as part of a compute job without any way to download&nbsp;it.</p><p>For each data set, publishers can select the specific algorithms they permit on their data set, or simply allow all published algorithms. The implementation in Ocean Market is private by default: upon publishing a compute data set, no algorithms are allowed to run on it. This is to prevent data escape by a rogue algorithm being written in a way to extract all data from a data set. This is why the most public option of allowing all published algorithms should be handled with care&nbsp;too.</p> Check it&nbsp;out <p>Everything is live in <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> right now, in all supported networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon/Matic, Rinkeby, and&nbsp;Ropsten.</p>A compute data set with allowed algorithm on Polygon/Matic: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:76E031A63e4dAB370Ae25b1A93A997e79e084f6f">market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:76E031A63e4dAB370Ae25b1A93A997e79e084f6f</a><p>We suggest checking out the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">Ocean Market connected to Polygon/Matic</a> where you can already find some compute data sets and algorithms, and you will enjoy fast and cheap transactions. Switch your wallet to Polygon/Matic, or use the chain preference:</p><p>We’ve also prepared a walkthrough of the key user flows in Ocean Market recorded during the first tech&nbsp;demo:</p> Publish a Compute Data&nbsp;Set <p>When publishing a data set, you’ll see a new option under Access Type. You can now choose Compute to make data sets available for Compute-to-Data (but not for download, for example).</p>Data Publisher Flow: Set Access Type for your data set to Compute or Download.<p>When inspecting a compute data set after publishing, you’ll see a new Edit Compute Settings&nbsp;button.</p>Data Publisher Flow: New asset action for compute settings.<p>This button brings you to a screen where you can choose which algorithms you want to allow on the data&nbsp;set.</p>Data Publisher Flow: Define algorithms allowed to run on your data&nbsp;set. Publish an Algorithm <p>To publish an algorithm, you simply host a script file and point to its URL, just as with data sets. Then you define the Docker environment you want your script to run&nbsp;under.</p><p>See <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-algorithms/">this tutorial with examples</a> for the specifics of how an algorithm needs to be authored.</p>Algorithm Publisher Flow.<p>After publishing, you set either a fixed or dynamic price, just like on data&nbsp;sets.</p> Start a Compute&nbsp;Job <p>Go to the data set you’d like to analyze. Under the Use tab, you can choose from a drop-down list of allowed algorithms which ones you’d like to run on the data set. Choose the algorithm, then click Buy Compute Job. This buys you (compute) access to both items: to the data set (for the duration that the data publisher has set) as well as the algorithm.</p>Starting a Compute&nbsp;Job. Compute Job Details and&nbsp;Results <p>Once you start the Compute Job, you’ll see in your history that it’s running. The final output results will be available there, along with further&nbsp;details.</p>Compute Job details are displayed under&nbsp;History.

Ardor is a product by Jelurida, the company that is also responsible for NXT, the first POS blockchain. NXT is so old that it was even mentioned in Ethereum’s first whitepaper as a project that conducted a very successful ICO and thus this is one of the reasons that Ethereum chose the ICO model in the first place.

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) continues to be a top priority for many organisations throughout the world. It is one of the most important&nbsp;solutions&nbsp;to help organisations reduce the risk from cyberattacks that target their privileged accounts&nbsp;and help move passwords into the background reducing cyber fatigue. A compromised privileged account enables an attacker to move around the network undetected, download malicious payloads, stage compromised servers and cause significant financial losses to their victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost all users are now privileged users. With 80% of breaches involving the compromise of IT and business user credentials you must create a plan to reduce the risks posed by “overprivileged access” users, applications, and services.&nbsp; When users are over-privileged it only takes attackers a few easy steps to become a full domain administrator.&nbsp; We must make it more difficult that force attackers to take more risks increasing the chance of detecting them early before serious damage is done.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>One question for all organizations is how to get started. Where is the best place to begin for managing and protecting privileged access? It’s vital that you have have a solid strategy. Whether you’re starting a new PAM project or strengthening an existing Privileged Access Solution, Joseph Carson, Thycotic’s Chief Security Scientist and Advisory CISO will guide you step-by-step through planning your journey to privileged access security&nbsp;and introduce you to the PAM checklist that will help guide you to both maturity and success.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/2021-04-28-carson-privileged-access-security-maturity-success"></a>

<p>Blockchain technologies flourished at the beginning of 2021 with the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/cryptocurrency-market-cap-tops-2-trillion-for-the-first-time.html">price of Bitcoin</a> reaching new heights and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/artists-jump-into-nfts-seeing-a-digital-bonanza-11617634274">NFTs bursting into the world spotlight</a>. And, while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-high-gas-fee-crisis-won-t-be-solved-by-eip-1559-coin-metrics-report">Ethereum gas fees</a> continued to constrict the flow of business, new blockchains gained momentum. Civic made bold moves in Q1 by responding to these new market conditions through integration with the Solana blockchain and further developing our identity verification business offering.</p>



<p>Key milestones</p>



<p>In March, we <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210311005236/en/Civic-Announces-Integration-With-Solana-Blockchain">announced our integration</a> with the Solana blockchain, which has been unlocking new opportunities for Civic. We’re proud that Civic — <a href="https://www.identity.com/embedding-identity-into-the-blockchain-with-solana/">and our nonprofit partner, Identity.com</a> — are paving a better, more sustainable path by leveraging Solana’s blazing speed and low fees that scale as the ecosystem grows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move was prompted by soaring Ethereum transaction fees, which have blocked the mainstream adoption of DeFi and squeezed companies that depend on a functional blockchain ecosystem since last summer. With a second layer solution requiring months of development, chain-agnostic Civic has shifted resources to providing an identity gateway for the next generation of blockchain-powered products.</p>



<p>Now, with identity as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure, a safer, more sustainable financial ecosystem may develop. And, with our unique expertise in identity-based key management and recovery, Civic will help make financial tools more accessible to mainstream consumers.</p>



<p>We believe that identity will be a necessity for businesses in Solana’s ecosystem in order to comply with global regulations in the near future if DeFi is to truly scale for mainstream consumer adoption. Our new products will offer more privacy and a more secure experience for DeFi products and other application layer technologies.</p>



<p>Buzz about Civic</p>



<p>Our Solana integration announcement took center stage in the first quarter. Identity Review shared a <a href="https://identityreview.com/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain-for-defi-wallet/">thorough write-up</a>, noting that “Through this new collaboration between Solana and Civic, the fintech industry will take a step toward making financial tools more secure and more accessible to mainstream consumers.”</p>



<p>We also gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf4NbhxhfkU">company update</a> outlining the announcement and how we are interpreting the future with emerging technology. In the update, which was open to the Civic community, we had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/ama-vinny-lingham-solana-ceo-anatoly-yakovenko/">talk about the integration</a> with Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko. Most importantly, we talked about why now is the right time to devote resources to integrate with Solana: because markets don’t wait for engineering timelines. This is in reference to the time it will take to build Layer 2 on the Ethereum blockchain. Businesses within the ecosystem need to keep moving their momentum forward.</p>



<p>Earlier, before BTC spiked and NFTs took center stage, we took a broad view of the new year in conversation with Cointelegraph, weighing in on topics such as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-bitcoin-prove-itself-to-be-a-reliable-store-of-value-in-2020-experts-answer">store of value</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-cbdcs-affect-the-crypto-space-in-2020-and-what-s-next-in-2021-experts-answer">central bank digital currencies</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-lies-ahead-for-crypto-and-blockchain-in-2021-experts-answer">what to watch</a>. We also shared commentary in podcasts for <a href="https://goldsilverbitcoin.com/29-vinny-lingham/">Gold Silver Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.blockhashpodcast.com/podcast/vinny-lingham-ceo-of-civic">Blockhash</a>.</p>



<p>On the horizon</p>



<p>With new market conditions, the opportunities for identity verification abound. You can expect to hear more news about our Solana integration in the coming months, starting with a consumer-friendly gateway to DeFi on Solana via a wallet experience that enhances the vision started with their mobile app on Ethereum. With the emergence of NFTs, Civic has been actively exploring opportunities to harmonize and secure user experiences.</p>



<p>2021 has already proven to be a disruptive year. We are looking forward to continuing to build on the new opportunities that our directional change has already brought to our doorstep.</p>

  2020 pushed the notion of trust to the forefront of all our lives. It made customer trust in brands acutely important to the bottom line amidst a severe economic recession. It also forced many organisations to overcome long-standing reservations about trusting their employees to work from home and placing their faith in digital channels to serve customers.

<p>We’re&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/03/01/five-reforms-the-ftc-can-undertake-now-to-strengthen-the-agency/">recent article</a>&nbsp;published on the Brookings Institution site by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-rich-51b313a7/">Jessica Rich</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinguished Fellow,Institute for Technology Law and Policy, Georgetown University Law Center. Rich&nbsp;spent 26 years with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/">Federal&nbsp;Trade&nbsp;Commission</a>&nbsp;(FTC)&nbsp;up until 2017&nbsp;and has&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/03/01/five-reforms-the-ftc-can-undertake-now-to-strengthen-the-agency/">five reforms the FTC can undertake now to strengthen the agency</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is particularly interesting to us because the FTC is the agency charged with protecting consumer privacy in the US. But, Rich says&nbsp;the 108-year old institution faces significant challenges across the board, which&nbsp;include the agency “badly&nbsp;need[ing]&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2021/01/14/after-20-years-of-debate-its-time-for-congress-to-finally-pass-a-baseline-privacy-law/">stronger federal law</a> to protect the privacy of the American public.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>We, like many, believe a US national privacy law is&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">now more likely than ever</a> before, but we’re not there yet.&nbsp;So while the FTC, and the rest of us, wait for&nbsp;that, here&nbsp;are three things&nbsp;Rich believes the FTC could do right now&nbsp;in relation to&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;data protection&nbsp;and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 Establish a new bureau of data protection&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Rich cites&nbsp;the worsening&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global data privacy crisis</a>&nbsp;with its flourishing&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">data economy</a>, frequent significant&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;and widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">data abuse</a>, and&nbsp;growing&nbsp;issues of anti-trust&nbsp;as reasons for&nbsp;the FTC to create a&nbsp;new bureau&nbsp;of data protection.&nbsp;She envisions&nbsp;the new bureau&nbsp;staffed with people from both the existing FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection (BCP) and Bureau of Competition (BC), and unified in&nbsp;a&nbsp;focus on data protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich says, “The new bureau would be responsible for privacy and security enforcement and related policy initiatives. It also would handle issues at the intersection of competition and privacy, such as mergers involving large amounts of consumer data, or practices like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/google-chrome-to-end-support-for-third-party-cookies-within-two-years.html">blocking “third party” cookies</a> that appear to place privacy and competition in conflict. Significantly, the new bureau would not just protect “privacy,” but would also address broader data protection concerns, including anticompetitive data practices and the use of data for fraud, racial profiling, and discrimination. While increased legal authority and resources (including more technologists) will be needed to fully realize the potential of the new bureau, there are good reasons to create this bureau now.”&nbsp;</p>



 Issue a commission policy statement on consumer harm&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Rich would like to see clarity around what&nbsp;constitutes consumer harm for purposes of FTC law enforcement and policy.&nbsp;She points to the FTC’s “most definitive discussion of the issue”, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1980/12/ftc-policy-statement-unfairness">Unfairness Policy Statement</a>, written in 1980, and argues it no longer serves the modern Internet and the data-driven digital age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The FTC’s unfairness statement has proved to be surprisingly durable, but its discussion of consumer harm is woefully outdated. Notably, it focuses mostly on economic harm and doesn’t discuss the many other forms of injury enabled by modern technology, particularly in the area of privacy and data security&nbsp;…&nbsp;A new policy statement on consumer harm would update old thinking, educate the public, and lay the foundation for stronger FTC enforcement and policy efforts,” Rich says.&nbsp;</p>



 Convene a public workshop on privacy “third rails”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We agree with Rich when she says, “Without a strong federal privacy law, the FTC will continue to be hampered in its efforts to protect the privacy of American consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;the FTC’s repeated assertions that “the laws it now enforces contain many gaps in protection and does not allow the FTC to seek civil penalties for violations in most instances.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich says Congress has debated whether to pass&nbsp;a&nbsp;national privacy law for two decades “but keeps getting stuck on the same issues—in particular, whether the federal law should preempt state privacy laws and whether to authorize private rights of action. Many stakeholders view these issues in “yes” or “no”&nbsp;terms, and&nbsp;have not sufficiently explored potential middle grounds.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich points to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/bridging-the-gaps-a-path-forward-to-federal-privacy-legislation/">earlier article</a>&nbsp;on the Brookings Institution site which&nbsp;discusses a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bridging-the-gaps_a-path-forward-to-federal-privacy-legislation.pdf">June 2020 report</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;exploresthese “middle grounds” — to “unfreeze the privacy debate” between Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich proposes the FTC host a public workshop to find potential solutions to issues of&nbsp;preemption and private rights of action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minor rambling about Credentialing a professional and why that business problem isn’t as simple and exciting as you think.</p>
<p>I am a Professional Engineer, which in Canada, is a regulated profession. That means I am formally credentialed. The tech that I am issues comprises of a rubber stamp and an ink pad. Yup – very high tech…</p>
<p>Is it sufficient? Likely.</p>
<p>The stamp and ink aren’t the important part – the act of stamping something and then signing it is the important part. That’s what legally binds me to my work (disclosure: I don’t do work that legally requires my P.Eng. stamp as software isn’t regulated, yet.) Can it be faked? Easily on a technical basis, but much harder in reality – what work have you created that is being faked and how do you pose as me on a project for long enough that your client believes you’re me?</p>
<p>How often have I used my stamp. Literally never for work. I used it to capture the photo for this article though.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, some credentials become much more valuable because they are used all of the time.</p>
<p>Consider a doctor prescribing medication.</p>
<p>How often does that happen?</p>
<p>How much incentive is there to fake a prescription? Quite a bit though doctor-shopping may be an easier path where the doctors are well known (smaller cities and towns).</p>
<p>What are the consequences of such fakes? There are quite severe ones and controls are put in place to attempt to manage (e.g. opioid prescribing) when the problem gets big enough.</p>
<p>So here’s something to think about as you work to credential the world – is that credential you’re talking about used a lot? Is it critical to solve a problem? Are there existing ways to get the job done that aren’t broken (enough).</p>

<p>Yesterday, in a notice provided to Civic by the the United States District Court – Southern District of New York, the class action lawsuit brought against Civc, which began in April of 2020, was dismissed.</p>



<p>The dismissal of this case signals the end of a lengthy and hard fought process for Civic. During the past year plus the company remained confident that we would prevail, not just on behalf of Civic, but in support of the crypto ecosystem overall. Nonetheless, sometimes being on the right side of an argument is not enough (and we were right), so it is with a certain sense of vindication that we tick this one in the win column for Civic and for crypto.</p>



<p>We would like to offer our heartfelt and sincere thanks to our loyal Civic community, our counsel, and to the crypto community at large for your support. The innovative interconnected web of projects that call crypto home are an incredible group, and we count ourselves lucky to be among them. Onward and upward! Our work has just begun!</p>
