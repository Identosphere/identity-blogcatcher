 &nbsp; SEC Shares Views on DeFi Risks, Regulation and Opportunities  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-defi-20211109"> offered views on the status of decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) regulation in an article published in The International Journal of Blockchain Law. While DeFi has the potential to optimise transaction speed, cost, and customization, the Commissioner argues that it mimics traditional financial services offerings and products. As such, DeFi is analogous to offerings and services already under the SEC’s jurisdiction. Therefore Crenshaw expects the ecosystem to face comparable challenges to traditional financial markets. According to Crenshaw:</p> 
  
  “Unless required, there will be projects that do not invest in compliance or adequate internal controls;  
  when the potential financial rewards are great enough, some individuals will victimize others, and the likelihood of this occurring tends to increase as the likelihood of getting caught and severity of potential sanctions decrease; and  
  absent mandatory disclosure requirements, information asymmetries will likely advantage rich investors and insiders at the expense of the smallest investors and those with the least access to information.”  
  
<p>The Commissioner remarks that DeFI projects lack standards on risk disclosure and provide too little information for investors to appropriately assess risk, and she cites this as a cause for reduced investor confidence and investor participation. In the long run, the Commissioner argues that regulatory frameworks facilitate flourishing markets. Those responsible for regulating these markets are the same authorities encountered in traditional finance including the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury and the SEC. At the time of the Commissioner's statement, however, no DeFi participants have registered with the SEC. The Commission aims to increase engagement with market participants and reminds that development teams can liaise with the<a href="https://www.sec.gov/finhub"> Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology</a> to clarify their regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Commissioner Crenshaw offered a stern warning: non-compliant projects face enforcement actions. For example, in 2021,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/33-10961.pd"> DeFi Money Market received a cease-and-desist order</a> as it offered and sold more than $30 million of securities in an unregistered offering while misleading investors on the project. Nonetheless, the SEC encourages innovators to reach out to discuss regulatory changes that can allow for DeFi innovations. As it stands, the Commissioner identified two problems that need to be addressed by the DeFi ecosystem to ensure markets are fair for all investors:</p> 
  
  Lack of transparency regarding the operational arrangements of DeFi projects: projects are often launched by professional investors which may influence the governance of the project. The statement claims that these are rarely disclosed in plain English and put retail investors at a disadvantage. More to the point, the Commissioner declared: “It is not reasonable to build a financial system that demands investors also be sophisticated interpreters of complex code.”  
  Like other blockchain-based projects, DeFi transactions are pseudonymous: although transactions are public and immutable, not knowing who is behind an address or transaction raises concerns of market manipulation. Indeed, trading volumes can be inflated by one entity transacting with itself. This hinders the ability of investors to obtain reliable information before making a decision. The Commission highlights that in traditional financial markets investors have agreed to give up some degree of privacy to benefit from regulated markets with less manipulation and fraud. The SEC expects that DeFI projects which overcome the pseudonymity hurdle are more likely to succeed.  
  
<p>The statement concludes that some DeFi projects already fit in the SEC’s jurisdiction. When this is the case, developers should comply with existing regulations. Furthermore, the SEC expects collaboration from the ecosystem to find solutions that are suited to this new technology.&nbsp; Beyond “profitability, speed of development and innovation”, the Commissioner presses developers to contribute to a financial system in which “investors have access to actionable, material data, and it should be a system that reduces the potential for manipulative conduct.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As regulators begin to scrutinize the DeFi space more closely, DeFi developers and participants will need to prepare to comply with regulatory requirements.<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/schedule-demo"> Schedule a demo</a> to find out how Elliptic can help your business comply with existing anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regulations and manage DeFi-related risks.</p>

 &nbsp; FinCEN Adds Sanctioned Entities  
<p>On November 8th 2021, the US Department of the Treasury<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0471"> announced new sanctions</a> against a cryptoasset business that was used to launder the proceeds of ransomware attacks. The Treasury estimated that ransomware payments reached $590 million during the first half of 2021. It underscored that non-compliant exchanges were increasingly targeted by cybercriminals to launder the proceeds of their crimes. To counter this threat, the Treasury sanctioned<a href="https://chatex.com/"> Chatex</a>, a Latvian cryptoasset exchange used to launder ransomware proceeds, as well as three of its partners. A further two Ukrainian individuals were added to the list as they took part in ransomware attacks which generated more than $200 million in cryptoassets. The Treasury reiterated that “financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with the sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions or be subject to an enforcement action.” Read our coverage of last week's sanctions <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/crypto-addresses-holding-nfts-worth-532k-are-among-latest-sanctioned-by-ofac">here</a> and learn more about how Elliptic can screen your cryptoasset transactions in real-time to<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/crypto-transaction-monitoring"> limit your exposure to sanctioned entities</a>.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; Sweden Considers Restricting Proof of Work Mining Citing Environmental Concerns  
<p>The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA) and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA)<a href="https://www.fi.se/en/published/presentations/2021/crypto-assets-are-a-threat-to-the-climate-transition--energy-intensive-mining-should-be-banned/"> have concluded</a> that cryptoassets based on proof of work (POW) protocols such as Bitcoin threaten Sweden’s ability to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change. Because of the rise in the price of cryptoassets in recent weeks, blockchain encryption puzzles have become increasingly complex requiring more computing power. As a consequence, electricity demand has surged. The SFSA and SEPA mention that cryptoasset miners are increasingly relocating to the Nordic region thanks to the availability of renewable energy. However, authorities claim that this clean energy is being diverted from “essential services.” They suggest that legislators (including the European Commission) consider a tax on energy-intensive production of Bitcoin, a ban on POW mining and disclosure requirements for businesses who trade or invest in cryptoassets using this protocol. Nonetheless, the SFSA and SEPA recognise that there is a risk of encouraging relocation of businesses to less restrictive jurisdictions.</p> 
<p>As with recent regulatory announcements on the<a href="https://www.ftadviser.com/investments/2021/10/22/hmrc-to-send-nudge-letters-to-crypto-asset-investors/#:~:text=HMRC%20is%20preparing%20to%20send,from%20their%20crypto%20asset%20holdings"> tax treatment</a> and<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2021/october/jon-cunliffe-swifts-sibos-2021"> macroprudential regulation</a> of cryptoassets, this development shows that authorities are closing in on all facets of the ecosystem.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; Singapore Clarifies Approach to Cryptoassets, DeFi and Central Bank Digital Currencies  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Ravi Menon, the Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) made a<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/the-future-of-money-finance-and-the-internet"> statement on cryptoassets,DeFi and Central Bank Digital Currencies</a> at the Singapore Fintech Festival. In his speech, he stated that MAS did not view cryptoassets as money and reminded the industry that cryptoasset businesses are subject to licensing and supervision requirements due to ML/FT risks. Nonetheless, Menon recognized the potential benefit that blockchain technology could bring to an economy and he highlighted a particular interest for cryptoassets which are backed by reserves.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>His statement also addressed Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), stating that MAS sees benefits in issuing a wholesale digital currency targeted at banks to improve reserve management and transform cross-border payments. Turning to a retail CBDC (a digital Singapore Dollar available to all), he said that MAS does not see the development of a CBDC as urgent. He argued that cash would still be relevant in the foreseeable future, Singapore’s payment system is sufficiently efficient and inclusive, and substitution from the Singapore Dollar to foreign CBDCs is not presently seen as a threat. Nonetheless, Menon announced the launch of Project Orchid to work on the technical requirements needed to issue a CBDC if MAS decides to launch a retail CBDC. He also reminded participants at the meeting of a number of MAS’s initiatives including<a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/mas-and-financial-industry-to-use-new-digital-platform-to-fight-money-laundering"> COSMIC</a>, a platform for financial institutions to share data relating to high risk and illicit activity using their own systems.</p> 
 &nbsp;  
 &nbsp; UK Statement on CBDCs  
<p>On November 9th 2021, Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and the Bank of England (BoE) announced the next steps in the exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This follows the creation of a joint<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2021/april/bank-of-england-statement-on-central-bank-digital-currency"> CBDC Taskforce</a> by HMT and BoE in April 2021. In 2022, both agencies will launch a public consultation to assess the merits and implications of a CBDC as well as starting high level design planning. HMT and BoE note that no decision has been made on the introduction of a CBDC in the UK. If regulators chose to develop a CBDC following their 2022 consultation, the announcement suggests that it would launch during the second half of the decade at the earliest. Spokespersons from HMT and the BoE stated they were looking forward to an open discussion on this topic with all stakeholders.</p>

<p>The past few Holochain releases have focused on both increasing resilience and adding features for developers.</p><p>One task is particularly important, even though you’ll probably never see or experience it — and in fact, its invisibility will be the proof of its success. Right now, the core dev team is doing extensive sharding tests, tuning parameters, adjusting the algorithm, and testing again. Currently, they’re investigating how peers respond to dramatic changes in their neighbourhood, such as many neighbours leaving at once or adjusting their <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">arcs</a> of responsibility.</p><p>What they’re seeing is that nodes respond very quickly to changes in their neighbourhood — which is great in principle, but such rapid responses are causing ‘oscillations’ that take a while to calm down. It’s a bit like when you meet someone coming toward you in a hallway, then you both try to make way for each other but end up moving in the same direction. So you readjust, get in each other’s way again, and repeat a few more times before you figure it out. That’s what’s happening at the DHT level, and the dev team is working on strategies to dampen those oscillations and allow nodes to reach stability after disruptions.</p><p>As regular readers know, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/#how-rrdht-makes-things-fast-and-robust">sharding</a> is Holochain’s long-term plan for building scalable peer-to-peer networks. Sharding is already built into Holochain, but it’s currently disabled by default. This testing and improvement work is getting it ready for real-world use.</p><p>Now let’s dig into what’s happened in the last three Holochain releases.</p> Holochain 0.0.113: Small release <p>This version of Holochain, released three weeks ago, was a small one. It contained two changes:</p>  Your <code>post_commit</code> callbacks should now be ‘infallible’, which means that they don’t return a <code>Result</code>. In fact, the host doesn’t even expect or check for a return value. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)  Breaking: <code>HeaderHashes</code> and <code>HeaderHashedVec</code> no longer exist. They were previously only used in <code>post_commit</code>, which is fairly new. Note that I mistakenly reported this for 0.0.112. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)  <p>View the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20211027100746">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.114: Introspection, network simulations, and more <p>There are quite a lot of changes in last week’s release. Developers will note that zome functions can get more info about their context, while under the hood, we worked on DHT resilience improvements and got prepared to write sharding tests.</p>  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html"><code>zome_info</code></a> now includes <code>entry_defs</code>, a vector of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/prelude/struct.EntryDefs.html">entry definitions</a> from the same zome. No code changes needed, but zomes will need to be recompiled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>)  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.dna_info.html">dna_info</a></code> now includes <code>zome_names</code>, a vector of strings containing the names of the zomes as defined by the DNA manifest. As with the above, only recompilation is necessary. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>)  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/info/fn.call_info.html">call_info</a></code> now includes the name of the function being called. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1078">#1078</a>)  Breaking: Within a hApp manifest, both ‘<a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.10/holochain_types/app/type.CellNick.html">nick</a>’ (deprecated) and ‘slot’ for a DNA have been collapsed into one new property called ‘role’. It does the same thing as ‘slot’ — gives the DNA an identifier that other components of the hApp (UI and other DNAs) can use to easily address cells created with that DNA, regardless of the DNA hash. This role identifier is internal to the hApp, and the role can also be filled by DNAs and cells that are external to the hApp, such as a DNA that implements DPKI. The only change you need to make is to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1045/files#diff-664227a03af324bf24e56578368216ab0a83cf7d90f0315a3a54b2ae638c5d5eL7-L8">replace <code>slots</code> with <code>roles</code></a> in your hApp manifest. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1045">#1045</a>)  Breaking: A source chain <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.114/hdk/chain/fn.query.html">query</a></code> now guarantees ordered results: elements will be returned in header sequence ascending (oldest to newest). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1004">#1004</a>)  New: the admin API now has a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/0.0.114/holochain/conductor/api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DumpFullState"><code>DumpFullState</code></a> endpoint, which lets developers inspect individual cell states during testing. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1065">#1065</a>)  <code>remote_signal</code> now uses a more efficient method of sending notifications to peers, which can take advantage of a multicast approach. It will also now fail silently if it can’t contact the peer — which is a good reminder that signal delivery is <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/#when-not-to-use-signals">not guaranteed</a> and shouldn’t be relied on for important exchanges. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1075">#1075</a>)  Breaking: Remote nodes will now return a <code>Busy</code> message if they’re overloaded with incoming gossip. This continues work in fixing consistency bottlenecks, allowing peers to process DHT data at a sustainable pace. This breaks the network protocol, which means that cells running on conductor 0.0.114 won’t be able to communicate with cells running on earlier conductors.

<p>Korean regtech company <a href="https://argoskyc.com/">Argos KYC</a>, in its quest to improve the speed and accuracy of its Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, has partnered with AI-based document recognition specialist <a href="https://smartengines.com/">Smart Engines</a>. The alliance will see Argos KYC leveraging Smart Engine’s Green AI and Smart ID SDK to extract ID document data and identify document types, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>The Smart Engines technology has a small footprint, making it energy efficient and versatile in terms of deployment. Notably, its OCR solution can extract data in over 100 languages.</p>



<p>“We are proud that our OCR performs exceptionally well for the Korean language,” said Smart Engines CFO Nikita Arlazarov. “Our partnership with Argos KYC not only corresponds to the needs of their business but will help it to get in the head place among its competitors.”</p>



<p>OCR is a crucial part of ensuring KYC and AML compliance through remote enrollment technologies, which take a two-pronged approach to digital identity verification: document recognition and biometric face matching. When signing up for an account online, a user will take a photo of their identity document, then snap a selfie. The onboarding technology will match the user’s face to the photo on the ID, ensuring they are who they claim to be. A strong OCR solution ensures the data captured from the ID is both legitimate and accurate.</p>



<p>As the ID verification space heats up, flooded with new startups and loads o<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/event-recap-findbiometrics-enterprise-online-summit-092903/">f investment</a>, speed and accuracy are clear differentiators. Users are coming to expect frictionless enrollment, with surveys suggesting that undue user friction around ID verification and authentication <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fiserv-banks-need-improve-digital-services-retain-their-customers/">can lead to lost customers</a>. In this regard, Argos KYC is taking the prudent strategy.</p>



<p>“I have no doubts that positive experience with the KYC solution will enable further expanding the services based on ID scanning for our customers and to effectively apply legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating identity theft, money laundering, and terrorist financing,” said Argos KYC CEO Q Lee.</p>



<p>This latest partnership comes on the heels of Smart Engines’ latest OCR upgrade, which enabled it to extract <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/new-smart-engines-ocr-pulls-payment-data-from-credit-cards-101302/">payment data from credit cards</a>.</p>

<p>Spain-based biometric onboarding leader <a href="https://en.facephi.com/">FacePhi</a> has won further recognition from its compatriots, this time from the Official College and Association of Graduates and Technical Telecommunications Engineers of the Valencian Community (COGITCV/AGITCV). The latter has named FacePhi as the winner of one of its 2021 Telecommunications Talent Awards, in its case in the Technological Company category.</p>



<p>The awards are aimed at recognizing the success of professionals and organizations from the Valencian territory across business and academia. In a statement announcing the award win, FacePhi framed it as validation “for the daily effort of all the people who make up FacePhi, the true core of the company; a multidisciplinary team that, day-by-day, shows commitment to a new project, developed in-house and with an international scope.”</p>



<p>The award win offers another indication that FacePhi is a darling of the Spanish business community. Earlier this year, FacePhi won the Alicante SME of the Year Award, and shortly thereafter Banco Santander and the Chamber of Commerce of Spain gave FacePhi the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-named-spains-sme-of-the-year-702261/">National SME Award</a> for 2020.</p>



<p>The company is well-respected beyond Spain, of course. FacePhi is renowned as one of the leading pioneers of selfie-based identity verification, and has established a strong presence in the financial services sector with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-provides-biometric-onboarding-mibanco-customers-latin-america-021703/">its SelphID solution</a>. A number of financial services providers, particularly in the Latin American region, use the solution to let customers remotely confirm their identities simply by uploading a selfie image and pictures of official ID, with FacePhi’s facial recognition technology matching the faces in the images.</p>



<p>With the pandemic having boosted interest in the selfie-based approach to customer verification, FacePhi has enjoyed an especially strong growth trend of late, with the company reporting a 60 percent year-over-year increase in revenues for the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-reports-60-sales-increase-for-h1-as-ceo-takes-board-chair-707261/">first half of 2021</a>.</p>



<p>FacePhi’s portfolio is not limited to facial recognition, however. The company recently announced a comprehensive new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/money2020-facephi-announces-adaptable-multimodal-identity-platform-710251/">FacePhi Identity Platform</a> that features fingerprint recognition, voice recognition, and behavioral biometrics in addition to facial recognition, and also supports digital signatures.</p>

<p>An up-and-coming behavioral biometrics specialist has raised $35 million in a recent funding round, and may be able to stoke further interest with an aspect of its solution that helps it to stand out.</p>



<p>Based in Montana, <a href="https://www.neuro-id.com/">Neuro-ID</a> offers a behavioral biometrics solution that analyzes patterns in how end users type and interact with their devices in order to spot the signs of fraud. In that respect, it’s similar to other solutions in segment of the biometrics space that has quietly been surging in popularity in recent years, especially in the financial services sector.</p>



<p>But Neuro-ID’s solution goes further than detecting potential fraud. As the company explained in a statement announcing the new funding, its solution is capable of using the behavioral data it collects “to reveal key insights into the intent and emotion behind each user interaction.” It does this through a proprietary “Friction Index” that is designed to help clients make sense of the behavioral data.</p>



<p>Speaking to VentureBeat, Neuro-ID CEO Jack Alton explained that the company’s aim is to not only fight fraud but also increase conversion rates for clients.</p>



<p>“Traditional behavioral analytics companies like NuData have used behavioral technology to do things like authenticate existing customers to prevent account takeovers by malicious actors,” he said. “Neuro-ID is focused on tackling a much larger ‘conversion crisis’ that all digital organizations face.”</p>



<p>Neuro-ID’s Series B funding round was led by Canapi Ventures and featured contributions from existing investors FinVC and TTV Capital. </p>



<p>Commenting on the investment, Canapi Ventures Partner Walker Forehand explained that “Neuro-ID’s differentiated platform and unique value proposition put the company at the forefront of the rapidly expanding behavioral analytics space,” adding later that it is “well-positioned to take advantage of tailwinds created by the digitization of financial services and growth of e-commerce as companies look to better understand customer intent and behavior.”</p>



<p>Neuro-ID previously raised $7 million in a Series A funding round, and says that it increased its revenues and client base fourfold over the past year.</p>

<p>Users’ frustrations with the Pixel 6 smartphone’s fingerprint scanner have pushed Google to respond, and the tech giant has offered an interesting explanation via its official Twitter account.</p>



  



<p>Replying to customer inquiries (as spotted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-slow-fingerprint-sensor-195023475.html">Engadget</a>), the Made By Google account explained that the fingerprint sensor’s slow performance may be a result of the use of “enhanced security algorithms”, adding, “In some instances, these added protections can take longer to verify or require more direct contact with the sensor.”</p>



<p>Complaints about the performance of the sensor have been widespread, with reviewers and customers flagging it as a real pitfall of an otherwise solid smartphone. As some tech writers have explained, the sensor isn’t even all that slow in absolute terms – it’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/google-stumbles-in-pivot-to-in-display-fingerprint-scanning-811011/">just a little bit slower</a> than what today’s smartphone users are used to, and that can lead to persistent frustration, especially for those who use biometric authentication to streamline daily activities like paying for subway fare.</p>



<p>The other issue is reliability, with Google facing complaints about the number of false rejections produced by the Pixel 6’s sensor.</p>



<p>The important context here is that this is Google’s first attempt at an in-display fingerprint sensor, one of the biggest recent trends in mobile biometrics. As such, it helps to illustrate both the popularity of this kind of technology, and the difficulties of grappling with this nascent technology.</p>



<p>It also shows the benefits of offering facial recognition as another authentication option. Google had impressed users with a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometrics-news-google-launches-pixel-4-new-biometric-face-unlock-ditches-fingerprint-scanner-101601/">3D facial recognition system</a> in the Pixel 4 and 4a, but has since abandoned facial recognition entirely on its mobile devices, even as the modality has increased in popularity among other smartphone makers and users.</p>



<p>As Engadget’s J. Fingas reports, there have been suggestions that the Pixel 6’s fingerprint scanning system’s poor performance is the result of the use of an optical scanner, rather than an ultrasonic sensor; but other devices featuring an in-display optical sensor have not faced the same complaints. “There’s a real chance software may play a role in the Pixel 6’s quirks,” Fingas concludes.</p>



<p>Whether the performance issues could be addressed by a future software update or not, for now Google is offering users <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6285273#zippy=%2Cfingerprint-unlock-not-working-on-pixel-pixel-pro%2Cfingerprint-not-accepted">some basic tips</a> on potentially improving their user experience, including re-enrolling fingerprints, pressing more firmly on the scanner, and cleaning the display.</p>

<p>Ride-hailing startup Vengo has become the latest customer to embrace <a href="https://shuftipro.com/">Shufti Pro</a>‘s remote onboarding solution. The company will use the Shufti Pro solution to verify the identities of its drivers.</p>



<p>Shufti Pro’s solution is designed to use facial recognition to match end users’ selfie images to those of their official identity documents. It’s an increasingly popular approach to remote identity verification, and Shufti Pro may be picking up momentum as a vendor, having <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shufti-pro-helps-verify-identities-morpho-labs-crypto-backers-110409/">just announced another client</a> – crypto platform Morpho Labs – last week.</p>



<p>Vengo says its app-based ride hailing service is operational in the US, Europe, Asia, and South America; but in a statement announcing the partnership, the company emphasized that it was embracing Shufti Pro’s solution in order to “comply with mandatory KYC requirements, especially for the market segments of Venezuela”.</p>



<p>That having been said, Vengo co-founder Sami Michl also gestured at Europe’s biggest privacy and data protection regulation in his commentary on the partnership.</p>



<p>“Shufti helps us to keep a competitive advantage in leapfrogging markets by using artificial intelligence to verify our drivers data and storing them GDPR-compliant,” he said, adding later, “the PCI-compliant AI ID Verification underpins our clear and transparent compliance framework, which we use for fraud detection with our payment gateways and other strategic partners.”</p>



<p>For Shufti’s part, CEO Victor Fredung said that the company is committed to helping businesses to “expand without the risk of digital identity fraud,” and highlighted the efficacy of Shufti’s technology. “Our AI-powered KYC solution validates the identity of individuals in seconds with an accuracy rate of 98.67 percent, making the onboarding process swift and reliable,” he said.</p>



<p>Shufti Pro upgraded its platform with the addition of an <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/shufti-pro-adds-nfc-verification-identity-verification-platform-042301/">NFC reading feature</a> to further enhance document verification. The company’s solution <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/shufti-pro-gets-listed-salesforce-appexchange-052108/">made its debut</a> on the Salesforce AppExchange the following month.</p>

<p>Friction is the new F-word, and you know what that means. Complete this short survey to tell us how sensitive you are to those mobile experiences that rub you the wrong way and gain access to expert reports on preventing fraud and enhancing customer experiences in mobile apps. Eight survey respondents will receive a $50 Amazon gift card for participating.</p>


   When you read the word friction, what do you think?  Rug burn.  Changing my car’s tires.  The number of steps it takes to open a mobile account.  [Censored].    When using a mobile app how onerous does an onboarding experience have to be before you abandon a transaction?  If account creation takes longer than five minutes, I’m gone.  After three or four minutes you’ve lost my business.  I’m busy, if you can’t onboard me in less than two minutes you’re too slow for me.  I have a high tolerance for friction – it doesn’t matter how long account creation takes if I’m determined to use your app.    Are you interested in learning more about how 27 leading mobile apps compare when it comes to friction, or how low-friction technologies can decrease fraud in mobile banking? (Select all that apply)  I’m curious about the leading apps, show me the Mobile App Friction report. [Download the Mobile App Friction Report]  Tell me how a challenger bank nearly eliminated fraud without increasing friction. [Download the Incognia Case Study]    What is your purchasing authority? (Select all that apply)  I am a decision maker.  I am an influencer.  I specify or recommend products for purchase.  None.    Is your organization evaluating biometrics and identity technologies?  We are actively looking for biometrics and identity solutions.  We are open to evaluating biometrics and identity solutions in the future.  Our organization has already deployed some biometrics and identity solutions.  Biometrics are not a fit at my organization.     Please provide your contact information to complete the survey.

<p>At Dock, we’re focused on providing the best possible developer tools to ensure our products are easy to use while providing the best possible experience for technical teams. So today, we’re delighted to announce that we’ve incorporated a sandbox environment for users of our API. &nbsp;</p><p>For the uninitiated, Dock’s API enables businesses and developers to easily and instantly issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities on the Dock Blockchain. Dock integrates industry-leading World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) VCDM standards, allowing interoperability with other open source technologies. We provide a range of open-source software on <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork">GitHub</a> that can be used alongside the API.</p><p>You can test our API in the sandbox testnet by simply switching the toggle to test mode.</p><p>Primary features of Dock’s API include:</p>  Issuing, verifying, managing, and revoking/unrevoking verifiable credentials  Creating and managing decentralized identities  Anchoring credentials on-chain to enable timestamping  Creating and assigning schemas to credentials for compliance  <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#primary-features">And more</a>  <p>All of which you can test out in the sandbox environment! </p><p>To get started; create a free account, log into your <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">dashboard</a> and acquire your API key. </p><p>By default, API keys are created for production. You can switch the toggle to test mode and utilize the API in this endpoint. Any transactions made in test mode will not carry through on production. Note; your API keys for production and testnet are different. </p><p>All about DIDs</p><p>Decentralized Identities (DIDs) are globally unique identifiers that allow their owner to prove cryptographic control over them. DIDs on Dock are created by choosing a 32-byte unique (on Dock chain) identifier along with a public key. </p><p>Get accustomed to Dock’s API before utilizing your 50 free transactions on production;</p><p>Using the sandbox environment, create a new DID, public key, and controller by using an auto-generated keypair. It is important to have a public key of one of its three supported types. </p><p>Dock supports 3 types of public keys: sr25519, ed25519, and secp256k1. These public keys are supported by 3 classes: PublicKeySr25519, PublicKeyEd25519, and PublicKeySecp256k1.</p><p>You can update your public key or the controller of an on-chain DID by preparing a signed key update. You can even rotate the key of an existing DID following the instructions on our <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#update-did">API documentation here</a>.</p><p>A DID can be deleted from the testnet blockchain by sending the corresponding message signed with the current key. However, further attempts to resolve this DID will fail, just as it would in production mode. </p><p>Issuing Credentials</p><p>Simple to verify and almost impossible to fake or modify, recording credentials on the blockchain will increase security and prevent fraud. Though the VCDM spec does not mandate it, an issuer in Dock must have a DID on a chain. </p><p>You can use the sandbox environment to issue credentials just as you would on production; ensure your public key is accessible to the holder and verifier to verify the signature (in proof) in the credential. The DID can be found in the issuer field of the credential.</p><p>Updating or deleting Registries</p><p>Utilize the sandbox environment whenever you need it, simply switch the toggle in the top right corner to test mode and get to work.</p><p>There can be multiple registries on the chain, and each registry has a unique ID. A registry can be created, updated, revoked/unrevoked, and even deleted in a few simple steps. View our <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#registries">API documentation here</a> and get started in the sandbox environment. </p><p>Verify Credentials</p><p>In production, upon receiving a verifiable credential or presentation, a verifier verifies the validity of the credentials. </p><p>The verify method can be used to check the authenticity of the issuer and the issuer’s signature, revocation status if the credential is revocable, and if the holder has signed the presentation.</p><p>Verify a credential or presentation in our <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">sandbox testnet here</a>.</p><p>Give it a try</p><p>Dock’s API allows you to easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities on the Dock Blockchain. It’s easy to set up and implement, and requires no sign-up fee! Get started in our sandbox environment and your 50 free transactions will be in production when you switch over.</p>

<p>In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to the Co-founders of Unit — <a href="https://www.mihealy.com/">Michael Healy</a> and <a href="https://www.yipworx.com/">Thy-Diep (“Yip”)&nbsp;Ta</a>.</p><p><a href="https://docs.unit.foundation/">Unit.Network</a> is a parachain built on Substrate and linked to the <a href="https://polkadot.network/about/">PolkaDot network</a> that (1) provides tools to build and grow a token, (2) enables decentral (free-market) banking, and (3) is fundamentally designed to catalyze the token economy — widespread adoption of tokens for use (not just investment) throughout the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We spoke about how tokens could help distribute value in the world, the future of a token economy, the role of cryptocurrency treasuries, and more during our conversation.</p><p>Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;<a href="https://anchor.fm/dataeconomy/episodes/Michael-Healy--Thy-Diep-Yip-Ta--How-token-economy-could-contribute-to-distributing-value-e1a3p90">podcast</a>.</p><p>What is a token economy, and how can it solve the problem of inequity in&nbsp;society?</p><p>Imagine an economy driven by tokens. The concept of tokens is super new. At the moment, when people think about coins or tokens — they think about Bitcoin or Ethereum.</p><blockquote>“How we view tokens is that they’re just a way for value to flow around the economy more efficiently and freely, and a way to share and distribute value in a more equitable way. Currently, the way the world works is that the people who benefit from business organizations doing well are just the founders and the investors. However, organizations would be nothing without the customer base and employees. They won’t be able to thrive or survive without them. When a project like Uber reaches worth $80 billion on the stock exchange, none of it goes to the 2 million drivers that are a huge support system for Uber. The inspiring vision of the token economy is where everything in the world has a token- whether it’s your local restaurant or your friend who’s an artist. You have an idea for a project, and you create tokens,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><blockquote>“Token is the container that enables the flow of economic transactions in a world where every stakeholder who helps contribute value can have a fair share in it,” added&nbsp;Yip.</blockquote><p>Many people who know about cryptocurrencies also consider a range of operational questions like what to build on or how to make a token. According to Michael, blockchain technology is going to become commoditized. People are comparing which blockchain is better and does more transactions per second or is more decentralized.</p><blockquote>“It’s not going to matter which chain you issue your token on. It’s not going to matter which platform you’re using to put data on. It is just going to be about how to monetize, and the best thing about the blockchain is that it’s decentralized. Even with us being cofounders, we just can’t decide to take everything down tomorrow,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><p>However, a decentralized token economy can only be enabled with the help of a seamless treasury system. <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/zhangb2/treasury.pdf">A treasury system</a> is a community-controlled and decentralized collaborative decision-making mechanism for sustainable funding of blockchain development and maintenance. During each treasury period, project proposals are submitted, discussed, and voted for; top-ranked projects are funded from the treasury. More specifically, the treasury system supports liquid democracy/delegative voting for better collaborative intelligence. Namely, the stakeholders can either vote directly on the proposed projects or delegate their votes to experts. Its core component is a distributed universally composable secure end-to-end verifiable voting protocol. The integrity of the treasury voting decisions is guaranteed even when all the voting committee members are corrupted. Michael comments on the concept of a treasury that Unit is building:</p><blockquote>“It sounds very simple- put funds into a treasury, and the treasury is providing this fundamental book value. This is super cool to address and understand how to value different tokens. For example, you can currently look at different coins and tokens on two popular sites- CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. But there’s no parameter for assessing the underlying value that’s being created or generated backing up the token. The Unit Treasury really solves&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>The future of Token&nbsp;Economy</p><p>How big is the token economy? If you look at tokens, it’s about 8000 tokens. The crypto market cap of the token market cap is between $2 to $3 trillion. It sounds like a lot of money, but the biggest company globally is Apple which is about $2 to $3 trillion; Tesla just crossed over, being worth $1 trillion. That’s just one&nbsp;company.</p><blockquote>“There are about 8 billion people in the world. We think each person is going to have a token. We think more than having a personal token; they will own a token for a community or different businesses and projects. We are at a stage with just 8000 tokens. If this was a party, the music hasn’t turned yet and nobody is here. Most people in the world, most companies, most leaders don’t see the potential and possibility of tokens yet. So I guess our responsibility, vision, mission, and purpose behind Unit to bring the future and the value of tokens to the entire world,” says&nbsp;Michael.</blockquote><p>Use cases of token&nbsp;economy</p><p>Everything in the non-internet and non-mobile world eventually moved to the internet. Newspaper, shopping, education, travel — everything went online. It’s the same with a token and blockchain. There is an opportunity if there isn’t a decentralized app or a token for a particular industry or a particular business. For example, if there’s a supermarket, which is centrally owned and centrally runs, there’s an opportunity for you to create a supermarket, which has decentralized ownership and decentralized operations.</p><p>Yip mentions that other use cases will be everything related to helping the gaming and the metaverse economy come to&nbsp;life:</p><blockquote>“ People will spend more and more time in Virtual Reality and mixed reality environments, and all this needs creators. A lot of people can already start to earn a living, producing content like this. It’s not about consuming gaming but being able to consume it and produce at the same time. You can become a creator in that new economy and already play and earn, but also create and earn. This will reduce a lot of inequities in the&nbsp;market.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2: 15 to 5.36: What does data ownership mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>5.36 to 11.40: What is a token economy, and what problems can it solve?

  <p>When you hear SSO (Single Sign-On), you probably immediately think of web apps, and how you only need to sign into one web app first, then all other web apps give you seamless access. Unfortunately, for desktop and mobile applications (often referred to as “native apps”), the seamless web SSO experience (also referred to as native SSO) has not caught on. This is partly due to the lack of an industry standard or best practice on how to accomplish native SSO.</p>

<p>Although there is no standard yet, there’s been growing demand for a solution, due to the continued expansion of native apps, both desktop and mobile. In 2020, a report from RiskIQ counted <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/02/28/there-are-now-89-million-mobile-apps-and-china-is-40-of-mobile-app-spending/?sh=33b7e96721dd">8.9 million mobile apps</a>. There are also a large number of internal native apps available to employees within an enterprise.</p>

<p>In comparison with desktop or web apps, it’s even more critical to enable SSO for mobile apps, due to the smaller keyboard and screen on a mobile device, which makes password input more painful. To date, complex proprietary solutions have not proven interoperable with the variety of native applications an enterprise installs on employee devices. Thus, there is still a dire need for an industry-standard solution.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this problem is widely recognized, and an OIDC draft spec <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">Native SSO for Mobile Apps</a> has been released to address the issue using a token-exchange approach. Okta recently added support for this draft spec. In this article, we describe the solution and compare it to an existing approach. We also share an example app to demonstrate how you can use the token-exchange solution to build SSO for your apps, not only within the same device, but also across devices. Specifically, the example demonstrates how you can single-sign-on with Okta to a mobile app on one device (such as your iPhone), then have access to all your apps on another desktop device (such as your Mac).</p>

 Sharing web sessions with native apps 

<p>Before we describe the token-exchange solution, let’s explore how to build a native SSO solution based on web SSO. If we could share web login sessions with native apps, we could leverage the advance in browser SSO technology. Web session sharing has become more restrictive due to the continued increase in privacy restrictions on mobile devices. Apple leads the charge on adding more privacy restrictions, but Android is quickly following suit.</p>

<p>Apple introduced <code>SFSafariViewController</code> in iOS 9, which enables an embedded web browser experience inside a mobile app. But Apple quickly changed its behavior. In iOS 11, <code>SFSafariViewController</code> no longer shares any browser cookies with the standalone Safari browser on the same device, making it impossible to share SSO sessions between a mobile app and a web app.</p>

<p>Apple introduced <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> in iOS 12 to add the ability to share browser cookies, but it is restrictive:
It can only be used in an OIDC-style login flow, and only shares persistent cookies, not session cookies.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/shared-sso-android-ios/ios/overview/">Okta developer guide on web session sharing</a> illustrates how two mobile apps on the same device can share a web login session. At a high level, it involves these steps:</p>

 
   Enable persistent cookies. Okta login session is stored in a session cookie by default, but only persistent cookies can be shared in iOS. 
   Login App 1 through the embedded browser. The login session is saved in a persistent cookie. 
   Login App 2 through the embedded browser. Since the login session is still in the persistent cookie, the user is not prompted for login. 
 

 Native SSO based on token exchange 

<p>Okta’s native SSO solution is based on token exchange, and it builds on an OIDC draft spec <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">Native SSO for Mobile Apps</a>. The following diagrams, taken from the spec, illustrate the flow to enable native SSO.</p>

<p>Sign-in to the first application is similar to a normal OIDC sign in, using a system browser. The only difference is that we request the <code>device_sso</code> scope, and in return, we receive a <code>device_secret</code> along with the returned tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When Native App 2 requests login, it can simply take the ID token and device secret returned for App 1, and call the token endpoint to exchange for tokens for App 2. The returned tokens for App 2 have their own refresh lifecycle.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO Guide</a> goes into more detail on how to enable native SSO, and demonstrates the interaction through curl commands.</p>

 How is it different 

<p>The token-exchange-based native SSO solution is simpler and better than sharing web SSO in at least several regards:</p>
 
   Out-of-the-box config: Sharing web SSO requires you to use an API to configure all users to use a persistent cookie for session management. (The default is to use a session cookie.) A login session will persist even after you close the browser, which may be a surprise for some users. In contrast, native SSO is one of the supported grant types that can be easily enabled in the Okta admin console. 
   Single LogOut: It is not possible to single logout all applications with the web SSO sharing solution. If you want to log out from all apps, you have to log out from each app one by one. In contrast, in native SSO, one can simply revoke <code>device_secret</code>, then all apps automatically sign out. 
   Multiple devices: Sharing web SSO can only work on the same device. In contrast, native SSO can work across devices, as long as <code>device_secret</code> can be safely shared. In fact, the remaining portion of this blog demonstrates how to implement native SSO across multiple Apple devices. 
 

 Single sign-on across multiple Apple devices 

<p>Many of us own multiple devices such as iPhone, MacBook, iPad. It would be great to single sign-on to apps across all the devices we own. In this section, we demonstrate how to sign into a mobile app on an iOS device and a desktop app on a MacBook by leveraging iCloud keychain.
Note that this demo generalizes the <code>device_secret</code> concept described in the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-native-sso-1_0.html">draft spec</a> to beyond a single device. While it allows you to single sign-on across multiple devices, you do lose the ability to revoke access on an individual device. (You can only revoke all devices.) Also, you lose the assurance that the <code>device_secret</code> can identify a single device.</p>

<p>We first need to create two OIDC apps in your Okta admin console, one for the iOS mobile app, another for the Mac desktop app. See our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO Guide</a> for full instruction.</p>

<p>Next, let us start an Xcode project, and add two targets: one for an iOS app (<code>nativesso</code>), another for a Mac app (<code>nativessomac</code>). The full source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-ios-native-sso-example">Native SSO sample app repo</a>.</p>

 Store device secret in iCloud Keychain 

<p>The key to enabling native SSO is to be able to securely share <code>device_secret</code> across multiple devices. We can use iCloud Keychain. We will show how to use Apple’s keychain interface functions to save and restore the device secret.</p>

<p>By default, a keychain item is only stored per app. No other apps can access the keychain items your app saves. However, the keychain has a concept called the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps">keychain access group</a>. You can enable multiple apps to share the same keychain access group, then all of these apps can read and write from the same Keychain Access Group. A Keychain Access Group is tied to a developer account, so only your apps (if enabled) can access the group. No other apps from other developers can access your group, so it is secure.</p>

<p>First, let us add the keychain access group. Click the target, select Signing &amp; Capabilities, click + to add a Keychain Sharing capability. Then input a unique group name, such as <code>com.atko.group</code>, in the box. This will update the entitlement file. Repeat this step for other targets or apps that you want to share the device secret with.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To save a device secret and ID token in the keychain, we invoke the following function:</p>

   <code>static func addDeviceSecret(idToken: String, deviceSecret: String) {
    let attributes: [String: Any] = [
        (kSecClass as String): kSecClassGenericPassword,     // only Password items can use iCloud keychain
        (kSecAttrSynchronizable as String): kCFBooleanTrue!, // allow iCloud
        (kSecAttrLabel as String): keychainTag,              // tag to make it easy to search
        (kSecAttrAccessGroup as String): keychainGroup,      // multiple apps can share through this group
        (kSecAttrAccount as String): idToken,
        (kSecValueData as String): deviceSecret.data(using: .utf8)!
    ]
    // Let's add the item to the Keychain! 😄
    let status = SecItemAdd(attributes as CFDictionary, nil)
}
</code>   

<p>We first set the <code>attributes</code>:</p>

 
   <code>kSecClass</code> is set to <code>kSecClassGenericPassword</code> because iCloud keychain only supports password items, not certificates. 
   <code>kSecAttrSynchronizable</code> flag indicates that we want to use iCloud keychain. 
   We add a <code>kSecAttrLabel</code> to facilitate a later query to find this key. 
   <code>kSecAttrAccessGroup</code> is set to the same keychain access group enabled in the entitlement, for example <code>com.atko.group</code>. 
   We reuse fields designed for saving passwords: save ID token in <code>kSecAttrAccount</code> field, and device secret in <code>kSecValueData</code>. 
 

<p>After the attributes are set, it is a simple call to Apple’s API <code>SecItemAdd</code> to save the credentials.</p>

<p>We can find the previously saved device secret through a query to the iCloud keychain through the following function.</p>

   <code>static func queryForDeviceSecret() -&gt; (idToken: String?, deviceSecret: String?) {
    let query: [String: Any] = [
        (kSecClass as String): kSecClassGenericPassword,     // only Password items can use iCloud keychain
        (kSecAttrSynchronizable as String): kCFBooleanTrue!, // allow iCloud
        (kSecAttrLabel as String): keychainTag,              // tag to make it easy to search
        (kSecAttrAccessGroup as String): keychainGroup,      // multiple apps can share through this group
        (kSecMatchLimit as String): kSecMatchLimitOne,       // should only have one key
        (kSecReturnAttributes as String): true,
        (kSecReturnData as String): true]
    var item: CFTypeRef?

    // should succeed
    let status = SecItemCopyMatching(query as CFDictionary, &amp;item)
    
    if let existingItem = item as? [String: Any],
        let idToken = existingItem[kSecAttrAccount as String] as? String,
        let deviceSecretData = existingItem[kSecValueData as String] as? Data {
        let deviceSecret = String(data: deviceSecretData, encoding: .utf8)
        return (idToken, deviceSecret)
    }
    return (nil, nil)
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>query</code> is set using the same set of parameters as used in the <code>SecItemAdd</code> call, then it is a simple call to the Apple’s API <code>SecItemCopyMatching</code>.</p>

 Exchange device secret for new tokens 

<p><a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios">Okta OIDC iOS library</a> is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS">AppAuth library</a>. For token exchange, we will use AppAuth’s built-in functions.</p>

<p>We first have to construct a configuration for AppAuth.</p>

   <code>let configuration = OIDServiceConfiguration.init(
    authorizationEndpoint: URL(string: authorizeUrl)!,
    tokenEndpoint: URL(string: tokenUrl)!
)
</code>   

<p>The <code>authorizeUrl</code> should be set to your AS (Authorization Server)’s “authorize” URL, for instance: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>. The <code>tokenEndpoint</code> should be the token url, like this: <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token</code>.</p>

<p>Then we construct a token exchange request. Note that we specify the new grant type <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange</code>, and also add in the special parameters in the <code>additionalParameters</code> field. Specifically, <code>actor_token</code> should be set to the device token, and <code>subject_token</code> should be set to the ID token you obtained earlier when a different app signed in.</p>

   <code>let request = OIDTokenRequest(
                configuration: configuration,
                grantType: "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange",
                authorizationCode: nil,
                redirectURL: nil,
                clientID: oktaOidc.configuration.clientId,
                clientSecret: nil,
                scope: "openid offline_access",
                refreshToken: nil,
                codeVerifier: nil,
                additionalParameters: [
                   "actor_token" : deviceSecret!,
                   "actor_token_type" : "urn:x-oath:params:oauth:token-type:device-secret",
                   "subject_token" : idToken!,
                   "subject_token_type" : "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token",
                   "audience" : "api://default"])
</code>   

<p>Lastly, we perform token exchange to get a new accessToken, refreshToken for the new app.</p>

   <code>// perform token exchange
OIDAuthorizationService.perform(request) { tokenResponse, error in
    if error != nil {
        // handle errors
    }
// Signed in, persist tokens, 
}
</code>   

 End-to-end login flow 

<p>Now that we have the building blocks of save-and-query device secret, and token exchange, let’s tie them together to enable login on a device. Essentially, it follows these steps:</p>

 
   Look up <code>deviceSecret</code> from iCloud keychain.
       <code>  let (idToken, deviceSecret) = queryForDeviceSecret()
</code>       
   
   If <code>deviceSecret</code> exists, attempts token exchange, as outlined in the previous section. 
   If the token exchange succeeds, the user is already logged in. We then save login state locally so that the app does not need to do a login check on the next startup. This is leveraging Okta OIDC library’s built-in capability to persist login state locally.
       <code>  stateManager!.writeToSecureStorage()
</code>       
   
   If no <code>deviceSecret</code>, or token exchange fails, invoke the OIDC login flow.
First construct a configuration for Okta’s OIDC library:
       <code>  let configuration = try OktaOidcConfig(with: [
   "issuer": "https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default",
   "clientId": "0oa826j5pHmPRt2n00w6",
   "scopes": "device_sso openid offline_access",
   "redirectUri": "nativesso:/callback",
   "logoutRedirectUri": "nativesso:/logout"
  ])
</code>       
    <p>Then invoke the OIDC flow. On an iOS device:</p>
       <code>  oktaOidc.signInWithBrowser(from: self, callback: SignInHelper.oktaOidcCallback)
</code>       
    <p>On a Mac:</p>
       <code>  oktaOidc.signInWithBrowser(redirectServerConfiguration: nil, callback: SignInHelper.oktaOidcCallback)
</code>       
   
   If the sign-in is successful, we save the login state locally, the same as in step three. In addition, we save the device secret in the iCloud keychain, so that other apps can perform native SSO login.
       <code>  removeDeviceSecret()
  addDeviceSecret(idToken: stateManager!.idToken!, 
               deviceSecret: stateManager!.authState.lastTokenResponse!.additionalParameters!["device_secret"]! as! String)
</code>       
   
 

<p>Note that the Okta SDK currently does not understand the device secret field, so we are parsing for the field directly from the last token request response.</p>

<p>By now, you should be able to launch both the iPhone app and the Mac app. The first one will prompt you for login, but the second one will be able to log you in without any prompt.</p>

 Okta’s Native SSO is available now 

<p>Okta’s native SSO feature is now in GA (general availability). You can turn it on in your org, and start experimenting. Beyond the demo use case we showed above, we envision it will open up many more scenarios. Give it a try, and drop a comment below to directly reach the development team. We would love to hear your feedback and feature requests.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>We’ve already told many folks what we are advising <a href="https://www.cheqd.io">cheqd</a>&nbsp;and participating in the cheqd network as a node operator – but we wanted to provide more information for the community (clear disclosure – that means we will, or do – depending on when you are reading this article – hold cheqd tokens).</p>
<p>This article aims to explain areas where we are aligned with cheqd as well as a few areas we will be pushing them towards.</p>
 1. OUR CLIENTS 
<p>We serve a range of client types (government, military, financial institutions, NGOs, not-for-profits, startups). I’ll deal with them in two distinct groups here as the first group is unique while the others fall into the same broad bucket.</p>
 1.1 GOVERNMENT 
<p>We advise several government agencies and they, right now, aren’t overly interested in token-enabled networks for operational use. However, they do need to understand what things will mean when permissionless ledgers and tokens are “normal” and citizens insist on their use.</p>
 1.2 OTHER CLIENTS (Corporations, Financial Institutions, Startups, Investors, Crypto Projects, and Not for Profits/NGOs) 
<p>We are advising multiple organizations about the state of decentralization/crypto/web3 space and about the key developments in the space. Many of these organizations are either actively interested in understanding what impact permissionless ledgers and tokens will have on them immediately or over the longer term. Their interest ranges from rabid to tepid to allergic. Some may be partial competitors to cheqd but they are also potential collaborators. It’s an interesting mix.</p>
<p>The reason we advise them is that it is our job at Continuum Loop to keep them apprised about where things are headed (here comes an obligatory Canadian hockey quote from a non-sports fan):</p>
<blockquote><p>“I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.”</p>
<p>– Wayne Gretzky</p></blockquote>
 2. COMPLIANCE 
<p>For many of our clients, compliance is a big issue. While many of the #decentralizeTheWorld types would like to think that there is no need for this, the world we live in needs it. So part of our efforts with cheqd is in understanding and advising on how the cheqd network fits with various compliance and audit needs.</p>
<p>Payments aren’t simple. Sure, in crypto it is easy to send funds from one address to another on the same chain. Once you start exchanging between different coins/tokens you add quite a bit of complexity. Adding the KYC/AML needs that you will, as a citizen of a country, require and things get hairy quickly.</p>
 3. INTEROP/STANDARDS 
<p>We have been talking more and more about what we call “premature interoperability” and “premature standardization”. The gist of these discussions is that there are only a few areas right now where interoperability and standardization make any sense – and neither have definitive good answers. We’ll be supporting cheqd to align with the key initiatives that we see are making a difference, particularly with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, Hyperledger with the <a href="https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html">Aries Interoperability project</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;with its interoperability profile efforts. These leading groups are bringing the industry together and I’ll be helping cheqd play a role there.</p>
 4. GOVERNANCE 
<p>As a founder (and funder) of the Trust Over IP Foundation, the consideration of governance of any ecosystem is critical. We’ve looked at how cheqd could fit into various different ecosystems that we are helping with and are pleased that it fits nicely. It is focused on the creation of a permissionless network. They are working to ensure that no single party holds too much control. In this case, control could easily kill an ecosystem so that is critical. One of my most important operating principles is pinned on my Twitter profile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Control only what you must. Influence the rest.</p>
<p>— Darrell O'Donnell 🇨🇦🆔 (@darrello) <a href="https://twitter.com/darrello/status/792496888444575744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>A governance-related area that I will be pushing cheqd and others in the SSI/decentralized identity realm relates to where developers fit into the governance structure. To date, the ecosystems we are working with don’t incentivize developers well, or at all. That’s a deep flaw in my view. We have created back-of-napkin incentive concepts that show our team internally what is feasible with cheqd in the longer term, and from the Continuum Loop side, we’re satisfied that we’re off to a good start.</p>
 5. COMMERCIAL MODEL 
<p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is part of what we help our clients understand. One big problem is that to date they really only get uptake where they are radically reducing costs, which is a bottom-line impact for companies.</p>
<p>The more interesting use cases from a business perspective are top-line revenue related – how does a business drive massive value for its customers using verifiable credentials? Any business that drives value deserves a portion of that value (while rent-seekers take oversized percentages of value while adding little or nothing, and should rightly be removed from the system).</p>
<p>The problem has been answering the following range of questions:</p>
 
 How does a Verifier pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Holder pay an Issuer; 
 How does a Verifier pay a Holder; 
 or any variant of those pairings (or more than 2 parties)? 
 
<p>This is indeed a hard problem, especially when you consider how privacy, security, and compliance are impacted when you introduce payment.</p>
<p>Many of our clients feel there is a way to add value and drive revenue with decentralized identity, but we haven’t had any good answers to date. We believe we are getting much closer to that with cheqd and other projects we are working on.</p>
 6. FIAT versus TOKEN 
<p>One of the first questions I asked the cheqd team when we started getting into discussions was how they would make life easy for users that want to use, or just stick with, fiat currency for transactions. They will need to provide details for you but I am satisfied that they are taking a good approach to make fiat payments work – especially when it comes to network fee stability.</p>
<p>On the tokenomics side, we aren’t going to get into the science (magic/mythology/voodoo – pick your term) of tokenomics as that is not our area of deep expertise. However, it is worth mentioning a few things that are important to our clients and our team. Governance is an obvious one. Another is ensuring that the non-token world can be abstracted away from the token when required. Another is how cheqd’s approach may enable commercial models that, to date, have been holding back the use of decentralized identity. The team at cheqd has a coherent explanation of how <a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-f13f680cf00d">cheqd is handling the tokenomics here</a>.</p>
 7. SOVRIN 
<p>I have fielded a lot of “but what about Sovrin?” questions. These ones baffle me somewhat, but I get it. I want to be clear, we (Continuum Loop and I) fully support the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> and its mission. I am an ex officio member of the Sovrin Board of Trustees, by virtue of co-chairing the <a href="https://sovrin.org/i4a/">Identity For All Council</a>, which is hosted at the Sovrin Foundation. I volunteer a lot of time with Sovrin and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Similar to Continuum Loop’s work with governments that are working on deploying, or have deployed, Hyperledger Indy networks of their own, Sovrin plays a critical role. We don’t believe that there will be one single SSI network but Sovrin is important both as a network, as well as its facilitator/leader role in a network-of-networks. The cheqd network adds to the diversity in the network-of-networks and I imagine that the two groups will work together nicely.</p>
<p>Sovrin is also the progenitor of much of the leading thinking that is in the space – Trust Over IP Foundation; Sovrin Governance; Hyperledger Indy; and more.</p>
 8. CONCLUSION 
<p>We’re looking forward to learning how our relationship with cheqd shakes out. We’re going to be learning alongside them and our clients. I am sure we will make progress and I am sure we will stumble at times. That’s what we do at Continuum Loop.</p>
<p>Our clients are the ones that face an uncut jungle and do one of two things – grab a machete to cut trail (Innovators*) or look for the narrow trails that other adventurous souls have already started to cut (Early Adopters*). Our clients are not looking for paved roads through well-known paths (majority and laggards). By the time those roads are in place the rest of the world is already using them.</p>
<p>* If the Innovator/Early Adopter terms are unfamiliar check the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle">Technology Adoption Life Cycle</a>. Keep in mind that most folks that talk about the adoption life cycle usually start with “we need the Early Adopters”, when they likely mean they need the Innovators.</p>

<p>Identity platform grew eightfold in the UK compared to previous year, continues to see increasing demand for its solutions.</p>
<p>London and Manchester, November 11th, 2021: IDnow, a leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification from Germany, with offices in Manchester and London, has grown eightfold year-over-year in the UK market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow, comments: “We’re seeing a significant rise in demand for our services from the UK market this year. The pandemic pushed many industries into accelerating their digitisation, and as part of that, consumers now expect a much quicker and fully digital onboarding process. The knock-on effect of that has been an increase in cybercrime making security more important than ever and meaning businesses have a heightened focus on delivering a safe and secure process for customers.”</p>
<p>IDnow’s UK growth is aligned with the global demand for its solutions. The firm sees substantial interest across the world, with more and more companies deciding to switch to fully digital application processes.</p>
<p>To meet the rising demand, IDnow acquired two companies in 2021: French identity technology provider, ARIADNEXT and German IdentityTM. The merged companies able to offer one of the broadest sets of identity verification solutions to the European market.</p>
<p>IDnow’s Director UK&amp;I, Roger Tyrzyk, adds: “Since we launched into the UK in 2019, we’ve seen consistent growth, as businesses look to deploy most secure digital onboarding processes possible. As digitisation continues at pace, we are expecting this demand to continue to grow and as a result, will be looking to further invest in our UK presence, with plans to create more jobs over the next 12 months. As digital identity experts, our expansion will come at a critical time, as the UK Government moves forward with its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, a national approach for digital identity solutions which will enable people to prove who they are quickly and safely.”</p>
<p>As part of its high-growth strategy, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become recognised as an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 900 customers worldwide, including Canopy, MyCDD, Entain and ICICI.</p>

<p>Travel and tourism was one of the worst affected industries due to the COVID pandemic.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.unwto.org/unwto-world-tourism-barometer-data">UNWTO World Tourism Barometer</a>, international travel fell by 72% in January-October 2020 when compared to the previous year, resulting in a loss of about USD 935&nbsp;billion.</p><p>In 2021, things began to look up for this industry as it saw a reasonable recovery, thanks in part to the widespread availability of vaccinations. Another important aspect that bolstered the travel industry is the adoption of digital vaccination certificates and travel passes that boosted the confidence of people to travel&nbsp;again.</p><p>At a time when airline companies and airport authorities were scrambling to check the vaccination status of their passengers, these digital credentials streamlined the verification process and created a safe travel experience for everyone involved.</p><p>The European Union digital COVID certificate and Affinidi’s safe travel passes played a big role in different geographies to get people to travel&nbsp;again.</p> Affinidi’s Safe&nbsp;Travel <p>Affinidi’s Safe travel, in particular, made a big difference in boosting travel in Southeast and Central Asia by providing end-to-end validated digital health credential solutions based on <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">self-sovereign identity</a>.</p><p>Essentially, any traveler who tested negative in the RT-PCR test was given a vaccination credential mentioning the same, and this could be shared securely with the airline, airport authorities, or any other verifier as needed. This interoperable solution used QR codes for easy verification and followed the principles of self-sovereign identity such as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">security</a>, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">selective disclosure</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This created a sense of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">trust</a> for the verifying entities because these <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> are tamper-proof and machine-verifiable, and hence required no physical contact. As for passengers, it was a safe and secure way to share their vaccination status <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">without revealing</a> additional personal information.</p><p>In all, it worked well for every stakeholder in the travel industry.</p><p>While this has been helpful to create a sense of confidence during the pandemic, what happens in a post-pandemic world? How can digital credentials continue to enhance the travel experience? More importantly, are there more ways to generate revenue from these credentials?</p><p>To explore these answers and to discuss new revenue streams within the travel industry using digital credentials, join us for Affinidi’s webinar on November 25th at 4 pm&nbsp;SGT.</p><p>Toby Berger, the Director of Travel Affinidi, and Shankar Pillai, the Director of Engineering. Health/Travel, Affinidi will be talking about the impact of digital credentials in 2022 and&nbsp;beyond.</p> What to Expect from the&nbsp;Webinar? <p>In this webinar, Toby will be talking about the main adopters (issuers, holders, and verifiers) of the COVID verification solutions and relevant use-cases. He will be giving you pointers on the aspects you should consider while selecting a verification solution and the likely challenges you will face while implementing them.</p><p>Toby’s insights will be followed by a use-case presentation by Shankar where he will use Affinidi Travel as an example to demonstrate how VCs can help enable safe travel. He will also describe its architecture, so you can visualize its integration with your&nbsp;idea.</p><p>Finally, Kamal Laungani, the Global Developer Ecosystem Manager, will describe the APIs and SDKs that can help you build an VC-based&nbsp;app.</p><p>These interesting sessions will be followed by Q and A on our&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>.</p><p>Sounds interesting, right?</p><p>Register <a href="https://lemmatree.zoom.us/webinar/register/8016354073764/WN_WrlR9eGZQ6K3RgKIDPKkKQ">here</a> for the webinar, and together, let’s see how we can leverage the power of digital credentials to boost the travel industry and gain economic benefits from&nbsp;them.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a> to know about such interesting events.

Below are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round 12 (the same as round 11). “Unleashing Data” has two tiers ($3,000 USD, $10,000 USD max); other categories have four tiers ($3,000 USD up to $35,000 USD&nbsp;max).</p><p>“Unleashing Data” Category:</p>  Open to&nbsp;All    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  <p>2. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: $1,000 USD of legitimate consumptions in the previous month AND the team has received less than $30,000 USD funding&nbsp;total.  <p>All other Categories (max per&nbsp;team):</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during application process. Introduced to related projects.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above.

<p>“Web 3.0 enables a future where distributed users and machines are able to interact with data, value and other counterparties via a substrate of peer-to-peer networks without the need for third parties. The result:&nbsp;a composable human-centric and privacy preserving computing fabric for the next wave of the web.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This quote from venture capitalists Max Mersch and Richard Muirhead writing in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>&nbsp;is a pretty good answer to the question, as is this from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=745d290558df">Forbes Technology Council</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment, overtaking Web 2.0’s centralization, surveillance and exploitative advertising. Decentralized infrastructure and application platforms will displace centralized tech giants, and individuals will be able to rightfully own their data.”</p>



<p>Clearly Web 3.0 will shake up data privacy and change the data economy as we know it. Indeed, as the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) suggested in 2018, Web 3.0 might just be the answer to our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy woes</a>.</p>



 What is Web 3.0? 



<p></p>



<p>Web 3.0 is the latest iteration of the internet that’s arriving even as Web 2.0 still consumes us. Web 3.0 goes by several different monikers: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">decentralized internet</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">spatial web</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">semantic web</a>. A brief history of the internet’s evolution puts Web 3.0 in context:</p>



  Web 1.0 was&nbsp;static desktop web pages.  Web 2.0 is interactive content on desktop, mobile and social media, and constant connection via devices.  Web 3.0 will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">marked</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;open source software&nbsp;and trustless&nbsp;(users interact publicly or privately without a trusted third party)&nbsp;and&nbsp;permissionless&nbsp;(no governing body)&nbsp;networks. It will be&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">built</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;edge computing,&nbsp;decentralised data networks&nbsp;and&nbsp;artificial intelligence.  



<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte</a>&nbsp;says Web 3.0 or the spatial web will combine machine learning from the semantic web with distributed ledger technologies like blockchain to authenticate and decentralize information resulting in “interaction with information away from screens and into physical space.”</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>



<p>And this shows how Deloitte sees the spatial web continuing to emerge from now:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a><br>



<p>Clearly, the hallmarks of Web 3.0 will be decentralization and greater user interaction and control over data. Data will be dispersed across an array of computing resources, including phones, appliances, sensors and vehicles,&nbsp;rather than held exclusively in central data stores&nbsp;and, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte Insights</a>&nbsp;says, it&nbsp;“will eventually eliminate the boundary between digital content and physical objects that we know today” and “improve efficiency, communication and entertainment in ways we are only beginning to imagine today.”</p>



<p>The enabling technologies of Web 3.0 are the innovations we’re already seeing, such as&nbsp;augmented and virtual reality, advanced networking (e.g. 5G), geolocation, Internet of Things devices and sensors, distributed ledger technology (e.g. blockchain), and artificial intelligence and machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are one example of Web 3.0 innovation, but as Mersch and Murihead say in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b">The Medium</a>, Web 3.0 goes way beyond cryptocurrencies to crypto-connections of people, corporates and machines … “leading to a “return to the global village” — daily immersion in the human-centric and highly personalised interactions from which we used to benefit, yet now delivered at the global scale of the internet and supporting an ever-increasing myriad of human and machine skills specialisations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=5044b1a858df">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;sees Web 3.0 as promoting “true sovereignty” where users own and control&nbsp;who profits from an individual’s time and information … “and eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it.”</p>



 What does Web 3.0 mean for privacy? 



<p></p>



<p>For privacy, this brave new world will mean humans, enterprises and machines can share more data with far greater privacy and security. We will no longer rely on (or will at least interact on our own terms with) Big Tech platforms with all their inherent risks, and users will own their own data and digital footprint via&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-a-decentralized-web-3-0-the-answer-to-our-privacy-concerns/">IAPP</a>&nbsp;laid out exactly what Web 3.0 could mean for privacy and was highly optimistic:&nbsp;</p>



  We’ll use cryptographically secured digital identities to trustlessly complete transactions that currently require us to give up our highly sensitive and highly valuable&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. We will no longer be the product and return to being the customer.  The Googles of the world will no longer control our data and bad actors will be less able to attack it. What’s more, governments won’t control our data either. Instead, all apps, users and connected devices will interact directly and data will be stored in secure decentralized ways. This will mean we’ll see fewer data breaches that affect large numbers of users, and rightfully return control of data to individual users.  The “middleman” of centralized identity management on the web will be obsolete and users will instead interact directly using&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">self-sovereign identities</a>.&nbsp;  



 Obviously, this is all sounds like a data privacy nirvana, but the IAPP has two warnings:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



  Privacy regulations might be stumbling blocks and regulators will need to unravel issues including:  Who is the controller/processor for decentralized personal data  Where would the decentralized data be stored – location and jurisdiction&nbsp;  How to respond to subject access requests, and which entities are required to respond to such requests  How to delete or change personal information on and off the blockchain.<br>  Easy to use and convenient decentralized applications will be paramount for the average user.&nbsp;  



<p>And that’s where Anonyome Labs is helping to realize the vision of Web 3.0. Our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">applications and platforms</a> are already allowing users and enterprise partners to create and manage multiple digital identities via our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, with each Sudo providing a range of privacy protecting capabilities. You can see these capabilities in our exemplar app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;which currently provides for private, secure and compartmentalized&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">communication</a>. Learn more about how we’re promoting self-sovereign identities&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2019/08/self-sovereign-identities/">here</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll obviously stay abreast of the emergence of Web 3.0 and we’ll keep talking about the innovations and issues in coming months and years.</p>

<p>The time has finally arrived! As of November 11 at 4:14 pm CET, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a fully decentralized blockchain network. This means that BOTLabs GmbH, the company behind the development of KILT Protocol, has handed over decision-making to the community. From now on, KILT will be run via a sophisticated system of governance in which any KILT Coin holder can propose changes to the network that can be voted on by the community. This level of decentralization is what makes Web3, the next generation of the internet, truly fair and exciting.</p> Decentralization Day <p>Until now, the Sudo (super user) key allowed the development team to make any necessary changes to the blockchain on behalf of the network without the vote of the KILT community. Now that the network has been audited and these functionalities are running as planned, the time has come for the community to take&nbsp;control.</p><p>Today KILT reached the final step of decentralization. The Sudo key was removed and governance of the KILT blockchain transitioned into the hands of its community.</p> Governance at&nbsp;work <p>The first proposal in front of KILT community governance is to allow tokens to be transferred (TTE) and to distribute the “thank you” KILT Coins to supporters of the crowdloan. With sufficient backing, this proposal will go to referendum at the end of this week (by 12 November) for KILT Coin holders to vote on over the following 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Following a successful referendum, proposals are automatically carried out on KILT on-chain by the system, after an enactment period of one day. So it can be expected that the KILT Coins will be distributed to crowdloan supporters in around two weeks’ time. Follow the process on-chain <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fspiritnet.kilt.io%2F#/democracy">here</a> to see blockchain democracy in&nbsp;action!</p> The Path to Decentralization <p>Over three years of planning and development have gone into bringing KILT Protocol to this point. First conceived in 2018, KILT was developed by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/about-us/">BOTLabs under the direction of Ingo Rübe</a>. From the beginning, KILT was designed to evolve into a decentralized blockchain network that aims to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy and dignity to the individual as well as enabling innovative, industry-agnostic business models around identity.</p><p>Thanks to support from its community, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-wins-kusama-parachain-auction-slot-6-launches-mainnet-a48aed4ed5e0">KILT</a> secured a parachain slot on the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> network and launched as a live blockchain on September 8th of this year. KILT was designed as a limited delegated proof of stake (<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">LDPoS</a>) system, with delegators who support a network of collators that hold and secure the data of the KILT blockchain and create blocks. Following this design, <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">an initial cohort</a> of 16 active collators were onboarded at launch. This number is expected to increase to 75 in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>Since launch, the development team of KILT Protocol added functions such as staking, governance, and a Treasury, which will fund projects that support the KILT ecosystem, approved by community vote. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/how-it-works/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials</a> were also added to provide developers with tools to create businesses around identity and credentials.</p> In the Hands of the Community <p>As part of handing over the network to the ecosystem, BOTLabs GmbH, the company that developed KILT, will publish a series of how-to guides and blogs over the next few weeks to help the community to take control of their network. These will include guidance on how to become an active participant in the ecosystem including how to vote and how to stake on&nbsp;KILT.</p><p>Keep an eye on KILT’s <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> to follow these exciting developments and to learn how to become an active member of the KILT community!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralized identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-transitions-to-a-fully-decentralized-network-8edc5f66ed9f">KILT Transitions to a Fully Decentralized Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 10.11.2021 Die Zukunft gehört digitalen Identitäten  <p>Der Fachartikel “Elektronische Gesundheitskarte auf dem Prüfstand: Die Zukunft gehörte digitalen Identitäten” ist als Titelstory in der aktuellen Ausgabe der E-HEALTH-COM, dem unabhängigen Fachmagazin für Gesundheitstelematik, vernetzte Medizintechnik, Telemedizin und Health-IT für Deutschland, Österreich und die Schweiz erschienen. In dem Beitrag von Christian Hälker, Michael Hartmann und Dominik Deimel geht es um die Lösung des sicheren Zugriffs auf die Gesundheitsdatenautobahn ohne elektronische Gesundheitskarte.</p><p>„Ohne eGK in die TI“: Mit dieser Herausforderung startete Ende 2020 der Verband der Privaten Krankenversicherung (PKV Verband) ein Innovationsprojekt zu digitalen Identitäten. Es findet mittlerweile große Aufmerksamkeit und könnte die Zukunft der deutschen Telematikinfrastruktur entscheidend mitprägen.</p><p>In einer Marktrecherche im zweiten Halbjahr 2020 hat sich der PKV-Verband mit unterschiedlichen Ansätzen bei der Realisierung digitaler Identitäten in der Branche beschäftigt und sich für eine Innovationspartnerschaft mit den Firmen msg systems ag und comuny entschieden.</p><p>Seit Februar 2021 arbeiten diese beiden Unternehmen zusammen mit den privaten Krankenversicherungen Allianz, Debeka, Signal Iduna und mit Beteiligung der gematik unter der Koordination des PKV-Verbands an der technischen Realisierung der Lösung zum Zugang zur TI ohne eGK. Im August hat sich diesem Projekt auch die BARMER als erste gesetzliche Krankenversicherung angeschlossen und im September dann die ERGO/DKV als weitere PKV, um den Einsatz des Lösungsansatzes für ihre Versicherten zu eruieren.</p><p>Ziel ist, Identitäten auf dem Mobilgerät komfortabel zu erzeugen und zu nutzen. Der Anspruch der PKV an digitale Identitäten ist hoch, sie müssen sicher sein und dem Konzept der gematik zum föderierten Identitätsmanagement entsprechen. Danach sollen mit einem Zugang viele digitale Lösungen in der TI erreichbar sein.</p><p>Die Ende September abgeschlossene Konzeptions- und technische Umsetzungsphase konnte allen Beteiligten die Machbarkeit und die Vorteile eines IDP-Lösungsansatzes mit Datenhaltung und Prozesssteuerung auf dem Mobilgerät aufzeigen. Das Innovationsprojekt konnte aufzeigen, dass die Einführung von physischen eGK-Diensten wie E-Rezept und ePA für private Krankenversicherer nicht zwangsläufig notwendig sein wird. Jeder Versicherer stellt zukünftig einen Identitätsprovider bereit, lässt diesen hierfür bei der gematik zu und betreibt ihn anschließend entkoppelt von eigenen Fachanwendungen wie zum Beispiel der ePA […].</p><p><a href="https://www.comuny.de/wp-content/uploads/EHC_Sonderdruck_Digitale-Identitaeten_PKV-Verband_Online.pdf">Weiterlesen?

<p><br>Another day, another data breach! &nbsp;It's the reason why Bloom was founded and why we feel so passionately about what we build. &nbsp;These breaches will just continue to happen until we shift the paradigm from centrally stored personal data to models built around decentralized identity. &nbsp;Let’s take a look at the facts of this latest breach.<br></p><p>Robinhood Data Breach Compromises Names and Email Addresses of Millions of Customers<br></p><p>On November 3, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/">Robinhood</a> released a statement that an unauthorized intruder gained access to the personal information of millions of its customers. &nbsp;The data breach compromised the email addresses of approximately five million people, and separately, the full names of around two million people. &nbsp;Further evidence shows that a smaller number of customers may have had additional personal information exposed.<br></p><p>Based on the on-going investigation, it appears social security numbers and bank account data were not breached, and that there has been no financial loss to any customers. &nbsp;The incident is still under investigation and Robinhood has enlisted the help of law enforcement, as well as Mandiant, a cybersecurity company. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Unfortunately, Robinhood’s data breach is just the latest attack in a year that has seen a record number of breaches. &nbsp;Despite the knowledge that a cybersecurity-related incident was likely, an intruder was able to easily bypass Robinhood’s security system, compromising the information of millions of customers who had put their trust in the company.<br></p><p>Why does this keep happening? &nbsp;When are users going to start to demand that every company they deal with not store their personal information centrally? &nbsp;Decentralization is the future - not just for transactions, but for personal data storage and interactions. &nbsp;Download the Bloom App if you haven't already done so and see why over a million other users believe that their personal information should be theirs. &nbsp;And if you're a business, sign up for an <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp Demo</a> and see what it could mean for your business. &nbsp;It’s time to be proactive about our digital identity.<br></p><p>Data Breaches Reach an All-time High in 2021<br></p><p>As we approach the holiday season, the days are getting shorter, shopping receipts are getting longer, and cybersecurity threats are at an all time high. &nbsp;In fact, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), the number of data breaches so far this year has already <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/identity-theft-resource-center-to-share-latest-data-breach-analysis-with-u-s-senate-commerce-committee-number-of-data-breaches-in-2021-surpasses-all-of-2020/">surpassed the total for 2020</a>. &nbsp;This is extremely alarming news and worrisome as we approach the time of the year when online shopping is at its peak, and more of our personal information is available on the web.<br></p><p>As of now, there have been over 1,290 data breaches - up by 17% since last year. &nbsp;With the exponential growth in the connectivity of cyber devices, and the vulnerability of a centralized intermediary, cybersecurity is more important than ever. &nbsp;Phishing and ransomware attacks continue to be the most prevalent weapons for hackers, and the firm Cybersecurity Ventures estimate that a new ransomware attack will occur every 2 seconds. &nbsp;Ransomware is a criminal extortion tool in which key files are encrypted by hackers, rendering them inaccessible to the victim until a ransom has been paid. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Although ransomware is not a new tactic, the expanded attack surfaces and interconnectivity of digital commerce have made the cybersecurity threat as dangerous as ever. &nbsp;Hackers, constantly seeking new avenues to exploit, are now demanding payments in the form of cryptocurrency. &nbsp;The US Treasury Department has tied approximately $5.2 billion in BitCoin transactions to ransomware payments. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Awareness and Transparency<br></p><p>Cybersecurity is all about risk management. &nbsp;As the number of threats increases, more and more Americans are expressing concern that their personal information, or that of the centralized financial institutions to which they are associated, is at risk. &nbsp;The problem, though, is this: awareness does not necessarily lead to action. &nbsp;Too often, people assume that cybercrime is someone else’s responsibility, and believe that a hack will never affect them personally. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Furthermore, some organizations and governments have purposefully been withholding important data breach notices. &nbsp;In 2017, a ransomware attack called WannaCry, disrupted hospitals, schools, and government organizations in over 100 countries, demonstrating the vulnerability of globally-connected networks and devices. &nbsp;Although the WannaCry attack (and others, including CryptoLocker, WhiteRose, and Petya) was seen by some as a wake-up call, organizations and governments did not fortify against future attacks. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Significant Attacks in 2021<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at some of the more significant attacks that have occurred just this year.<br></p>  Bonobos: In January, Bonobos, a men’s clothing retailer, was victim of a massive breach, in which personally identifiable information (PII) of over 7 million shoppers was leaked in a forum for hackers. &nbsp;The PII included address, phone numbers, account information, and partial credit card numbers.  Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn: Due to an unsecured database, the PII of 214 million social media users was leaked, exposing full names, subscriber data, location, and other contact information.  CNA Insurance: Hackers in March attacked CNA, one of the largest insurance firms in the US, compromising the data of around 75,000 employees, and leading to the halt of trading for a short period of time. &nbsp;CNA Insurance agreed to pay the hackers $40 million to regain access to their ransomed network.  National Basketball Association: This year, the NBA was targeted by a ransomware attack, with the group responsible claiming that they had stolen 500gb of confidential data.  Buffalo Public Schools: Unfortunately, cyberattacks within the education sector are also becoming more prevalent, and in March the Buffalo Public Schools suffered a ransomware attack that targeted highly sensitive information for the 34,000 students within the school district.<br>  <p>As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough for people, hospitals and healthcare facilities have also become increasingly prone to cyber attacks. &nbsp;Often these critical facilities are forced to comply for fear of shutting down their medical operations. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Securing our digital identities is a universal problem. &nbsp;The interconnectivity of the world we live in means that cyberthreats will continue to impact our lives, and although awareness is increasing, so too is the complexity of the targeted attacks. &nbsp;Information shared with a centralized entity is vulnerable to a breach, as the user loses control of precisely who has their personal data. So, what can be done to mitigate the risk?<br></p><p>The Bloom Solution<br></p><p>Taking proactive measures is a good place to start. &nbsp;Staying hyper-vigilant to cyber trends and utilizing new and emerging tools to help with compliance and risk will certainly help to avoid an attack. &nbsp;Bloom offers a solution for digital identity, user privacy, and risk assessment. &nbsp;In fact, Bloom was founded in response to the 2017 Equifax scandal, in which hackers gained access to the private information of 147 million US citizens. &nbsp;By developing the BloomID, Bloom gave its users the ability to create and control their own digital identities. &nbsp;More recently, with the release of OnRamp, our latest DeFi-focused product, we are securely connecting enterprises to users by offering reusable, verifiable credentials to help enable compliance and risk assessment. &nbsp;This means that your personal information and financial data, used in determining creditworthiness, are available to use on a decentralized platform without sacrificing your privacy. &nbsp;<br></p> Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all with one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>,,Auf meinem Bildschirm sehen Sie sechs Menschen‘‘, sagte Frank Puscher. ,,Einige mögen Ihnen sympathischer sein, andere weniger. Was beachtenswert ist: keiner dieser Menschen existiert in echt.‘‘ Unter diesem Eindruck begann die Vortragsreihe zum Thema: ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘. Am 4. November 2021 luden das BMWi, BMJ und VDE ein, um über exakt dieses Thema virtuell zu diskutieren, Lösungen zu präsentieren, und auf die Fragen der 103 Teilnehmenden einzugehen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der erste Teil der Fachkonferenz begann mit einer Einführung in die Problemstellung: Es ging zum einen um Fake Reviews im Internet, zum anderen um eine Einführung in das Thema Deep Fakes – eine Mischung von Deep Learning und Fakes. Anschließend gab es Impulsvorträge zu der Kernfrage: Wie schützen wir den politischen Diskurs in Zeiten der Aufmerksamkeitsökonomie? Hier wurden die Herausforderungen bei der Regulierung von Deep Fakes herausgestellt und Beispiele aus der Gegenwart. Im zweiten Teil der Konferenz ging es konkret um die Frage: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Impulsvorträge griffen diese Frage von verschiedenen Ansätzen auf und zeigten Ideen für den möglichen Umgang und Regulierungen von Deep Fakes. &nbsp;</p>



 Teil 1: Wie sieht die Problemstellung aus? KI als globaler Trend.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>Ab wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?</p></blockquote>



<p>Künstliche Intelligenz nimmt mehr Raum in Diskursen ein. Ob in der Altenbetreuung, beim Auftritt in Lernvideos oder Beantworten von Kundenfragen, KI Klone werden uns wohl immer häufiger in der nahen Zukunft begegnen. Dabei handelt es sich durchaus nicht um etwas Exotisches: Eingebettet in unsere Gesellschaft handelt es sich um eine Software, die bereits jeder nutzen kann. Ein anschauliches Beispiel verdeutlicht, dass virtuelle KI Klone sogar CO2 sparen könnten. Wenn Prominente ein Double von sich erstellen, könnten sie zur selben Zeit an verschiedenen Orten sein und müssten nicht selbst reisen. Das führt zwangsläufig zu der Kernfrage: Ist das schlimm? Wann ist es schädlich, wenn computergenerierte Inhalte auf uns treffen?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betrachtet man die Rolle von KI in Deutschland fällt zunächst auf: so weit verbreitet wie in anderen Ländern ist es hier nicht. Bereits 2018 benannte eine Studie des Roland-Koch Instituts die USA als führende Nation im Bereich KI. Vom Amazon Go Supermarket, in welchem man ohne Angestellte, Kasse, und Barcode-Scanner einkaufen kann, bis hin zu KI Klonen, die Termine beim Friseur ausmachen: die USA zeigen Ausschnitte einer Welt, die hier noch nicht Realität, aber definitiv Zukunft sein kann (<a href="https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718">https://www.gtai.de/gtai-de/trade/specials/special/usa/entwicklung-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-ist-in-den-usa-bereits-22718</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doch noch ist es hierzulande weniger verbreitet. Auswirkungen von KI gestützter Fakes auf den politischen Diskurs sind überschaubar, dafür im Handel jedoch mehr ausgeprägt. So lässt sich ein Problemfeld von Fake Reviews im Internet deutlich erkennen: Die negativen Folgen von durch Bots kreierter Fake Reviews kreieren die Gefahr, seriöse Anbieter:innen nicht mehr zu erkennen, ein allgemeines Zurückgehen von Vielfalt, und das Abhängen neuerer Plattformen. Wie eine Studie herausstellte, haben 85% aller befragten Händler:innen bereits negative Auswirkungen auf ihre Verkaufszahlen erlebt – durch Fake Reviews. Problematisch hierbei sind vor allem das Fehlen eines Unrechtsbewusstseins und eine effektivere Rechtsdurchsetzung.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Man sieht: die Grenzen zwischen Realität und Künstlicher Intelligenz vermischen. Ebenfalls ist zu erkennen, dass es sich um ein zukünftiges Problem handelt, welches definitiv Auswirkungen annehmen wird. Freilich bringt das Vorteile mit sich, aber jede Münze hat zwei Seiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So fokussierte man sich in der Fachkonferenz auf das mögliche Ausmaß von KI, wenn keine Regulierungen vorliegen. Auch wenn es sich noch um Zukunftsszenarien handelt, sind negative Folgen bereits absehbar. Diese ziehen sich von der individuellen Ebene (Verletzung von Menschenrechten, Psychologischen Folgen), über die Wirtschaftliche Ebene (Versicherungs- oder Steuerbetrug) bis hin zur ganzen Gesellschaft (Verletzung demokratischer Werte). Kompliziert wird es weiterhin, wenn man die Anonymität der Täter:innen bedenkt oder die rechtlichen Herausforderungen. Das Paradox liegt hierbei zwischen Rechten wie Kunstfreiheit und staatlichen Pflichten, nämlich dem Schutz von Persönlichkeitsrechten. Selbstverständlich ist auch das Erkennen von KI Klonen oder automatisierter Bots nicht immer einfach. Als Bot gilt ein Account, der mehr als 50 Tweets pro Tag twittert. In einer vorgestellten Studie wurde ein Twitter Account eines kanadischen Ingenieurs untersucht, der im Durchschnitt über 300 Tweets pro Tag twitterte. Wie allerdings festgestellt wurde, handelte es sich hierbei allerdings nicht um einen automatisierten Account, sondern um einen echten Menschen. Alles sind Herausforderungen, denen die Regierung sich definitiv wird stellen müssen. KI ist ein globaler Trend, der sich weiterentwickelt.&nbsp;</p>



 Teil 2: Wie gelingt eine nachhaltige Lösung? Die Rolle von SSI.&nbsp; 



<blockquote><p>,,Wir stehen hier – wie in vielen anderen Bereichen – Infrastrukturfragen gegenüber. Individuelle Pflichten sind da ein winziger Anteil; der Löwenanteil liegt bei systemischen Veränderungen.‘‘ </p>Irene Adamski</blockquote>



<p>Wie herausgestellt, stellt KI aktuell keine Gefahr da. Diese besteht vorwiegend im Bereich von Fake Reviews im Internet und der Verbreitung gefälschter Inhalte durch KI-Klone. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In der Mitte von Schwierigkeiten liegen die Lösungen. Derlei gibt es einige, und auch Jolocom hat am Donnerstag den von uns verfolgten Ansatz vorstellen dürfen: Selbst-Souveräne Identitäten (SSI) im digitalen Raum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu seinen und ihren Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen. Globale Entwicklungen zeigen den Vorwärts-Trend von KI-Anwendungen. Auch auf EU-Ebene gibt es Ambitionen, digitale Identifikationsnachweise auszugeben. Die eIDAS Verordnung strebt eine digitale Identität an, die von jedem Mitgliedsstaat herausgegeben und von den anderen Mitgliedsstaaten anerkannt werden müssen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es ist wichtig, an der Wurzel des Problems anzusetzen und Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum auszubauen. Dieses Vertrauen kann vor allem durch SSI hergestellt werden.  &nbsp;</p>

Ontology Technical Director, Ning Hu, was invited to participate in the second hardcore technology sharing BeWater Live held by Bewater Community, top developer community of China, sharing content on the theme “From 2D Social Network to 3D Social Network” for technology enthusiasts.  Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, shared her opinion in the article “<a href="https://beincrypto.com/women-and-web-3-0-experts-weigh-in-on-community-and-financial-freedom/">Women and Web 3.0 — Experts Weigh-In On Community and Financial Freedom</a>”, published in BeInCrypto. She said decentralized finance offers more opportunities for authentic creativity and boundary-breaking, and women’s role in the redefinition of what finance is, is&nbsp;key.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>CoinDesk — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/22/why-us-policymakers-should-embrace-web-3/">Why US Policymakers Should Embrace Web&nbsp;3</a></p><blockquote>Big tech has been embroiled in an unending series of controversies over the past decade, ranging from poor stewardship of consumer data and privacy breaches to disinformation and algorithmic bias. But these platforms are now being disrupted and disintermediated by Web3. For instance, decentralization has opened up the possibility of a world in which people can own their data and grant applications permission to use it on a limited basis, rather than having that data littered across hundreds of centralized databases.</blockquote><p>When people talk about Web3, it is often difficult to circumvent a puzzle: how to protect their own identity and privacy data while also being connected with the real world? In order to solve this confusion and to prepare people for the Web3 explosion, Ontology proposed the decentralized digital identity (DID) solution, ONT ID. ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C commendations for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, using blockchain and cryptographic technology, that can quickly identify and connect people, data, and services. It is decentralized, self-sovereign, privacy-preserving, and easy to use, enabling users to fully control their own data and identities.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With v13, View Engine is no longer available, replaced by Ivy. Ivy is the future of Angular applications, and the benefits are tremendous. After initially landing in v12, Ivy paves the way for new feature updates, simplifies existing capabilities, and increases rendering performance.</p>

<p>The way you can now create components dynamically is an example of how this release simplifies existing capabilities. Dynamic components are components loaded at runtime. You might use this when you need to tailor visible components based on responses from a server call. Previously, to dynamically create components, you had to use the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code>. Now the API takes the Component type directly. Let’s look at how this works.</p>

 Set up the Authorization Server 

<p>In my example, I am authenticating using OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect through Okta. In my Okta Authorization Server, I added a custom claim named <code>pet_preference</code> to my identity token. Does this sound only vaguely familiar? Refresh your understanding of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect by reading “<a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2021/10/29/things-to-keep-in-mind-about-auth">The Things to Keep in Mind about Auth</a>”.</p>

<p>With this custom claim, I want to display dynamic components specific to the value. The app uses the claim value to rotate through images of pets that match their preference.</p>

 Prepare the components 

<p>To write something like this, you’ll first create components for the customized views of different pets that all implement the same interface, such as one named <code>PreferenceComponentInterface</code>. The interface has a property named <code>data</code> so you can pass in customized information. You’ll also need to get the <code>pet_preference</code> custom claim value and retrieve content specifically for it. Once you have the data for the preferred pet, you can add the code to create dynamic components.</p>

 Implement the dynamic component creation 

<p>Create a <code>Directive</code> to house the view.</p>

   <code>import { Directive, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appPreference]'
})

export class PreferenceDirective {
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }
}
</code>   

<p>And a container component that handles the dynamic creation of the component. I simplified the code snipped to focus on the v13 change. In an upcoming post, I’ll do a complete walkthrough of creating this application.</p>

   <code>class PreferenceItem {
  component: Type&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;;
  info: any;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-secret-preference',
  template: `&lt;ng-template appPreference&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;`
 })

export class SecretPreferenceComponent implements OnInit {
  @ViewChild(PreferenceDirective, {static: true}) private host!: PreferenceDirective;
  
  private preferences: PreferenceItem[] = [{
    component: MyCustomComponent,
    info: 'example'
  }, {
    component: MyOtherCustomComponent,
    info: {
      isTrue: true
    }
  }];
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {
    const preferredItem = this.preferences[0];
    const compRef = this.host.viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;PreferenceComponentInterface&gt;(preferredItem);
    compRef.instance.data = preferredItem.info;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Notice you didn’t have to inject the <code>ComponentFactoryResolver</code> to do this. The API is more straightforward to use. A more realistic use case might be a custom claim for the department and displaying customized content based on the authenticated user’s department.</p>

 Clean-up after each test 

<p>Testing Angular apps is much improved in v13, and better cleanup of the DOM between tests is the new default. Now, Angular does a better job of cleaning up the DOM, and tests run faster and more performantly with better isolation between tests.</p>

<p>The clean-up behavior is configurable when configuring or resetting the <code>TestBed</code>. Let’s look at an example test where we greet the user after they’ve logged in.</p>

<p>Component code</p>

   <code>@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  template: `
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;Welcome {{name}}!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/ng-container&gt;
  `
})

export class ProfileComponent {
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? 'stranger')
  );

  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Test code</p>

   <code>describe('ProfileComponent', () =&gt; {
  let component: ProfileComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture&lt;ProfileComponent&gt;;

  let authStateSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj&lt;OktaAuthStateService&gt;([], { authState$: of(authState) });

  beforeEach(() =&gt; {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [ ProfileComponent ],
      providers: [
        { provide: OktaAuthStateService, useValue: authStateSpy }
      ],
      teardown: { destroyAfterEach: false } // flakey tests!
    });
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes the user by name', () =&gt; {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
      
    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome Test Name!');
  });

  it('should show text that welcomes a user with no name', () =&gt; {
    (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(authStateSpy, 'authState$')?.get as jasmine.Spy).and.returnValue(of({
      isAuthenticated: true,
      idToken: {...idToken, claims: {sub: 'sub'}}
    }));
      
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProfileComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();

    const spanEl = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('span'));
    expect(spanEl).toBeTruthy();
    expect(spanEl.nativeElement.innerHTML).toEqual('Welcome stranger!');
  });
});
</code>   

<p>We can configure the teardown cleanup in this test suite by changing the value of <code>destroyAfterEach</code>. With this change enabled by default, you have the option of writing new tests with better performance. Plus, you can disable the default for tests that aren’t ready to consume the changes. Angular has our backs on non-breaking updates!</p>

 Enhanced developer tooling 

<p>Creating Angular apps is now easier with developer tooling enhancements and compilation time improvements.</p>

<p>The first thing you might notice is how much faster the build time is. A lot of work went into improving the build time. By adding <a href="https://angular.io/cli/cache">a build cache</a>, the Angular team found build time improvements of up to 65+%!</p>

<p>The Angular Language Service’s tooling improvement to auto-apply optional chaining feels like a small thing but is such an appreciated feature. I can focus on the object property I want to use, and the tooling handles the optional chaining for me!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: The example demo shown above is for demonstration purposes, and exaggerates capabilities to showcase the new feature. Please remember to apply sound software development practices to your real-world applications.</p>

 So long, Internet Explorer! 

<p>In this release, we also say goodbye to Internet Explorer. <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/41840">Dropping Internet Explorer support</a> means lots of doors open up for new features, refactoring the code base, and keeping up with security best practices. With extra polyfills, you can use Okta’s Auth JS library in Internet Explorer, but the recommendation is to migrate away from it.</p>

 All the Angular v13 details 

<p>These are the features that I found most interesting, but there are lots more in Angular v13! You can read more about them in the <a href="https://blog.angular.io/angular-v13-is-now-available-cce66f7bc296">Angular team’s blog post</a>. You can read about the changes in the new version of <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-4/">TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://rxjs.dev/6-to-7-change-summary">RxJS</a>.</p>

 Upcoming changes 

<p>Angular keeps improving and growing. The <a href="https://angular.io/guide/roadmap">subsequent releases</a> should prove exciting, with features such as strict typing for forms and standalone components in the works.</p>

<p>Due to the ID-Wallet project in Germany, some articles and comments have equated Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) with blockchain technology in the last few weeks. The impression is given that SSI only works in conjunction with a blockchain. Spoiler, that’s not the case.<br>In the following, I will try to explain why this is not the case in a simplified way.</p>



<p><br>The term blockchain is used in this article to represent all Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). Including all public blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, permissioned / public and permissioned / private Blockchains.</p>



<p>What does decentralized mean in Decentralized Digital Identities (aka SSI)?</p>



<p>The “decentralized” doesn’t refer to Blockchains. Decentralized means that a person’s data is stored with the person and is under their control. Most of the time, the information is stored on the smartphone, on a so-called wallet. An SSI wallet also has nothing to do with storing cryptocurrencies. Conventional Digital Identity systems store the data and information centrally on the server of the provider.</p>



<p>Private and public key, what is it?</p>



<p>SSI is only possible due to cryptography. One of the cornerstones is asymmetric encryption. A key pair is generated using a cryptographic method. The key pair consists of a public and a private key. As the names suggest, the private key must remain private, and the public key can be shared with the broader public You can do two things with the key pair:</p>



  You can encrypt a message. <br>Encryption is done with the public key and decryption with the private one.  You can sign a file. <br>The signature is made with the private key, and the signature is verified with the public key.  



<p>The signature function is essential for further explanation.</p>



<p>SSI and digital signatures.</p>



<p>In an SSI system, an issuer generates the data (e.g. a driver’s licence), digitally signs it and transfers it to the holder. The holder can send the signed data or only parts of it to a verifier. The verifier can use the issuer’s public key to check the authenticity of the data.</p>



<p>How does the verifier get the public key?</p>



<p>For the verifier to be able to check the data, he needs the issuer’s public key. But how does he get it? In conventional systems, such as SSL certificates, a central point is contacted. Our browser asks a registration authority whether the website’s certificate is registered. In this way, our browser ensures that we are not on a fake page. The disadvantage is that the process depends on a central service and collects information about the activities.</p>



<p>Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain.</p>



<p>A Blockchain can be used to store and query the public key. It should be emphasized that the Blockchain alone does not provide any security whether the stored key comes from the specified issuer. It must be guaranteed that the issuer is who he claims to be. This cannot be achieved by technology alone. In addition, organizational and process specifications must be defined. This is called governance or a trust framework. But this is a different topic and would go beyond the scope of this article.<br>The theoretical advantage of a Blockchain is that it is decentralized, and theoretically, every verifier can keep a copy of a Blockchain node, ensuring that he does not have to contact a central service. In reality, however, the query is usually made by a central service that itself operates a node and provides the information.</p>



<p>Can other storage locations than Blockchains be used for the public keys?</p>



<p>Yes, you can. It would even be possible to use existing PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures). It only has to be ensured that privacy of the holder is ensured and that no third party receives information about the use of the data. Another aspect is the dependence on a central service. If this stops the service or deletes individual keys, the key cannot be verified anymore. These aspects must be taken into account in the design of a trust framework. Here again, decentralized technologies could be helpful …</p>



<p>The following graphic shows an example in which 2 documents from 2 different exhibitors are checked by one auditor. The first issuer, in this case, a bank, uses a Blockchain network to store the public key. The second issuer, an authority, uses an existing PKI.</p>



For a bigger picture, <a href="http://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/process_EN.png">click here</a>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>In the past two years, the SSI community has emancipated itself from Blockchain technology. It has been recognized that a Blockchain is not necessarily a prerequisite for realizing Self Sovereign Identity. And there is not “the one” Blockchain network on which an SSI system has to be built. It doesn’t matter which one, as long as it meets security and operational standards.<br>It is also difficult for authorities, for example, to abandon their current PKI implementations. Furthermore, it can therefore make sense to use existing PKIs.</p>



<p>Jolocom considers these requirements and develops its next generation of SSI technology independent of the underlying storage, PKI or Blockchain networks. Any storage location can be linked.<br>More important than the technology used is the definition of the organization and the processes so that a secure PKI and the highest level of privacy is guaranteed for the citizens.</p>

 The <a href="https://shyftfederation.com/federation">Shyft Node Federation</a>, consisting of all validators for the Shyft Network, publicly signed off on voting guidelines and node rights and responsibilities. <p>It’s official: <a href="https://coinshares.com/">CoinShares</a>, <a href="https://www.maven11.com/">Maven11</a>, Fabric, ClicketyClack, Connect Capital, AD Node, <a href="https://stakingteam.com/">Staking Team</a>, Merkle Trading, <a href="https://blockunity.com/">BlockUnity</a>, Paycase Financial, <a href="https://defi.tech/">DeFi Technologies</a>, Mempool Partners, Nodebased, NP IR, among others, have signed off on the <a href="https://shyftfederation.com/docs/shyft-federation-constitution.pdf">Shyft Node Federation Constitution</a> — the guidelines for node governance of Shyft Network. The Constitution outlines responsibilities, voting guidelines, and ground rules that enable improvement protocols and a framework for new nodes to enter the Network. The Federation Constitution is also a resource for the Shyft Network community to stay informed on the rules that guide the Network and federation members’ expected duties and responsibilities for the months&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>The Federation Constitution details the current rights, duties, penalties, and authorities for members. Members can seal transactions as a Validator on the Chain upon signing of the Constitution, with each validator entitled to one vote per matter, including the option to propose additions or amendments to the Constitution. Additionally, members have the right to verify current network configurations and performance. As incentivization for their duties, members will receive SHFT for their performance at a rate of 7 SHFT per block&nbsp;sealed.</p><p>The Constitution also outlines Federation duties regarding commitment to ensuring the security of the Chain and individual Node Operations. Federation members agree to sealing blocks, remaining online, and deploying critical security-related software updates upon signing. Federation members also must generate applications, onboard new users, and support ongoing use cases that leverage the Chain. Members are also required to uphold the common good of the Federation through their public messaging activity, with specific guidelines around the release of financial advice in public forums. Additional duties outline governance participation for members pertaining to the potential risk of removal, notification of validator transfer, and confidentiality agreements. If Federation members fail to uphold their duties, the Constitution specifies penalties, including Member review and potential loss of&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The Federation must adhere to a common set of principles to execute on the mechanics agreed upon by the supermajority of its members. Principles include managing DAO mechanics in existing smart contract and on-chain voting systems, addition and/or removal of Validator keys (with specific voting parameters), and specifications on proposed changes, if applicable, to protocol code on Github. In closing, the Constitution outlines potential Amendments to the Constitution, including guidance on proposal endorsements, review/committal timelines for amendments, and voting necessities for the passing or failure of suggested amendments.</p><p>By making these rules, guidelines, penalties, and opportunities public, Shyft Network is implementing a more transparent and trustworthy environment for Federation members to navigate and capitalize on their obligations and opportunities. As an innovative public constitution focused on building Proof-of-authority (PoA) in blockchain, Shyft Network is creating opportunities for Federation members to become successful validators by incentivizing good participation through the attachment of reputation to identity a sector. As a more secure and robust alternative than PoS (proof-of-stake) when considering the distribution of trust across private and public networks, the guidelines in the Constitution create the best possible framework for Federation Members to uphold their duties for the betterment of the Network and their own position.</p><p>The entire Shyft Network team would like to recognize and express gratitude to the entire Node Federation member network, who, upon signing this Constitution, demonstrate their commitment to the highest level of trust in blockchain, our Network, and community.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out the Federation Website (<a href="https://shyftfederation.com/federation">The Federation | Shyft Federation</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/fMMeQ9ck">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

 GiD Report#185 — What the future of identity looks&nbsp;like <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-184-every-company-is-an-identity-company-4422ca3f3ccb">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The future of identity will be portable and decentralized  Why we should care about our&nbsp;data  Cartoon of the week — Metaverse edition  Tweet of the week — What constitutes ownership?  Stuff happens   1. The future of identity will be portable and decentralized <p>This week, we’ve got a great long read via <a href="http://global.id/toddjcollins">/toddjcollins </a>— <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">an in-depth piece by Kei Kreutler analyzing the state of digital identity and where it might go in the context of&nbsp;web3</a>:</p><blockquote>Whether it’s the enforcement of legal identities, platform lock-in, or more implicit social norms, the logic of individualized identity was baked into web 2.0. With the advent of web 3.0, we have a chance to do things differently. Ultimately, web 3.0 identity will revolve around questions of privacy, portability, and ownership. Beyond such clearly contentious issues, we still have the ability to imagine more, with a reinvigorated array of tools in our hands for thinking through identity. One of these tools is multi-signature accounts, which are accounts that can provide identity collections for individuals, groups, or organizations. Embracing more than the normative individual as a fundamental unit of account, such a paradigm could better serve the creation of resilient, accountable, and mutualistic institutions leading into the twenty-first century.</blockquote><p>Kreutler covers everything from SSI to DIDs to NFTs to DAOs. If those terms don’t make a ton of sense to you, then <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">you’ve found yourself some productive evening reading</a>. Notably, Kreutler believes that smart, interoperable identity will underpin the so-called Metaverse — which got a big bump in relevance recently with Facebook’s branding and strategic pivot.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://avc.com/2021/10/web3-vs-web2/">Web3 vs Web2 — AVC</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewharris/2021/10/22/a-complete-revolution/">The Future Of Money: A Complete Revolution</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-files-to-sell-digital-sneakers-as-it-seeks-downloadable-kicks-11635873070">Nike Files to Sell Digital Sneakers, as It Seeks Downloadable Kicks</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-papers-show-a-company-locked-in-zuckerbergs-stranglehold">Facebook Papers Show a Company Locked in Zuckerberg’s Stranglehold</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/mythical-games-hits-unicorn-status-with-150m-round/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Mythical Games Hits Unicorn Status with $150M Round — Blockworks</a>   2. Why we should care about our&nbsp;data <p>First up, Facebook is ditching its facial recognition program, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-shut-down-facial-recognition-in-photos-videos-11635874174?mod=djem10point">the WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook said it is shutting down its facial-recognition system in the coming weeks, scrapping a feature that has developed into a key tool for sharing photos on social media but has raised concerns among privacy advocates and regulators.</blockquote><blockquote>The move continues a dramatic reshaping of the tech giant in recent weeks, which includes pausing the development of an Instagram for children product and a rebranding of the entire company to Meta Platforms Inc. to focus on a future beyond social&nbsp;media.</blockquote><blockquote>People who have opted into facial-recognition service will no longer be automatically recognized in video and photo content, according to Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at Meta, formerly Facebook Inc. He said the social-media platform would also delete data related to the faces of more than one billion&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>In related news, Australia is pretty much done with Clearview AI, ordering them to delete all data belonging to Australians, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete">the Verge&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>Controversial facial recognition firm Clearview AI has been ordered to destroy all images and facial templates belonging to individuals living in Australia by the country’s national privacy regulator.</blockquote><blockquote>Clearview, which claims to have scraped 10 billion images of people from social media sites in order to identify them in other photos, sells its technology to law enforcement agencies. It was trialled by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) between October 2019 and March&nbsp;2020.</blockquote><blockquote>Now, following an investigation, Australia privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), has found that the company breached citizens’ privacy. “The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair,” said OAIC privacy commissioner Angelene Falk in a press statement. “It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.”</blockquote><p>This one is a bit stickier and goes to the heart of the debate around what constitutes public data — and if that data is public, shouldn’t it be accessible by&nbsp;anyone?</p><p>If you accept that to be true, it speaks toward individual responsibility around privacy and oversharing. Our personal data is incredibly important and we should probably think twice before offering it to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-shut-down-facial-recognition-in-photos-videos-11635874174?mod=djem10point">Facebook to Shut Down Facial Recognition in Photos,&nbsp;Videos</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete">Clearview AI ordered to delete all facial recognition data belonging to Australians</a>   3. Cartoon of the week — Metaverse edition <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVvvHVHMAvI/">The Economist</a>:</p> 4. Tweet of the week — What constitutes ownership? <p>As much as blockchain maximalists might have you believe, a private key does not necessarily constitute ownership. We’re human beings living in a society under the rule of law. If someone’s car keys fall out of their pocket at the park and you pick them up, you don’t suddenly own their car. All you have are someone else’s car&nbsp;keys.</p><p>We saw this play out in the world of NFTs last week when <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinbecerra/status/1454328591202721796">three of Calvin Becerra’s Bored Apes were&nbsp;stolen</a>:</p><p>Of course, just because something you own was stolen doesn’t mean they aren’t still yours — though, apparently, this is a contentious issue to&nbsp;some:</p><p>As it played out, the community disagreed. Major NFT exchanges including OpenSea pledged to lock the NFTs making it impossible for the thieves to cash&nbsp;out.</p><p>This story has a happy ending — eventually, all three Bored Apes were <a href="https://twitter.com/calvinbecerra/status/1457725639344021522">returned to their rightful owner</a>.

They’re the latest in a line of such projects that dates back to CryptoPunks and Crypto Kitties, both of which launched in&nbsp;2017.</blockquote>  What they’re saying: “The project’s name, Bored Ape Yacht Club, represents a club for people who got rich quick by ‘aping in’ — crypto slang for investing big in something unsure — and, thusly, are too bored to do anything but create memes,” writes Rolling Stone’s Samantha&nbsp;Hissong.  <blockquote>By the numbers: Bored apes have gone from nothing to a billion-dollar ecosystem in less than a year, with one ape selling for $3.4 million at Sotheby’s.</blockquote>  The 277-year-old auction house called its image “an NFT with historical significance,” on the grounds that only 100 apes have gold&nbsp;fur.  <p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bayc-bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-interview-1250461/">How Four NFT Novices Created a Billion-Dollar Ecosystem of Cartoon&nbsp;Apes</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/04/fc-barcelona-joins-nft-rush-with-moments-from-122-years-of-history/">FC Barcelona Joins NFT Rush With Moments From 122 Years of&nbsp;History</a>   5.

Description: This week we welcome Kevin Sellers, our Chief Marketing Officer here at Ping Identity. When he’s not traveling the world, Kevin is leading the charge of our marketing efforts to be sure Ping is connecting with its users and championing truth, trust, and identity. Kevin talks about his transition from Intel into the identity space and what he’s learned, why partnering with Terry Crews was great for the brand, and his tips for brands looking to stand out and convey their uniqueness. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [3:00] Kevin talks about what he learned at Intel Inside about creating an emotional response and teaching consumers to think not only about what it is they are buying, but what goes inside, how it’s made, and how this makes a difference. [5:14] The identity world now can look like what Kevin calls the “sea of sameness.”Everyone talks about being the trusted solution. How does Ping Identity stand out and convey its specialties and uniqueness? [5:45] In this digital-first world, we must understand who it is that we are engaging with, and that means truly knowing your identity and how it matters. [8:25] Identity is the foundation of all commerce. Kevin shares how brands can position themselves in a way that shows their unique value. [9:11] What is the differentiator for Ping? Kevin first talks about knowing the soul of the company, which is a combination of mission, culture, leadership, and values, and also strategy. [11:19] Ping Identity helps its users become champions, which is more of an emotional place where the team can position capability through more of an outcome orientation than a feature or rational product-based orientation. [12:50] How did Terry Crews come to be involved with Ping Identity, how did it help the brand, and what makes Terry so cool to work with as the Chief Identity Champion? How can brands decide if working with a spokesperson is right for them? [21:42] Our identity is like a fingerprint; it is unique to us and cannot be copied. Our credentials can, but our identity is unlike anyone else’s, and that is why it is  the foundation of any digital transformation.  [23:08]The evolution that was eye-opening to Kevin was how important and central identity and access management really is.   &nbsp; Quotes:    “There’s what you want to be for the market, and then what you are. Part of the journey is to really do a discovery of the soul of the company.”—Kevin   “Most people will listen to and engage with a message from a trusted person talking about a brand, far more than they do a brand talking about a brand.”—Kevin   “Be true to your soul, be true to who you are, tell the story well, and you’ll find that that marketing is actually a pretty cool thing. And it actually can make a difference in the trajectory of your company’s success.”—Kevin    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity KevinSellers TerryCrews

  <p>Ransomware Attacks have become the biggest single cyber risk for enterprises of any size and industry. Current surveys and KuppingerCole´s own research indicate a steep rise not only in the number of attacks, but as well in the average damage &nbsp;per incident. The dark side of digital is industrializing itself, turning ransomware into big business The question is no longer if and when your organization will be attacked, but whether and how successful the attackers will be. “Sophisticated recent ransomware attacks are fully aware of standard backup strategies and corrupt or destroy your one and only option to recover without paying the ransom.” says KuppingerCole´s Cybersecurity Lead Christopher Schütze. &nbsp;“The complexity of today´s multicloud environments require more than traditional backup &amp; restore approaches” he continues.</p>
<p>In this workshop, we will provide you with an overview on the pillars of a proactively resiliient IT Infrastructure. Starting with an individual ransomware resilience assessment, each participant will (individually and anonymously) benchmark the resilience of her organization against ransomware attacks, relative to the average value of the whole group that conducted the assessment. The key topics of this workshop will be:</p>
 
 The state of ransomware, from a business and a technical perspective 
 The ransomware attack surface&nbsp; 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Preparation&nbsp; 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Protection 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Response&nbsp; 
 Ransomware Resiliency Essentials: Recovery&nbsp; 
 Your individual ransomware risk and what to do now

<p>After three years of research and development, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> secured a Kusama parachain slot and launched mainnet in September 2021, and is now in the last phase before decentralisation. Part of this final stage is to ensure that the KILT blockchain is resilient to hacker attacks and to get an overview of potential weaknesses in order to fix them before the network is decentralised. To achieve this, BOTLabs GmbH, the entity behind KILT Protocol, engaged Security Research Labs (SRLabs) to perform a security&nbsp;audit.</p> The Auditor <p><a href="https://www.srlabs.de/">SRLabs</a> is a cybersecurity consultancy and hacking research collective striving to make the world more secure. BOTLabs selected them for their <a href="https://www.srlabs.de/bites/blockchain-security-best-practices-for-your-next-review">methodological approach</a> and <a href="https://www.srlabs.de/bites/blockchain-security-six-common-mistakes-found-in-substate-chains">extensive experience</a> in auditing Kusama, Polkadot, Substrate-based chains, and many networks in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> Audit Scope <p>The aim of the security audit was to assess the KILT Protocol with regards to its resilience to hacking attempts and to get an overview of the most relevant weaknesses in order to fix them before the launch of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We engaged SRLabs to perform audits&nbsp;of:</p>  The KILT Blockchain  The KILT Software Development Kit (SDK), which enables an easy way for developers and third parties to build applications on the top of KILT&nbsp;Protocol  The Sporran Wallet, a browser extension which in its current version can receive, hold and send KILT Coins; soon it will also be used to manage KILT credentials.  <p>In order to effectively review the KILT codebase, SRLabs employed a threat model-driven code review strategy. For each identified threat, hypothetical attacks that can be used to realise the threat were developed. Prioritising by risk, the codebase or relevant pallets was assessed for existing protections against respective threats and attacks, as well as the vulnerabilities that make these attacks possible.</p><p>Karsten Nohl, SRLabs’ founder, adds: “Every blockchain system comes with new security challenges due to the unique business logic and implementation. Starting from threat modeling enables our testers to focus attention on the most promising hacking avenues. The collaboration with BOTLabs on securing KILT Protocol worked really&nbsp;well.”</p> Audit Results <p>During the audit, SRLabs identified eight issues including two with a high severity. These two issues were found in the areas of staking and were resolved by the KILT development team with the first runtime upgrade. The remaining six issues affecting the area of KILT functionality with a severity of moderate to low were fixed by the KILT development team in a subsequent runtime upgrade, in advance of full decentralisation and the availability of the KILT functionality.</p><p>“We selected SRLabs for their experience with top projects in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. We appreciated their methodological and collaborative approach, and plan additional audits with SRLabs as we continuously evaluate KILT Protocol security,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-protocol-completes-security-audit-with-srlabs-4d7130212cbd">KILT Protocol Completes Security Audit with SRLabs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Organizations across the world are plagued by limited visibility of privileged accounts, users, and credentials. This creates a host of security and auditability issues, with former employees retaining access to sensitive information - a dangerous backdoor for attackers. As organizations accelerate towards the cloud, it is critical to have a strategic privileged access approach in place to ensure secure onboarding and management of new privileged accounts at scale.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 11th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealAbyss">Andrey Sher</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyRussian">Russian community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I learned about Ontology shortly after its founding in 2017. Ontology had a fresh take on Web3 and brought its own, new and unique product suite. Namely, the management and protection of user online identities and&nbsp;data.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I like the idea of ​​Ontology and its future prospects; renting cars, devices, real estate, and the ability to provide these services without an intermediary. I like their range of services very&nbsp;much.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I see an opportunity to help show people how their data is managed and controlled online! Once people realize how little control they currently have over their data, Ontology’s decentralized identity and data solutions become very attractive.</p><p>I like to be the first to receive information. And the opportunity to do what I like, which is helping people! Although, I began doing this long before I became Harbinger.</p> 4. Why is it important to you to be a part of the Ontology community? <p>I am very close to the ideas and goals of Ontology. I want to be at the forefront of decentralized identity adoption.</p> 5. How is the Ontology community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Our community is similar to other crypto communities in certain respects. However, one thing that stands out to me is that people who come to Ontology become loyal supporters forever.</p> 6. What do you use as your main channels for interacting with the Ontology community and why? Do you want to see&nbsp;more? <p>Most often I use Telegram, but I also actively communicate through other social networks on cryptocurrency channels. There are a lot of people in these groups and you can get new ideas and information, as well as help people learn more about Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share an unforgettable experience or something you learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a journalist? <p>There is access to the admin chat. There, the admins turn to each other for help and if you closely follow everything, then later, you won’t even need to ask, you will know a lot of subtleties. I would like to highlight DuMonT, he is a real pro and responds very&nbsp;quickly!</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Innovative, thoughtful, impactful.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology can expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less? What kinds of things do you see community members doing that you think have helped our community grow? <p>Of course, the first is advertising and cooperation with companies and the integration of ONT ID. The creation of new applications, especially related to GameFi, is also important. The community should share and recommend Ontology on social media and messenger apps.</p> 10. What do you see as key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help achieve&nbsp;them? <p>Ontology has a great future. I believe the project will continue to grow and improve. The sky’s the&nbsp;limit!</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>When you communicate with a Kubernetes cluster, using kubectl, or a client library, or a tool like <a href="https://kdash.cli.rs/">KDash</a>, you are primarily interacting with the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/">Kubernetes API server</a>.

 Why secure the API server? 

<p>The API server has multiple layers of security. By default, all communication with the API server uses TLS. Authentication is done using service account tokens, bearer tokens, basic authentication, a proxy, or client certificates, depending on the platform. In the case of PaaS like Amazon EKS, AKS, and GKE, it can also be done using custom authentication mechanisms. Once a request is authenticated, the API server can use one of several authorization mechanisms, like Attribute-based access control (ABAC) or Role-based access control (RBAC), to control access to resources. And finally, there are also admission control modules that can be configured to control resource modifications.</p>

<p>Since the API server is the only part of the Kubernetes cluster that a client can access, it is essential to secure the API server. Unauthorized access to the API server can lead to hijacking of the entire cluster, which also lets an attacker access all secrets and data accessible to the services running on it. Hence, configuring users and roles properly is a must to secure the cluster, especially in organizations where more than one user can access the cluster.</p>

 Why OpenID Connect? 

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/">OpenID Connect</a> is an authentication standard built on top of OAuth 2.0. It adds an additional token called an ID token. OpenID Connect also standardizes areas that OAuth 2.0 leaves open to choice, such as scopes, endpoint discovery, and dynamic registration of clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the default authentication mechanism of the Kubernetes API server might be enough for simple use cases, where only a handful of people manage the cluster, it does not scale for bigger organizations. Also, the default is definitely not the most secure way, because Kubernetes does not handle user management and expects it to be done outside. This is where OpenID Connect (OIDC) comes in. OIDC can manage users and groups, which works very well with the Kubernetes RBAC to provide very granular control of who can access what inside a cluster.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With an OIDC integration, you can use the same OIDC provider used for SSO in your existing infrastructure to access your Kubernetes cluster, like Okta or Keycloak.</p>

 Use Okta as an OIDC provider to secure the API server 

<blockquote>
  <p>Okta provides cloud software that helps companies manage and secure user authentication into applications and enables developers to build identity controls into applications, websites, web services, and devices. Okta is a certified OpenID Connect provider.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us see how we can secure the Kubernetes API server using Okta as an OIDC provider and use RBAC to control access from the Okta Admin Console. If you are using Amazon EKS, check out this <a>tutorial for using Okta OIDC with EKS</a>.</p>

 What you’ll need to get started 

<p>Before you try this out, make sure you have access to the following.</p>

 
   An Okta account. You can sign up for a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">free Okta account</a>. Or, you can use another OIDC provider or <a href="https://github.com/dexidp/dex">Dex</a>, and the steps should be similar. 
   A Kubernetes cluster. I’m using <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a> to run a local <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> cluster. You can use any Kubernetes distribution, including managed PaaS like Amazon EKS, AKS, and GKE, and so on. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a> installed on your machine. 
   <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli">Terraform</a> installed on your machine. This is not required if you do the Okta configuration via the <a href="https://login.okta.com/">Okta Admin Console</a> GUI. 
 

 Set up an Okta OIDC application and authorization server 

<p>You can achieve OIDC login for the cluster by creating a simple OIDC application with Okta either using the Okta CLI or the Admin Console. But with an OIDC application alone, you would have to use the client secret to authenticate from kubectl or any other client library. Authenticating with the client secret does not scale and is not better than default k8s authentication mechanisms, as you won’t have granular controls over users and roles. For a more helpful setup, we need an OIDC application and an authorization server with customized claims and policies for Kubernetes. This way, we can use Okta to manage users and permissions as well.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to set up an OIDC application and authorization server in Okta. If you prefer to do this via a GUI, then follow the steps in the <a>**Configure Your Okta Org ** section</a> of the article mentioned earlier, to do it via the Okta Admin Console.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will use Terraform to configure the Okta part so that you can reuse the code for any automation required. Let’s dive into each step needed.</p>

 Set up Terraform 

<p>You can find the complete Terraform source code for this article in this <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-k8s-oidc-terraform-example">GitHub repo</a></p>

<p>First, we need to configure the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Okta Terraform provider</a>. Create a new Terraform file, let’s say <code>okta.main.tf</code>, and add the following:</p>

   <code>variable "base_url" {
  description = "The Okta base URL. Example: okta.com, oktapreview.com, etc. This is the domain part of your Okta org URL"
}
variable "org_name" {
  description = "The Okta org name. This is the part before the domain in your Okta org URL"
}
variable "api_token" {
  type        = string
  description = "The Okta API token, this will be read from environment variable (TF_VAR_api_token) for security"
  sensitive   = true
}

# Enable and configure the Okta provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    okta = {
      source  = "okta/okta"
      version = "~&gt; 3.15"
    }
  }
}

provider "okta" {
  org_name  = var.org_name
  base_url  = var.base_url
  api_token = var.api_token
}
</code>   

<p>You need to provide the input variables <code>org_name</code>, <code>base_url</code>, and <code>api_token</code>. Update these values in a file named <code>okta.config.auto.tfvars</code>. The <code>.auto</code> in the name is important; otherwise, Terraform will not pick it up automatically. For example, if the address of your Okta instance is <code>dev-1234.okta.com</code>, then your <code>org_name</code> would be <code>dev-1234</code>, and <code>base_url</code> would be everything that comes after the org name (e.g., okta.com).</p>

<p>Next, you will need to generate the <code>api_token</code> value. Log in to your Okta administrator console as a superuser and select Security &gt; API &gt; Tokens (Tab) from the navigation menu. Next, click the Create Token button, give your token a name, click Create Token, and copy the newly generated token. Save this in a separate <code>secret.auto.tfvars</code> file excluded from Git or in an environment variable named <code>TF_VAR_api_token</code>.</p>

<p>The Okta provider is now configured and ready to go.</p>

 Create groups 

<p>Now we need some groups to differentiate and map different kinds of users who want to access our clusters. Let’s say we have a group of administrators with full access to the cluster and another group of users who have limited access. You can have any number of groups as per your needs. The configuration below will create two groups. The group’s privileges will be defined using Kubernetes RBAC policies on the cluster, which we will do later.</p>

   <code># Set up OKTA groups
resource "okta_group" "k8s_admin" {
  name        = "k8s-admins"
  description = "Users who can access k8s cluster as admins"
}

resource "okta_group" "k8s_restricted_users" {
  name        = "k8s-restricted-users"
  description = "Users who can only view pods and services in default namespace"
}
</code>   

 Assign users to the groups 

<p>The below snippet looks up existing users and adds them to the groups. You can add any number of users at this stage, or you can skip adding users and do it via the Okta Admin Console later. For this exercise, I’m fetching existing users. You could also create new users using the <code>okta_user</code> resource.</p>

   <code># Assign users to the groups
data "okta_user" "admin" {
  search {
    name  = "profile.email"
    value = "&lt;your_admin_user_email&gt;"
  }
}

resource "okta_group_memberships" "admin_user" {
  group_id = okta_group.k8s_admin.id
  users = [
    data.okta_user.admin.id
  ]
}

data "okta_user" "restricted_user" {
  search {
    name  = "profile.email"
    value = "&lt;another_user_email&gt;"
  }
}

resource "okta_group_memberships" "restricted_user" {
  group_id = okta_group.k8s_restricted_users.id
  users = [
    data.okta_user.restricted_user.id
  ]
}
</code>   

 Create an OIDC application 

<p>Now that our groups are in place, let’s create an OIDC application. We will set the application type to <code>native</code> and use PKCE as client authentication, which is much more secure than using a client secret. We will also set the redirect URIs to <code>localhost:8000</code> so that we can work with kubectl locally. We should also assign the groups we created earlier to this application here. Finally, we can capture the client ID of the created app using an output variable.</p>

   <code># Create an OIDC application

resource "okta_app_oauth" "k8s_oidc" {
  label                      = "k8s OIDC"
  type                       = "native" # this is important
  token_endpoint_auth_method = "none"   # this sets the client authentication to PKCE
  grant_types = [
    "authorization_code"
  ]
  response_types = ["code"]
  redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
  ]
  post_logout_redirect_uris = [
    "http://localhost:8000",
  ]
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [groups]
  }
}

# Assign groups to the OIDC application
resource "okta_app_group_assignments" "k8s_oidc_group" {
  app_id = okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.id
  group {
    id = okta_group.k8s_admin.id
  }
  group {
    id = okta_group.k8s_restricted_users.id
  }
}

output "k8s_oidc_client_id" {
  value = okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.client_id
}
</code>   

 Create an authorization server 

<p>Next, we need an authorization server so that we can define policies and claims. We will also capture the issuer URL in an output variable.</p>

   <code># Create an authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server" "oidc_auth_server" {
  name      = "k8s-auth"
  audiences = ["http:://localhost:8000"]
}

output "k8s_oidc_issuer_url" {
  value = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.issuer
}
</code>   

 Add claims to the authorization server 

<p>Let’s add a claim to the authorization server to add the user’s groups in the <code>id_token</code> when they authenticate. We will need this to do RBAC at the Kubernetes side. Also, note that we are only adding groups with the prefix <code>k8s-</code> to the claim. This is to avoid adding groups that are not related to Kubernetes.</p>

   <code># Add claims to the authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server_claim" "auth_claim" {
  name                    = "groups"
  auth_server_id          = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  always_include_in_token = true
  claim_type              = "IDENTITY"
  group_filter_type       = "STARTS_WITH"
  value                   = "k8s-"
  value_type              = "GROUPS"
}
</code>   

 Add policy and rule to the authorization server 

<p>Now we need to create policies and rules for the authorization server. The below policy defines which OIDC applications it will be assigned to. Then we create a rule for the policy that will define the PKCE tokens lifetime and refresh interval. For this, we are leaving the values at default, which is 1 hour lifetime and unlimited refresh interval, but you can change them as per your needs.</p>

   <code># Add policy and rules to the authorization server

resource "okta_auth_server_policy" "auth_policy" {
  name             = "k8s_policy"
  auth_server_id   = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  description      = "Policy for allowed clients"
  priority         = 1
  client_whitelist = [okta_app_oauth.k8s_oidc.id]
}

resource "okta_auth_server_policy_rule" "auth_policy_rule" {
  name           = "AuthCode + PKCE"
  auth_server_id = okta_auth_server.oidc_auth_server.id
  policy_id      = okta_auth_server_policy.auth_policy.id
  priority       = 1
  grant_type_whitelist = [
    "authorization_code"
  ]
  scope_whitelist = ["*"]
  group_whitelist = ["EVERYONE"]
}
</code>   

 Create the Okta configurations using Terraform 

<p>Now that the Terraform code is ready, let’s apply it. First, run <code>terraform plan</code> to see the changes that will be made. Verify that the changes proposed by the <code>plan</code> make the changes you wanted, on the resources that you intended to modify. Then run <code>terraform apply</code> and type <code>yes</code> to apply the changes. You should see an output similar to this. You can also log in to the Okta Admin Console to verify the changes.</p>

<p>Copy the output values as we will need them for the next steps.</p>

   <code>okta_group.k8s_admin: Creating...

</code>   

<p>You can run <code>terraform destroy</code> to revert the changes if required.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TIP: You can use the <code>terraform import &lt;resource_name.id&gt;</code> command to import data and configuration from your Okta instance. Refer to <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">these Okta Terraform provider docs</a> for more information.</p>
</blockquote>

 Preparing the cluster for OIDC 

<p>Now we need to prepare the cluster to work with OIDC. For this, we need to update the API server flags below:</p>

 
   <code>oidc-issuer-url</code>: This will be your issuer URL from the Okta authorization server 
   <code>oidc-client-id</code>: This is the client ID from the Okta OIDC application 
   <code>oidc-username-claim</code>: This is the claim that will be used to identify the user. In this case, it is <code>email</code>. 
   <code>oidc-groups-claim</code>: This is the claim that will be used to identify the groups. In this case, it is <code>groups</code>. 
   <code>oidc-ca-file</code>: This is the CA file that is used to validate the OIDC server. If you are using Okta as an OIDC provider, then you don’t need to set this. 
 

<p>NOTE: If you encounter an issue where OIDC groups/users collide with Kubernetes groups/users, you can set <code>oidc-groups-prefix</code> and <code>oidc-username-prefix</code> flags as well.</p>

<p>Flags can be set when creating the cluster or by patching the API server via SSH, as described below.</p>

 Create a cluster with OIDC enabled 

<p>Here is how you can create a new k8s cluster with OIDC enabled using different tools. Execute the command for the tool you’re using. Make sure to replace <code>&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;</code> with values from the output of the Terraform step. For any other tools, refer to their documentation on how to update API server flags.</p>

 kubeadmn 

<p>If you are using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadmn</a>, add the following flags to the cluster configuration and pass them to <code>kubeadm init</code> command.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    oidc-issuer-url: &lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;
    oidc-client-id: &lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
    oidc-username-claim: email
    oidc-groups-claim: groups
</code>   

 kOps 

<p>For <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kOps</a>, create a cluster with the required config. For example, the code below will create a cluster in AWS.</p>

   <code>kops create cluster \
 --authorization RBAC \
 --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
 --cloud aws \
 --state $S3_STATE_STORE
</code>   

<p>Now edit the cluster config and add OIDC data.</p>

   <code>kops edit cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --state $S3_STATE_STORE
</code>   

<p>Add this YAML to the <code>kubeAPIServer</code> spec.</p>

   <code>kubeAPIServer:
  authorizationRbacSuperUser: admin
  oidcIssuerURL: &lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;
  oidcClientID: &lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
  oidcUsernameClaim: email
  oidcGroupsClaim: groups
</code>   

 k3d 

<p>To create a <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> cluster using <a href="https://k3d.io/">k3d</a>, run the following command.</p>

   <code># k3d v5.0.0+
k3d cluster create $CLUSTER_NAME \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-username-claim=email@server:0" \
--k3s-arg "--kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-groups-claim=groups@server:0"
</code>   

 Updating an existing cluster to enable OIDC 

<p>If you already have an existing cluster, you can SSH into it using the root user and patch the API server with the following command.</p>

   <code>ssh root@master-node-ip

sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml

...
    command:
    - /hyperkube
    - apiserver
    - --advertise-address=x.x.x.x
...

    - --oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt; # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-username-claim=email # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
    - --oidc-groups-claim=groups # &lt;-- 🔴 update this
...
</code>   

<p>If you are using a managed service like <a>EKS</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/oidc#enabling_on_an_existing_cluster">GKE</a>, then follow their instructions to update the API server.</p>

 Configure RBAC 

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">Role-based access control</a> lets you control who can access what is inside a cluster. This is a very powerful feature and can be used to control access to specific resources. The great thing about using OIDC is that we can use it with RBAC to enable very granular control over resources.</p>

<p>Most Kubernetes distributions have RBAC enabled by default. If not, make sure to enable it before proceeding. It can be set using the <code>--authorization-mode</code> flag for the API server when creating or patching the cluster. For example, <code>--authorization-mode=RBAC,anotherMethod</code>.</p>

<p>For this exercise, we will use both groups we created in Okta. At the cluster level, we restrict admin access to a specific group that will be controlled via the OIDC provider, in this case, Okta.</p>

<p>Let’s create a cluster role binding by applying the below YAML via kubectl. This binds to the built-in cluster role called <code>cluster-admin</code> and restricts access to users in the <code>k8s-admins</code> group in Okta. Now any user added to the group will have access to the cluster, and removing someone from the group will be enough to remove their access.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: oidc-cluster-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: k8s-admins
EOF
</code>   

<p>In real use cases, you may want to restrict further a group’s access to specific resource types or namespaces, add multiple groups with different permissions, and so on. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">this</a> for different possibilities.</p>

<p>Now, let’s create a k8s role that can only view pods and services in the default namespace.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: restricted-user
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
EOF
</code>   

<p>Now we can bind the role to the second group we created in Okta.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: oidc-cluster-user
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: restricted-user
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: k8s-restricted-users
EOF
</code>   

<p>That’s it! The cluster is now ready for some OIDC action.</p>

 Connecting to the cluster using kubectl 

<p>Before we can go ahead and test this out, we need to do some setup for kubectl so that it knows how to do OIDC authentication. We need to install <a href="https://github.com/int128/kubelogin">kubelogin</a> plugin for this. Go ahead and install it using any of the following commands.</p>

   <code># Homebrew (macOS and Linux)
brew install int128/kubelogin/kubelogin

# Krew (macOS, Linux, Windows and ARM)
kubectl krew install oidc-login
</code>   

<p>The plugin enables OIDC login capability for kubectl. Let’s test it out first. Run the following command, make sure to replace <code>k8s_oidc_issuer_url</code> and <code>k8s_oidc_client_id</code> with what you saved earlier during Okta set up.</p>

   <code>kubectl oidc-login setup --oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; --oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;
</code>   

<p>This should produce an output that looks like this:</p>

   <code>authentication in progress...
Opening in existing browser session.

## 2. Verify authentication

You got a token with the following claims:

{
  "sub": "00u28lpcoheT48W5A5d7",
  "ver": 1,
  "iss": "&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt;",
  "aud": "&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt;",
  "iat": 1634657188,
  "exp": 1634660788,
  "jti": "ID.AmO7M7Z4xh_rSN4IHVuQEfJ4QuoADOWHSrVHuNyn9so",
  "amr": [
    "pwd"
  ],
  "idp": "0oa28lrldhsBglcC35d7",
  "nonce": "2Rsv7E84vo_K14J6qm9IgKjNsCUxb4Hc16qgzx9CKlk",
  "auth_time": 1634649927,
  "at_hash": "veXQkvqTjCl70OkZnKZVyA",
  "groups": [
    "k8s-admins"
  ]
}

</code>   

<p>Now let us update kubectl configuration to add an OIDC user:</p>

   <code>kubectl config set-credentials oidc-user \
--exec-api-version=client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1 \
--exec-command=kubectl \
--exec-arg=oidc-login \
--exec-arg=get-token \
--exec-arg=--oidc-issuer-url=&lt;k8s_oidc_issuer_url&gt; \
--exec-arg=--oidc-client-id=&lt;k8s_oidc_client_id&gt; \
--exec-arg=--oidc-extra-scope="email offline_access profile openid"
</code>   

<p>Now we can use this user to authenticate to the cluster via kubectl.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --user=oidc-user -n default
</code>   

<p>This should open a browser window to authenticate you. You can use your Okta account credentials to log in.</p>

<p>Test out this RBAC configuration by playing around with different users in different groups. Users who are not in the <code>k8s-admins</code> group in Okta should not be able to access any resource. Users who are only in the <code>restricted-users</code> group should only be able to see pods and services.</p>

<p>You can use the below command to set this user as default for your current kubectl context.</p>

   <code>kubectl config set-context --current --user=oidc-user
</code>   

 Learn more about using OIDC with Kubernetes 

<p>Using OIDC is a great way to secure your Kubernetes clusters, especially in bigger teams. It is more secure than any of the default Kubernetes authentication mechanisms. On top of that, it will let you manage users and their roles and permissions in your cluster, and even add multi-factor authentication for your cluster.</p>

<p>While this exercise shows you an Okta implementation, the process would be very similar for other OIDC providers. Check out the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Okta Terraform provider docs</a> to see what else can be automated via Terraform. You can also automate the Kubernetes parts via terraform using the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs">Kubernetes Terraform provider</a>.</p>

			 Tokeny has successfully helped Enegra migrate its EGX security tokens from Ethereum to Polygon. End-users now benefit from faster, cheaper and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets. 
<p>Luxembourg — 5th November 2021 — <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, an asset tokenization and compliance infrastructure provider, has successfully helped Enegra Group Ltd (“Enegra”), a commodities trading firm with approximately $28 billion in net asset value (NAV), migrate its equity-tied EGX security tokens from Ethereum to Polygon.</p>
<p>The migration enables faster end-to-end transfers of EGX security tokens with near-zero transaction fees on Polygon and puts EGX tokens on a pathway to attract global top 20 token market cap status.</p>
<p>In September 2019, Enegra tokenized 100% of its equity and issued EGX equity-backed digital security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform. Enegra decided to switch to Polygon to address Ethereum’s mounting gas fees and slow transaction speed and improve liquidity for EGX token holders.</p>
<p>The EGX tokens were issued through the T-REX security token standard, now recognized as the ERC3643 by the Ethereum community. Thanks to the cross-chain compatibility of the standard, the migration to Polygon from Ethereum was seamlessly managed over a few days, and investors were able to retain the same wallet address for holding their EGX tokens. After the migration, investors were able to interact immediately with their tokens on Polygon via the same platform but without prohibitive gas fees.</p>

		 
	 
    We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra    
	 
		 
			<p>Energa’s decision comes at a time of intense interest in tokenization — a means of digitizing any asset and placing it on an immutable blockchain. Equity, funds, debt, and even real estate can all benefit from the added liquidity, efficiency, and transparency tokenization brings. Mid-cap companies, investment banks, asset managers, funds, and stock exchanges from all around the world are already starting to shift towards blockchain-based financial assets.</p>
<p>Enegra Group Ltd, incorporated in Malaysia, enables mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally against larger competitors by providing world-class commodity trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance. It currently has mining offtake agreements with 16 mid-tier mines in Southeast Asia with a combined Net Asset Value (NAV) of $US 28 billion, audited by Crowe LLP, a global top 10 accounting and audit firm.</p>

		 
	 
    Our goal is to provide our customers with a flexible and scalable solution for permissioned tokens. Issuers of tokens don’t need to worry anymore about being blocked on a blockchain forever. Without losing any history, we now have the tools and processes for smooth migrations from one network to another. Enegra’s migration has showcased how quickly and easily migration can be done using our technology stack. And, the benefits are realized instantly, which is exactly what investors need and expect.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Polygon was designed to work in parallel with the Ethereum network to improve functionality and promote infrastructure development. The leading Ethereum scaling platform achieves this via its array of scaling solutions, including Polygon PoS, Polygon SDK, Polygon Avail, Polygon Nightfall, and Polygon Hermez.</p>

		 
	 
    The tokenization of real-world assets and financial securities is probably the next big wave in DeFi, and we are excited to see our partner, Tokeny, bring qualitative and compliant assets to the Polygon network. By leveraging our infrastructure with the right software provider, such as Tokeny, businesses can quickly deploy or convert their assets to Polygon.  Sandeep NailwalCo-Founder at Polygon    
	 
		 
			<p>The EGX Security Token found at address 0x8db0a6d1b06950b4e81c4f67d1289fc7b9359c7f on Polygon. The EGX token complies with the ERC3643 standard.</p>

			 About Enegra&nbsp; 
<p>Enegra is an international mineral commodities trading business based in Malaysia. Enegra is proud to be one of the world’s first regulated companies to issue equity backed digital security tokens, under security token code EGX on the Polygon network. Enegra has secured lucrative mining offtake agreements among 16 mid-tier mines in Southeast Asia. This provides Enegra with exclusive access to 1.8 billion tonnes of thermal coal and up to 500,000 tonnes per month of nickel sands. The valuation of these mining offtake assets provides Enegra with an audited Net Asset Value (NAV) of $US 28 billion, audited by Crowe LLP<a href="https://www.crowe.com/"> https://www.crowe.com/</a>&nbsp; a global top 10 accounting and audit firm. Based on total issued supply, each EGX token has a NAV of $US 329, underwritten by an audited balance sheet.

 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

 See how Ontology’s ONT TAG protects ROCKI’s user&nbsp;base <p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483">announced</a> a partnership with <a href="http://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain. Today, we are excited to share more details about how ROCKI is leveraging <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>’s decentralized identity framework on its own platform.</p><p>Ontology’s decentralized framework encompasses <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/enter-web-3-0-with-ont-id-375930e78242">several products</a> including <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-2-0-take-charge-of-your-identity-with-customized-data-control-and-disclosure-features-c54bd9305e2d">ONT ID</a>, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, and <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>. Ontology’s Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration Management SDK enables ROCKI to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs.</p><p>Ontology’s DID technology relies on global trust anchors to verify user credentials that can then be used to establish a digital identity across multiple blockchains (e.g. Ontology, BSC, Ethereum, Polkadot).</p><p>We are proud to see ROCKI users now log into the services in a decentralized way thanks to Ontology’s decentralized identity-based batch verification solution, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT&nbsp;TAG</a>.</p><p>ONT TAG enables ROCKI (along with other apps) to quickly obtain a user’s verifiable credentials with the user’s authorization. The authorization process is performed whilst protecting user privacy. To authorize credentials, ONT TAG must first be granted permission by the user&nbsp;only.</p><p>This set of solutions fully takes into account the verification requirements of users and applications for specific information sources.</p><p>Being fully integrated into the ROCKI application, when users log into ROCKI, ONT TAG is working in the background to verify their credentials. This means that users unfamiliar with Ontology may not even know that ROCKI is actually relying on Ontology’s DID framework. Nonetheless, the user benefits from ONT TAG’s unique authorization process. The entire process only takes a few minutes, is cheap, and prevents the application from collecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>ROCKI is a fast-growing start-up with a growing user base of over 9,000 musicians and 30,000 songs. Thus far, over 1,200 music NFTs have been minted and traded on the platform. We are excited to be providing DID services to ROCKI’s users. ONT TAG ensures ROCKI users’ data remains secure and artists are rewarded for the work they&nbsp;produce.</p><p>Stay tuned for future Ontology news and&nbsp;updates.</p> About ROCKI <p><a href="http://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a> is a user-centric music streaming ecosystem that incentives both the artists and the listeners by rewarding them with its in-house ROCKI token.

<p>With almost 7.5 million people working in the construction industry and 673,000 people employed by the mining industry, contributing about 5% to overall employment in the US economy, it’s becoming more important to simplify the verification of qualifications and ensure each worker is fully certified for the job at hand. </p><p>The current process when verifying the certifications and qualifications of each worker consists of:</p>  Each worker holding a paper-based certificate for each qualification they have.  Handing these paper-based certificates over to the site managers.  Site managers having to verify each of these qualifications by calling the issuing body.  Noting each worker's accreditations to ensure they do not carry out tasks on site they are not qualified for.  <p>This process must be done on each new site a worker attends. The worker cannot begin their day until their accreditations have been verified, this can take hours to do and causes delays in the scheduled work. </p><p>There are many issues with paper-based certifications from reduced productivity to heightened compliance risks. In the UK, it’s a legal requirement under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 (HSWA) that businesses are responsible for developing and following a health and safety policy to keep employees out of danger. Many countries have passed similar worker safety laws, however, some businesses fail to comply with this legislation. A worker can change the expiration date of a qualification and reprint, or produce fraudulent qualifications they claim to have earned - this causes huge compliance risks for the site if the verification process fails. </p><p>“​​Being found guilty of breaching the regulation can cost far more than it would to comply, as you could face staggering fines, legal costs, compensation, sick pay, and more. Health and safety fines alone can cost £62,770 more than the cost of compliance for an SME.”* Verifiable Credentials removes the risk of accidentally approving and verifying a fraudulent qualification.</p><p>How Verifiable Credentials transforms this process</p><p>With verifiable credentials, each worker stores their accreditations on a digital wallet on their mobile device. They have full control over these accreditations and who sees them. They are also not prone to loss or damage as is the case with paper-based credentials. </p><p>Digital credentials remove any risk of fraudulent activity; credentials are issued by an educational or training body, and these can be optionally anchored to the Dock blockchain which serves as a timestamp for the credential, providing an expiration date for each qualification. The verifier (being the work site) can instantly verify the credentials; through the use of cryptography, can know they are legitimate. This removes any compliance risks associated with the credentials as a worker cannot falsely claim qualifications. <br><br>Hours down to minutes</p><p>By integrating with Dock and utilizing verifiable credentials, the process of verifying a workers qualifications goes from analysing paper-based certificates and calling each educational body to certify the legitimacy of it, to having the accreditations sitting in a tamper-proof digital wallet, with a digital signature signature from the issuing body certifying the legitimacy. </p><p>This process goes from hours of verifying workers to minutes, reducing delays in the scheduled work while ensuring no fraudulent certifications are presented. </p><p>As mentioned above, certificates are held in a digital wallet; should an educational or training body cease to exist, the credentials stay in the digital wallet, and as the decentralized identity that issued the credential is immutable and stored on the blockchain forever, it’s legitimacy can be verified indefinitely. </p><p>Contact Us</p><p>Dock’s API is easy to use and integrate with, sign up and trial the API in test mode. You have 50 free transactions to use on production, access to the sandbox test net at all times, and no card required on sign up. </p><p>If you’d like to find out more about API and how it will benefit you and your company, book a consultation with our experts here. <br></p><p>*<a href="https://www.arinite.co.uk/the-cost-of-health-and-safety-compliance-versus-a-fine">Arinite Health and Safety</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4925/1">Cloud Security 2025 – Perspective &amp; Roadmap</a> on Thursday, November 11 from 11:00 am to 11:20 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Martin some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Are today's identity and access solutions such as IGA and PAM able to serve the needs of today's complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments? 
<p>I think that's a good question. When we look at this and we look at a little bit of where do IGA and PAM solutions stem from, then these solutions were created to work with environments where you have a traditional server set up, where you focus on your workforce identities, but they were not built for agile IT environments, they were not built for environments that you have in a cloud environment or on your private cloud, on your kubernetes environment, we have workloads going up and down where you have way more types of identities, where you have service identities and things and devices and other things. So, both IGA and PAM, as we know them, are focused on a very traditional problem. So how to give access to your workforce, to applications. To extend it a little to partners and other things, there's consumer identity management. But in fact, no they weren't built for multi-cloud and multi-hybrid, which means there are use cases, there are challenges, there are requirements that can't be served well with these types of solutions.</p>
 So, you are saying that there's a need for additional solutions if we look at today’s agile IT workload. Would Cloud Infrastructure and Entitlements Management (CIEM) be a solution for that? 
<p>So, CIEM is an interesting thing and it popped up and emerged because there's a challenge, which is: How do you manage the access of resources to services and of resources to other resources in your dynamic environments, which you find in public cloud environments which you find in your private cloud, which you find in other modern work environments and so CIEM is something which solves a problem, which is., when you go to the core of CIEM, it's cloud and it's infrastructure. At the end, what we need is to look at, how can we work with all the environments we have in a multi-cloud - which CIEM does - and the multi-hybrid. If you count private clouds, if you count your own so to speak de facto private cloud or your own data center as a hybrid part, then CIEM doesn't fully serve that.</p>
<p>It is part of the problem, it's super important to address that, but I believe we should do it better for everything, not just for cloud, or multi-cloud, but for the entire types of modern workloads. And also looking at how can we, from a management perspective, from a policy perspective, from a governance perspective, do that for every type of workload in a consistent manner, because having one solution for the cloud, the public cloud, one solution for your private cloud and for your UVM environments and for the traditional workloads and having other solutions, or workforces or resources and services, makes it, over time, rather complex. So, yes, it is a solution, we need to figure out solutions in that space, CIEM is a step in the right direction. But I don't believe that it's the final step in that evolution.</p>
 You say that CIEM will not be the last step to a full strategic approach. Could you maybe recommend to CISOs how they could approach this topic strategically? 
<p>Yeah, and I think there are two levels, there's tactical and there's strategic. For the strategic part, at our recent European Identity and Cloud Conference, we unveiled three concepts, three models we call BASIS, SODAS and DREAM. And DREAM is that perspective, the tension of CIEM towards dynamically managing all types of resources: Dynamic Resource and Entitlement and Access Management, and it covers all types of resources. So this, I think, gives a good target state from a strategic perspective for a unified management, for a unified delivery of applications in Europe. Today's IT to serve the needs of the digital business. Tactically, I think it's worth to look at CIEM and how these tools are evolving. Some of them are really making some interesting progress and we see other vendors coming in more from policy management perspective.</p>
<p>So OPA, the open policy agent, for instance, is a very interesting theme here, which all of them help you to get a better grip with the dynamic workloads by managing them through policies. Strategically seen, in any case, you need to put policies at the forefront. You can't manage dynamic workloads with static concepts such as roles or so, but you need dynamic concepts. That means you control via policies. This is in some way the common denominator of everything you're doing in the future. And this is, I think, a very central aspect in everything you do strategically. Tactically, look at the solutions out there today because. You must address the challenge of. Managing entitlements in your cloud environments and beyond.</p>

  <p>When defining classes for a simple aggregation of values, Java developers have traditionally relied on constructors, accessors, <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>toString()</code>, an error-prone practice that has low value and shifts the focus away  from modeling immutable data. Java records were introduced as a first preview in JDK 14 in order to simplify how we write  data carrier classes. The second preview came in JDK 15 and the finalized feature arrived  in JDK 16. A summary of this history is available in the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395">JDK Enhancement Proposal JEP 395</a>.</p>

<p>While code generators can be used to reduce boilerplate code, the goals of the <code>record</code> proposals focus on its semantics. In this post, let’s explore Java records’ features and advantages, and apply them for building a REST API and querying a database.</p>

 The <code>record</code> keyword 

<p>The <code>record</code> is a new type of declaration, a restricted form of class that acts as a transparent carrier for immutable data. Let’s start the exploration by defining a simple data type <code>EndOfGame</code> as a <code>record</code>:</p>

   <code>import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;

public record EndOfGame(String id, LocalDate date, LocalTime timeOfDay,
                        String mentalState, Integer damageTaken,
                        Integer damageToPlayers, Integer damageToStructures) {
}
</code>   
<p>As you can see in the example above, the <code>record</code> has a name, <code>EndOfGame</code> in this case. What looks like a constructor signature is the state description or header, declaring the components of the <code>record</code>.</p>

<p>The following members are acquired automatically with the declaration:</p>

 
   A private final field and a public read accessor for each component of the state description 
   A public canonical constructor with the same signature as the state description, which initializes each field from the corresponding argument 
   Implementation of <code>equals()</code>, <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>toString()</code> 
 

<p>The tests in the <code>EndOfGameTest</code> class below verify that the automatic members are indeed available:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.domain;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

public class EndOfGameTest {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EndOfGameTest.class);

    private EndOfGame createEndOfGame() {

        return new EndOfGame("1", LocalDate.of(2018, 12, 12),
                LocalTime.of(15, 15), "sober",
                10, 10, 10);
    }

    @Test
    public void equalsTest() {
        EndOfGame eog1 = createEndOfGame();
        EndOfGame eog2 = createEndOfGame();

        assertTrue(eog1.equals(eog2));
        assertEquals(eog1, eog2);
        assertEquals(eog1.hashCode(), eog2.hashCode());
    }

    @Test
    public void toStringTest() {
        EndOfGame eog = createEndOfGame();
        logger.info(eog.toString());

        assertEquals("EndOfGame[id=1, date=2018-12-12, timeOfDay=15:15, mentalState=sober, " +
                        "damageTaken=10, damageToPlayers=10, damageToStructures=10]",
                eog.toString());
    }

    @Test
    public void accessorTest() {
        EndOfGame eog = createEndOfGame();
        assertEquals("sober", eog.mentalState());
    }

}
</code>   
<p>The automatic canonical constructor is used for creating a sample <code>EndOfGame</code> in the method <code>createEndOfGame()</code>.
In the <code>equalsTest()</code> above, <code>eog1</code> has the same state as <code>eog2</code>, so <code>eog1.equals(eog2)</code> is <code>true</code>. This also implies both instances have the same <code>hashCode</code>.
Automatic read accessors have the same name and return type as the component. Note there is no <code>get*</code> prefix in the read accessor name, which is the same name as the component, as illustrated in the <code>accessorTest()</code>.</p>

 Java record restrictions and rules 

<p>While <code>record</code> provides a more concise syntax and semantics designed to help to model data aggregates, as stated before, a <code>record</code> is a restricted form of a class. Let’s have a brief look at those restrictions.</p>

 Inheritance, extensibility, and immutability 

<p>A <code>record</code> is implicitly final, and cannot be abstract. You cannot enhance it later by extension, as the compiler will output the following error:</p>

   <code>Cannot inherit from final 'com.okta.developer.records.EndOfGame'
</code>   

<p>A <code>record</code> cannot extend any class, not even its implicit superclass <code>Record</code>. But it can implement interfaces. Using the <code>extends</code> with records clause will cause the following error:</p>

   <code>No extends clause allowed for record
</code>   

<p>A <code>record</code> does not have write accessors and the implicitly declared fields are final, and not modifiable via reflection. Moreover, a <code>record</code> cannot declare instance fields outside the <code>record</code> header. Records embody an immutable by default policy, usually applied to data carrier classes.</p>

   <code>Instance field is not allowed in record
Cannot assign a value to final variable 'id'
</code>   

<p>Read accessors can be declared explicitly, but should never silently alter the record state. Review record semantics before making explicit declarations of automatic members.</p>

<p>A record without any constructor declaration will be given a canonical constructor with the same signature as the header, which will assign all the private fields from the arguments. The canonical constructor can be declared explicitly in the standard syntax, or in a compact form:</p>

   <code>public EndOfGame {
    Objects.requireNonNull(date);
    Objects.requireNonNull(timeOfDay);
    Objects.requireNonNull(mentalState);
    Objects.requireNonNull(damageTaken);
    Objects.requireNonNull(damageToPlayers);
    Objects.requireNonNull(damageToStructures);
}
</code>   

<p>In the compact form, the parameters are implicit, the private fields cannot be assigned inside the body, and are automatically assigned at the end. This enables a  focus on validation, making defensive copies of mutable values, or some other value processing.</p>

 Serialization, encoding, and mapping 

<p>Record instances can extend <code>Serializable</code>, but the serialization and deserialization processes cannot be customized. Serialization and deserialization methods like <code>writeObject</code>,  <code>readObject</code> can be implemented, but will be ignored.</p>

<p>As <code>spring-web</code> module provides Jackson with JSON encoders and decoders, and Java record support was added to Jackson in release 2.12, records can be used for REST API request and response mapping.</p>

<p>Records cannot be used as entities with JPA/Hibernate. JPA entities must have a no-args constructor, and must not be final, two requirements that <code>record</code> will not support. There are additional issues with JPA and records too.</p>

<p>Spring Data modules that do not use the object mapping of the underlying data store (like JPA) support records, as persistence construction detection works as with other classes. For Spring Data MongoDB, the general recommendation is to stick to immutable objects, because they are straightforward to materialize by calling the constructor. An all-args constructor, allows materialization to skip property population for optimal performance. This too is recommended, and Java record semantics align with these guidelines.</p>

 Use Java records with Spring WebFlux and Spring Data 

<p>While searching for a dataset for this tutorial, I came across a collection of 87 end game statistics from a single player, for a popular game. As the author included his mental state in the game play data, I decided to use Java records for building a basic average query and finding out if the player’s performance was significantly altered when sober vs when intoxicated.</p>

<p>Let’s jump ahead and build a secured REST Api using the <code>EndOfGame</code> record, Spring Boot, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/community">MongoDB</a> and Okta authentication. With the help of <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a> create a WebFlux application, from the web UI or with <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a>:</p>

   <code>https -d start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==2.5.6 \
  baseDir==java-records \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.records \
  artifactId==records-demo \
  name==java-records \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.records \
  javaVersion==17 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta,data-mongodb-reactive
</code>   

<p>Note: Although Java records have been available since release 14, the Spring Initializr Web UI only lets you select Java Long Term Support (LTS) releases.</p>

<p>Extract the Maven project, and edit <code>pom.xml</code> to add two more required dependencies for this tutorial, <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/mongodb/">MongoDB Testcontainers Module</a> for testing database access, and <code>spring-security-test</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.testcontainers&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mongodb&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.15.3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;5.5.1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6

</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, and add the following content:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}

      port: 27017
      database: fortnite

logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.data.mongodb: TRACE
</code>   

<p>Add an <code>EndOfGame</code> record under the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.domain</code>. Annotate the <code>record</code> with <code>@Document(collection = "stats")</code> to let MongoDB map <code>EndOfGame</code> to the <code>stats</code> collection. As you can see, a record class can be annotated. The class should look like this:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.domain;

import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.mapping.Document;

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.util.Objects;

@Document(collection = "stats")
public record EndOfGame(String id, LocalDate date,  LocalTime timeOfDay,
                        String mentalState, Integer damageTaken,
                        Integer damageToPlayers, Integer damageToStructures) {

    public EndOfGame {
        Objects.requireNonNull(date);
        Objects.requireNonNull(timeOfDay);
        Objects.requireNonNull(mentalState);
        Objects.requireNonNull(damageTaken);
        Objects.requireNonNull(damageToPlayers);
        Objects.requireNonNull(damageToStructures);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Add a new record for the mental state query <code>MentalStateDamage</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.domain;

public record MentalStateDamage(String mentalState,
                                Double damageToPlayers,
                                Double damageToStructures,
                                Double damageTaken) {
}
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.repository</code> and add a <code>MentalStateStatsRepository</code> interface:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public interface MentalStateStatsRepository {

    Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage();

}
</code>   

<p>Add the implementation <code>MentalStateStatsRepositoryImpl</code> to retrieve the average damage in each category, for each mental state:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.ReactiveMongoTemplate;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.aggregation.Aggregation;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

import static org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.aggregation.Aggregation.*;

public class MentalStateStatsRepositoryImpl implements MentalStateStatsRepository {

    private final ReactiveMongoTemplate mongoTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public MentalStateStatsRepositoryImpl(ReactiveMongoTemplate mongoTemplate) {
        this.mongoTemplate = mongoTemplate;
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage() {
        Aggregation aggregation = newAggregation(
                group("mentalState")
                        .first("mentalState").as("mentalState")
                        .avg("damageToPlayers").as("damageToPlayers")
                        .avg("damageTaken").as("damageTaken")
                        .avg("damageToStructures").as("damageToStructures"),
                project("mentalState", "damageToPlayers", "damageTaken", "damageToStructures")
                );
        return mongoTemplate.aggregate(aggregation, EndOfGame.class, MentalStateDamage.class);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Note: The <code>Impl</code> suffix is required for customizing individual repositories with <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.single-repository-behavior">Spring Data</a></p>

<p>Create the <code>StatsRepository</code> interface, extending the <code>MentalStateStatsRepository</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import org.springframework.data.repository.reactive.ReactiveSortingRepository;

public interface StatsRepository extends ReactiveSortingRepository&lt;EndOfGame, String&gt;, MentalStateStatsRepository {

}
</code>   

<p>After the import,the sample dataset, will create strings for the date and time values, in a custom format. Create the following converters to map <code>String</code> to <code>LocalDate</code> and <code>LocalTime</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter;

import java.time.LocalDate;

public class LocalDateConverter implements Converter&lt;String, LocalDate&gt; {

    @Override
    public LocalDate convert(String s) {
        return LocalDate.parse(s);
    }
}
</code>   
   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.repository;

import org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter;

import java.time.LocalTime;

public class LocalTimeConverter implements Converter&lt;String, LocalTime&gt; {

    @Override
    public LocalTime convert(String s) {
        return LocalTime.parse(s);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>MongoConfiguration</code> class in the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.configuration</code>, to register the converters:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.configuration;

import com.okta.developer.records.repository.LocalDateConverter;
import com.okta.developer.records.repository.LocalTimeConverter;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.convert.MongoCustomConversions;

import java.util.Arrays;

@Configuration
public class MongoConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public MongoCustomConversions mongoCustomConversions() {

        return new MongoCustomConversions(
            Arrays.asList(
                    new LocalDateConverter(),
                    new LocalTimeConverter()));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>StatsService</code> interface in the <code>com.okta.developer.records.service</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.service;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public interface StatsService {

    Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage();

    Flux&lt;EndOfGame&gt; getAll();
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>DefaultStatsService</code> class for the implementation in the <code>com.okta.developer.records.service</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.service;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import com.okta.developer.records.repository.StatsRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@Service
public class DefaultStatsService implements StatsService {

    @Autowired
    private StatsRepository statsRepository;

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; queryMentalStateAverageDamage() {
        return statsRepository.queryMentalStateAverageDamage();
    }

    @Override
    public Flux&lt;EndOfGame&gt; getAll() {
        return statsRepository.findAll();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>StatsController</code> class in the <code>com.okta.developer.records.controller</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.controller;

import com.okta.developer.records.domain.EndOfGame;
import com.okta.developer.records.domain.MentalStateDamage;
import com.okta.developer.records.service.StatsService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@RestController
public class StatsController {

    @Autowired
    private StatsService statsService;

    @GetMapping("/endOfGame")
    public Flux&lt;EndOfGame&gt; getAllEndOfGame(){
        return statsService.getAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/mentalStateAverageDamage")
    public Flux&lt;MentalStateDamage&gt; getMentalStateAverageDamage(){
        return statsService.queryMentalStateAverageDamage();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>The controller enables the <code>/endOfGame</code> endpoint to get all entries, and the <code>/mentalStateAverageDamage</code> endpoint, that returns the damage in each category, as in average by mental state.</p>

 Test Java records in the web layer 

<p>Create a <code>StatsControllerTest</code> class in the package <code>com.okta.developer.records.controller</code> under the <code>src/test</code> folder, to verify the endpoints’ basic functionality with a web test. In this test, only the web slice is verified:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.records.controller;

    private StatsService statsService;

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    @Test
    public void testGet_noAuth_returnsNotAuthorized(){

                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().is3xxRedirection();
    }

    @Test
    public void testGet_withOidcLogin_returnsOk(){

        EndOfGame endOfGame = new EndOfGame("1", LocalDate.now(), LocalTime.now(), "happy", 1, 1, 1);

        given(statsService.getAll()).willReturn(Flux.just(endOfGame));


        webTestClient.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .get().uri("/endOfGame")
                .exchange()

                    .jsonPath("$[0].date").isNotEmpty()
                    .jsonPath("$[0].timeOfDay").isNotEmpty()
                    .consumeWith(response -&gt; logger.info(response.toString()));

    }

    @Test
    public void testGetMentalStateAverageDamage_withOidcLogin_returnsOk(){

        MentalStateDamage mentalStateDamage = new MentalStateDamage("happy", 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);

        given(statsService.queryMentalStateAverageDamage()).willReturn(Flux.just(mentalStateDamage));

        webTestClient

                .consumeWith(response -&gt; logger.info(response.toString()));
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Run the tests with the following Maven command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=StatsControllerTest
</code>   

<p>The <code>/mentalStateAverageDamage</code> test above also verifies that the <code>MentalStateDamage</code> record type is correctly handled when used as a response body. For the <code>/endOfGame</code> you should see response logs similar to this:</p>

   <code>[
   {
      "id":"1",
      "date":"2021-10-21",
      "timeOfDay":"12:02:34.233944363",
      "mentalState":"happy",
      "damageTaken":1,
      "damageToPlayers":1,
      "damageToStructures":1
   }
]
</code>   

 Test Java records in the database layer 

<p>Download the test dataset from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-java-records-example/blob/main/src/test/resources/stats.json">GitHub</a> with HTTPie, and copy it to <code>src/test/resources/stats.json</code>:</p>

<p><code>@DataMongoTest</code> configures the data layer for testing. For this test, I evaluated using <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#core.repository-populators">repository populator</a>, but decided to go for a Testcontainers MongoDB instance instead, to reuse the import process and <code>data.json</code> file later with Docker Compose. Using a container MongoDB instance requires disabling the <code>EmbeddedMongoAutoConfiguration</code>.</p>

<p>In the <code>setUp()</code> above, the <code>mongoimport</code> tool is executed in the test container, initializing the <code>stats</code> collection with the sample dataset.</p>

<p>Run the tests with the following Maven command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=StatsRepositoryTest
</code>   

<p>If the import runs successfully, the following line should appear in the test logs:</p>

   <code>87 document(s) imported successfully. 0 document(s) failed to import.
</code>   
<p>Also, you can inspect the response in the logs for the average damage test:</p>

   <code>MentalStateDamage[mentalState=sober, damageToPlayers=604.3777777777777, damageToStructures=3373.511111111111, damageTaken=246.46666666666667]
MentalStateDamage[mentalState=high, damageToPlayers=557.547619047619, damageToStructures=2953.8571428571427, damageTaken=241.71428571428572]
</code>   
<p>For this single-player dataset, the damage taken or inflicted was not orders of magnitude different when sober than when high.</p>

 Run the application 

<p>Create a <code>docker</code> folder in the root of the project, and add the following <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file there:</p>

   <code>version: "3.1"

services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:bionic
    environment:
      - MONGO_INIT_DATABASE=fortnite
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - ../src/test/resources/stats.json:/seed/stats.json
      - ./initdb.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initdb.sh
  demo:
    image: records-demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=mongodb
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
</code>   

<p>Add also the <code>initdb.sh</code> script in the <code>docker</code> folder, to import the test data into MongoDB, with the following content:</p>

   <code>mongoimport --verbose --db=fortnite --collection=stats --file=/seed/stats.json --jsonArray
</code>   

<p>In the project root, generate the application container image with the following Maven command:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
</code>   
<p>Run the application with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Once the services are up, go to <code>http://localhost:8080/mentalStateAverageDamage</code>, and you should see the Okta login page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign in with your Okta credentials, and if successful, it will redirect to the <code>/mentalStateAverageDamage</code> endpoint, and you should see a response body like the following:</p>

   <code>[
   {
      "mentalState":"sober",
      "damageToPlayers":604.3777777777777,
      "damageToStructures":3373.511111111111,
      "damageTaken":246.46666666666667
   },
   {
      "mentalState":"high",
      "damageToPlayers":557.547619047619,
      "damageToStructures":2953.8571428571427,
      "damageTaken":241.71428571428572
   }
]
</code>   

 Java records advantages and limitations 

<p>While Java record is more concise for declaring data carrier classes, the “war on boilerplate” is not a goal of this construct, Records are not meant to  add features like properties or annotation-driven code generation, as <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Project Lombok</a> does. Record semantics provide benefits for modeling an immutable state data type. No hidden state is allowed, as no instance fields can be defined outside the header, hence the transparent claim. Compiler generated <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> avoid error-prone coding. Serialization and deserialization into JSON are straightforward thanks to its canonical constructor. Summarizing some of the Java Record features discussed in this post:</p>

<p>Advantages</p>
 
   Concise syntax 
   Immutable state 
   Compiler generated <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> 
   Straightforward JSON serialization and deserialization 
 

<p>Limitations</p>
 
   Immutable state 
   Cannot be used as JPA/Hibernate entities 
   Cannot be extended or inherit a class 
 

 Learn more about Java and Spring 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learned about Java record semantics, its benefits, and limitations. Before choosing this feature, make sure to find out if your favorite frameworks support it. Fortunately, Spring Boot support for Java Records was recently added in 2.5.x releases through Jackson 2.12.x. I was not able to find comments about records in Spring Data documentation.</p>

   Identity sprawl is a challenge facing most modern enterprises as a result of inorganic growth, piecemeal identity solutions, and more recently, a loss of control due to unplanned remote work. This sprawl leads to tremendous technical debt and has turned identity and access management into a roadblock for many organizations.

 &nbsp; 
 The Lead Up&nbsp; 
<p>The topic has been discussed in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group">informal bi-weekly meetings</a>&nbsp;for the last two months&nbsp;(we call it the SCIM Interest Group), with strong participation and lots of healthy opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started by reviewing the many different draft extensions that are out there for SCIM, and a lot of those reviews are available on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe2lm3WNUfehPOxEvZ92ygA">SCIM IG&nbsp;Youtube&nbsp;channel</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.&nbsp; We applied for the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting to get feedback from a larger audience and to judge whether we have momentum, and now we are going to find out.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft View&nbsp; 
<p>When it comes to SCIM,&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;interested in participating for several simple reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operational Clarity&nbsp;</p>
 
 At the time SCIM was born,&nbsp;the&nbsp;cloud was&nbsp;still&nbsp;new&nbsp;and the possibilities were not known.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;very&nbsp;common assumed implementation pattern was&nbsp;a push model from on-premises to cloud, and this led to assumptions about who would be pushing what data where.&nbsp;&nbsp;These days however, the combinations of push and pull, client and server, are much more varied.&nbsp;We think that some simple updates in language and better profiling of common implementation roles could make the specification much more intuitive to adopt – thus&nbsp;helping overall interoperability&nbsp;across the identity community&nbsp;and&nbsp;getting us closer to making SCIM a must-have&nbsp;cross-domain interface.&nbsp; 
 
<p>End to End Automation as a First Order Goal&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Identity world is now&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;powered by automation and&nbsp;AI.&nbsp; Connectivity is no longer just about web single-sign on;&nbsp;the new and growing requirement today is for&nbsp;automated&nbsp;corporate oversight,&nbsp;including&nbsp;governance, provisioning, risk detection and threat intelligence.&nbsp;And we don’t only want to automate the connections, we want to automate the establishment of the connection.&nbsp; We are hoping to research&nbsp;whether there is additional&nbsp;metadata or even schema that could facilitate a more seamless bootstrapping of&nbsp;various protocols in the multi-cloud world, including&nbsp;protocols like&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared&nbsp;Signals and&nbsp;Events(SSE)/CAEP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/fastfed">Fastfed</a>, with a plan to&nbsp;lay the groundwork for the explosion in multi-cloud automation that&nbsp;growing industry verticals like&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudknox.io/cloud-infrastructure-entitlement-management/">CIEM</a>&nbsp;exemplify.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Security Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Multi-cloud&nbsp;Updates&nbsp;</p>
 
 In the API Security world, a lot has happened since the first SCIM work began.&nbsp; OAuth 2.0&nbsp;has become&nbsp;the preferred mechanism for protecting APIs and a number of extensions have evolved that increase security during access token presentation.&nbsp; We want the negotiation of industry-best security to be well specified for identity data&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Get Involved&nbsp; 
<p>The most important thing to do is to sign up for the IETF Birds of a Feather meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration is here:&nbsp;<a href="https://registration.ietf.org/111/">https://registration.ietf.org/111/.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no membership requirement, but there is a fee – a day pass costs $125 but there are fee waivers available if that cost is too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also join our merry band in the SCIM Interest Group – connection data is on our wiki:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group/wiki">Explanation of our goals, how to get involved, and pages on our dedicated work efforts (github.com)</a>&nbsp;. We meet every 2 weeks, in two different times of day to encourage global participation. For updates,&nbsp;the easiest way to stay informed is to subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ietf.org%2Fmailman%2Flistinfo%2Fscim&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPamela.Dingle%40microsoft.com%7C50789b8468294876f9df08d9507d030f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637629320743730646%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sGI8BsjgtS2v7idTkSnr4O0QI9BlYBs9M2DGaePjr8U%3D&amp;reserved=0">SCIM Mailing list at IETF</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your excitement about this standards work is as great as&nbsp;ours&nbsp;and we cannot strongly enough encourage your participation – the best specifications are made from diverse input, and the more breadth we have in implementation experience and point of view, the better we will do.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp;</p>

				  The W3C’s DID Specification is critical to building a better digital world.  
			  
				
				
				  Sam Curran and Ken Ebert  
			  
				
				
				 <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 to develop standards for the World Wide Web. Over the years, this collaboration between membership organizations and the W3C’s staff has been responsible for developing CSS, HTMl, JSON, SVG <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium">and more</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/">Credentials Community Group</a> (CCG), was created by the W3C in 2014 to discuss, research, document, prototype, and test credential storage and exchange systems for the Web. As&nbsp; part of this work, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a> (DID Working Group) was formed to standardize the DID URI scheme and the data model and syntax of DID Documents.</p>
<p>The DID Working Group eventually published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Specification</a> as a W3C Proposed Recommendation, and interested parties were invited to review it. The result, after years of work, is one of the most innovative standards to date. The specification addresses an important gap in internet infrastructure — that of proving identifier ownership using methods that are distributed and decentralized. Filling this gap is a critical step towards realizing&nbsp; decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Several organizations have formally objected to the specification. We will not discuss their objections or the responses here — they have been well addressed by other community members and we refer you to a few of them, listed below.</p>
<p>The position of Indicio is that the DID Specification is of signal importance to creating a better digital world. We recognize that, as with any specification, improvements can and will be made in the future; but we back its recommendations and its approval.</p>
<p>We do this because Indicio is committed to advancing decentralized digital ecosystems that provide the ability to trust the authenticity of information and relationships using verifiable credentials. As the gap between our real and digital lives blurs, we must be able to define public goods that orient and protect people as they live and work and do business at the intersection of the real and digital. Decentralized identity is a public good — and we can’t collectively achieve it without a DID Specification.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity enables privacy and consent, authenticity and verification, and all within a new mechanism for peer-to-peer interaction that transforms security. All of these elements are either missing from or badly broken in our current digital world. The move from centralized ways of organizing digital information and relationships to decentralized is the paradigm shift we need, one that will benefit almost everyone, whether consumer or business, citizen or government. It will even benefit&nbsp; things — devices both digital and non-digital.</p>
<p>The DID Specification is critical to realizing decentralized identity as a public good. This is why we support the W3C, its groups, and its standards work — and encourage everyone to get involved to build a better digital future.</p>

			 Enegra’s tokenized equity improves the liquidity of its $28Bn balance sheet via T-REX Platform<br>
 
<p>Enegra sought to provide liquidity and great UX for its investors while remaining compliant on the public blockchain. Enegra turned to Tokeny’s innovative digital asset compliance infrastructure to issue, manage and transfer its equity on the blockchain. Tokeny’s solution allows Enegra to achieve a seamless outcome without the worry of technical barriers. The highlighted results are:</p>

		 
	 
      <p>Improved liquidity</p>      <p>Global and automated compliance</p>      <p>Zero transaction fees</p>                              We tokenized our equity to improve liquidity. And, now that the technology is available for faster, cheaper, and compliant transactions on the blockchain, we wanted our investors to take advantage of it. Polygon and Tokeny provided the complete infrastructure we needed to do so, and we are extremely pleased with the results.  Matthew AverayManaging Director &amp; CEO at Enegra        
	 
		 
			 Introduction 
<p><a href="https://www.enegragroup.com/">Enegra</a> was established in Malaysia in 2011, with a mission to enable mid-tier commodity miners in emerging markets to compete globally, Enegra achieves this through its world-class trading expertise, risk management, logistics, and governance – thereby delivering economic security among mid-tier mining communities whose lack of trading expertise often leaves them exploited on price.</p>
 Why Enegra tokenized its equity 
<p>Earlier 2019, Enegra’s management team explored asset tokenization, and team was fascinated by the concept and the advantages it brings to the company as an issuer, along the liquidity benefits to its investors. The following benefits meet exactly what Enegra sought to achieve for its new equity offering:</p>
 
 Improved liquidity 
 Automated compliance 
 Real-time cap table 
 Low administration and asset transfer costs 
 Control securities 
 Directly connect with investors 
 
 Compliantly tokenizing assets since 2019 
<p>Later in 2019, Enegra embarked on a search for a suitable tokenization platform to issue and manage its equity-backed security tokens on a public blockchain in a compliant manner, along with the necessary controls in place. Tokeny’s <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> caught Enegra’s attention for two main reasons:</p>
 
 First: it leverages the public blockchain while bringing compliance and control. It achieves this through a unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> by whitelisting of digital identity not the wallet for maximum security, e.g: when investors lose their wallets, issuers can recover the tokens for them. 
 Second: it provides the most advanced platform (120+ functions) with the best user experience in the market. 
 
<p>In September 2019, Enegra issued its equity-backed EGX security tokens via Tokeny’s T-REX Platform on Ethereum. From then on, Enegra has been managing its security tokens and investors through the same platform.</p>
 Improving the UX further: say goodbye to gas fees 
<p>Earlier this year, Tokeny enhanced its blockchain layer to start supporting Polygon, a scalable layer 2 solution, to provide a faster, cheaper and compliant infrastructure for its customers. In addition, <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/">the Gas Tank solution</a> was introduced to make the transaction fees free for platform users, eliminating infrastructure costs and troublesome processes.</p>
<p>To enhance the user experience of its security token holders, Enegra upgraded its services with Tokeny last month:</p>
 
 Migrated security tokens to Polygon&nbsp; 
 Implemented the Gas Tank solution 
 
<p>Enegra and its security token holders can now take advantage of fast, free and compliant transactions which ultimately improves liquidity and accessibility of the assets.&nbsp;</p>

 Introduction <p>In collaboration with<a href="http://twitter.com/deltadao"> deltaDAO</a>, we implemented new adjustable privacy features into Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>If data owners want to spin up their data market based on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>, it will now include adjustable privacy features by design, including a privacy preference center, multi-language privacy policies, and more editable metadata.</p><p>Section 1 of this blog post discusses the need for decentralized data sharing solutions and explains how Ocean Protocol solves the current trade-off between using and monetizing private data and the risk of exposing&nbsp;it.</p><p>Section 2 explains how privacy-preserving data sharing with Oceans <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2020-05-26-ocean-protocol-launches-compute-to-data-efb89990ce1">Compute-to-Data </a>enables individuals and businesses to monetize private data while keeping full ownership and&nbsp;control.</p><p>Then we describe how Ocean follows privacy and security by design principles and explain the new privacy features that Ocean Market now offers by default. Following that, we include a brief How-to on how to use these features in practice when setting up a data&nbsp;market.</p> Background <p>AI loves data. The more data is available, the more accurate AI models become which leads to better business and research outcomes. It can help research, leading to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/motivation-for-the-global-initiative-on-ai-and-data-commons-151628c15d6">life-altering innovations</a> in science and technology.</p><p>However, while large amounts of valuable data are generated each year, data exchange, AI application and analysis are often aggravated by restrictions or concerns over security, privacy and associated regulatory risks. For example, the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines high potential fines for privacy breaches, which can be as high as 4% of a company’s annual turnover.</p><p>Thus, data often remains locked in silos and its value is underutilized. Data is hoovered up and used by a handful of big players. In the status quo, there is just not enough incentive to share&nbsp;data.</p><p>But: The confluence of blockchain, AI and data can very well be a lightning charge to spark an immense and far-reaching decentralized Data Economy. That is where Ocean Protocol comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>Ocean is built on a radical possibility: the potential for data to be shared openly without barriers. The idea was to build a decentralized data exchange protocol that enables anyone to publish and trade datasets that they have the right to. At its core Ocean aims to give people and organizations the power to take control of their data, share their data the way they want to, and monetize their data under their own terms. It aims to unlock an Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/deltadao">deltaDAO AG</a> acts as an integrator of the Ocean Protocol tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Adding more privacy-preserving features to the Ocean tech stack is one focus of the ongoing collaboration between deltaDAO and Ocean Protocol Foundation. In the last few months deltaDAO focused&nbsp;on</p>  improving the privacy features in Ocean&nbsp;Market  building market and Compute-to-Data demonstrators, such as the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/building-towards-a-decentralized-european-data-economy-a-minimal-viable-gaia-x-mvg-powered-by-43a853101d">Minimal Viable&nbsp;Gaia-X</a>  educating enterprises and consortia about the Web3 data economy and Ocean Protocol core&nbsp;design   Compute-to-Data (CtD) <p>Compute-to-Data allows for privacy-preserving data sharing, remote computation and data monetization and is a core feature and strong advantage of Ocean Protocol. CtD keeps the data on-premises and allows data consumers to run remote compute jobs on the data. Data owners keep full control as the data never leaves their premises and is only ever accessed by algorithms.</p><p>Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff between using private data and the risks of exposing it. Newly monetized data creates new revenue streams for data publishers. Price discovery using Automated Market Makers (AMMs) allows newly published data to be priced to market&nbsp;value.</p><p>CtD is directly integrated into Ocean Market, where data providers can opt to restrict the access type to “compute only”. Once data is made accessible, the compute job is brought to the data and executed on-premise. This is especially suitable to train AI models, calculate statistics or build business analytics use cases on private data without revealing them.</p><p>“The technology must default towards the ideals of data protection, towards democratizing data while retaining privacy rights. Compute-to-Data is Ocean’s response to solving the current trade-off between benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it.” — Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder of Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>There is a multitude of applications in business, technology and science, benefitting from sufficient aggregation or anonymization of data. Moreover, data owners can approve only vetted and trusted algorithms, which further lowers privacy&nbsp;risk.</p><p>“Using Ocean Protocol, data consumers can train their AI models on remote private data sets and extract insights while ensuring compliance with privacy regulation. The data remains secure, it never leaves the owner’s premises.” — Frederic Schwill, Tech Lead at&nbsp;deltaDAO</p> Applications and business cases of Ocean’s&nbsp;CtD <p>Ocean’s CtD is a versatile technology that can be applied to problems and business cases of varying complexity.</p><p>In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster. The cluster runs in the background on, for example, cloud services like AWS or Azure or private infrastructure. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end-users. In its simplest form, it could compute an average. For example, getting an average of wages across offices of a multinational company can be difficult due to privacy regulations in different jurisdictions.</p><p>More advanced applications could feature statistics or business analytics use cases, for example doing remote analytics across the supply chain of certain automakers.</p><p>CtD is especially useful when applied to verticals like the health sector, where Ocean Protocol enables the possibility to train machine learning models across patient data residing at different hospitals. CtD applied in the health sector can accelerate advancements in science and research, ultimately contributing to saving more lives&nbsp;faster.</p> Privacy-preserving data monetization <p>CtD, combined with Ocean Protocol’s built-in data monetization layer is a powerful tool to enable sustainable business models around private data lakes. Users can benefit from this technology in a number of ways. Developers can quickly launch their own data marketplace, using Ocean software components while connected to the Ocean decentralized data-sharing network.</p><p>Data owners can sell the private data in a marketplace while maintaining control:</p>  Privacy: sell private data, while preserving privacy. It stays private because only AI algorithms see the data directly.  Control: data assets remain secure. Control stays with data owners because data never leaves the premises.  <p>Data consumers can access private data without the liability of directly seeing private&nbsp;data.</p><p>AI practitioners &amp; data scientists can access valuable, private data that was previously unavailable, which can lead to more accurate AI models to improve research and business outcomes.”</p> Following privacy and security by design principles <p>Being based on blockchain, Ocean Protocol has some key advantages compared to traditional Web2 data sharing solutions:</p><p>It is radically different from the traditional manner we exchanged data in the past, which usually involves giving up control and using a middleman mediating between data market participants. The middleman is a single point of failure and could use the data for their own benefit or have their data stolen, as regularly reported in the&nbsp;media.</p><p>Following security and privacy by design principles and giving control back to the user, are key elements of the GDPR. Ocean gives full control and sovereignty to data owners. Moreover, compared to Web2 solutions, Ocean Market requires minimal personal&nbsp;data.</p> NEW: Adjustable privacy&nbsp;features <p>The Ocean Market is an out-of-the-box data marketplace for monetizing data — both with an Ocean reference marketplace and the promise to allow developers to build their own marketplaces to monetize data. Here data can be bought or sold in a privacy-preserving fashion using&nbsp;CtD.</p><p>If data owners want to spin up their data market based on Ocean Market, it will now include adjustable privacy features by design. Here’s&nbsp;how:</p>  Multi-language privacy policies. Ocean Market delivers a privacy policy in English, German, Spanish, and French to inform the market users adequately and transparently about the processing operations. These policies are free to use and can be quickly adjusted to your needs so that you can get started right away and worry less about regulations.  Facilitated introduction of new policies: Moreover, Ocean Market provides easy to edit markdown files to enable you to easily add and remove privacy policies. You can add a policy by providing your own markdown file in the content/pages/privacy directory.  Privacy preference center. There is also a configurable privacy preference center. We offer a simple configuration for showing a cookie banner, as well as a more advanced setup. If your use case requires it, you can now configure a fine-grained preference center for marketing or analytics cookies, which require user&nbsp;consent.  History Table: The history table is a transparency feature you can use to quickly overview the transactions you made on Ocean&nbsp;Market.  Disclaimers. To increase transparency even further, Ocean Market provides several disclaimers to inform users about privacy implications.  Editable metadata: After publishing a data asset you can rectify your metadata (e.g. the author field) at any&nbsp;time.  Data Lifecycle Management: You can restrict the processing of your personal data on Ocean Market by using <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory">Purgatory</a>, a mechanism to hide any data asset from Ocean&nbsp;Market.   How to use the new privacy&nbsp;features <p>If you are new to Ocean Market, head over to our dedicated beginners guide on how to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/launch-a-blockchain-based-data-marketplace-in-under-1-hour-9baa85a65ece#3a60">Launch a blockchain-based data marketplace in under 1&nbsp;hour</a>.</p><p>After finishing the initial setup of your data market, depending on your use case, you may want to enable the features mentioned above.</p><p>To get started and display a simple pre-configured cookie banner, head to your&nbsp;.env file in the root of your repository. If you do not yet have a&nbsp;.env file you can just create&nbsp;one.</p><p>Make sure you have the file saved at the same location as shown&nbsp;below:</p><p>Now copy and paste the following into the&nbsp;file:</p><p>GATSBY_PRIVACY_PREFERENCE_CENTER=”true”</p><p>You will notice a few changes when you now run your market with the following command: npm&nbsp;start.</p><p>First, you will notice a cookie banner that is now appearing in the bottom left corner (1). Additionally, a link to open this banner again is now displayed in the footer&nbsp;(2).</p><p>Now, to configure everything that is displayed within the privacy preference center, you can open the “content” folder and navigate to a file called “gdpr.json”. Open it up and you will see the configurations for our privacy preference center.</p><p>You can change the title, body and even the text on the buttons in this file. Additionally, you will notice a variable called “optionalCookies”. Here you can configure which optional cookies your market implementation uses and give the user the option to opt-in or out of each category individually.</p><p>If you click on the “Customize” button in the cookie banner of your running market, you will see the additional preferences a user can&nbsp;set.</p><p>To make use of those preferences, head over to the CookieConsent provider located in the “provider” folder in the “src” directory. Open the “CookieConsent.tsx” file and you will find two functions that are of special interest. “handleAccept” and “handleReject”. Each time the user changes their settings on any given cookie category, these functions will be called respectively. The “cookieName” passed over to the functions is the same you set in the “gdpr.json” file.</p><p>To make interaction with cookies a little easier for you we also provide a helper file named “cookie.ts” located in the “utils” folder within the “src” directory. You can import the “setCookie” and “deleteCookie” functions, as well as the “getCookieValue” function anywhere in your code to easily handle your&nbsp;cookies.</p><p>But there’s more! Let’s say your market will only use strictly necessary cookies and you want to display a cookie banner only to inform users. In that case, you can go ahead and delete the “optionalCookies” variable in the “gdpr.json” config file altogether. Now change the text of the cookie banner and give the close button a more fitting label and you are all&nbsp;set.</p><p>Your users will now be presented with a simple cookie banner informing them of your use of cookies, which they can acknowledge.</p> Conclusion <p>For Ocean, secure data sharing is a means to an end: it enables staking, pricing, curating, and incentivization to share. Until now, anyone looking to provide data for sale would need to set up companies, figure out the back-office, build sales and distribution channels and then provide the actual value of the data. With Ocean, those barriers are much, much&nbsp;lower.</p><p>Ocean Protocol resolves the current trade-off between the benefits of using private data and the risks of exposing it. Ocean follows security and privacy by design principles, giving control and sovereignty back to data&nbsp;owners.</p><p>If you want to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/launch-a-blockchain-based-data-marketplace-in-under-1-hour-9baa85a65ece#3a60">spin up a data market based on Ocean Market</a>, it will already support all privacy features out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>“The increasing loss of control over one’s own data and the non-transparent way in which companies exploit users requires change.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>There is no successful digital business without utilizing digital identities. Digital identities of consumers, customers, business partners, employees, but also devices, things, or services are at the core of the digital business. Unfortunately, most digital identities reside in siloes. Building a modern Identity Fabric that delivers seamless yet secure and controlled access from everyone and everything to every service requires breaking down the legacy identity siloes. Only then, new digital services can unveil and leverage the potential of the identities you have and that are newly created. Radiant Logic delivers the technology for creating a unified view and use across all types of identities, thus delivering the data foundation for modern Identity Fabrics.

<p>In den letzten Wochen gab es, aufgrund des ID-Wallet Projektes, einige Artikel und Kommentare, die Dezentrale Digitale Identitäten, auch Self Sovereign Identities (SSI) genannt, mit Blockchain Technologie gleich setzten. Es wird der Eindruck vermittelt, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit einer Blockchain&nbsp;funktioniert. Spoiler, das ist nicht so.<br>Wieso dies nicht so ist, versuche ich im Folgenden vereinfacht zu erklären.</p>



<p>Der Begriff Blockchain wird in diesem Artikel stellvertretend für alle Distributed Ledger Technologien (DLT) verwendet. Darunter fallen sämtliche public Blockchains wie Bitcoin oder Ethereum, permissioned/public -, und permissioned/private Blockchains.</p>



<p>Was bedeutet dezentral bei Dezentralen Digitalen Identitäten?</p>



<p>Das “dezentral” bezieht sich nicht auf Blockchains. Dezentral bedeutet, dass die Daten einer Person, bei der Person selbst gespeichert und unter deren Kontrolle sind. Meist sind die Daten auf dem Smartphone, auf einer sogenannten Wallet, gespeichert. Eine SSI Wallet hat auch nichts mit dem Verwahren von Kryptowährungen zu tun. Herkömmliche digitale Identitätssysteme speichern die Daten auf dem Server des Anbieters, also zentral.</p>



<p>Privater- und öffentlicher Schlüssel, was ist das?</p>



<p>Dezentrale Digitale Identitäten sind nur aufgrund von Kryptographie möglich. Einer der Grundpfeiler ist die asymmetrische Verschlüsselung. Mittels eines kryptographischen Verfahren wird ein Schlüsselpaar erzeugt. Das Paar besteht aus einem öffentlichen- und einem privaten Schlüssel. Wie die Namen schon verraten, muss der private Schlüssel privat bleiben und der öffentliche Schlüssel kann geteilt werden. Mit diesem Schlüsselpaar kann man zwei Dinge tun:</p>



  Man kann eine Nachricht verschlüsseln.<br>Die Verschlüsselung erfolgt mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel und Entschlüsselung mit dem privaten.  Man kann eine Datei signieren.<br>Die Signatur erfolgt mit dem privaten Schlüssel und die Prüfung der Signatur erfolgt mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel.  



<p>Für die weitere Erklärung ist die Signaturfunktion wichtig.</p>



<p>Dezentrale Digitale Identität und digitale Signaturen.</p>



<p>In einem SSI System, erzeugt ein Aussteller die Daten (z.B. einen Führerschein), signiert diese digital und übergibt sie dem Empfänger. Der Empfänger kann den signierten Datensatz oder Teile davon an einen Prüfer schicken. Der Prüfer kann mit dem öffentlichen Schlüssel des Ausstellers die Echtheit der Daten prüfen. </p>



<p>Wie kommt der Prüfer zum öffentlichen Schlüssel?</p>



<p>Damit der Prüfer die Daten prüfen kann, benötigt er den öffentlichen Schlüssel des Ausstellers. Aber wie kommt er zu diesem? In herkömmlichen Systemen, wie zum Beispiel bei SSL Zertifikaten, wird eine zentrale Stelle kontaktiert. Unser Browser fragt bei einer Registrierungsstelle nach, ob das Zertifikat der Website registriert ist. Damit stellt unser Browser sicher, dass wir uns nicht auf einer gefälschten Seite befinden. Die Nachteile dieser Methode sind, die Abhängigkeit von einem zentralen Dienst und das Sammeln von Informationen über unsere Aktivitäten.</p>



<p>Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain.</p>



<p>Für die Speicherung und Abfrage des öffentlichen Schlüssels kann man auch eine Blockchain verwenden. Hier ist zu betonen, dass die Blockchain keinerlei Sicherheit gibt, ob der hinterlegte Schlüssel wirklich vom vorgegebenen Aussteller stammt. Es muss gewährleistet sein, dass der Aussteller auch der ist, für den er sich ausgibt. Dies kann nicht durch Technologie alleine erreicht werden. Es müssen auch organisatorische- und Prozessvorgaben erstellt werden. Oft wird von Governance oder einem Trust-Framework gesprochen. Dies ist aber ein anderes Thema und würde den Rahmen sprengen. Der theoretische Vorteil einer Blockchain ist, dass sie dezentral ist und theoretisch jeder Prüfer eine Kopie eines Blockchainknoten vorhalten kann und so sichergestellt ist, dass man keinen zentralen Dienst kontaktieren muss. In der Realität erfolgt die Abfrage aber auch meist bei einem zentralen Dienst, der selbst einen Knoten betreibt und die Information zur Verfügung stellt.</p>



<p>Kann man auch andere Speicherorte als Blockchains für die öffentlichen Schlüssel verwenden?</p>



<p>Ja man kann. Es wäre sogar möglich bestehende PKIs (Public Key Infrastructures) zu verwenden. Es muss nur sichergestellt werden, dass der Datenschutz eingehalten wird und kein Dritter Informationen über die Benutzung der Daten erhält. Ein weiterer Aspekt ist natürlich die Abhängigkeit von einem zentralen Dienst. Stellt dieser den Dienst ein, oder löscht einzelne Schlüssel, kann der Schlüssel nicht mehr geprüft werden. Auf diese Aspekte muss im Design eines Trust-Frameworks Rücksicht genommen werden. Hier könnten wieder dezentrale Technologien hilfreich sein…</p>



<p>Die folgende Grafik stellt ein Beispiel dar, indem 2 Dokumente von 2 unterschiedlichen Ausstellern von einem Prüfer geprüft werden. Der erste Aussteller, in diesem Fall eine Bank, verwendet ein Blockchain Netzwerk, um seinen Schlüssel abzulegen, der zweite Aussteller, eine Behörde, verwendet ein bereits existierende PKI.</p>

<p>Fazit</p>



<p>In den letzten beiden Jahren hat sich die SSI Community von der Blockchain Technology emanzipiert. Man hat erkannt, dass eine Blockchain nicht unbedingt eine Voraussetzung ist, um eine Digitale Dezentrale Identität zu realisieren. Und es gibt auch nicht das eine Blockchain-Netzwerk, auf der ein SSI System aufbauen muss. Es ist egal welches, solange sie Sicherheits- und Betriebsstandards erfüllt.<br>Es ist auch schwierig, dass zum Beispiel Behörden, ihre derzeitigen bestehenden PKI Implementierungen aufgeben werden. Daher kann es Sinn ergeben auf bestehende PKIs aufzusetzen.</p>



<p>Diesen Rahmenbedingungen trägt auch Jolocom Rechnung und entwickelt seine nächste Generation von SSI Technologie unabhängig vom darunterliegenden Speicher, PKI oder Blockchainnetzwerken. Jeder beliebige Speicherort kann angebunden werden.</p>



<p>Wichtiger als die Frage, der eingesetzte Technologie, ist die Definition der Organisation und der Prozesse, damit eine sichere PKI und das höchste Maß an Datensicherheit für die Bürger gewährleistet ist.</p>

 More Americans than ever are pushing for federal data privacy protections, according to the Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MeriTalk&nbsp;<a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/trust-in-government-is-low-but-americans-are-united-around-investments-in-technology/">survey</a>&nbsp;released last month. 



<p></p>



<p>The clear majority of adults surveyed want national standards around how companies collect, process and share&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;to help protect users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and security online. Seven in 10 people agree with the federal government treating personal data security as a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">national security</a>&nbsp;issue and investing in cybersecurity.</p>



 The survey also revealed&nbsp;<a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/trust-in-government-is-low-but-americans-are-united-around-investments-in-technology/">60 percent</a>&nbsp;of Americans believe their social media and physical location data are not secure online. 



<p></p>



<p>The AP-NORC surveyed 1,004 adults in late June using NORC’s Ameri-Speak panel, which is designed to be representative of the whole population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall the results show Americans are optimistic that government investments in technology will improve their lives, particularly their online data security, in the next 10 years. But 56 per cent say they trust the private sector to do more than government in this area—which we see as&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">a&nbsp;massive opportunity</a>&nbsp;for enterprise to step up the privacy and cybersecurity solutions they offer customers.</p>



<p>Americans have been waiting a long time for a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">national data privacy law</a>, as opposed to the patchwork of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state laws</a>&nbsp;we currently have, and the United States remains one of the few countries in the world without one.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">China</a> recently passed its Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), recognizing that the amount of personal data collected by non-government online services and mobile apps is at the point where it can be a rich data source for a national security adversary. The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">United States</a>&nbsp;certainly recognizes this same&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/digital-advertising-may-present-national-security-risks-us-senators/">risk to national security</a> from&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>.</p>



<p>The people are speaking so let’s hope the federal government hears and acts soon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, help your customers protect the privacy and security of their online data by rapidly developing and deploying branded solutions using our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;toolkit.

<p>Blockchain technology has come a long way over the last decade, from Bitcoin enabling a secure, decentralized, and trustless way to transfer value, to Ethereum enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications, opening up a wider range of logic with new use cases. We are already seeing a fast rate of adoption in blockchain applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Many blockchains outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum are also gaining adoption, widening the funnel for the mainstream to enter this space. The time is ripe for multichain.</p> Layers in the blockchain <p>Before diving into multichain, let’s first go over the three layers in the blockchain ecosystem: layer 0, layer 1, and layer&nbsp;2.</p><p><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-0">Layer 0</a> (L0) is the base layer among blockchain protocols. Think of it as a blockchain of blockchains. It supports different types of blockchains and allows them to interoperate with one another (e.g. Polkadot and&nbsp;Cosmos).</p><p>Today, if you ask anyone outside of the vibrant crypto community to describe blockchain, most would mention: Bitcoin (or maybe Dogecoin). Bitcoin and Dogecoin are both layer 1. <a href="https://thedefiant.io/whats-layer-1-vs-layer-2/">Layer 1</a> (L1) is a blockchain itself and acts as the base layer for applications.</p><p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/whats-layer-1-vs-layer-2/">Layer 2</a> (L2) is a network built on top of the underlying layer 1 blockchain. They are designed to help scale the underlying blockchain, for instance, by handling the computation of many transactions off-chain and submitting a single proof so that users can enjoy fast transaction speed and low gas cost for using the&nbsp;network.</p> Enter multichain <p>A multichain world represents the world of multiple blockchains spanning layer 0 to layer 1 to layer&nbsp;2.</p><blockquote>We believe multichain is already&nbsp;here.</blockquote><p>Check <a href="https://cryptofees.info/">cryptofees.info</a>, a site that offers usage metrics on blockchains and protocols, today versus a year before&nbsp;today.</p>Crypto Fees chart, 1 year&nbsp;ago<p>A year ago, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and protocols built on Ethereum represented nearly the entire list. Today, new players — L1s outside of Ethereum, protocols built on separate L1s, and various L2s — have gained popularity.</p>Crypto Fees chart,&nbsp;today<p>This is not to say Ethereum combined with its ecosystem of protocols is losing its dominance, but rather the total addressable market is being realized faster. This trend is just getting started. Time will tell, but we do not see this as a winner-takes-all-market.</p><p>Currently, adoption of multichain seems to be mainly driven by problems stemming from network congestion in blockchains with high demand. This means that since there is so much demand to use the blockchain, unless you pay really high gas fees, your transaction will take a long time to be completed. As a result, other blockchains that focused on scalability (fast transaction times) with low cost of entry (cheaper gas fees) have benefited&nbsp;. Of course, this provokes the question: is it acceptable to compromise security and decentralization for scalability? Is it making the right tradeoffs in the blockchain <a href="https://medium.com/certik/the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3">trilemma</a> model? We will dive more into that in the next&nbsp;section.</p><p>At Magic, we would like to share our thoughts on pragmatically taking Web3 to the mainstream, and this starts with focusing our lens from a purely UI/UX perspective.</p><blockquote>Scalability and cheaper gas fees as the two main factors that need to be addressed to onboard the next billion Web3&nbsp;users.</blockquote><p>Scalability enables fast transactions. Fast transaction time is already a massive UI/UX improvement. Just look at Amazon losing revenue for <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">every hundred milliseconds of latency</a>. Unless everyone goes down the rabbit hole of how blockchains actually work, people will simply not wait and drop off. Time is precious.</p><p>Cheaper gas fees lower the cost of entry for the mainstream. Currently, the “mass” are priced out of using Ethereum (hopefully ETH2 + L2s will address this) for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Not understanding or appreciating the cost of using a highly secured and decentralized blockchain which does not justify the high cost they need to pay to use the blockchain  Not having enough capital to use chains with high&nbsp;demand  <p>Thankfully, there is great progress in L0s, L1s, and L2s working in tandem to address those issues and level the playing field for everyone.</p> Multichain is a&nbsp;choice <p>What should the right mental model be for deciding which blockchain to pick over another? Is the blockchain <a href="https://medium.com/certik/the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3">trilemma</a> model the only one to look at? There are different implications that you may run into when you compromise one aspect over another. At the same time, this is not completely binary. It is more like playing around with the levers based on your preference or requirements. How much speed does your application need? How much decentralization is enough? How much security is required?</p><p>Let’s go over some hypothetical scenarios with respect to the trilemma&nbsp;model:</p>  Your application does not benefit from the network effect of users that already exist in the blockchain. You are also concerned that you may experience network congestion issues during busy times even in scalable blockchains that could affect your app’s experience. It would make sense to launch your own blockchain on L0. This likely means you would first be prioritizing speed and security over decentralization.  You are launching a DeFi application and your #1 priority is tapping into the blockchain with the most liquidity and the network effect of DeFi users. Fast transaction speed and low gas cost are nice-to-haves. It would make sense to launch your application on a blockchain with the most liquidity and many DeFi users. People would be most comfortable providing liquidity to the blockchain that is secure and decentralized.  You would like to tap into a diverse set of user bases. It would make sense to launch your application on multiple chains with different sets of user bases. If the user base is the top priority, perhaps the trilemma model does not matter as&nbsp;much.  You are launching a NFT game application and you care about fast transaction speed and low gas cost. It would make sense to launch your application on a highly scalable chain that offers low gas cost. This likely means you would be prioritizing speed over security and decentralization.  <p>It does not always have to be systemic related. There could be one blockchain community that really aligns with your ethos and you are also aligned with their vision that they are chasing towards and you would like to be part of their journey. Or you may strongly care about developer experience, and the blockchain project that offers the best developer experience according to your criteria may be attractive to&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the end, multichain is a&nbsp;choice.</p> Magic and multichain brings us closer to mainstream adoption <p>At <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a>, we serve developers.</p><blockquote>Magic is empowering developers with the tools needed to put them in the best position to succeed.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the tenth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/MunajHossan4">Munaj Hossan</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyBangladesh">Bengali community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first learned about Ontology from CoinMarketCap in 2019. At first, I didn’t do much research on it but later when I saw that its team members were developing the project very well, I began following Ontology more seriously.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I noticed that Ontology had many local communities. I wanted to support Ontology and help grow the ecosystem so I created the Ontology <a href="https://t.me/OntologyBangladesh">Bengali Community</a>.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>In my opinion, a Harbinger’s main role is sharing news, helping community members, removing language barriers, and maintaining the community’s growth and activity.</p><p>My favorite thing is having direct and special access to the Ontology&nbsp;team.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Ontology is one of the best blockchain platforms I’ve seen and has been on the market for over three years. Being part of the Ontology community is the best way for me to improve my&nbsp;skills.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology has a total of 30+ local communities and 700K community members. Ontology has a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">Harbinger program</a>, which is not available in other projects. Ontology imparts ideas to people before launching anything new, which we have seen in its <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/web3-101-how-ontology-is-helping-catalyze-web-3-0-adoption-and-why-it-matters-cae3d304fb22?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">Web3</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/what-are-ethereum-virtual-machines-and-why-should-you-care-930a739171a9?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">EVM</a>&nbsp;series.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I am most active on Telegram so I will choose Telegram as the key channel. I also use Twitter to interact with Ontology-related posts.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Since I am a new Harbinger, I have no memorable experiences. However, I understand that the Ontology team evaluates advice from Harbinger’s and helps implement new ideas. If you want to be a Harbinger, you can <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">apply</a>. Remember that if you work hard, you will&nbsp;succeed.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Active, helpful,&nbsp;awesome.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I think new events and campaigns can be held to help grow the community and impress existing community members. I would like to see more Harbingers and influencers in Ontology who can help grow the community.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>ONT ID recently surpassed 1.5 million users and on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Ontology</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet">ONTO Wallet</a> passed 160k and 100k followers, respectively. I think community is the key to achieving these milestones. Hopefully, the community will continue supporting Ontology in the future as&nbsp;well.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Joe some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “Securing the Cloud - From the Inside Out” 
<p>Sure. Hi, I'm really excited to do this presentation. The way I think about it is, you know, there's that old saying "the cloud is just someone else's computer", and in this case, a big part of the cloud is actually the computers that we run for our customers. My number one job at Cloudflare is to make sure that those servers are secure. And so what I'm looking forward to doing is talking about how we approach security of those servers, how we interact with customers on that and how you should be thinking about, when you evaluate companies like Cloudflare.</p>
 What does the term "cloud" represent for you and Cloudflare? 
<p>Yeah, it's funny. To me, the term cloud represents the concept of making your job easier for you. It's taking one of the burdens of traditional information security and information technology and moving it off of your responsibility and not ours. It used to be that every company, as they grew up, they had to buy more and more servers of their own and dedicate more and more of their own resources to taking care of them. Now, with the cloud, our customers can focus on their core product, and we take care of that infrastructure for them.</p>
 What lessons have you learned over the years managing Cloudflare? 
<p>Well, people always ask me why I joined Cloudflare, and one of the reasons I joined was because I like going where the internet security issues are. And the internet security issues happen from the kernel on the server all the way up to the network, traffic all the way out to the end-user, and, I have learned that something can go wrong anywhere along the process. It can be a security issue. It could be a performance issue. And you need to have dedicated teams working on all those areas all the time to support our customers well.</p>
 How does Cloudflare ensure that privacy and security are delivered despite the immense scale? 
<p>Yeah, I think it's, you know, it starts with our mission as a company. At Cloudflare, our mission is to help build a better internet. And we think about, everyday performance, reliability, security, and privacy. Our business model doesn't involve collecting people's data and making information from it or making money from it. It involves providing security, privacy, and performance at scale. And then a business model comes from that. It's a really neat thing where you get to come to work every day and help make the internet better for everybody else and build a business around it.</p>

<p>NFTs, the Metaverse, and Digital Identity</p>



<p>This post started over as a mid-coffee ramble at <a href="https://community.decentralised.co/c/nft/power-law-of-nfts-in-the-metaverse">Decentralised.co</a> (kudos go to <a href="https://community.decentralised.co/u/5126b933">Joel John</a> for creating that community).</p>



 
I thought I would share a thought that is still forming in my mind. It came from a question that I was asked:
 



<p>“Will NFTs matter in the gaming and VR/AR worlds?” </p>



<p>My answer was yes. But then I started wondering what that could mean. Imagine a 3D immersive environment along the lines of Second Life. You “decorate” your “home” with “art”. You pop up an obligatory Persistence of Memory Dali print. But is it “real” and what does real even mean? In the physical realm, we know that this is only one original, which is at the MOMA in NYC. But what about the various quality prints that I can buy – at the MOMA, on Amazon, on the street.</p>



<p>How do we know that something is “authorized” or “authentic”?</p>



<p>And now, let’s go digital, where copying of data is free.</p>



<p>How do people know what’s real when we’re in the digital realm? Naval Ravikant did a good job of describing this idea on a <a href="https://tim.blog/2021/10/28/chris-dixon-naval-ravikant/">recent podcast</a> with Tim Ferriss and Chris Dixon. Basically, your game or xR rig will tell you what’s “real” and what is a reproduction, copy or outright fake. (Note: that podcast landed after most of this article was written – pretty awesome timing).</p>



<p>My guess here is that there will be a power law of NFT platforms and issuers that are considered “the real deal”. That is, a small number of NFT platforms/issuers that, when you query the detail behind that Dali on the wall, you say “OMG – this isn’t a crappy print from the street, this one is from .” The rest will be the equivalent of the poster you can buy on the street for your dorm room. As Naval says in that podcast – it’s the “copy-and-paste jpeg” or the original.</p>



<p>(Note: that world avocado image up above – it’s a copy-and-paste of an NFT. I haven’t figured out how to embed an image-based NFT into Ulysses/WordPress yet.)</p>



<p>This power-law concept presents signalling opportunities galore. But how will this shake out? Will there be preferred NFT Issuers on various platforms? As an example, TerraVirtua could be the recognized leader in the Unity gaming realm, but may mean nothing – or not even function – in a Facebook/Meta world. In fact, if you listen to that podcast I mentioned (Tim Ferriss, Naval Ravikant and Chris Dixon) they’ll point out that corporates (e.g. Meta/Facebook) are likely to resist any decentralized NFT use unless they get a “cut”. Remember – when you own the house, the house always wins.</p>



<p>Now think about artists and the way that they sell one original, numerous “limited” prints, perhaps some “artist” prints, and then there are the mass merchandise posters, postcards, coffee coasters, toilet paper (is that a thing? I hope not), etc. Will there be NFT platforms that cater to each of those? Will the artist receive similar portions of the proceeds?</p>



<p>Add in the identities (yes, the digital identities) of the key players – the artist/creator; the seller; the buyer; the platform. Each of those will get a cut of the proceeds likely. As an example, GaryVee (the creator) has some NFTs that clear a 10% fee on re-sale. The platform (Opensea.io in GaryVee’s case) adds 2.5%. So the seller is paying a selling fee of 12.5%. Further, of the 10% take that GaryVee brings in 1% (10% of his fees) goes to charity – which I imagine is handled via a smart contract.</p>



<p>Things are changing.</p>



<p>Quickly.</p>



<p>Just some mid-morning coffee thoughts. Let me know what you think.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>It was February 2014, already hundreds of millions of people worldwide had a smartphone in their pockets, with dozens of apps installed, apps like: Snapchat, Spotify, Vine, Skype, and games like Angry Birds and Minecraft. Mobile apps had been booming for a few years, and users were eager to install every app that resonated with them out of a seemingly unlimited stream of new apps. Indeed, the Apple’s App Store had recently reached the 1 million mobile apps milestone.</p>
<p>Not only mobile, but also in web services, for every new app I wanted to use, I needed to create a new user account, which was OK when I could count them with my own fingers. But what if I had 20, 30, 40 apps on my phone. This was becoming a headache for people, but especially it was clear to become a security concern.</p>
<p>Identity professionals had seen this challenge even in their own lives. And there were combined efforts from big tech, mobile operators, identity software vendors, to architect a solution. An early effort was the OpenID standard, which gained promising interaction at the start of the 2010s. With my OpenID user account, I could log into Yahoo, Google MySpace, and dozens of thousands of web services. However, the lack of a uniform user experience didn’t help people and not a massive audience got hooked with the standard.</p>
<p>So, what happened after the setback? A new solution had been cooked by identity professionals, and finally solved this long living problem. OpenID Connect not only solved that problem for the big tech and social networks, but created a modern way of user authentication, especially for mobile.</p>
<p>Today, if you are listening to this podcast, you have definitely used OpenID Connect before, with or without knowing it. To hear a story from the brilliant minds that designed this standard, let’s hear from Nat Sakimura, one of the creators of the OpenID Connect 1.0 Standard, and today, Chairman of the OpenID Foundation. How was the world just before OpenID connect appeared?</p>
<p>—</p>
 <p>Nat Sakimura</p> 
<p>Nat Sakimura: So you know, the creation of OpenID Connect actually started in 2009. And contemplation on that was actually done from 2007. Even before OpenID 2.0 was published, right? There were things like XRI, XDI, SAML. And SAML was becoming pretty strong in the market, but at the same time, because of the XMLD Signature problems, people are starting to complain about that.</p>
<p>And the OpenID Connect just started off with three people: Me, John Bradley, and Breno De Medeiros at the corner of the Internet Identity Workshop. And we were just sketching out a protocol, which is really dead simple to implement in the simple cases but at the same time, something that could be extended to a very high security, integrity protected federation protocol. And the years between 2010 and 2013 was spent on drafting it and implementing it.</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of people started implementing OpenID Connect back in 2011 or something like that. And we had multiple rounds of interop tests as well as you know, they were actually deployed in the wild and was tested. So OpenID Connect was actually quite well-implemented by service providers like Google before it was published in 2014.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, so that was my understanding that before the standard was published, like Google and other service providers already had some version, but not fully compatible. That was my understanding, it’s what I read. So, it then comes…</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, because it’s… early drafts, right?</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, early drafts. So what happened when all these people in these companies decided to join forces to create a unified standard that didn’t exist at that time? Was it easy to reach consensus for creating this new standard?</p>
<p>Nat: So it wasn’t that difficult. So, the process was kind of long, because we had to start from creating the digital signature standard to start with, right, which became JWS. And also, we had to create a token standard, which later became JWT, and encryption as well.</p>
<p>And so we had to start building very basic blocks. In parallel, we were also developing OAuth right, as the base protocol. So it was almost done from the ground up, because we didn’t have enough building blocks. So that kind of took long, but the discussion there wasn’t that contentious, really. People are cooperating and trying to achieve the maximal interoperability and the consensus in good spirit. So that was good.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that was great. Great to hear that there was consensus already because there was a need for having such a global standard for authentication for these new times especially when mobile was getting big.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, I guess the appearance of the iPhone and subsequent mobile-first world actually helped people to converge, because then people realise that they need a new protocol, which could deal with the new environment effectively.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And what would have happened if, for some reasons, even though you just told us that it was good consensus, but if some reason the standard had been published but still failed, what would have happened?</p>
<p>Nat: So by the time we have published the final version, it was pretty well deployed. So we didn’t think that it’s going to be a miserable failure. Google, Microsoft, Yahoo – well, at least Yahoo Japan – and a bunch of mobile carriers has already deployed them. So we were quite confident that it is going to achieve some degree of success.</p>
<p>But we actually had a long way to go as well. The specification is written in English – it’s just English, right? And there can be many ways to interpret it. And that became actually blatantly clear. And it was clear that we needed something which makes it tighter. That’s why we created certification suite. And I think over 600 deployments have already tested with the OpenID Connect certification in some form or fashion. And I think that has actually helped the interoperability of OpenID Connect substantially.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when the certification started?</p>
<p>Nat: So that was April 2015, just about a year after we had published OpenID Connect final.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. OK. Excellent. So it didn’t take too long until…</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, right. So Google, Microsoft, Ping Identity, ForgeRock, Nomura Research Institute, PayPal, went through the certification.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Oscar: That was Nat Sakimura from the OpenID Foundation. The standard was published and announced in February 2014 during the conferences, RSA 2014 and the Mobile World Congress, and the promise on the press release was “Providing Increased Security, Usability, and Privacy on the Internet”.</p>
<p>I was also curious to get another viewpoint from the early days when OpenID Connect was coming to life. Let’s hear from Petteri Stenius, Principal Scientist at Ubisecure. Since when, you, the team at Ubisecure years ago, start hearing about OpenID Connect? Since when OpenID Connect came to your radar?</p>
<p>—</p>
 <p>Petteri Stenius</p> 
<p>Petteri Stenius: All right. Thanks, Oscar. A nice question. Of course, in the very early days Ubisecure was definitely a SAML company. So back in the year of 2008, we had completed a full-matrix interoperability testing with a couple of very large companies like CA, NTT, RSA and Ping. So we had made a huge effort into testing interoperability with our SAML implementation. The testing was quite an effort. It was almost two weeks, a team of four people, when the size of our company was about 20 people at the time.</p>
<p>It was also at that time that we did hear for the first time mentioned the OAuth 1.0 and OpenID 1.0. The names of these protocols started to pop up. Initially, we did look at those, but we didn’t really become interested in the first versions of these protocols. But a couple of years later, the next iterations of this specification started to appear with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0. We did pay some more attention to this. But we were still quite happy with SAML so we did not rush into any implementations. And I think it was only in 2014, that we started to work on adding support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect into the products.</p>
<p>Oscar: And that happened, I guess, because some of Ubisecure customers or prospective customers already had new different requirements. So could you tell a bit about that?</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah. The fact is that SAML is quite complex and it basically requires that you integrate with ready tested implementation. So either your application server has a built-in support for SAML or you add support for SAML with an integration module. So, if you can find an application server that has support for SAML, or you can find an integration module with SAML, then you are quite happy. But the challenge at that time, in the beginning of 2010, 2012, and so, was that people started building web applications with completely new languages, tools and frameworks and application servers. So it was increasingly hard to find integration modules.</p>
<p>Also, there was this boom of mobile apps. So, SAML and mobile apps don’t really work well together. OpenID Connect is better suited for integration with mobile apps. So there was increased demand from our customers that they wanted something that was simpler than SAML and also they had completely new use cases with the mobile apps. So there was good reason to start working on OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>[For more information, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/education/differences-between-saml-oauth-openid-connect/" title="check out this blog on the differences between OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0 &amp; SAML">check out this blog on the differences between OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0 &amp; SAML</a>]</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Mobile… well, the explosion of the mobile apps was definitely a driver.</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah, yeah. It was in the beginning of this decade. Yeah. Last decade, sorry.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Now, it’s last decade. That’s correct.</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: And if you can tell us a bit of what happened in the Ubisecure team, development team, when you made the decision already we are going to implement OpenID Connect into the platform. So tell us a bit of how things went in that moment.</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah. The product from the beginning has been designed so that it’s possible to add support for new federation protocols. There is a plug-in architecture of sorts. So when we started with the product, we only had support for our own in-house ticket protocol – that was in probably 2002 or 2003. Then we soon added SAML and WS-Federation. Initially, adding support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect was not a huge effort. It was quite straightforward.</p>
<p>But in the end, given all the extensions that have been designed into the specifications, I mean, it has been a significant effort to follow all of the developments in both of these specifications. But I’m fairly happy with the way that it has turned out. We have good support for most of the most important features in both of these specifications. And also we recently were able to complete interoperability testing with OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. And I also know that you at some point joined forces in OpenID Foundation. You’re a member and very active member there, right?</p>
<p>Petteri: Yeah, yeah. I’ve been mostly active in the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/mobile/">MODRNA Working Group</a> where we are designing APIs for mobile authenticators, because mobile authenticators were… I mean Finland was quite early adopting mobile authenticators with the mobile PKI effort. I think it was already 15 years ago or something like that, that we had the mobile PKI system running in Finland and we had quite a lot of experience from that. And it was good to be sharing those experiences with the MODRNA Working Group and we were designing the new APIs for mobile authenticators.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, it’s great that now we are actively participating also in OpenID Foundation, helping building further this protocol, OpenID Connect and also OAuth 2.0 that evolves in parallel.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>That was Petteri Stenius, from Ubisecure.</p>
<p>When the OpenID Connect 1.0 was published, there was a strong need for a standard like that. Big players in tech and in the identity space put in all their efforts, and soon mobile operators, banks, governmental institutions and all kinds of organisations followed the adoption of the standard.</p>
<p>We can certainly say that OpenID Connect took over the world. It’s so prevalent in the online services we use every day that today it’s nearly impossible to measure how many services use the standard.</p>
<p>To give you just one example of the magnitude of this success, at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2018 in Munich, Alex Simons from Microsoft Identity Division, shared that in the last week of April 2018, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/sites/futurium/files/7_nat_sakimura_openid.pdf">92% of all Azure Active Directory authentication happened with OpenID Connect</a>. That was a massive slice of the pie chart that he showed. And that number is a lot and it’s growing every single day.</p>
<p>Today, nearly every single mobile application in which you authenticate uses the standard. As you can imagine, new security challenges have appeared throughout the years, so the standard had to keep evolving. So I asked Nat Sakimura his thoughts on the future of OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Let’s now jump to the future, so, if you can tell me a bit of the new things that are happening in OpenID Connect for the protocol and how do you see the future of OpenID Connect if we start thinking five or 10 years, what do you envision?</p>
<p>Nat: Right. So, after we had published OpenID Connect 1.0, we were not standing still. For example, we have done quite a lot of work in the mobile space, as well as mobile operator space, as well as in the Financial Grade API security profile space. So generally speaking, Open Banking. So the UK has adopted FAPI, Australia adopted FAPI, and Brazil is now deploying FAPI into 800 banks and other relying parties there. And the US is also expected to do so pretty soon. And Russia is also in the process of doing so.</p>
<p>So, I continue to see… and so, if you don’t know FAPI is security protocol for higher risk use cases, right? So OpenID Connect can address very simple cases, to high security use cases, and it offers a lot of options. But FAPI actually pins it down to the highest security only options, right? And we do expect more deployments and more adoption of FAPI in the coming years. And in the OpenID Connect working group, we are busily working on something called Self-Issued OpenID Provider or SIOP, which is defined in chapter seven of OpenID Connect Core.</p>
<p>But there are handwavy stuff there. And also, we wanted to make it useful in terms of verified credentials and distributed identifier. So we are making an extension with regard to that. So we expect the specs to be coming out in a year or so, hopefully. So they can be deployed in the self-sovereign and distributed identifier and verified credential space as well. So that’s one thing.</p>
<p>We are also working on something called OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance. And this is to convey metadata about how identity proofing was performed on that particular entity. It’s closely related to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network">GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network</a>, which I announced at EIC last week. And this has been deployed already. And it’s not the final specification, it’s just Implementer’s Draft, but it’s been deployed by multiple parties. And it’s actually actively in use in Europe for creating the qualified certificate and qualified signature. So I’m expecting some take up, at least in this regard, as well. So these are the things coming up.</p>
<p>Oh, there’s another thing. We’re working on something called CAEP, Continuous Access, Evaluation Protocol, and RISC, which is Risk Information Sharing and Coordination protocol. So, we are moving towards the world where just depending on the one authentication event isn’t good enough. We need to evaluate the access continually. And if there are some peculiarities about access, then we might want to notify the stakeholders so that they can be prepared for anomaly and something like that. Or, if it was deemed too low from the point of view of authentication level, then the user can be re-authenticated or something like that.</p>
<p>So, it’s an application of something called security event token. But it’s actually deployed among big techs right now. And I think that’s going to be a very, very useful addition to the world of, I kind of put it, internet security, or cyber world security and safety, let’s say. So these are the things which I do expect to come within five years or so.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Excellent. As I can see, there are several improvements and projects also connected to OpenID Connect protocol that come – you’re expecting in five years means – means that in 5, 10 years from now, and even more, we will still be using OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>Nat: In some form or fashion, I think.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so we’ll see OpenID Connect for many years.</p>
<p>Nat: For example, SAML was published – SAML 2.0 was published in 2005, if my memory serves well, and we are still using it, right? It’s been there for 16 years. So, new technology seldomly completely replaces the older technologies. They will form additional layers, and slowly start replacing it but it doesn’t happen, like at one stroke or something like that.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Oscar: And that was the story of how OpenID Connect took over the world and became an irreplaceable building block for digital identity today. Today, more than 6 billion people use a smartphone, and the most popular apps people use have changed. As Nat Sakimura said, for many years to come, OpenID Connect will be in use, and combined with other standards, will be protecting your identity every time you book a taxi ride, order food delivery, or as this story is coming to an end, go to Netflix and find the next story for your day.</p>
<p>This was a special story episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Thank you to our guests, Nat Sakimura and Petteri Stenius. The story of this episode was produced by me, Oscar Santolalla, with help of Francesca Hobson and Elena Sanz.</p>

<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, makes the ACH transfer process more secure and more consumer-centric with our open banking platform. Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments are one of the most-used payment rails and are a streamlined form of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). In 2020 alone, ACH moved $61.9 trillion in transactions. Strictly for payments moved between US-based banks, these electronic payments operate as paperless checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payments are issued in two forms: ACH credits (push) and ACH debits (pull). Understanding the difference between the two can help you understand how to better leverage ACH credits and debits in your everyday business transactions.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is an ACH Debit? 
<p>An ACH debit transfer “pulls” funds from the payer’s bank account. If you’ve ever set up a recurring bill payment online, this is an example of a pull. In order to initiate an ACH debit, the payer must give their account and routing numbers to the payment receiver (who requests the payment), and give them permission to access the funds. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">The Nacha Web Debit Account Validation Rule</a> requires the account to be verified before the first payment can be issued from it. While various verification methods are available, verification can happen by confirming the account number, or by the account owner giving permissioned access to it through an open banking portal.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is an ACH Credit? 
<p>An ACH credit transfer “pushes” funds to a bank account at the request of a payer. If you receive your paycheck through direct deposit, it comes through an ACH credit transfer, in which your employer is requesting that funds be moved directly from their bank account to yours. You can also make payments in the form of an ACH credit, but unlike an ACH debit, you would initiate the transfer.&nbsp;</p>
 How Do ACH Transactions Work? 
<p>ACH transactions happen in two key steps:</p>
 
 Initiating the payment: Before a payment originator can initiate a transfer, they must receive permission to either push or pull funds to or from the account. Originators can receive permission by signing an ACH authorization form or through verbal agreement. This authorization phase is also when the transaction is marked as either a one-time or a recurring payment.&nbsp; 
 Receiving the payment: Once the ACH transfer has been authorized, your bank account will either push or pull the funds, depending on whether it’s a credit or debit transfer. If there are insufficient funds to push or pull, the payment can fail. In some instances, this can result in overdraft fees for the account holder. 
 
 Direct Deposits and ACH Transactions 
<p>Direct deposits have become the preferred method for issuing paychecks, both for employees and employers. Depositing payment directly into an employee’s account via the ACH network is a streamlined option. It also removes the fraud risk and processing delays of paper checks. Direct deposits are a type of ACH credit transfer, where employers push funds to an employee once they’ve received and verified the employee’s account and routing numbers.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Nacha’s New ACH Debit Rules? 
<p>Nacha’s central role is to facilitate the ACH network. Their top priority is ensuring that funds transfers are secure. In order to better protect the network as a whole, as well as individual businesses and consumers, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/how-the-nacha-web-debit-rule-affects-your-organization/">Nacha implemented a new rule</a> that applies specifically to WEB (online-initiated) debit transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Nacha’s operating rules, originators of WEB debit entries are required to use a “commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection system” to mitigate fraud risk. As of March 19, 2021, Nacha added account validation as a central component of fraud prevention. Any WEB debit originator now has to validate an account before first use, or when an account number changes.</p>
 Common Questions About ACH Transfers 
 How Long Do ACH Debit or Credit Transfers Take to Clear? 
<p>Because they are processed in batches, ACH transactions can take longer than other forms of payment to clear at the receiving bank. Some banks may offer same-day ACH payments which adds an extra window for submitting transactions, but most financial institutions charge extra because they’re moving toward faster payment options.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Security Risks of An ACH Transaction? 
<p>As with any form of payment, there are security risks associated with ACH transactions. For example, with access to routing and account numbers, criminals can authorize fraudulent ACH transfers. Nacha regularly updates <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/current-fraud-threats">this page</a> with the most current ACH-related threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following Nacha’s guidelines and using secure ACH payment solutions will mitigate the security risks associated with ACH transactions.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Benefits of ACH Transactions Over Other Types of Payments? 
<p>ACH transactions are the most widely-used payment rail because they’re simple and secure. This makes them the obvious choice for exchanging payments via the internet. Some advantages of ACH payments include:</p>
 
 ACH is the backbone of every disbursement, bill payment, and P2P financial services app. It’s the universal standard for sending and receiving money. 
 Lower fees than wire transfers and other EFT formats. 
 ACH transfers are convenient, thanks to the ability to set up recurring payments, and you can make ACH payments from anywhere. 
 
 Are ACH Transfers Right for My Business? 
<p>Many businesses leverage ACH transfers to pay vendors and receive payments from customers, in addition to paying employee salaries. The speed, convenience, and security of ACH payments are behind today’s most successful businesses, assuring a positive impression of your brand. If your company is frequently moving money, making large payments or if it isn’t as important when the transactions goes through ACH transfers may be the right choice.</p>
<p>There are areas where ACH could be improved. It lacks a seamless returns process and there isn’t a dispute mechanism for consumers. It lacks transparency and immediacy in many ways, which is why when fraud occurs it can be costly for merchants and businesses.</p>

 GiD Report#184 — Every company is an identity&nbsp;company <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-183-a-more-constructive-model-for-nfts-9a704014ae4c"> last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The age of digital&nbsp;identity  Gensler: “DeFi will end poorly” without regulations  Meme of the week — Meta&nbsp;edition  Tweet of the week — Crypto&nbsp;edition  Headline of the week — Dinosaur&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. The age of digital&nbsp;identity <p>There was a time when every company became a tech company. Soon after, every company was a fintech&nbsp;company.</p><p>We’ve now reached the stage where every company is going to be an identity company. Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook — wait, I mean Meta — wants us to ditch our monitors and smartphones for VR goggles so we can engage with each other in an all encompassing digital reality called the metaverse.</p><p>But we’re not going to get there without figuring out digital identity&nbsp;first.</p><p>For years, identity has been an afterthought for most companies. Need to check for age? Just tell me your birthday. We won’t actually confirm that it’s your real birthday, but at least we asked, right? Or you might outsource identity to Facebook or Google. But those platforms don’t care about identity — they care about ad dollars and engagement. You only need an email, any email, to create an account — real or fake. If you decide to manage identity yourself, your company’s servers are now the target of hackers and if headlines from the past few years are any indication, the hackers are pretty good at stealing our&nbsp;data.</p><p>As the stakes of our social and business interactions online have increased — with the pandemic pouring gasoline on the trend — the status quo isn’t good enough&nbsp;anymore.</p><p>For responsible parents, age restrictions matter. Kids are too smart for the honor system. But having to send a photo of your driver’s license to a questionably secure server every time you want to watch an R-rated movie or access a restricted service hardly makes for a convenient and safe experience.</p><p>David McCabe from the NYTimes has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/internet-age-check-proof.html">a new report on the end of anonymity as companies start to take identity more seriously</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>People in Japan must provide a document proving their age to use the dating app Tinder. The popular game Roblox requires players to upload a form of government identification — and a selfie to prove the ID belongs to them — if they want access to a voice chat feature. Laws in Germany and France require pornography websites to check visitors’ ages.</blockquote><blockquote>The changes, which have picked up speed over the last two years, could upend one of the internet’s central traits: the ability to remain anonymous. Since the days of dial-up modems and AOL chat rooms, people could traverse huge swaths of the web without divulging any personal details. Many people created an online persona entirely separate from their offline&nbsp;one.</blockquote><blockquote>But the experience of consuming content and communicating online is increasingly less like an anonymous public square and more like going to the bank, with measures to prove that you are who you say you are. This month, lawmakers in Washington, which has lagged other world capitals in regulating tech companies, called for new rules to protect young people after a former Facebook employee said the company knew its products harmed some teenagers. They repeated those calls on Tuesday in a hearing with executives from YouTube, TikTok and the parent company of Snapchat.</blockquote><p>Taking identity seriously is necessary and responsible. But relying on outmoded frameworks to do so is problematic.</p><p>The first problem is friction:</p><blockquote>Richard Errington clicked to stream a science-fiction film from his home in Britain last month when YouTube carded&nbsp;him.</blockquote><blockquote>The site said Mr. Errington, who is over 50, needed to prove he was old enough to watch “Space Is the Place,” a 1974 movie starring the jazz musician Sun Ra. He had three options: Enter his credit card information, upload a photo identification like a passport or skip the&nbsp;video.</blockquote><blockquote>“I decided that it wasn’t worth the stress,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>The second problem is security:</p><blockquote>Critics of the checks worry that the requirement will force users to give sensitive information to websites with limited resources to prevent hacks. Outside companies that offer age checks would be vulnerable, too.</blockquote><blockquote>“Either way, that’s still a treasure trove of data that’s exploitable,” said Daly Barnett, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online privacy and free speech advocacy&nbsp;group.</blockquote><p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) addresses both those problems with one stone. Verify your age once and now you can use that credential over and over without re-submitting any personal data. Friction problem&nbsp;solved.</p><p>Moreover, a company only needs to know that you’re, for example, over 18. They don’t need to know your birthday. They don’t need to know your ID number or your driver’s license’s expiration date. None of that personal information needs to be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>And because it isn’t being shared, there’s no “treasure trove of data that’s exploitable.” Instead, your data is safe with you. You control it, you own&nbsp;it.</p><p>Some companies like Twitter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/internet-age-check-proof.html">as the NYTimes reports</a>, are sticking to their guns in order to protect the original charm of the internet:</p><blockquote>Some services are resisting the checks. Twitter allows users to disclose their birth date but does not require it. If users want to view adult content — nudity is prevalent on the service — they must click through a warning but don’t have to prove they are 18 or&nbsp;older.</blockquote><blockquote>“At the heart of Twitter is the belief that there’s a huge value to the public conversation of people being able to speak pseudonymously to the world,” said Nick Pickles, a senior director of global public policy strategy at Twitter, “and also not requiring a significant amount of personal information to be provided before you can use online services.”</blockquote><p>But in light of smarter identity frameworks such as SSI, that becomes a false argument. Why not have it both ways? Ensure that only adults are accessing adult content while also ensuring that those who want to remain pseudoanonymous can stay just that — and not have to share a “significant amount of personal information” as a ticket to&nbsp;entry.</p><p>One thing’s for certain — the digital age we live in will only get more digital. But in order to get to a more constructive future, we need to get digital identity&nbsp;right.</p><p>Every company will now have to be an identity&nbsp;company.</p><p>This is a seminal moment in the history of the internet. The paths we choose will have a tremendous impact on our daily digital experience.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="http://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/internet-age-check-proof.html">Anonymity No More?

Gensler: “DeFi will end poorly” without regulations <p>First, here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/126ecd7a-0b02-4d9f-97f7-ffa2b24894a2">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>Global authorities have taken the first step to bring decentralised finance under regulatory oversight after rapid growth in the blockchain-based alternative to the traditional financial system.</blockquote><blockquote>Standards setters for anti-money laundering said on Thursday that creators, owners and operators of decentralised finance services should comply with rules designed to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. The Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, urged national regulators to apply standards to individuals who “maintain control or sufficient influence” over DeFi apps, it said in a&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>The guidance from FATF, an intergovernmental body based in Paris, is the first effort by global authorities to address the rapidly expanding world of decentralised finance, which has grown fivefold this year to $100bn locked up in projects, according to data group DeFi&nbsp;Pulse.</blockquote><p>Now, here’s <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-gary-gensler-speaks-144426838.html">SEC Chief Gary Gensler via&nbsp;Yahoo</a>:</p><blockquote>My broad thoughts are it’s one of the innovative areas in this crypto movement. I mean, we start with Satoshi Nakamoto who was pressing up against the definition of money and ledgers, sort of an old, thousands of years old technology, money and&nbsp;ledgers.</blockquote><blockquote>But decentralized finance has started to press up some other innovations. While that’s all interesting, it reminds me a lot about when peer-to-peer lending came along about 15 years ago. People said, well, I’ll lend money to you and it would just be peer-to-peer. And we had to take 3, 4, 5 years to bring it within an investor protection, and in some cases, banking regulation.</blockquote><blockquote>And I would say that’s what we’re going through right now. The same process, hopefully, we get to the other side where whatever innovation it’s there survives. But again, the public is protected. We protect against financial stability concerns as well. There’s a lot of lending going on. There’s a lot of trading going on. And without protections, I fear that it’s going to end&nbsp;poorly.</blockquote><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lassoing-a-stallion%3A-how-gary-gensler-could-approach-defi-enforcement-2021-10-21">the bad news for&nbsp;DeFi</a>:</p><blockquote>The first ugly truth about DeFi regulation is that it will inevitably come too late. Systems like UniSwap and Celsius were built in ways that challenge the fundamental premises of conventional financial regulation, but regulators will not be quick to shift their models to conform with the reality on the ground. Meanwhile, DeFi systems continue to grow, guaranteeing they’ll face increasing scrutiny.</blockquote><blockquote>Jai Massari, a partner focused on trading and markets at the law firm Davis, Polk and Wardwell, predicts a three-step process of reconciling those conflicting truths. Call it the Stages of Regulatory Grieving.</blockquote><blockquote>“I think it starts off with enforcement,” she says, “because enforcement is easier than regulation.” Those enforcements could be similar to recent actions that have led to large fines for crypto exchanges like Kraken or services like Tether. But they could also go further to include criminal charges against individuals, on which more&nbsp;below.</blockquote><p>In the short term, some DeFi services might be incentivized to continue operating in a Mad Max world in order to gain market share versus platforms that adopt a more compliant approach. In the long run, it will make sense for DeFi to get ahead of regulations and be compliant yesterday — what we call Green&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Again, that begins with digital identity — and for decentralized finance, it would make a lot of sense to adopt a decentralized form of identity.</p><p>Every company is an identity company — including DeFi.</p><p>Oh yeah, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/tether-partners-with-identity-startup-notabene-on-travel-rule-compliance/">that includes Tether,&nbsp;too</a>:</p><blockquote>Stablecoin issuer Tether announced on Tuesday that it has begun a trial partnership with Notabene to help it combat money laundering in cross-border transactions.</blockquote><blockquote>The partnership with the startup, which provides software to crypto exchanges to help them identify their users and track transactions, will help Tether to comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “travel rule,” which requires financial institutions to exchange customer information for both senders and recipients of relevant transactions.</blockquote><blockquote>The FATF is a Paris-based global, money-laundering watchdog. Its guidelines for crypto compliance have expanded to include exchanges and stablecoin issuers, which are known as virtual asset service providers, or&nbsp;“VASPs”.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/126ecd7a-0b02-4d9f-97f7-ffa2b24894a2">Global regulators target blockchain-based ‘decentralised finance’</a>  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/sec-chair-gary-gensler-speaks-144426838.html">SEC Chair Gary Gensler speaks to Yahoo&nbsp;Finance</a>  <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lassoing-a-stallion%3A-how-gary-gensler-could-approach-defi-enforcement-2021-10-21">Lassoing a Stallion: How Gary Gensler Could Approach DeFi Enforcement</a>  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-se-cs-gensler-is-calling-for-more-investor-protections-as-de-fi-blossoms-164203144.html">Why SEC’s Gensler is calling for more investor protections as DeFi&nbsp;blossoms</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/26/tether-partners-with-identity-startup-notabene-on-travel-rule-compliance/">Tether Enlists Startup to Help It Comply With Money Laundering Rules</a>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/cfpb-chief-warns-of-big-techs-deeper-incursion-into-financial-sector">CFPB chief warns of tech giants’ deeper incursion into financial sector</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/blockfi-to-launch-new-product-suite-with-private-firm-neuberger-berman/">BlockFi to Launch New Product Suite with Private Firm Neuberger Berman — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/us-sec-set-to-crack-down-on-stablecoins-in-new-report/">US SEC Set to Crack Down on Stablecoins in New Report — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/122241/ethereum-defi-protocol-cream-finance-hacked-for-115-million">Ethereum DeFi protocol Cream Finance hacked for more than $130&nbsp;million</a>  <a href="https://frcusvi.org/tron-ceo-justin-sun-withdraws-4-2-billion-from-aave-colin-wu-explains-why/">Tron CEO Justin Sun Withdraws $4.2 Billion from Aave, Colin Wu Explains&nbsp;Why</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/coddsquad">/CoddSquad </a>— <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/crypto-investor-says-he-lost-6-figures-on-a-dog-inspired-defi-project.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail">This crypto investor says he just lost $470,000 on a dog-inspired DeFi&nbsp;project</a>   3.

You may have noticed an <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/monthly-roundup-for-holo-holochain-99a372802e2a">uptick</a> in stories, blogs, apps, news and announcements coming from Holo recently. In large part this is simply because there is much more that can be built on Holochain than ever before. The proof of this reality is that the wider community of projects and developers are beginning to move with haste in their respective projects. Simultaneously the Holo development team is now unblocked. Certain feature development had been on pause until Holochain had finished updating to a necessary level of features and stability. This is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>In order to make the sequencing of our interdependent work more visible to our community, we refreshed <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">our roadmap for Holo</a> and included some key Holochain releases.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/q4-2021-update-on-milestones-and-progress-27eb0b0b7e5a">Read the full Leadership &amp; Org&nbsp;Update.</a></p> 3 More Holochain ReleasesI <p>In a Dev Pulse that was published last week, Paul talks through the latest 3 versions of Holochain that have been released. This Dev Pulse is packed full of information on not only the releases, but Dev Camp updates, networking fixes, and more information on Sweettest, a Rust-based Holochain testing framework. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/">You won’t want to miss this&nbsp;update!</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/">Read the full Dev&nbsp;Pulse.</a></p><blockquote>Gosh, now that the dev team has moved to weekly releases, there’s a lot to catch up on when I skip a week! The most recent Holochain releases have a number of bug fixes that improve performance and reliability, along with a new feature (<a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">post_commit</a>) and a few breaking changes.<br>- Paul&nbsp;d’Aoust</blockquote> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on Holo&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter.</a></p> RedGrid: Carbon Neutral By&nbsp;2030 <p>Earlier this month, Paul wrote an excellent thought piece on RedGrid, which is building the internet of energy on Holochain.

Dev Camp participants and community devs are getting real-time support for their Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools from the Holochain dev team. These community-created tools make it much easier to build Holochain applications. Dev Campers have been building their own app using these RAD tools. These apps will then be easy for non-developers to install and use using the new Holochain launcher.</p><p>We will continue to post updates on the <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Holochain Twitter.</a></p> Watch the replay of AMA&nbsp;48 <p>Earlier this month we hosted AMA 48, where we gave vital details of the HoloPort Alpha Program.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Stefan Würtemberger, Vice President Information Technology at Marabu Inks, will give a presentation on the impact of cyber attacks on businesses entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4866">And Suddenly It Burns Without Fire</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 10:10 am to 10:30 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Stefan some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “And Suddenly It Burns Without Fire - Impact of Cyber Attacks on Your Business”? 
<p>Yeah, you can expect how a company has massive problems and you can't see it. You will get the feeling how an IT department has to work to fight against hackers and restore the company's business. We will dive into incident and recovery management and afterwards we make a recap about lessons learned and go into preparation for the next attacks.</p>
 What are the most important experiences in dealing with cyber-attacks? 
<p>There are a lot of things you have to expect. The most critical thing is how the company reacts. You don't know what to do and when you don't have emergency planning, you have to handle that. And the most important thing is that you don't have fears about the cyber-attack. It’ll go away, and you won’t have a lot of fun in these times. It's the most horrible time for IT, when you have a cyber-attack.</p>
 How do you counter them and what can you do to prepare yourself? 
<p>We counter cyber-attacks in a couple of KPIs. We measure how much traffic we have, how many incidents we have in the company, and the preparation is much easier. You have to speak a lot with your colleagues, with the employees and prepare them how to handle and to work in a cyber-attack. And also, once they make errors by clicking links, how they should react and inform the business leaders and IT department to be prepared that we know that we could have the next cyber-attack.</p>
 What does it look like when it happens a second time and what are the lessons learned? 
<p>When a cyber-attack is in progress, the first impression is: you do nothing about it and you see that systems are not working correctly, and that's the horrible time for IT. In the progress of a cyber-attack, you see clearly how it comes and how it works from the attacker side and you fight against them, that the business is coming back to normal operation and the preparation is then to see how they come into the company, and then you have to prepare your business and the IT that you know where they're coming through and you close the doors and you prepare your network to the next level of IT security with certain technology, but also with the knowledge of the people and the awareness that it could happen any time and in any location and in every certain day.</p>

<p>Als operations manager van een private leasemaatschappij wil je twee dingen. Eén: zoveel mogelijk verwerkte dossiers per dag. Twee: een hoge&nbsp;first time right&nbsp;ratio in de acceptatie van het private leasecontract. Kwantiteit én kwaliteit dus, tegen zo laag mogelijke kosten. Een uitdaging, want het acceptatieproces in de private lease sector is sterk gereguleerd en dat betekent dat ieder document zorgvuldig moet worden gecheckt door de acceptatieafdeling. Gelukkig zijn er manieren om het acceptatietempo én het first time right percentage te verhogen. Die beginnen niet bij je klant of bij de lease adviseur, maar bij je interne processen.</p>

<p>The period to vote on Dock’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/proposal-to-update-network-rewards-split/">first on-chain governance proposal</a> to update the emission rewards split has officially concluded, with a resounding approval by token holders. This marks an exciting evolution for the Dock network, with the community participating for the first time in a successful vote to make a significant change to the Dock network.</p><p>The Dock community was presented with a proposal by the Dock Association to adjust the split of network staking rewards between validators and the Dock treasury. Prior to the vote, the split was 60% to the treasury and 40% to validators and stakers, originally modeled based on the rewards split on the Polkadot network. The recently approved proposal adjusts this split to an even 50/50 between the treasury and validators, thus increasing rewards to validators and their stakers.</p><p>The results of the vote can be viewed on the <a href="https://dock.subscan.io/referenda/1">Subscan Explorer</a> and this change has automatically taken immediate effect on-chain. We appreciate the community’s participation and look forward to future collaborations on governance for the Dock network.</p>

  <p>Since 2013 when it was released to the public, Docker has become an industry-standard tool for development teams to package applications into small executable containers. A year later, Kubernetes was released by Google to manage large amounts of containers, and provide features for high availability (HA) and auto-scaling.</p>

<p>While Kubernetes adds many benefits to your container management, you might find the process of setting up Kubernetes within your on-premise infrastructure quite challenging, especially on the first try. To overcome this challenge, managed Kubernetes is offered as a service by several cloud service providers.</p>

<p>In this article, you will learn about the services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for using Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This article will walk through the hands-on creation of a Kubernetes cluster to deploy a containerized Node.js application secured with Okta.</p>

<p>To follow along with the cluster creation steps, you will need the following:</p>

 
   An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS account</a>. Sign up for an account to receive free AWS credits. 
   The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a> installed and configured on a local computer. 
   The <a href="https://eksctl.io/introduction/#installation"><code>eksctl</code> command line tool</a> installed on your local machine. 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, installed on a local computer to build a Docker image of the cloned Express.js application. 
 

 Introducing Kubernetes offerings on Amazon 

<p>While Kubernetes is open-source and can be used within your on-premise infrastructure, Kubernetes is also cloud-agnostic. Major cloud service vendors provide Kubernetes as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering to deploy and scale containerized applications across virtual machines. The Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) from Amazon Web Services is one example of such an offering.</p>

<p>The Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) lets you deploy, run, and scale your containerized application within a Kubernetes cluster consisting of EC2 instances acting as worker nodes. For customers using a hybrid cloud model, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/">Amazon EKS Anywhere</a> deployment option allows you to use Kubernetes clusters within a supported on-premise infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Fargate service on AWS also provides cloud customers with the ability to use Kubernetes, but in a serverless manner. When using Fargate, you get to run a pod within a Kubernetes cluster on demand. Fargate helps to reduce the operating cost (OpEx) of your infrastructure as you will only be billed for the pods and not the EC2 instance nodes.</p>

<p>Related: The article <a>Deploy a .NET application using AWS Fargate</a> shows a practical use of AWS Fargate.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will focus on using Kubernetes through the Elastic Kubernetes Service.</p>

 Understanding the EKS architecture on AWS 

<p>The EKS architecture comprises three main components – clusters, nodes, and the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), which forms the networking aspect. Let’s proceed to consider the clusters, and VPC.</p>

 EKS Clusters 

<p>An EKS cluster is composed of a control plane and worker nodes residing within a VPC created for the cluster. A cluster’s control plane is placed in an AWS-managed account and runs the Kubernetes software. The worker nodes, on the other hand, run in a user’s AWS account, and are EC2 instances that connect to the control plane through the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/">API Server</a> from the Kubernetes software.</p>

<p>An EKS cluster can be created through several tools such as the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">AWS console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Cloud Formation</a>, <a href="https://eksctl.io/"><code>eksctl</code></a>, or even <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>, as well as other infrastructure as code tools. When using terminal-based tools such as the AWS CLI or <code>eksctl</code>, you provide the properties of the cluster to be created by EKS, either by using a configuration file or through command line arguments. Within the demo section of this article, you will use the <code>eksctl</code> command line tool to create a cluster.</p>

<p>With regard to the cluster’s security, the internal connection between the control plane and worker nodes uses a certificate file generated on setup. The cluster’s data stored within <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#etcd">etcd</a> is also encrypted by default using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Key Management Service</a> on AWS.</p>

 The EKS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 

<p>An AWS virtual private cloud (VPC) is an isolated virtual network made up of smaller network components such as subnets and internet gateways, amongst others.</p>

<p>A VPC is required for creating a cluster. The VPC is also required to contain subnets within at least two availability zones. These subnets can either be public or private; however, it is recommended to have a combination of public and private subnets so that ingress traffic can be load balanced.</p>

<p>EKS has an uptime <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/sla/">Service Level Agreement</a> of 99.95%. As one of the strategies to ensure high availability (HA), an Auto Scaling Group can be used within each Availability Zone to monitor the nodes within a cluster, scaling them to meet your application’s demands or even restarting them when health probes fail repeatedly.</p>

 Creating a Docker container 

<p>With the knowledge you now have about EKS, let’s create a cluster having a deployment to run the Docker image of a Node.js application secured with Okta. We will reuse the Node.js application that was built for an earlier blog post, <a>Building a Simple Authentication in Express in 15 minutes</a>. You need only focus on creating a Docker image of the application.</p>

<p>The steps outlined below will guide you through building the Docker image of a Node.js app secured with Okta.</p>

<p>1. Open your terminal to execute the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone"><code>git-clone</code></a> command below to clone the Okta-secured Node.js application from the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example">OktaDev repository</a> to your local computer.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example.git
</code>   

<p>2. Using your preferred code editor, open the <code>okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example</code> folder cloned above and create a file named <code>Dockerfile</code>. This file will store the steps for building a docker image out of the cloned application.</p>

<p>Next, paste the code within the code block below into the <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>

   <code>FROM node:alpine

WORKDIR /okta-k8-app

COPY . .

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD exec npm start
</code>   

<p>When the <code>docker build</code> command is executed, Docker will perform the following steps to build an image of the application.</p>

 
   Use <code>node:alpine</code> as the base image of the docker image about to be built. 
   Set the current working directory to <code>okta-k8-app</code>. 
   Copy all the files from the root directory (<code>okta-node-express-15-minute-auth-example</code>) into the root directory of the docker image being built. 
   Run <code>npm install</code> command to install the node.js dependencies specified in the <code>package.json</code> file for the application. 
   Expose port 3000 to allow external HTTP requests to reach the Node.js application running on port 3000. 
   Lastly, execute <code>npm start</code> command to start the application 
 

<p>3. Create another file within the project directory and name it <code>.dockerignore</code>. This file will specify other files that should not be copied into the Docker image such as a <code>.env</code> file containing sensitive credentials.</p>

<p>Next, add the content of the code block below into the <code>.dockerignore</code> file;</p>

   <code>.git
.env
</code>   

<p>4. Execute the docker build command below to build a docker image of the application using the steps in the <code>Dockerfile</code> you created above.</p>

<p>The tag <code>-t</code> flag specified in the command below will attach a tag of okta-k8-app to the docker image about to be built. This tag will come in handy when you run the docker image.</p>

   <code>docker build . -t okta-k8-app
</code>   

<p>5. Optionally, create a <code>.env</code> file within the project directory to securely store the Okta client credentials.</p>

<p>Please refer to the article, <a>Build Simple Authentication in Express in 15 Minutes</a>, to create an Okta application, and retrieve the client credentials for the application through the Okta developer console before proceeding further.</p>

<p>Add the client credentials retrieved to the <code>.env</code> file in the format below. (Make sure there is no whitespace before values.)</p>

   <code>HOST_URL=&lt;OKTA_APP_HOST_URL&gt;
OKTA_ORG_URL=&lt;OKTA_ORG_URL&gt;
OKTA_CLIENT_ID=&lt;OKTA_APP CLIENT_ID&gt;
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;OKTA APP CLIENT_SECRET&gt;
OKTA_TOKEN=&lt;OKTA_APP_TOKEN&gt;
APP_SECRET=&lt;OKTA_APP_SECRET&gt;
</code>   

<p>6. Optionally, execute the <code>docker run</code> command below from your terminal to run the docker image built above. This command will allow you to test the running docker image from your web browser.</p>

   <code>docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 okta-k8-app
</code>   

<p>From your terminal’s output, you can see the logs, indicating that the application is running on port 3000.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With the Node.js application now running in the terminal, you can view the Node.js application within the web browser at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>

<p></p>

 Pushing the docker image to the Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 

<p>In the last section, you built the docker image for your application. Now you can proceed to create a registry within the Elastic Container Registry, and push the newly created docker image into it.</p>

<p>Execute the <code>ecr-public</code> command below to create a public repository within the Elastic Container Registry. The tag flag <code>--tags</code> will also attach a tag with a key of environment and value of development to the repository. This command works for the us-east-1 region, but does not work in all AWS regions.</p>

   <code>aws ecr-public create-repository --repository-name okta-k8-ecr-repo --tags Key=environment,Value=development --region us-east-1
</code>   

<p>The command executed above will return a JSON response by default to describe the created repository. Take note of the <code>repositoryUri</code> contained in the JSON response, as you will attach a tag containing the <code>repositoryUri</code> to the docker image.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, execute the docker tag command below to tag the docker image built previously.</p>

<p>Note: Replace the <code>&lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;</code> placeholder within the template section in the code block below with the REPOSITORY_URI of the docker image you pushed to the ECR in the format of <code>&lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;:latest</code> .</p>

   <code>docker tag okta-k8-app:latest &lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;:latest
</code>   

<p>Execute the command below to authenticate your computer’s docker client with your ECR repo through an authentication token.</p>

   <code>aws ecr-public get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin public.ecr.aws
</code>   

<p>Next, execute the command below to push the tagged docker image to the ECR repository you created.</p>

   <code>docker push &lt;REPOSITORY_URI&gt;
</code>   

<p></p>

 Creating an EKS cluster 

<p>So far, you have pushed a docker image to the Elastic Container Registry. Let’s create a cluster in EKS that will use the docker image you previously pushed.</p>

<p>Use the <code>eksctl</code> CLI tool to create a cluster within EKS. <code>eksctl</code> is a third-party CLI tool written in Go that simplifies the management of EKS clusters by leveraging AWS CloudFormation to manage your cluster and other dependent objects such as VPCs, and subnets.</p>

<p>When creating a cluster, <code>eksctl</code> requires a very minimal configuration. It will attempt to create a cluster using its default values. However, you can specify the cluster configurations as command line arguments to the <code>eksctl</code> command, or more conveniently, specify a YAML file containing your cluster configurations.</p>

<p>When the <code>create cluster</code> command is executed without a configuration file, <code>eksctl</code> will create the following AWS resources, which the cluster depends on:</p>

 
   A VPC with two subnets. One is public, the other is a private subnet across three availability zones within the VPC. 
   A <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">node group</a> containing two virtual machines as the worker nodes for the cluster. 
 

<p>Execute the <code>create cluster</code> command below to create a new cluster named <code>okta-k8-cluster</code> within the AWS region specified. This can take a considerable amount of time, so wait until the command is executed successfully.</p>

<p>Note: Replace the <code>&lt;AWS_REGION&gt;</code> placeholder with the region attached to your AWS account. For this tutorial, we are using the us-east-2 region.</p>

   <code>eksctl create cluster --name okta-k8-cluster --region &lt;AWS_REGION&gt;
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>After the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code> has been created, execute the command to switch your <code>kubectl</code> context to that of the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code>. Executing the command will enable <code>kubectl</code> to connect to your EKS clusters.</p>

   <code>aws eks --region us-east-2 update-kubeconfig --name okta-k8-cluster
</code>   

 Creating Kubernetes resources 

<p>At this point, you have an empty Kubernetes cluster running on EKS. Let’s proceed to create three resources within the cluster.</p>

<p>Using the three steps below, you will create three YAML files within the application directory to store the configurations for the following resources that will be created within the cluster: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secret</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">deployment</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">service</a>..</p>

<p>1. Create a file named <code>loadbalancer.yaml</code>. This YAML file will contain the configurations for creating a load balancer for the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code>, enabling you to access the application that will run within the cluster.</p>

<p>Add the content of the code block below into the <code>loadbalancer.yaml</code> file.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: okta-express-k8-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: okta-express-k8
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
</code>   

<p>Execute the command below to create a load balancer using the configuration in the <code>loadbalancer.yaml</code> file above. This command creates a load balancer within the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service on AWS, which you can access through an endpoint.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f loadbalancer.yaml
</code>   

<p>Next, execute the command below to get details about the load balancer we just created.</p>

   <code>kubectl get service/okta-express-k8-loadbalancer
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Note: Take note of the External IP returned among the details of the load balancer above. You will use the External IP in the following steps as an endpoint to access the application.</p>

<p>2. Create a file named <code>secret.yaml</code>. It will contain the fields for a Kubernetes Secret, storing the Okta credentials. A <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Secret</a> within Kubernetes is a resource used to store sensitive data such as passwords and API keys that have been excluded from your application code for security reasons.</p>

<p>Replace the <code>&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP&gt;</code> placeholder in the code block below with the External IP value derived from the load balancer details in step 1.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: okta-node-app-secrets
type: Opaque
stringData:
  HOST_URL: http://&lt;LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP&gt;:3000
  OKTA_ORG_URL: &lt;OKTA_ORG_URL&gt;
  OKTA_CLIENT_ID: &lt;OKTA_APP CLIENT_ID&gt;
  OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET: &lt;OKTA APP CLIENT_SECRET&gt;
  OKTA_TOKEN: &lt;OKTA_APP_TOKEN&gt;
  APP_SECRET: &lt;OKTA_APP_SECRET&gt;
</code>   

<p>Execute the <code>kubectl create</code> command below, from the directory where the files are located, to create a Kubernetes Secret using the <code>secret.yaml</code> file above. Make sure to replace the placeholders with their actual values.</p>

   <code>kubectl create -f secret.yaml
</code>   

<p>3. Create a <code>deployment.yaml</code> file and add the content of the code block below to define the properties of a deployment resource type.</p>

<p>The configuration file contains three parts that define a deployment. The metadata defines the resource information; the spec defines the number of pods to be created, the docker image to run within the pods, and a network port within the container to expose. The deployment will also mount the volume for the Kubernetes Secrets.</p>

<p>Note: Replace the <code>&lt;DOCKER-IMAGE-URI&gt;</code> placeholder within the template section in the code block below with the URI of the docker image that you pushed to the ECR.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: okta-express-k8-deployment
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: okta-express-k8

<p>Execute the kubectl create command below to create the deployment resource using the content of the configuration file above.</p>

   <code>kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
</code>   

 Modifying Okta client credentials 

<p>At this point, the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code> is almost ready for use. You’ve created a load balancer and a deployment resource. However, before a user can be fully authenticated through the Node.js application running within the cluster, you have to update the <code>redirect_uri</code> within the Okta credentials to point to the load balancer for the <code>okta-k8-cluster</code>.</p>

<p>Navigate to your Okta Developer Console and click on the application we’re using for this tutorial.
</p>

<p>In the LOGIN, section, click the Add URI button within the Sign-in redirect URIs subsection to add a new URI that will be used when initiating an authentication process. Add the load balancer external IP into the input field in the format below, replacing the <code>LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP</code> with your cluster load balancer’s external IP.</p>

   <code>http://LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP:3000/callback
</code>   

<p>Next click the Add URI button within the Sign-out redirect URIs subsection to add a new URI that will be used when signing out of the application. Add the load balancer external IP in the input field in the format below:</p>

   <code>http://LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP:3000
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Click the Save button to save the two added URIs.</p>

<p>At this point the application is fully set up and ready for use. With your web browser, you can access the Node.js application through the load balancer’s External IP in the format of <code>http://LOAD_BALANCER_EXTERNAL_IP:3000</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 More resources for Kubernetes on AWS 

<p>In this article, we covered basic aspects of the Elastic Kubernetes Service on AWS. You created an EKS cluster with a deployment and a service that uses the Docker image of a Node.js application.</p>

<p>Although this article did not focus on testing the scalability of the EKS cluster, you also created a load balancer within the ELB service to handle incoming traffic to the nodes within the cluster. Congratulations!</p>

<p>It’s David here from Magic. I am joining as one of the newest Magicians and as Product Lead. I am excited to welcome you to our October product&nbsp;update!</p><p>Since our last update, we’ve launched new features that make it even faster for you to get started with Magic and reach more customers.</p><p>In this post, I’ll cover the latest highlights and improvements.</p> Magic Login&nbsp;Form <p>Now with Magic, you can integrate a full end-to-end login solution to your web app with just two script tags. Your web app is future-proof as all login options and brand settings can be controlled through the Magic dashboard. Magic Login Form provides a complete login solution giving you full access to passwordless login and social logins. Magic Login Form provides a login form optimized for conversion and gives you control over your branding. All customizations can be configured from the Magic dashboard without requiring additional code&nbsp;updates.</p><p>To get started, head to our documentation <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">here</a>. Magic Login Form is compatible with allow list and block list, session management, and other features.</p> SMS Login <p>Did I mention SMS login? In October, we released passwordless login support for short message service (SMS). With SMS login, any customer with a mobile phone can use their mobile phone number to login to your web app on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. To login, the customer will provide their mobile phone number instead of an email or other username and password combination. Next they will receive a one-time code and enter that to complete their login to your application.</p><p>SMS login has several advantages including:</p>  Mobile phones are popular in markets all around the world and can expand your application’s reach.  SMS login provides a convenient way for your customers to get signed in because it does not require a context change and users often have a mobile phone&nbsp;nearby.  Returning customers don’t need to remember a password to get signed in. This can improve your customer retention and eliminate your forgotten password support&nbsp;cost.  SMS login allows you to verify the mobile phone number for each new registered user when they complete&nbsp;login.  <p>To get started, open your Magic dashboard and navigate to Passwordless Login. From there, you can enable SMS in one click. SMS is compatible with the Magic Login Form, web, React Native, and Magic’s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/magiclabs">Wordpress plugin</a>. Users who sign up on your website will show in your user dashboard. SMS is supported in 38 locales. For more information, see our SMS doc&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/sms/build-a-demo/browser">here</a>.</p> Bitcoin Support <p>Web 3.0 developers can now connect to the Bitcoin blockchain using Magic. Bitcoin is the world’s most recognizable digital currency and offers a way for developers to connect their decentralized apps (dApps) with mainstream customers. Developers who enable this will be able to onboard new customers easily with Magic’s passwordless user login and a Bitcoin wallet address. Bitcoin is just one of the 18 blockchains Magic currently offers. Head over to our <a href="https://magic.link/posts/magic-bitcoin">guide</a> to integrate Bitcoin&nbsp;today!</p> Flutter SDK <p>We are also excited to share that you can now bring passwordless login to your iOS and Android-based Flutter apps with the new Magic Flutter SDK. Flutter has taken off as an efficient framework for developers to build iOS and Android based apps for both platforms, once. The Magic Flutter SDK speeds up your time to market and gives you flexibility to use popular Social and passwordless logins. To learn more, visit our docs&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-methods/email/integration/flutter">here</a>.</p> Lastly <p>Everyone is invited to join us on Discord, where the Magic team and community gathers to chat, as well as help answer questions you might&nbsp;have.</p><p>Whether you’re a developer or just keen to<a href="https://community.magic.link/"> join the discussion</a> on auth, decentralized identity, or other modern infra like blockchain — come and say&nbsp;hi!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-product-updates-october-edition-859fd22153f2">Magic Product Updates: October Edition</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Ontology published <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1443893453495078934?s=20">#EVM 101</a> and series articles “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/what-are-ethereum-virtual-machines-and-why-should-you-care-930a739171a9">What Are Ethereum Virtual Machines and Why Should You Care?</a>” on Twitter, introducing the features and advantages of Ontology EVM: Increasing interoperability between Ontology and Ethereum; developers will be able to seamlessly migrate assets between both blockchains. Allowing users to access EVM-based projects deployed on Ontology, whilst enjoying lower gas fees and faster block production.  Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, introduced her work experience at Ontology in the article “Women in Fintech: Greatest Achievements with Goodbox, Pensionbee, TomoCredit, Ontology and LXME”, published in <a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/women-in-fintech-greatest-achievements-with-goodbox-pensionbee-tomocredit-ontology-and-lxme/">The Fintech Times</a>, a leading financial technology newspaper. She said blockchain and crypto are founded on egalitarian principles and she is very glad to be representing women in a more male-dominated industry.  Messari, a leading crypto data analysis company, published a research report entitled “<a href="https://messari.io/article/ontology-layer-1-trust-network-for-decentralized-identity-and-data?utm_source=messaricrypto&amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;utm_campaign=ontology-trust-network-data">Ontology: Layer 1 Trust Network for Decentralized Identity and Data</a>”. The report introduces Ontology’s suite of decentralized identity and data services, as well as its technical specifications.  Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, published an article entitled <a href="https://thedefiant.io/how-decentralized-identity-can-take-crypto-to-the-next-level/">“How Decentralized Identity Can Take Crypto to the Next Level</a>” in The Defiant, the essential information platform for the open economy. The article analyzed the principles and application fields of DID, and introduced the various project teams currently building DID solutions. For example, Ontology is developing a comprehensive identity infrastructure to bring trust, privacy and security to&nbsp;Web3.  <p>ONTO passed <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet/status/1450743749705826313?s=20">100,000</a> followers on Twitter and continues to focus on providing users with one-stop services for managing digital identities, data and digital&nbsp;assets.</p> Read this month’s report in your preferred language:   <a href="https://medium.com/p/3450dfbe9a20/edit">中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/a599b7504d09/edit">繁體中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/34b1cacb933/edit">日本語</a>  <a href="https://theontologyteam.medium.com/ontology-monthly-report-october-2021-%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%96%B4-30b52310209d">한국어</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/c9f41cbe0d7/edit">Española</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/a2cde85ea70f/edit">Slovenčina</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/b9e0023b7463/edit">Tiếng Việt</a>  <a href="https://theontologyteam.medium.com/ontology-monthly-report-october-2021-hindi-450ef924424">Hindi</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/17c5be1fc97d/edit">русский</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/32eddfc3069b/edit">Tagalog</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1205153956f/edit">සිංහල</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/5bdd75fe650f/edit">Türk</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/245e8cd0f2f6/edit">Italiano</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/3e9dfe8ea0bc/edit">বাংলা</a>  <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>When building an SPA (single page application) with React, routing is one of the fundamental processes a developer must handle. React routing is the process of building routes, determining the content at the route, and securing it under authentication and authorization. There are many tools available to manage and secure your routes in React. The most commonly used one is <code>react-router</code>. However, many developers are not in a situation where they can use the <code>react-router</code> library. Because of this, they may need to use Reach Router, Wouter, or maybe even no router at all.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to quickly build a secure SPA using React, Okta, and Wouter. Okta easily enables you to manage access to your SPAs (or any application for that matter). By using the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> library you can quickly build secure applications with React. At the time of writing this article, <a href="https://github.com/reach/router/issues/429">reach-router does not support React version 17+</a>.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 14</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>Create an Okta OIDC application</a> 
   <a>Create a React application with routing</a> 
   <a>Run your React application</a> 
   <a>Learn more about React</a> 
 

 Create an Okta OIDC application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once Okta is done processing your request it will return an Issuer and a Client ID. Make sure you note these, as you will need them in your application.</p>

 Create a React application with routing 

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE (I use Visual Studio Code) and use the task runner <code>npx create-react-app react-routing-demo</code> to scaffold your React project. You’ll be prompted to install <code>create-react-app</code>. Type y to approve.</p>

<p>This process takes a minute, so grab a cup of coffee or tea if you prefer. The task runner does a great job of getting your application started quickly, but you will need to add and edit a few of the files.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you will need to install some packages.</p>

<p>First, of course, wouter.</p>

   <code>cd react-routing-demo
npm i wouter@2.7.5
</code>   

<p>You will use Bootstrap along with the react-bootstrap library to style your app.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
npm i react-bootstrap@1.6.4
</code>   

<p>Next, you will get dotenv as a way of storing your sensitive Okta information.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@10.0.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will add the Okta React SDK to your project.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-react@6.2.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.6.0
</code>   

<p>With these dependencies installed, you can begin to create your app. First, add a new file called <code>.env</code> to the root of your project, and add the following items. Note here that the <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER</code> should match the issuer from the Okta CLI.</p>

 <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
</code> 

<p>Next, add a folder for <code>Components</code> and one for <code>Pages</code>.</p>

   <code>mkdir src/Components
mkdir src/Pages
</code>   

<p>In <code>Components</code> add a new file for <code>Header.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { Navbar, Nav, Form, Button } from "react-bootstrap";

const Header = ({ authState, oktaAuth }) =&gt; {
  if (authState?.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }

  const button = authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;Button
      variant="secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signOut("/");
      }}
    &gt;
      Logout
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;Button
      variant="secondary"
      onClick={() =&gt; {
        oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }}
    &gt;
      Login
    &lt;/Button&gt;
  );

  return (
    &lt;Navbar bg="light" expand="lg"&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Brand href="/"&gt;React Routing&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls="basic-navbar-nav" /&gt;
      &lt;Navbar.Collapse id="basic-navbar-nav"&gt;
        &lt;Nav className="mr-auto"&gt;&lt;/Nav&gt;
        &lt;Form inline&gt;{button}&lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;
    &lt;/Navbar&gt;
  );
};
export default Header;
</code>   

<p>This component displays a login button for your users. This button turns into a logout button once the user authenticates. The component also provides a place to access the <code>Profile</code> page you will create.</p>

<p>Add <code>Profile.jsx</code> to the <code>Pages</code> folder. The code for this file is as follows.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { Container } from "react-bootstrap";

import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Header from "../Components/Header";

const Profile = () =&gt; {
  const { authState, oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    async function authenticate() {
      if (!authState) return;

      if (!authState.isAuthenticated) {
        await oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
      }
    }

    authenticate();
  }, [authState, oktaAuth]);

  if (!authState?.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      &lt;Container&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Please wait while we sign you in&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    );
  } else {
    return (
      &lt;Container&gt;
        &lt;Header authState={authState} oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Your profile page&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to your profile page &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    );
  }
};

export default Profile;
</code>   

<p>This page leverages the <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to determine if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, then you will prompt them to log in with Okta. Otherwise, you will display a brief profile page.</p>

<p>Finally, add <code>Home.jsx</code> to the <code>Pages</code> folder with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { Link, Redirect } from "wouter";

import Header from "../Components/Header";

import { Container, Row, Col, Card } from "react-bootstrap";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

const Home = () =&gt; {
  const { authState, oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();

  return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;Redirect to="/Profile" /&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;Container&gt;
      &lt;Header authState={authState} oktaAuth={oktaAuth}&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;

      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;h3&gt;React routing Demo&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;h5&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; Demo using{" "}
            &lt;a href="https://github.com/molefrog/wouter"&gt;Wouter&lt;/a&gt; Secured by{" "}
            &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/h5&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;
            A tutorial written by{" "}
            &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/Col&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;

      &lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Col sm={12} className="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;Card style={{ width: "21.5em", margin: "0 auto" }}&gt;
            &lt;Card.Header&gt;Already have an Okta Account?&lt;/Card.Header&gt;
            &lt;Card.Body&gt;
              &lt;Link to="Profile"&gt;Login Here&lt;/Link&gt;
            &lt;/Card.Body&gt;
          &lt;/Card&gt;
        &lt;/Col&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;
    &lt;/Container&gt;
  );
};

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>This page uses the <code>Redirect</code> component from wouter combined with the <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to redirect authenticated users to the profile page. The page also serves as a landing page with some additional information about your application.</p>

<p>Finally, you will need to update your <code>App.js</code> file with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import "./App.css";

import { Router, Route } from "wouter";

import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

import Home from "./Pages/Home";
import Profile from "./Pages/Profile";

import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

const issuer = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER;
const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + "/callback";

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
      issuer: issuer,
      clientId: clientId,
      redirectUri: redirect,
    });

    this.restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;Router&gt;
        &lt;Security
          oktaAuth={this.oktaAuth}
          restoreOriginalUri={this.restoreOriginalUri}
        &gt;
          &lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/Profile" component={Profile} /&gt;
        &lt;/Security&gt;
      &lt;/Router&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Version 6.0 of the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> library includes a few changes to be aware of, depending on which version of the package you most recently used.</p>

<p>First, you must provide the <code>restoreOriginalUri</code> property in the <code>&lt;Security&gt;</code> component. If you were previously using version 4.x, you will notice that you need to inject the <code>OktaAuth</code> object into the <code>Security</code> component rather than the issuer, client ID, and other information. You can read more about these changes on <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-react#migrating-between-versions">Okta’s React GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>Here you are also importing the <code>bootstrap</code> CSS.</p>

<p>Finally, you are setting up the routing by wrapping the wouter <code>Router</code> in Okta’s <code>Security</code> component. This will give your routes access to the Okta API.</p>

 Run your React application 

<p>Your application is now complete. You can run it using <code>npm start</code> and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. From there you click the Login button, which will display the Okta login screen. Once you’ve logged in successfully you are redirected to the <code>Profile</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn more about React 

<p>With Okta React v6.0+, you no longer need access to the <code>react-router</code> package to set up routing in your React application. This version should make it easier and cleaner to set up Reach Router, Wouter, or to bypass using a router altogether.</p>

<p>You can find the example code from this tutorial in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-routing-example">oktadev/okta-react-router-example</a> project on GitHub.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Progress is often slowed down because of binary thinking. Binary thinking happens when complex concepts, ideas, and problems are overly simplified into being one side or another.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take me more than 30 seconds to scroll through my Twitter feed to see this type of behaviour in live action. Things get categorized as 100% good or 100% without any conversation around it, leading to divisiveness. We see examples of this very frequently when it comes to political conversations.</p>
<p>I’ve also noticed this type of behaviour within the self-sovereign identity world as well: “Such protocol is good, such protocol is bad”; “Such community is good, such community is bad.”</p>
<p>Now, if we take two communities within the SSI space – the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and the Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). I will sometimes hear people talking positively about one and negatively about the other. But why is this happening? Don’t we all have the same underlying values? Aren’t we all looking to better our lives through digital sovereignty?</p>
<p>I think the answer to this is clear and we need to get away from thinking in a binary manner about anything in our space. And if you really look at the overlap between both these communities: they are quite large.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Full blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@decentralized.identity/a-dif-toip-joint-statement-of-support-for-decentralized-identifiers-dids-v1-0-as-a-w3c-standard-16667ff3dba1">here</a>)</p>
<p>Even within certain communities I sometimes see examples of non-binary thinking: “Bottom-up approaches are good”, “Top-down approaches are bad”. I can confidently say that there is value in both top-down and bottom-up approaches.</p>
<p>If we all agree that there is value in regulated systems that we all participate in every day, then there is likely value in using digital versions of Government-issued IDs. This explains why Governments are taking current physical world trust models and putting them into the digital world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think we can also all agree that Identity is more than a Government-issued ID.&nbsp; This means there are plentiful of opportunities of re-thinking existing trust models and deploying bottom-up approaches that use community or reputational-driven credentials. Getting Discord credentials issued to me because I’m a good developer or a good marketing person is a valuable thing.</p>
<p>There’s a world where both of these co-exist.&nbsp;Nothing is ever completely good or bad.</p>
<p>Non-binary thinking will accelerate digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 Digital Sovereignty – operating in the digital world (or metaverse), with an emphasis on Government’s role in the digital world. 
 Why organizations such as Mozilla, Google, Apple recently objected to the W3C decentralized identifiers standards – does this go against the independence of people? Does it have to do with energy consumption of proof-of-work blockchains? 
 Deciphering Interoperability – there’s a need to focus more of the conversations around portability. Rouven provides some easy to understand examples. 
 What’s happening in the DIF and what are some of the cross-community collaborations 
 Overviewing Top-down and Bottom-up approaches – the differences in governance,&nbsp; the importance of reputation, opening up portable reputations from siloed spaces. 
 What to control and what not to? Where do I fit into a Decentralized ID ecosystem? Some examples of services offerings, including how financial institutions can create new value offerings. 
 Verified vs Verifiable – why these two words are fundamentally different and how they sometimes wrongly used.

<p>As the quest for a Net Zero carbon emission economy and society intensifies, we at Mydex have been asking: how can we&nbsp;help?</p><p>This blog provides our answer, which falls into three categories. One is relatively small but direct. The other, much bigger but indirect. The third, long-term.</p> Paper, paper everywhere <p>The direct contribution is reduced paper use. Every day, millions of letters, statements, forms and documents get moved around manually, eating trees and energy (in paper production, transportation, printing, recycling etc).</p><p>Mydex personal data stores help reduce paper use by digitising data processes. Even though paper use is a relatively small contributor to climate change, accounting for around 1% of CO2 emissions globally, the numbers are still&nbsp;big.</p><p>There are approximately 28m homes in the UK. They each get some form of letter from their local authority once or twice per year, not taking into account social services, education or the electoral roll. The average letter of this type is 4 to 6 pages with all the blurb and well thought out guidance and information linked to the main content of the letter e.g. council tax. If you then add on the other 14 service providers (e.g. Government, Utilities, NHS, Charities, Financial Services) this number multiplies out many times&nbsp;over.</p><p>The numbers become eye-watering. Just take one tiny example: the Lasting Power of Attorney process which is currently being reformed because its costs are ballooning so high. It is now processing some 19 million bits of paper every year in England and Wales and getting overwhelmed by the volume, which is rising&nbsp;rapidly.</p><p>Money-wise, the resulting costs are high. We estimate local authorities spend at least £118m a year producing and sending paper documents to households. Expand this across all UK service providers and the figure quickly reaches £2 billion. Key point: behind every £ in this £2 billion lies a carbon emission.</p> The challenge of alignment <p>The less direct but much bigger potential Mydex contribution lies in reducing wasted and duplicated effort in service provision.</p><p>Every piece of paper that an organisation or individual processes represents just the tip of an iceberg of activities: all the things people and organisations do to plan, organise, coordinate and administer the production, exchange and use of goods and services.</p><p>One core underlying challenge spans them all: the challenge of getting the right things to the right places at the right time. It’s largely taken for granted in most discussions but our economy depends on its ability to do this efficiently. It’s what puts food on supermarket shelves, mobile phones in our hands, Covid vaccines in our bloodstreams. Whatever the detail of the particular product or service that’s being delivered, this underlying logistics challenge of right thing, right place, right time remains essential.</p><p>It brings one big problem with it however: it is very easy to get wrong. Take the simple example of a retailer planning for Christmas. You can very easily order things that don’t sell while not ordering things that would sell. You can order too little (which creates out-of-stocks) or too much (which leaves you with stuff you can’t sell). Or you might have exactly the right number of each item overall, but deliver them to the wrong stores or at the wrong&nbsp;times.</p><p>When such misalignments happen they result in one of two things. Peoples’ needs and wants are not met, even though they could be. Or time, money and energy is invested in producing things that don’t get&nbsp;used.</p><p>In fact, anything less than the perfect alignment of right thing, time and place generates waste at three levels: 1) the time, effort and energy expended in doing things that fail to deliver value; 2) the time, effort and energy expended in trying to correct the mistake, and 3) the time, effort and energy expended in trying to create systems that avoid the first two — such as excessive bureaucracy.</p><p>Result? Wide scale duplicated effort, error and delay, which manifests itself for both people and service providers as FERC — Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost. And here’s the point: behind every instance of unnecessary friction, effort, risk and cost lies both a carbon emission generated for no purpose at all and a financial cost. Pure&nbsp;waste.</p><p>This challenge of efficient logistics is big enough with standardised physical goods. It’s far more acute when it comes to delivering uniquely configured personalised services like health and care, public administration or financial services. Because everything needs to be customised to each individual — the chances of getting something wrong, somewhere along the line, multiply — as do the resulting wasted time, effort and energy (carbon emissions plus financial costs again). This is one of the reasons why these sectors haven’t achieved the same advances in productivity as traditional manufacturing.</p> Data and waste reduction <p>What all this means is that excellent data logistics — getting the right data to and from the right places at the right times — is the key to better operational logistics&nbsp;… which is the key to waste reduction: saved money, reduced carbon emissions. It’s a small tail that wags a very large&nbsp;dog.</p><p>The Economist highlighted this last week in <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/23/a-real-time-revolution-will-up-end-the-practice-of-macroeconomics">a cover story</a> on ‘the real-time revolution’ in economics. “Bad and late data can lead to policy errors that cost millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in lost output”, says its leader on ‘Data and the Economy’. Our growing ability to access better data faster is a “prosaic promise” it notes. But it is “transformative: better, timelier and more rational decision-making”.</p><p>“Troves of timely, granular data are to economics what the microscope was to biology, opening a new way of looking at the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>That’s precisely what Mydex’s personal data logistics infrastructure does: make troves of timely granular personal data available to (and from) the right people at the right time, enabling them to make the right decisions better, quicker, cheaper and to implement these decisions better, quicker, cheaper — saving money and&nbsp;carbon.</p><p>A society’s ability to eliminate the waste caused by wrong-thing, wrong-time, wrong-place processes — friction, unnecessary effort, unnecessary cost, and delay — depends on its available technology and infrastructure. Given one level of tech and infrastructure, you can only go so far in reducing this waste. Mydex’s infrastructure renders previously unavoidable levels of waste and cost avoidable and unnecessary. In doing so, it opens up huge opportunities for efficiency improvements and elimination of unnecessary carbon emissions) at every level, right the way through the provision of every personalised service.</p> How much&nbsp;waste? <p>Exactly how much wasted energy, time and money are we talking about? This is a sadly under-researched area&nbsp;, but here are some pointers:</p>  Research by the economists John Wallis and Douglass C North found that 45% of all US economic activity was devoted to ‘transacting’ where transacting is defined as “the cost of carrying out a transaction by means of an exchange.”  A McKinsey study of ‘interactions’, defined as “the searching, coordinating, and monitoring that people and firms do when they exchange goods, services or ideas” found that on average 50% of all US labour activity is devoted to this&nbsp;task.  In an interview, the former Chairman of the consumer goods giant Unilever Niall Fitzgerald noted that if somebody from Mars asked him to describe his business, he would have to say ‘Well, I spend 50p in every product finding all the raw material, manufacturing a product and putting it in a packet and getting it to the factory gate in a form ready for consumption. I then spend another 50p on everything I do thereafter — marketing, selling, advertising, retailer’s mark-up — the whole lot to get it from the factory gate into the consumer’s home, which could just be across the street by the way. They would say this has to be crackers.”  <p>All of these analyses converge on the same overall figure of around 50%: the proportion of total costs incurred simply trying to match and connect the right people to the right products and services at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>Proportionately speaking, these costs have ballooned over the last century, and continue to balloon. A century ago, 75% of all economic costs went into making things, and only 25% into connecting and ‘transacting’. Today it’s more like 50/50. This is where the next productivity revolution needs to happen. To make it happen we need the sort of data logistics infrastructure that Mydex&nbsp;offers.</p> The long term opportunity <p>Personal data stores also do something else: because they make the individual the point where information about them is integrated, they enable individuals to build up rich, rounded pictures of their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>In the longer term, as individuals’ PDSs mature to cover the necessary data points, it will be possible to calculate (or at least estimate) each individual’s own carbon footprint. Much as financial advice and health treatments deal with the unique details of each individual, this data will act as the raw material for new services that help people identify the best and most painless ways to reduce this footprint — whether relating to behaviour and lifestyle or technology and infrastructure.</p><p>This will help address the common feeling which blocks so much positive action by individuals: the sense of being overwhelmed by complexity and not knowing what to do or how to do&nbsp;it.</p> Genuinely green economic&nbsp;policies <p>The lesson here is that the best ways to achieve a net zero carbon economy are not always directly&nbsp;obvious.</p><p>Most attention is understandably focused on direct ways of reducing carbon emissions: substituting renewable energy sources for fossil fuels; improving insulation of homes, and so on. Of course it’s vital we do these things. But they are not the complete picture. They ignore the way that excess effort including energy use — carbon emissions — are embedded, institutionalised, in the way current service provision works.</p><p>At first sight, investing in infrastructure like personal data stores may seem far removed from a green agenda. But if such infrastructure enables the systemic change just described, then it’s a hugely powerful contribution. As The Economist notes: it may be ‘prosaic’ but it is ‘transformational’.</p> Addendum <p>While good, <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/23/a-real-time-revolution-will-up-end-the-practice-of-macroeconomics">The Economist article</a> is also partial and to that degree misleading and missing the point. Of all the ingredients in the recipe of ‘right data at the right time and right place to drive right decisions and right actions’, it&nbsp;misses:</p>  A large portion of ‘the right time’. It focuses on tech-driven data such as sensors, monitors and financial transactions, but ignores the importance of making old, traditional data (like <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">verified attributes</a>) available at the right time. This is just as, if not even more important.  It talks as if the only ‘right data’ is statistical or analytical data that informs policy decisions, ignoring the operational data needed to take the right actions to implement these decisions.  By focusing on the right policies and ignoring the use of data to improve the operational implementation of these policies, it misses most of the economic benefits actually on&nbsp;offer.  <p>Previous blogs looked at key considerations for <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/deploying-personal-data-stores-at-scale-ad35fb205e73">scaling personal data store infrastructure</a>; necessary <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">design underpinnings</a>; and the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">functionalities we’ve been developing</a> to make our personal data stores both really useful and really easy to&nbsp;use.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-hidden-key-to-carbon-reduction-d5872032fc7d">Data: Hidden key to carbon reduction</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how the ads you see across different sites and social media channels reflect your recent purchases or browsing patterns?</p><p>Well, that’s due to something called surveillance capitalism.</p> What is Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism is a process by which companies collect your browsing and buying patterns to understand your behavior and accordingly, display ads relevant to you. For example, let’s say, you buy a beautiful vase to give your mother on her birthday. Soon, you’ll see vase-related Google ads on any website you visit and similar ads on your Facebook&nbsp;feed.</p><p>Sounds strange? What’s really going on&nbsp;here?</p><p>Some companies like Google and Facebook allow you to access different online services through their login. They use a form of internet identity called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">federated identity</a>, and in the process determine which services you can access through their login. Further, they do mass surveillance of your online activity and capture personal data such as your purchases, search terms you use, the sites you visit, social behavior, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This data is then used to create your online avatar, based on intelligent predictions, and this avatar is sold to third-party companies. The underlying AI-powered engine estimates your age, background, and income potential along with your location-specific data.</p><p>Based on all this information, third-party companies display relevant advertisements to entice you to buy the products shown on the&nbsp;ads.</p><p>Many of us see this as a good thing because you can easily find what you want with little effort. So, what’s the problem&nbsp;here?</p> What’s the Problem with Surveillance Capitalism? <p>Surveillance capitalism infringes your security and privacy in more ways than you imagine because the real commodity that’s being sold here is your personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Further, this data is captured and used in a way where you have little control over it. After all, this is your data and you don’t know where it is stored, how it is used, and where it is displayed. And worse, all these are done for commercial gain by companies that you don’t even&nbsp;know!</p><p>In other words, your data is collected and used by third-party companies for their profits and you’re left in the lurch as you have no control whatsoever!</p><p>The problem with surveillance capitalism is that it can go beyond just marketing products and services. You can be provided certain information consistently to force you to form a desired opinion about economics, politics, etc. In this sense, advertisements can be used to influence your thoughts and behavior in a certain way. A case in point is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/26/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign-us-election-laws">Cambridge Analytica’s</a> handling of Facebook data that is believed to have violated American election laws by swaying people in favor of one candidate.</p><p>All of these go against the basic tenets of privacy as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>So, what can you do about&nbsp;it?</p> Is There an Anti-dote for Surveillance Capitalism? <p>One possible solution can be <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, a new form of digital identity where you have complete control over your data, know where it is stored, and how it is used. You even have the choice to monetize your data if you choose to, and you get to decide to whom you want to sell your data as well. In other words, SSI empowers you to always be in&nbsp;control.</p><p>With SSI, you store your personal data in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital identity wallet</a> that only you can access. When you have to share your data with someone, simply choose the information required by the other person, compile it together, and send it securely.</p><p>Any information you share is protected by digital signatures that comprise a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">private-public key pair</a>. Hence, the chance for a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">data breach</a> reduces&nbsp;greatly.</p><p>Some of the advantages of using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a>&nbsp;are:</p>  You know where your data is&nbsp;stored.  You can choose to share or not share your data with another&nbsp;entity  The data you share is protected cryptographically by digital signatures, so unauthorized personnel can’t easily hack&nbsp;it.  You have the opportunity to monetize your data if you choose&nbsp;to.  You always have complete control over your&nbsp;data.  It protects your privacy and security.  Complies with many privacy and security-related regulations.  You can <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">share just what you want</a> through a principle called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/a-detailed-guide-on-selective-disclosure-87b89cea1602">selective disclosure</a>.  <p>Are these advantages enough to disrupt surveillance capitalism?

  <p>There’s a lot of information out there about adding authentication to your app, which is helpful! But also overwhelming. It can be hard to find relevant and up-to-date information. Security best practices and technologies change, so refreshing your understanding and keeping up with current best practices is a good thing. Here are some notes I took while I reviewed my knowledge and applied my experience implementing auth.</p>

<p></p>

 Prefer OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 

<p>If you’re implementing authentication to a new application, the best practice is to use OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC). The combination of OAuth 2.0 with OIDC provides consistency across many integration providers, standardized ways to access information, and security.</p>

<p>Let’s establish a baseline for the rest of this post by familiarizing ourselves with the basics. This <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc">Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a> is excellent.</p>

<p>What I really like about using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect together is that it separates “the auths” and adds structure to each. We learned from the blog post above that OAuth 2.0 is designed for authorization – access to data (resources). And we learned that OIDC is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0 that adds login and profile information. Thus, authentication is the act of establishing the login session that confirms the user logging in is who they say they are. Now we can be specific in our vocabulary and understand how each standard complements the other.</p>

<p>When you’re using OpenID Connect, don’t forget that you can inspect the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-openid-configuration">OpenID Connect Discovery</a> document to get a listing of endpoints and supported usages. You’ll see references to some of the metadata available in the discovery response below.</p>

<p>Armed with this knowledge, let’s continue!</p>

 Know your tokens 

<p>There are three different tokens at play in OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Depending on the grant type you use (more on that coming up), you might not have all three tokens. It’s good to remember the kinds of tokens you’re working with and what each does. This makes documentation even easier to parse and team conversations less confusing by specifying the exact type of token instead of only using the word “token”.</p>



    
    ID token: The token returned from OpenID Connect containing information about the authentication of the end-user in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/21/beginners-guide-to-jwt">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) format.


    
    Access token: The token returned from OAuth flows that allows you to access the resource. Access tokens returned from Okta are in JWT format.


    
    Refresh token: A long-lived token that you exchange for the short-lived access token. Not all grant types support refresh tokens.



 Claim wisely 

<p>A JWT has the capability to add custom claims to it. Adding custom metadata directly to the payload of access and ID tokens means you can get properties tailored for your application right from the get-go, right? What a great idea! Or is it?</p>

<p>Custom claims are powerful, but remember that the contents of a JWT are visible to anyone who has one, such as an external developer calling your system and potentially the end user. You don’t want to add private information with the expectation that it’s safe from prying eyes. You also don’t want to overload the token with a bunch of custom claims that will bloat the token. Keep your tokens lightweight and make adding custom claims a considered decision.</p>

 Use the right grant type 

<p>I think this is where developers start feeling detail overload. There are different grant types, and depending on who the caller is and what sort of software process you’re working on, the optimal grant type changes. To add further confusion, some grant types (or flows) are OAuth 2.0 standards, and some are from OpenID Connect. Plus, there are updated security practices, and not all blog posts reflect the current recommendations. Yikes! Let’s cut out the extraneous stuff and focus on the need-to-knows.</p>

<p>First, let’s start with listing all the available grant types. We’ll define a high-level overview of each:</p>

<p></p>



    
    Authorization Code is a grant type used by web apps where the source code is private, such as a server-side web app. An authorization code and a client secret are required to get an access token. You can make the authorization code grant type even more secure for server-side web apps by using PKCE as well! More on that below.


    
    Client Credentials is a grant type used for back-end communications, such as API to API. Users aren’t involved in this flow, so there isn’t an ID token available.


    
    Device Code is a grant type primarily used for IoT and smart devices. The flow delegates user authentication and authorization through an external device, such as a smartphone app or browser. Device Code is available as an early access feature in Okta, or follow the steps in this post to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/02/19/add-oauth-device-flow-to-any-server">add OAuth device flow to any server</a>.


    
    Refresh Token is not a grant type, per se. It’s a long-lived token the application may receive to get longer access to resources. Authorization Code, Device Code, Hybrid, and Resource Owner Password flows support refresh tokens if the authorization server is configured to give the app refresh tokens.


    
    Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is a flow to create a secret to use before exchanging the authorization code for tokens. This is not a grant type used on its own, but as an extra layer of security to the Authorization Code flow.


    
    Hybrid is a set of grant types from the OpenID Connect spec. The <code>code id_token</code> flow is the most common and combines two grants. It returns an access token via the Authorization Code grant and an ID token via the Implicit grant.


    
    Implicit is a grant type that used to be recommended for native and JavaScript apps. It is a simplified version of the Authorization Code grant but doesn’t require the authorization code exchange for the access token. Because of the security risks, OAuth 2.0 no longer recommends this grant type and it will be dropped in the upcoming OAuth 2.1 spec.


    
    Resource Owner Password grant type is a flow used by trusted first-party clients. Because of the risks involved in applications directly handling credentials, OAuth 2.0 no longer recommends this grant type and it will be dropped in the upcoming OAuth 2.1. There might be legacy applications requiring this flow, but that’s the only reason to use it.



<p>That’s still a lot of flows! And a lot to keep in mind. We’re busy developers! So let’s distill this down to the preferred grants.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s much better! We now have a reasonable number of grant types to work with: Device Code, Client Credentials, and a combination grant type – Authorization Code with PKCE.</p>


    
        
        Authorization Code with PKCE is the Authorization Code grant type powered by pixies proof key for code exchange. The flow adds a step to first generate a code challenge as an extra layer of security.
    


<p>Now that we have an updated list of recommended grant types, how do we know which one to use? You may need to use multiple grant types in a complete software system depending on the scenario and actors involved. You may have a SPA, a native application, back-end services and processes, and integrations with external parties. Each of these requires consideration for which grant type to use. Don’t worry; by checking the discovery endpoint you’ll know if your identity provider is up to the task of securely handling your needs!</p>

<p>We can use this handy-dandy flow chart to identify which grant type to use:</p>

<p></p>

 Keep it as simple as possible 

<p>We’re busy. And adding authentication and access security to our software is foundational, but it’s not the only feature of the software. As product developers, we need to get auth into the system and have the peace of mind that we’re covered without having to worry about all the details. To keep adding auth simple, use SDKs that already handle all those nitty-gritty details. Okta has SDKs for mobile, front-end, and back-end languages to get going quickly.</p>

<p>What’s that? You say that your needs are a little more complicated than simply adding an Okta SDK to your software system? When you need something more customized, incorporate <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified/">OIDC certified libraries</a> into your system that allow you to still follow auth best practices while implementing custom needs.</p>

 Next steps 

<p>These are the key takeaways that helped me better understand auth and incorporate team discussion points we had when implementing auth in the software system I worked on.

<p>I made this comic the for my friend, Nick. We meet for breakfast a few times a year. Last week was my fist meeting with Nick since leaving SAP, so I knew he'd ask about NuID. Nick is not into crypto, SSI, NFT's, or Web3 at all, he literally asked me "how big is an NFT...is it like a quarter...?" so I wanted to explain it to him in a context we both know well.</p><p>GOLF</p> Identities are a composite of identity <p>Where we are from certainly forms a part of our identity. And, where we are from has an identity of it's own. </p><p>Identities are a composite of what has, and is happening.</p> Recently golf has been on my mind with fall weather arriving in Texas <p>I live in San Antonio with Meagan and "The Girls" (Darby and Piper). San Antonio is a "low profile" kind of town that one might even call it "boring", yet, San Antonio has a lot of historical identity that is pretty cool.</p><p>There are the Missions of San Antonio, one of which is The Alamo. We also happen to have the 5-time NBA Champion (should be 6), San Antonio Spurs we host the PGA GOLF tournament just before The Masters.</p><p>The "<a href="https://www.jbsa.mil/News/News/Article/1090358/foulois-facts-commemorating-the-first-military-flight/">birth of military flight</a>" took place in San Antonio. March 2, 1910 on Ft. Sam Houston and the city is now home to nearly 500,000 active-and-veteran military personnel and the largest Joint Base in the Department of Defense (<a href="https://www.military.com/base-guide/joint-base-san-antonio">JBSA</a>). San Antonio is, Military City, USA.</p> If the US is deploying our military, many are deploying them from San Antonio. If one of our women or men is wounded, they’ll likely come here, to Brooke Army Medical Center. <p>In 1970 my grandfather, <a href="https://dustoff.org/raymond-bosworth/">LTC. Ray Bosworth</a> was transferred from Ft. Rucker, in Alabama to Ft. Sam Houston, where he eventually retired after a three-decade career.</p><p>My uncle, <a href="http://www.virtualwall.org/db/BosworthRP01a.htm">Ray Paul Jr.</a> had been killed, on July 4th, 1968 in Vietnam while the family lived on base in Alabama and my Boz was at the test-board there. Mother Rucker is where all Army-Aviators, who fly helicopters of any kind go to flight school. My father, Joe Jablecki is one of them, as are Boz and Ray.</p><blockquote>LTC Ray-Paul "Boz" Bosworth Sr., LT Raymond Paul Bosworth Jr., PFC Jerry Lee Bosworth, Cecile (Pikor) Bosworth, and my brother Patrick all rest in peace at Ft. Sam Houston National Cemetery. </blockquote><p>The national cemetery is a place that allows the course where I learned GOLF and a lot about life, to use it's land temporarily, separated by only a 4’ tall fence.</p><p>What I mean by "allows" is that that the land is an asset of the cemetery, and it grants temporary-authority to the golf course for it to use until it is needed, for our people.</p> As the cemetery needs land, the golf course loses land. <p><a href="https://www.valero.com/">Valero Energy</a>, sponsors of the Valero Texas Open PGA tournament is another world-class organization, going about their business kind of like the Spurs do. I’m proud to have Valero headquartered here in San Antonio.</p><p>When I was in high school and college my family operated a landscape company that my step-dad, Tom Martin founded and owned. &nbsp;That business led him to knowing <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/sa-obituaries/article/Benninger-excelled-in-business-and-charity-6319581.php">Ed and Nelda Benninger</a> closely during the time that Ed was President of Valero. Ed and Nelda lived in a beautiful home that Tom's company did the original design and landscape, and then many, many additional projects on. </p><p>Tom often joked that "Ed and Nelda put Jason Texas A&amp;M" and the dinner following our wedding-rehearsal was held at Gladys at the Strand, in 2004. The restaurant was amazing and had a fabulous private space, Ed’s Wine Room. Thomas Benninger was owner &amp; executive chef at Gladys..</p><p>The bond that Tom and the Benninger's formed through good business lasted for the rest of both of Ed and Nelda's lives. It was not really grounded in business at all, but about identity and reputation.</p> "Fish rot from the head" <p>Is a phrase I picked up from a talented professional management coach, who's now friend, named Alex Reidl. &nbsp;I hired him to conduct a workshop in Berlin with my leadership team in 2015. I say the phrase to describe something that I instinctively know, which is that that culture starts at the top - at the tip of the spear - with The Leader.</p><p>If I get to the top of an organization and realize there's a leadership problem, I'm done.</p><p>Ed Benninger was outstanding, as a person before he was an outstanding executive. I believe that Ed is still present in their culture today.<br><br>- Jason</p>

 InfoCert’s international expansion go faster and the Company aims to become the European Digital Trust Champion. 

<p>On October 27th 2021, Tinexta S.p.A. announced the signing of a binding agreement for the entry of Bregal Milestone into the share capital of InfoCert, with a minority stake.</p>

<p>Bregal Milestone is a European private equity fund managing more than €1.1 billion invested in technology sector. Bregal Milestone is part of Bregal Investments, a global group that has invested more than €15 billion since 2002 and currently has more than €12 billion in assets under management.</p>

<p>This operation will allow InfoCert to accelerate its ambitious international growth and development plan, which started in 2018 with the acquisition of Camerfirma and continued, more recently, with the acquisition of CertEurope and the investment in Authada. The support of a global partner such as Bregal Milestone, which has a specific know-how in the technology sector and an extensive network in Europe, will foster seizing the opportunities arising from the consolidation process of the Digital Trust.</p>

<p>The transaction involves an investment by Bregal Milestone of 100 million euros for the subscription of a dedicated capital increase up to a total share of 16.09% of InfoCert’s equity.</p>

<p>Combined with the acquisition of CertEurope, the investment of Bregal Milestone allows InfoCert to consolidate its role as a leader in the Digital Trust sector in Europe and at the same time to be able to offer to all its customers, especially in Italy, the best of the solutions and experience gained in over 20 countries.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>Using cloud services has now become an essential component of digital transformation.&nbsp; However, the dominant cloud service providers are not European and, following the recent <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II </a>judgment, transferring personal data to these services has become increasingly problematic. This is just one factor behind the increased interest in the idea of the sovereign cloud.</p>
 The Impact of Globalisation 
<p>Globalization has provided many benefits allowing nation-states and organizations to obtain what they need, when they need it from wherever it is cheapest. This has reduced the costs for citizens and businesses alike but has created an increased dependency on ever more extended supply chains.&nbsp; The COVID epidemic and subsequent supply chain disruptions have called this approach into question. The notion of the sovereign cloud needs to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>Cloud sovereignty involves several areas, these include but are not limited to the protection of personal data. It also includes the protection of intellectual property, commercial secrets, as well as other forms of sensitive information. It concerns the influence that service users have over the legal frameworks that bind the service through a say in government. Also, their confidence in service continuity not only in the event of natural disasters but also of geopolitical conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
 The Sovereign Cloud 
<p>The idea behind the sovereign cloud is to ensure that the services provided are within the control of the jurisdiction where it is used. This can be achieved in several ways through legal, and technical measures as well as physical location. Within Europe, there are already <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80900/european-hosted-hybrid-iaas-cloud/">several cloud services</a> that are locally owned and delivered.&nbsp; However, these services find it hard to compete against the level of functionality provided by the global hyper-scale cloud services and the economies of scale that they enjoy.&nbsp; Therefore, using purely local providers often involves increased costs and or reduced functionality.</p>
<p>Another approach is for state-sponsored projects.&nbsp; However, these have a chequered history when it comes to innovation and, in any case, the richness of the existing hyper-scale cloud services leaves an enormous gap to close.&nbsp; Therefore, quite sensibly, the European <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIAX project</a> does not seek to replace the existing cloud services but rather to increase local control.&nbsp; Google, together with other hyper-scale cloud providers, is a founding member of GAIAX.</p>
 Privacy of Personal Data 
<p>This Schrems II judgment has crystallized the risks around the privacy of personal data highlighting the differences in the rules between jurisdictions.&nbsp; The consequences of this judgment are still being played out and can be very disruptive.&nbsp; For example, the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/census-2021-portuguese-dpa-cnpd-suspended-data-flows-usa_en">Portuguese Information Commissioner gave the Portuguese Census Office</a> twelve hours’ notice to cease and desist from using a US based cloud service.</p>
<p>The use of cloud services that are owned and operated by providers that are outside the jurisdiction where they are used creates a risk.&nbsp; This is that a provider in another jurisdiction may be legally obliged to obey instructions from their government and that this foreign government is not bound by commercial contracts made by providers with organizations outside of that jurisdiction.&nbsp; This risk is highlighted by the Schrems II judgment.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Board recommendations identify three points at which the privacy of data can be compromised – during transfer, at rest in storage, and while being processed.&nbsp; The recommendations cover contractual tools such including standard data protection clauses (SCCs), binding corporate rules (BCRs), codes of conduct, certification mechanisms, and ad hoc contractual clauses.&nbsp; The EDPB also provided an updated <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-12021-standard_en">Joint Opinion 1/2021 on standard contractual clauses between controllers and processors</a>.&nbsp; In addition, the EDPB recommendations require supplementary technical measures and describe three approaches for which example use cases are provided.&nbsp; These technical steps include encryption, pseudonymization and multi-party computing.</p>
 Four Key areas of Sovereignty 
<p>There are four key areas of sovereignty which should be considered.&nbsp; These are data sovereignty, operational sovereignty, technical sovereignty, and sovereign ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data sovereignty – the customer should have control over the access to and the use of their data.&nbsp; This is what the technical measures from the EDPB are intended to enforce.&nbsp; Since many data processing regulations specify this, the customer should also have control over the physical location of their data and administrative access by cloud service administrators.&nbsp; With the exception of the location of administrators, data sovereignty is supported by all the major IaaS providers although not all customers make full use of the controls provided.</p>
<p>Operational sovereignty – this is control over the jurisdiction where the administration of the service and its infrastructure is conducted.&nbsp; The EDPB technical measures are intended to mitigate that lack of this control.&nbsp; The major CSPs now offer a form of “cloud in a box” which the customer can locate and administer wherever they wish.&nbsp; Other clouds are working to enable third party administration through partnerships with managed service providers in certain regions.&nbsp; The major hardware manufacturers also provide a partial solution offering hardware as a service where the customer rents capacity in dedicated servers that are located where the customer chooses.</p>
<p>Technical Sovereignty – the customer is able to develop, deploy, move, and manage their workloads with the minimum of disruption. While there is significant openness in application development environments, the major hyperscale clouds are built on proprietary technical stacks and this makes it hard to move a workload to another cloud.&nbsp; It also makes it hard to manage the hybrid multi-cloud and on-premises IT environment that is now common in most organizations.&nbsp; There is a need for standard interfaces that customers can use to build, deploy, manage, and optimize their workloads independently of the cloud service used.&nbsp; This is still work in progress with VMware, OpenStack, Anthos, RedHat OpenShift all offering some level of solution to some of the problems.</p>
<p>Sovereign Ownership – the infrastructure used to provide the cloud service is normally owned by the CSP.&nbsp; This means that even if it is located in a given geography its use could be withdrawn by the CSP in the event of geopolitical conflict.&nbsp; Even if it were to be seized by a government the knowledge and external infrastructure required would make it difficult to make it operational.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>Most of the discussion around the sovereign cloud has focussed on data sovereignty and, while this is important, there are other areas that need to be considered to provide a fully sovereign cloud.&nbsp; For most organizations, the major driver for sovereignty is the need for compliance. In this respect, all the major CSPs provide or support substantial technical and contractual controls. However, the technical controls available are not always fully exploited by cloud customers.&nbsp; Recently announced partnerships which enable allow a local service provider to deliver a version of a global service provide a solution to some of the operational sovereignty concerns.&nbsp; However, it remains to be seen whether these will actually work out in practice. &nbsp;Where full sovereignty is required, there are other factors that need to be considered. The trade-off between functionality, cost and all the four aspects of sovereignty is one that organizations need to consider when deciding on how to deploy their applications.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Andrzej Kawalec, Head of Cybersecurity at Vodafone Business, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4921">Ransomware: What Happens When the Tech Stops?</a> on Thursday November 11 from 09:30 pm to 09:50 am at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Andrzej some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your Keynote: “Ransomware: What Happens When the Tech Stops?” 
<p>I'm really excited to be able to share with you a discussion about genuinely how we have become critically dependent on technology and in our day to day lives and our professional lives, when and how cybercriminals are able to turn off our technology and disrupt our lives. I think it's a key issue for us all to think about. In the talk, we'll talk a little bit about how not just ransomware, but cybercrime has evolved to become genuinely one of the greatest challenges and threats I think society faces. We'll also talk a little bit about the risk that we face, who are our targets? Are we all targets? And then what we can do not if but when we experience digital disruption. I find it one of the most fascinating subjects to think about, and I really look forward to sharing that with you.</p>
 How was it possible that Ransomware evolved into Ransomware as a service (RaaS), a fully functional business with a highly developed criminal ecosystem? 
<p>What one of the most fascinating aspects of how ransomware is involved is actually how the criminal world has evolved. If we think about the poster children for digital disruption, Uber, Netflix and the like. For me, the most significant digital disruptive industry is the cybercrime industry. Cybercrime has overtaken the global illegal drugs trade, and it is an industry that is characterized by brutal innovation.</p>
<p>It's an ecosystem, globally connected, using cloud based and SaaS technologies to prosecute operations in any country against any person in the world, built upon anonymity and an anonymous and untraceable currency. I don't think it's a surprise at that point that we are facing a pandemic of ransomware using some of the most understood and groundbreaking technologies. So, ransomware as a service is just an example of how that global cybercrime industry has been able to out innovate the digital adoption and normal industry.</p>
 How can employees be both your weakest link and first line of defense? 
<p>One of the things that we often do in technology and in business is we think about the process and the systems and the technologies, but actually at the heart of all the value that's created are people. Digital value is only created when you when a person can access data and those two things come together. Cyber criminals understand that and target the individual, the user, the employee. What we often do as a security industry is think about ways to protect or help that user. What we actually need to do is think of them not as a weak link, but actually as a first line of defense.</p>
<p>And increasingly, if I think about in a mid and post-pandemic world where individuals and users are being, you know, are really being pushed to their homes to hybrid working models, they are at the frontline of security, not just for themselves, but their families and their employers and the people they collaborate and partner with. So, employees, people, individuals are absolutely our first line of defense and our best hope when it comes to thinking and dealing with these threats, not just dealing with them, but also recovering from them. Now security is both a boardroom issue now, but also a spare room issue as we all work from its bearings and in places all around the world. A key focus and a key area that we will talk about is how you focus on the individual, the user, the person who creates the value.</p>
 Should you pay ransom? 
<p>One of the biggest questions anybody can face. Should you pay ransom? The FBI say no. Europol say no. By paying ransom, you perpetuate the cybercriminal industry and you finance illegal activity. It's not that black and white. It really isn't that black and white. For me, the failure is that the vast majority of organizations that do pay a ransom, I think only 6% get all their data back. They don't reduce their disruption significantly.</p>
<p>But the difficult choice that an organization or an individual has to make, is exactly that, it's a very difficult choice, and I think people will choose to pay a ransom, even though it feels uncomfortable and morally or legally difficult because they don't feel they have another choice. Everything we should do is to give individuals and organizations the ability to make a choice about whether to pay ransom or not. But I completely agree with the FBI and Europol and most organizations that say, you shouldn't pay ransom, you will not get all your data back and you are funding an illegal enterprise and industry.</p>

  <p>Greetings Oktaverse! I’m Tanay 🖖</p>

<p>I have been following Okta for many years, and I am very excited to finally join you all and get a chance to serve this wonderful community.</p>

<p>First things first, here’s a picture of me so that you can recognize me and say hi the next time we meet. 👇</p>

<p></p>

 Who I am and what I’ve done so far 

<p>I started my journey into the world of tech communities and open source back in college when I came across <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I got the chance to participate in a lot of their projects and regional community-building initiatives. Over time, I fell in love with writing and have published books on Firefox OS, virtual assistants with Raspberry Pi, and WebVR.</p>

<p>During my last years in college, I got the chance to join the Tech Speakers program by Mozilla, and I dove head-first into the realm of public speaking. After wrapping up my studies, I moved to Berlin and worked with start-ups like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/">ResearchGate</a>, <a href="https://crate.io/">Crate.io</a>, and <a href="https://n8n.io/">n8n</a>.</p>

<p> Image from <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/community/2020/09/03/five-years-of-tech-speakers/">Mozilla’s blog</a></p>

<p>Before joining Okta, I have been responsible for building a developer relations team from scratch and managing the various facets of developer relations like docs, user on-boarding, support, partnerships, certifications, and community building.</p>

<p>I love geeking out about space exploration, submarines, science, and Lego models. Next on my reading list are:</p>
 
   Letters from an Astrophysicist by Neil deGrasse Tyson 
   Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker 
   The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups by Daniel Coyle 
 

<p>Do you have any book recommendations for me? 🤓</p>

 What I’ll be doing at Okta 

<p>I am fortunate to have worked with some of the most vibrant developer communities and individuals across the globe. I hope to use all the skills and knowledge I have acquired to help you get started and succeed with Okta.</p>

<p>As a result of my experiences, my operating style in developer relations is motivated by the urge to:</p>
 
   Share fascinating things that I have recently learned 
   Serve my communities by empathetically understanding their pain points 
   Enable my communities to be their best selves and become successful 
 

<p>You’ll be hearing a lot more from me on topics around security and identity. I am also very excited to work on educational resources for you all in my favorite languages: JavaScript and Python.</p>

<p>Is there anything you’d like me to create or focus on first? 🧑‍🚀</p>

 How to get in touch 

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/tanay1337">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanay1337/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tanay1337/">GitHub</a>. You can also write to me via my email <code>tanay.pant@okta.com</code>.</p>

<p>Please do reach out and let me know how I can enable you and support you with being the best at what you do! 🙌</p>

 Reference Libraries 

<p>Some of our most important work at Blockchain Commons is on specifications that improve the interoperability and resilience of cryptocurrency wallets. Our reference libraries allow developers to incorporate those specifications into their own code.</p>

<p>SSKR Security Review. However, there’s one more thing required before our libraries can be used in production releases: security reviews. Our vision is that third-party developers using our libraries will work with us to contract a security review from a third-party. They can take advantage of all the libraries already reviewed, and then they can increase that selection with a review of their own. Our sustaining sponsor, <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, began that process this quarter by arranging a security review for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a> libraries through <a href="https://radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security (ROS)</a>.</p>

<p>The folks at ROS tested our software and noted potential security problems. We then worked with them to close all issues that we felt were a priority. Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to transparency, we have published the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/reviews/2021-security-review.pdf">review</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md">response</a>, which includes a listing of issues that we resolved, as well as those we did not (and why). Thanks to this review, we feel that the <code>bc-shamir</code> and <code>bc-sskr</code> libraries are the first of our reference libraries ready for production deployment.</p>

<p>Project Nayuki Port. We also released a minor new utility library, a port of the Project Nayuki QR library into Swift as <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/QRCodeGenerator">QRCodeGenerator</a>. We’d discovered that Apple’s native iOS QR generation is inefficient for QR codes where individual segments require different optimization. Nayuki does the right thing, by individually optimizing each segment, so we ported it over as a replacement for the native Apple libraries, for use in our own code and by other developers.</p>

 Reference Apps 

<p>Our reference apps provide exemplar use of our specifications (and libraries).</p>

<p>SeedTool Updates. The release of Seedtool was one of our big events in Q2. In Q3 we’ve continued that work through two notable upgrades, releasing <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/README.md#version-history">1.1 in July, 1.2 in August, and 1.2.1 in September</a>. Some of the biggest updates included arbitrary key derivation, preset SSKR schemes, and developer functions that make it easier to test out QR &amp; UR-based requests and responses. We also added our first Ethereum support, through the ability to derive Ethereum private keys and addresses from your stored seeds. Our updated <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/blob/master/Docs/MANUAL.md">SeedTool Manual</a> describes all of the latest functionality.</p>

<p>QRTool Updates. Seedtool wasn’t the only reference app to get attention; <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QRTool</a> also received some minor updates in July, though those largely took the form of minor bug fixes. Updating QR Tool to use the Project Nayuki library port will be our next big update for QR Tool, sometime in the future.</p>

 Bitcoin Utilities 

<p>Other utilities make it easier to use Bitcoin and other blockchain and crypto-technology.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Standup Updates. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup-Scripts">Bitcoin Standup</a> was one of Blockchain Commons’ first releases. It automates the installation of a secure Bitcoin Core setup on a Debian Linux device or virtual machine . However, Bitcoin Core is always changing, requiring occasional updates. Our newest version of Bitcoin Standup, 0.8.0, updates the scripts to work well with Bitcoin Core 22.0 (which made some changes to its code signing).</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin Standup 0.8.0 does more than that. We’ve always imagined Standup as an engine that can install a wide variety of cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, and the new version of Standup offers the opportunity for the first such addition: <a href="https://cypherpunkpay.org/">cypherpunkpay</a>, an easy and accessible server for receiving Bitcoin payments. This addition, though just a starting point, was one of the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a> projects initiated by our 2021 interns, to offer cyryptocurrency support for activists.</p>

<p>Gordian Server Officially Released. Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS">Gordian Server</a> project took Bitcoin Standup as a jumping-off point and offered the same ability to easily install Bitcoin Core on the more accessible macOS UI. Like Bitcoin Standup it’s intended as the heart of a self-sovereign setup, where you can control both your wallet and your server. We released Gordian Server in some preliminary versions in 2020, but we’ve now polished it to improve its stability and ease of use, and have released it as the Feature-Complete <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianServer-macOS/releases/tag/v1.0.0">1.0.0</a>. Like our newest Standup release, this version of Gordian Server has also been updated to work correctly with Bitcoin Core 22.0.</p>

 Learning Resources 

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ goals has always been to improve the developmental understanding of Bitcoin. We also extend that goal to our own releases by working to make our specifications as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our popular <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a> has brought numerous developers into the industry. We’re thus thrilled to offer complete translations in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a>. This enormous amount of work was the product of a number of volunteers, some of whom were also working with us as interns, which means that the <a href="https://hrf.org/">HRF</a> should again be thanked for their support. We hope that these translations will help bring Bitcoin development to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world, which seems particularly important given El Salvador’s recent move to Bitcoin as a currency. (Learning Bitcoin also enjoyed quite a few minor edits as a result of the translations, as well as updates to include i2p and some recent revisions, resulting in our release of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases/tag/v2.1.0">version 2.1</a>; we’ve also got plans for <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/TODO-30.md">3.0</a>.)</p>

<p>New SSKR Docs. Shamir’s Secret Sharing is a critical element of #SmartCustody in today’s digital-assets world, which is why our SSKR library received our first security review. We’ve also been expanding our docs to talk more about how and why to use secret sharing (and why not to). Our newest <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-overview.md">SSKR docs</a> include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">Designing SSKR Share Scenarios</a>, which discusses many models for sharing (including all of the default scenarios now found in SeedTool), and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Dangers.md">SSKR Dangers</a>, which talks about why we ultimately prefer multisigs to secret-sharing.</p>

 Building to Specifications &amp; Laws 

<p>Specifications and supportive references are the first steps in bringing new ideas to the industry. To reach their fullest potential, those ideas eventually have to become something more …</p>

<p>DID Standardization. The DID specification, which is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">1.0 candidate recommendation</a> for an international standard, is our next big technical step forward for self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, big centralized companies such as Apple and Google have taken notice and unsurprisingly raised complaints. We’ve offered some support with language and with championing the hard work already done, though the heavy lifting continues to be done by the editors, including Drummond Reed, Manu Sporny, Amy Guy, and Markus Sabadello.</p>

<p>Principal Authority. Many specifications and standards need legal support to reach their fullest potential. Our work in Wyoming has resulted in the state legislature arriving at a legal definition of digital identity that centers on the concept of principal authority. This quarter, we released <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Principal-Authority/">a paper</a> on how principal authority defines self-sovereign identity, and what the next steps are. (We also presented the paper and testified about it to the Wyoming legislature.)</p>

<p>eResidency &amp; Other Testimony. Overall, we’ve been thrilled to be working with Wyoming, creating some of the first and best laws for supporting blockchains, cryptocurrency, digital identity, and digital companies. In a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2021/S19-2021092109-01E-Residency.pdf">recent presentation</a>, we urged them to leverage the infrastructure they’ve created into an eResidency program that can extend these benefits to companies worldwide. In other testimony for Wyoming, North Dakota, Texas, and the Netherlands we have provided support new laws for DAOs, updates to GDPR regulations and have advised how to avoid vendor lock-in and future-proof technology.</p>

 Other Future Expansions 

<p>Finally, we’re also looking to the future in other ways.</p>

<p>Ethereum Expansion. As noted, we’ve expanded Gordian SeedTool to support Ethereum key derivations. We’ve also been experimenting with selling some self-sovereign-identity NFTs to raise funds for Blockchain Commons. Generally, this all demonstrates our goal of bringing many of our philosophies, architectures, and models to the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we believe that #SmartCustody, and especially SSKR, could help Ethereum, which has a lot of its own challenges for responsible key management, such as the lack of true multisig. If you’d like to support our expansion into Ethereum, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a> and let us know why you did (or watch for upcoming NFT auctions!).</p>

<p>Second Intern Program. Finally, we’ve just completed our second summer’s intern program, and we’re thrilled to have another batch of interns who we helped to introduce to the world of blockchain development and who in turn helped us push forward projects such as our Learning Bitcoin translations and revisions. They also: produced a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Secure-Development-Setup-macOS">secure development setup guide</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Pseudonymity-Guide">pseudonymity guide</a> that offered more support for activists and HRF; developed a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli program</a> for leaving behind your digital assets; worked on creating a stable version of Esplora; and more. Some of our 2021 interns have already gone on to other paid work in the field; we’re looking forward to seeing what they create next!</p>

<p>Thank you, as always, for your interest in Blockchain Commons and the improvement of the entire blockchain field. If you like what we’re doing, we again encourage you to become a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">Github sponsor</a> so that we can continue forward with our work of making the industry independent, private, interoperable, and resilient!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p>Digital identity is a core element of business, more essential than ever before as the workforce becomes increasingly more mobile. The key to enable more efficient work is to remove barriers to onboarding and access for employees within the organization, and those partners, suppliers, and contractors outside the organization while adding additional security to the onboarding and lifecycle management of identities. A way to do this is to leverage a network of trusted identities. This whitepaper discusses the approach to operationalizing validated identity data for enterprise workforce use.

<p>As we know, regulations are specific rules that are created and maintained by authorities. They apply to nearly every aspect of life, but within the gambling sector, they play a key role. Due to the nature of the industry where lives can be impacted through bad decisions and abuse, certain rules and limitations need to be made to ensure a safe playing field for users and operators alike.</p>
<p>However, one key issue that affects everyone in this sector is the speed at which technology advances, making it impossible for regulations to keep up with these developments. One of the most recent examples of this is the growing popularity of online gambling, which faces issues with cybercrime and fraud. In some cases, there are even gaps between old regulation and modern technologies – something that we at IDnow are collaborating with regulators to solve.</p>
 A look at Germany’s new Gambling regime 
<p>A great example to look at concerning regulations is Germany. The country has recently opened up online gambling with the introduction of a new treaty – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/glucksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielneuregulierungstaatsvertrag (GlüNeuRStV)</a>, alongside a new authority, Saxony Anhalt.</p>
<p>One key thing that surrounds these new regulations is the focus on player safety, as well as AML and KYC compliance requirements. It’s vital for operators to know who their users are, ensure proper verification is put in place, prevent at-risk users from participating, and combat fraud where possible.</p>
<p>In fact, in order to get and maintain a license, operators will need to demonstrate a robust age verification solution, alongside other KYC checks and meeting certain AML requirements.</p>
 Meeting KYC and AML requirements around Europe 
<p>To meet these strict requirements, both in Germany and across Europe, operators will need to invest in setting up proper, robust systems. The key focus of these systems are player protection and operator security – it’s vital to both keep players safe and secure, while also combatting things like fraud.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to list every requirement for compliance all around Europe, as every country and its regulators will have differences in opinions and what’s needed. However, one way for any operator to meet requirements on a wide scale is through remote eKYC solutions, which are flexible in meeting a wide range of requirements.</p>
<p>The best way of doing this is by working with a partner that specializes in KYC and AML compliance and is able to bring a wide range of tools to the table. Some of the most important requirements that must be met include controlling player activity through exclusions, meeting security and risk-management standards, preventing fraud, and meeting customer needs by mitigating risks and providing seamless onboarding.</p>
 Are Operator and Regulator Aims Meeting Consumer Requirements? 
<p>With so many different requirements needing to be met by operators to be compliant with regulator rules there comes a key question: What about the consumer? When it all comes down to it, for both the operator and the regulator the consumers are the most important party.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s vital to discuss how current operator and regulator aims impact the consumer and if they’re meeting ever-changing requirements. The most important thing to consider is that there are many different types of consumers – there are young, old, experienced, and new players that all need to be considered.</p>
<p>With a step forward into online gaming, you need to not only consider ease of access for players who may not be accustomed to online content, but also keep in mind the younger tech-savvy audience. For example, regulators and operators alike need to consider a whole new avenue of online-based fraud and ensure players are protected from it as best as possible.</p>
<p>Customers will also have specific requirements which may not be a key priority for both operators and regulators. Considering current trends globally, there is a key focus on things being quick and easy. Consumers (especially younger customers) require a seamless experience, many users want to be able to play a game or place a quick bet while on the train or bus, as well as being able to register in an instant.</p>
<p>There is also a key focus on security, especially surrounding data. It’s a vital point for the consumer to know that their data is being safely stored and meeting things like GDPR requirements.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in all this is that while operators and regulators would like to meet all of their consumers’ needs and more, it’s incredibly difficult to keep up with the pace of technology. Operators struggle to keep up with requirements as staying compliant has to be a key focus, while it’s impossible for regulators to know what will come next.</p>
<p>There is a definite overlap in some consumer requirements and current operator and regulator aims, such as a growing focus on security, however, it’s also easy to see consumer requirements, like lightning-fast onboarding, being pushed aside.</p>
 Automated ID Verification’s role in gaming 
<p>One key way to aid both operators and regulators in meeting consumer requirements is through automated ID Verification. This is a way to provide a seamless onboarding process for new players by providing fast, AI-Powered identity verification, such as our very own AutoIdent.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> covers both current operator and regulator aims, as well as customer requirements. It has a key focus on speed, usability, and security, while being a fully compliant verification tool. With AutoIdent, users can be verified within minutes, with a very simple process, solving both usability and speed requirements for consumers, while remaining compliant, reducing stress on operators and regulators, while meeting their aims for online services.</p>
<p>Overall, automated verification looks to be the way forward and is already becoming commonplace for operators and regulators alike. The UK’s gambling commission already recommends looking into AI-Powered services for onboarding processes and many operators have moved to such a system.</p>
<p>This benefits every party involved in the process, from making consumers’ lives easier, to reducing waiting times and increasing conversion rates, while keeping a high level of security.</p>

<p>Today, virtually every country is impacted by substandard or falsified drugs entering their system, from generics to more expensive treatments for cancer and pain management. And the full extent of this problem is not known – but the WHO conservatively estimates that 200 million people are affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up to 2 billion people around the world don’t have reliable access to essential medicines and health products: leaving a vacuum too often filled by substandard or falsified products. The W.H.O. estimates that for low and middle income countries (LMICs)<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products"> one in 10 medical products</a> is substandard. This costs billions upon billions of dollars per year, eye-watering sums that pale in comparison to the human cost: annually, 200,000 lives are lost in Africa to fake antimalarial drugs alone. </p>
<p>This is a global problem that is growing as supply chains become more complex with multiple steps in distribution compounded by the rise in online sales of pharmaceuticals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we’ve partnered with the Distributed Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab (<a href="https://padproject.nd.edu/get-involved/distributed-pharmaceutical-analysis-lab/">DPAL</a>) of the <a href="https://science.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a> to reduce the damage to public health from substandard or falsified drugs by speeding up and expanding the process whereby they are identified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership will harness our <a href="https://artifacts.ai/how-it-works/">Web 3.0 technology</a> to:</p>
 
 Make all relevant information directly available online for researchers and regulatory authorities&nbsp; 
 Create a trusted and secure chain-of-custody of drug samples and their metadata&nbsp; 
 Scale-up across the DPAL participant community&nbsp; 
 Deliver actionable findings that contribute to improved public health outcomes 
 
 Void of authority for post-market surveillance&nbsp; 
<p>Currently, there is no single global authority for monitoring the quality of generic medicine. And this lack of post-market, sustained and scaled system for collecting, testing, analyzing and providing real-time feedback to public authorities, distributors, and manufacturers hurts everyone. &nbsp;Study after study reveals pervasive poor quality and products that are worthless or even harmful to patients. Many countries in the developing world do not have the technological infrastructure or regulatory resources to keep low quality medicines off the shelves. And since the pharmaceutical trade is a lucrative global market, low quality medicine can cross borders and harm people anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>This is why ARTiFACTS has teamed up with the DPAL program at Notre Dame. Together, we will make the process of managing and conducting post-market surveillance more efficient: helping to reduce the prevalence of fake drugs in the market. The partnership will provide the framework to accelerate testing of samples collected which is necessary to expand the coverage of countries and products that can be analyzed.&nbsp;</p>
 How did we get here?&nbsp; 
<p>A major factor that allows substandard or falsified drugs to penetrate supply chains across the developing world is the scarcity of regulatory and laboratory resources to conduct effective post-market surveillance. In 2014, the University of Notre Dame formed the Distributed Pharmaceutical Analysis Lab (DPAL) to expand testing of pharmaceutical dosage forms sourced directly from local pharmacies in participating countries.</p>
<p>DPAL provides high quality, validated&nbsp; chemical analysis of pharmaceutical samples from partners in the developing world.&nbsp; In collaboration with Chemists Without Borders DPAL uses analytical resources at academic institutions in the US to perform characterization of suspect medications that have been collected and screened in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, India, Nepal, or Malawi.</p>
<p>Made up from a network of 29 academic institutions across the US and around the world, DPAL has invented and successfully deployed a low-cost screening tool used in the field for processing thousands of samples to date. Paper analytical devices (PADs) are test cards that can quickly determine whether a drug tablet likely contains the correct medicines. They are cheap and easy to use, and don’t require power, chemicals, solvents, or any expensive instrument: so they can be deployed rapidly at large scale wherever a problem with pharmaceutical quality is suspected.</p>
<p>Following this initial success, and to further their mission to remove substandard or falsified drugs from LMICs markets, DPAL is now looking to scale up in order to gather more data, better understand statistical significance, and provide faster – even real-time – feedback to authorities to impact public health. The ARTiFACTS system will efficiently capture and record the physical location and scientific metadata produced as tasks are performed throughout the analysis cycle, enabling a dramatic step-up of the volume of samples processed.</p>
 No time to waste – why scaling up matters&nbsp; 
<p>Around the developing world governments, health departments and universities are working together to tackle this crisis with the ultimate goal of eliminating fake drugs from the market. But to achieve this, it’s first critical to understand where and how these drugs are getting to consumers in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hunt for falsified prescription drugs begins at pharmacies across the developing world. Secret shoppers sent out by local universities collect samples which are returned to the labs for initial testing. The samples and their results are recorded, bagged, and tagged – and separated into two groups. One set of samples will stay in-country and be sent to the relevant National Public Health Authority, and the other will be shipped over to the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame, where further tests are conducted and the results reported back to the relevant National Public Health Authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-initiative-launches-to-attack-problem-of-substandard-generic-drug-distribution-301404185.html">partnership with ARTiFACTS</a>, University of Notre Dame and the DPAL community will be able to reach more countries, assess more samples, and more efficiently deliver results to public health bodies in-country. Operating at scale will allow the DPAL research to improve public health outcomes by contributing meaningfully to post-market surveillance of pharmaceuticals in LMICs and beyond.&nbsp;</p>

<p>America’s leading non-profit privacy advocate, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and">EFF</a>) has slammed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6058?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22SHOP+Safe+Act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1">SHOP SAFE Act</a>&nbsp;before Congress as good in theory but fairly ridiculous in practice, especially for privacy.</p>



<p>The EFF calls out as a significant privacy risk the proposed requirement to have ecommerce platforms verify the identity, address and contact information of any third party seller who uses their services. It argues that requiring a seller of any good online, including used goods (think mom and dad running a garage sale) to send their driver’s license or other government ID to the platform before making a listing unnecessarily exposes their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;to the platform. And given the broad nature of the Bill, the selling platform in this case could be anything from eBay, Amazon, Facebook and Craigslist to Gmail and other email providers if the seller decides to make the sale via email (e.g. if they sell a used bike to a colleague using email).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Imagine if you had to provide a copy of your driver’s license to Craigslist just to advertise your garage sale or sell a used bike. As over the top as that seems, it’s even worse when you think about how this would apply to services like Gmail or Facebook. Should you really have to provide ID to open an email account, just in case you sell something using it? Requirements like this threaten not only competition but user privacy, too,” the EFF writes.</p>



<p>The bipartisan Stopping Harmful Offers on Platforms by Screening Against Fakes in E-Commerce (SHOP SAFE) Act was&nbsp;<a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4566">introduced</a>&nbsp;to Congress in March 2020 to protect consumers from the online sale of harmful counterfeit products. If the Bill passes, online marketplaces could be held liable for injury and damages suffered from these products. The way around being held liable is if the third party seller can be served a lawsuit in the United States or the platform meets 10 requirements before the counterfeit item is sold. The first of the 10 requirements is that the platform has “verified the identity, place of business, and contact information of third-party seller against governmental and other reliable sources.” Another requirement is that the platform has “conspicuously displayed the seller’s place of business, contact information, and identity along with manufacture location and shipping origin of the goods.” You can see the privacy risks to the mom and dad just wanting to offload some old books and clothes.</p>



<p>The Bill aims to offer ecommerce platforms incentives for more thoroughly checking third party sellers and hold those platforms liable for allowing dangerous counterfeits (e.g. a toy that breaks down and becomes as health hazard) to be sold. But while the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/shop-safe-another-attempt-fix-big-tech-will-mostly-harm-small-players-and">EFF</a>&nbsp;says protecting the consumer from dodgy products is a noble goal, it’s a case of hurting the consumer with a law that’s meant to help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redpoints.com/blog/everything-you-should-know-about-the-shop-safe-act/">commentators</a>&nbsp;say the SHOP SAFE Act has little chance of passing into law unless the increase in cybercrime and counterfeit products seen during the pandemic prompts lawmakers to tighten the screws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our perspective, this Bill is yet another challenge in the ongoing battle to protect consumer privacy, but we can offer some protection through&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>. Sure, there would be no way around having to submit a verifiable name and address via government ID, but using a MySudo phone number and email address instead of their personal details when they contact the ecommerce platform at least limits the amount of personal information they expose. Check out&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;consumer app and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;for delivering the same types of capability to customers.&nbsp;</p>

 Prosegue il processo di internazionalizzazione di InfoCert che si candida a diventare l’operatore leader nel Digital Trust a livello europeo 



<p>27 ottobre 2021, Tinexta S.p.A. annuncia la sottoscrizione di un accordo vincolante per l’ingresso nel capitale sociale di InfoCert, con una quota di minoranza, di Bregal Milestone.</p>



<p>Bregal Milestone è un fondo di private equity europeo che gestisce più di 1.1 miliardi di euro dedicati a investimenti nel settore tecnologico, parte di Bregal Investments, gruppo globale che ha investito più di 15 miliardi di euro dal 2002 e che ha attualmente in gestione attivi per oltre 12 miliardi di euro.</p>



<p>Questa operazione consentirà ad InfoCert di accelerare l’ambizioso piano di crescita e sviluppo internazionale avviato nel 2018 con l’acquisizione di Camerfirma e, più di recente, con l’acquisizione di CertEurope e l’investimento in Authada. L’affiancamento di un partner di respiro globale come Bregal Milestone, che vanta un know how specifico nel settore tecnologico e un esteso network relazionale di aziende in Europa, permetterà di cogliere le opportunità derivanti dal processo di consolidamento del settore del Digital Trust.</p>



<p>L’operazione prevede un investimento di Bregal Milestone pari a 100 milioni di euro per la sottoscrizione di un aumento di capitale dedicato fino ad una quota complessiva pari al 16.09% del capitale di InfoCert.</p>



<p>Insieme all’acquisizione di CertEurope, l’investimento di Bregal Milestone consente ad InfoCert di consolidare il ruolo di leader nel settore del Digital Trust a livello europeo e allo stesso tempo di poter offrire a tutti i propri clienti, in particolare in Italia, il meglio delle soluzioni e delle esperienze maturate negli oltre 20 Paesi in cui operiamo.</p>

 Eine Diskussionsrunde zum Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten” warf vor allem Fragen nach Datensicherheit und Kosten einer Wallet auf, sowie dem Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen. 



<p>Das Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten’’ ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor, besonders vorangetrieben durch die Corona-Pandemie und die damit verbundene zunehmende Digitalisierung in nahezu allen Lebensbereichen. Dabei rückt jedoch auch die Frage nach der ,,Selbst-Souveränen Identität’’ in den Mittelpunkt, kurz SSI. Unter diesem Thema fand auch die online Veranstaltung ,,Digitale Identität’’ des BFM (Betriebswirtschaftliches Forschungszentrum) am 20. Oktober 2021 statt. Während einer angeregten Diskussionsrunde stellten sich vor allem die Themen der Datensicherheit, Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen, und Kosten für eine Wallet in den Mittelpunkt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unter der Expertengruppe befanden sich Irene Adamski als Vertreterin von Jolocom, sowie Fabiane Völter als Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin der Uni Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch als Zuständiger für die Kreditsteuerung der BAUR GmbH und Boris Lingl als Head of Blockchain bei DATEV, welche die Fragen des Publikums zu beantworten suchten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eine Brieftasche im Physischen. Eine einzige Identität, die man über mehrere Domänen hinweg verwendet, verspricht niedrige Komplexität und Unabhängigkeit von Intermediären, sprich die Identität liegt nicht bei Dienstleistern, sondern bei den Nutzer:Innen selbst. Damit ist SSI als ein Mittelweg zu sehen, welcher die Vorteile der Isolierten und Föderierten Identität zu verbinden sucht. Ein Anwendungsbeispiel sei Folgendes: Man kann über diesen Ansatz einzelne Informationen weitergeben, beispielsweise der Bank mitteilen, dass man über 60000€ verdient – jedoch nicht den genauen Betrag. So bleibt die Kontrolle der Daten stets bei den Nutzer:Innen einer Wallet. Als eine ,,Brieftasche im Physischen’’ kann man diesen Ansatz verstehen, aus welcher man einzelne Karten zückt, die einzelne benötigte Informationen herausgeben. Weitere Beispiele für die Anwendung einer Wallet sind z.B. Ummeldungsprozesse, Tickets in Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln, oder eben Nachweise über Einkommen. So ist eine Wallet gewissermaßen ein Zusatz für die basis ID.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better safe than sorry – Datensicherheit bei der Wallet. Doch wie sieht es mit der Datensicherheit aus? Wie sicher ist eine Wallet wirklich? Kurz lässt sich sagen, dass dies immer in den Händen der Nutzer:Innen liegt. Im Falle einer Anfrage, etwas auszuweisen, können diese selbst an- und abwählen, welche Informationen sie teilen, oder es sogar komplett ablehnen. Die eigenen Daten liegen dabei allesamt verschlüsselt auf der eigenen Wallet. Ähnlich wie bei einer Brieftasche zieht man nur jene Informationen heraus, die man auch teilen möchte.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dies beantwortet jedoch nicht die Frage nach der Fälschungssicherheit. Eine falsche Identität wird zunächst durch die digital signierten Nachweise (Credentials) ausgeschlossen. Über Credentials kann der Verifizierer (z.B. BAUR) nachvollziehen, ob der Signaturschlüssel tatsächlich vom Landesamt kommt. Standardisierungsgremien sichern, dass keine falschen Identitäten angenommen werden, um Sachen anzufragen. So muss das Siegel original und geprüft sein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alle sollen mitgenommen werden. Ein zentrales Thema während der Diskussion, auf welches auch stets verwiesen wurde, war die Notwendigkeit einer Schulung oder Aufklärung der Nutzer:Innen. Zum einen darüber, nicht alle Daten mit allen teilen zu müssen, selbst wenn hierzu aufgefordert wird. Zum anderen vor allem im Umgang mit Skeptiker:Innen. Alle Bürger:Innen sollen mitgenommen werden, und Lösungen müssen parallel angeboten werden, um niemanden auszuschließen. Einigkeit herrschte darüber, dass das Nutzen einer Wallet freigestellt werden soll. EU Bürger:Innen müssen aber die Möglichkeit haben, eine Wallet zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen zu haben. Daher kam der Begriff einer Übergangszeit auf, mit der definitiv zu rechnen sei.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI als globaler Trend. Noch steckt die Anwendung der Wallet in den Kinderschuhen. Doch die Corona-Pandemie hat den Vorteil eines Digitalisierungsschubes gebracht und Bürger:Innen bereits an das Nutzen eines QR Codes gewöhnt. In fünf Jahren, so wurde der Ausblick in der Diskussion gegeben, soll dies bereits weitgehend normalisiert sein. Erste Rollouts könnten bereits in zwei Jahren stattfinden, beispielsweise beim Einchecken in Hotels oder beim Studierendenausweis. Vor allem globale Trends zeigen die Wichtigkeit auf, sich mit dem Thema SSI zu beschäftigen. Dabei richtet sich ein Appell vor allem an Unternehmen, denen die Rolle zufällt, ihre eigenen Identitäten zu verwalten und voranzutreiben. Die technische Infrastruktur muss bereitgestellt werden, und Unternehmen werden damit gewissermaßen zu Vorreitern der Wallet. SSI, so lautete das Fazit, werde sich wie das Internet verbreiten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ein Markt im Werden. Nichtsdestotrotz handelt es sich um einen Markt im Werden. Daher konnte man auch die genaue Frage bezüglich der Kosten nicht vollständig beantworten. Festzuhalten ist jedoch, dass keine Kosten auf die Endnutzer:Innen der Wallet zukommen werden. Es zahlen die Parteien (Aussteller:Innen und Verifizierer:Innen), welche die Infrastruktur betreiben, doch diese Anfangsinvestitionskosten fallen nur für Forschung und Entwicklung an. Zusammenfassend bietet SSI großes Potential, da auch digitale Maschinen oder Organisationen diesen Ansatz nutzen können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es folgten eine Dankesrunde und der Abschied. –&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It feels so long ago that Magic unveiled its first auth solution in April 2020. JAMstack was having a moment, and so were NFTs. The world had just begun to reckon with shutdowns and social distancing. A surge in remote work showed us that online identity was overdue for a refactor. Centralized infrastructures were being challenged everywhere.</p><p>Back then, all it took was one line of code to implement Magic.</p><p>We used to hear lots of positive feedback about our whole developer experience. Those docs, you know? So&nbsp;clean.</p><p>A year since, the world of web development is again at a threshold. We’re inundated with feedback from users that want a multitude of sign-in options. They want to feel secure, they want to own their data. They desire convenience and seamlessness. Providing an auth experience that serves every user, no matter their technical acumen or accessibility needs, is a costly undertaking for app creators. That’s because building a Magic implementation never really was just one line-of-code. You still have to create buttons, composed into forms, connected to a server. Model user accounts, measure conversion rates, but wait… did I aria-label that button right? Hold on, we need a combobox? Now add social logins to the mix: what the heck is OAuth? Or WebAuthn? This login page is turning into infinite story&nbsp;points!</p><p>As we added more and more choices for sign-in, we heard feedback that Magic was harder to use, especially for no-code builders. So, what happened? And why should auth — something that every app needs — be so difficult to build and maintain? That’s a question that’s been bugging me for some time now. I lead the engineering team for developer experience at Magic, so we aimed to set a new standard to help our customers build auth more quickly, more securely, more accessibly, and more user friendly-y.</p> Occam’s auth <p>The aha moment came from the simple realization that most modern auth flows follow a discrete pattern: authorization and callback. You prompt a user to authorize themselves, traditionally with an email + password. Or, a more modern (<a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/passwords-suck-6524a8e7aeb5">and more secure</a>) approach would use social logins, or Magic’s own passwordless email/SMS flows. Once a user has submitted their proof-of-identity (“authorization”), the app has to then verify this information (“callback”). In the case of social logins, this requires checking a one-time code built around some fancy, math-y cryptographic stuff. Or, using Magic’s passwordless SDKs, you just call getRedirectResult for social logins and loginWithCredential for email/SMS. Building auth for the web essentially boils down to two big function calls. Noticing this, however, presents an opportunity to do what we engineers love to do best: abstract!</p><p>But we weren’t going to make just any abstraction.</p><blockquote>We want a new paradigm that speaks to the power of web development today and uses web primitives in such a way that the solution can slot into just about any tech&nbsp;stack.</blockquote><blockquote>We’re especially excited about no-code and low-code platforms like Webflow and Bubble, so we made it a priority to support those tools as natively as possible.</blockquote> Introducing (truly) plug &amp; play&nbsp;auth <p>Today, we’re introducing a new way to implement Magic auth for the web: Magic Login&nbsp;Form.</p><p>We think it delivers on the promise of Magic as the easiest, most flexible, and most extensible auth solution available. That’s because we want your frontend implementation to be as simple as copy &amp;&nbsp;paste.</p><p>Everything you need to start securely authenticating your users with any of Magic’s sign-in methods is two &lt;script&gt; tags&nbsp;away:</p><p>That’s all it takes to connect your app to Magic’s entire suite of auth features. You get a beautiful, accessible login screen with UI best-practices built-in — we’ll even remember which auth method users previously signed-in with. And better yet, your implementation is future-proof and automatically updates with Magic’s service. So, when Magic adds support for your favorite social login provider, you don’t need to deploy an update. Your users will see the latest changes automatically. All of this happens inside of an &lt;iframe&gt; hosted on your domain, so users aren't left questioning what service they're interacting with, reducing the risk of phishing.</p>An example of a fully-branded Magic Login&nbsp;Form<blockquote>At Magic, we think developer experience is user experience.</blockquote><p>So we’re trying to remove as many barriers between you and your creativity as possible. With Login Form, you can stop worrying about auth and start focusing on what matters to your users and your business. Though it’s still not quite “one line of code” for everything auth, it’s a hell of a lot closer than we’ve seen anywhere else, and we’re excited about its potential to improve the auth experience for everyone on the web, long into the&nbsp;future.</p> The first prototype <p>At Magic, we promote a culture of creative experimentation, and we put this into practice during bi-weekly “demo days.” Everyone on the team has an opportunity to share something they’re working on — whether it’s related to a milestone project, or just a blossoming idea. Some of our best features sparked this way, usually based on pure intuition and user empathy. This takes a lot of introspection as a team. If we’re knowledgable of ourselves, it tends to manifest in great products for our users. So, demo day is also an opportunity for us to invest in each&nbsp;other.</p><p>When Login Form made its first appearance at demo day — unplanned and off-the-cuff — it looked like&nbsp;this:</p><p>The inspiration for that demo had simmered for a while. When we talked about this “big idea,” to make auth simple and clean and future-proof, it was sandwiched between phrases like “pie-in-the-sky” and “someday…” But, to produce that working proof-of-concept was a matter of hours (it helps, of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s664NsLeFM">that we already had a universe in which to bake our apple&nbsp;pie</a>).</p><p>Demo day was a hit, but that’s only where the real work&nbsp;began.</p> The “real”&nbsp;work <p>For the developer experience team, Login Form meant so much more than a pre-packaged UI. It represented a whole new, opinionated implementation approach. Building a login page is pretty easy to “get”, even if you’re not an engineer. We’ve seen a thousand login pages before. But we still had to explain this implementation approach in a way that our product designers and marketing extraordinaries could relate to — we needed to help them tell a story. So, we went back to the drawing&nbsp;board.</p>Snapshots from the UI design&nbsp;process<p>It didn’t take long to find consensus on a UX pattern. Again, it’s a login page (a damn good login page). We started with a few design&nbsp;goals:</p>  Login Form should be adaptive to a developer’s Magic Dashboard settings, creating a seamless development experience. If you add some Google creds to your Magic account, then Login Form should instantly reflect&nbsp;that.  Logging in should be quick, easy, and frictionless — users should never feel lost in sea of sign-in options. So, we want to remember what sign-in method a user has previously used for an app, then we can focus them on the right form automatically.  Good design is inclusive design. Our entire login experience should reflect UI best practices and accessibility standards, above and beyond simple compliance.  The design should be extensible. While we’re super proud of our initial release, we’re already thinking about ways to make Magic Login Form even better. Simplicity and flexibility help ensure we’ve got room to grow moving&nbsp;forward.   A new onboarding experience for developers <p>Magic Login Form represents a new onboarding experience for end-users, so we wanted to revamp our own onboarding experience for developers to match. Learning about auth can quickly derail any developer’s good day. Striking the balance between good UX and good security can just boggle the mind. Even building on top of a solution like Magic can quickly spiral into a thousand-thousand esoteric questions. UX tends to be the last box on the auth checklist. So, how do we show-off the “easy button”? We started by looking at our own sign-up experience on Magic Dashboard.</p><p>After you’ve completed our passwordless email flow for the first time, you see a screen like&nbsp;this:</p><p>When we created npx make-magic, we sought to speed-up development of new projects using Magic. When we added this screen to our sign-up flow, however, we saw a mixed response. Some, especially those from a JAMstack background, were happy to see familiar tooling options. Others were unsure about what npx make-magic was doing in their system, and why they were being asked to start there. One developer was confused upon seeing npx, thinking that Magic worked exclusively for the NodeJS ecosystem—an impression we wanted to correct. The easiest decision for us was to strike this page from our sign-up flow completely.</p><p>We replaced this piece of the onboarding puzzle with a new Login Form settings page. From here, developers can access an interactive preview of their customized form. We also introduced a new featured card to Magic Dashboard’s home page, surfacing this new implementation approach with a beautiful, eye-catching design.</p> Now what? <p>Getting started with Magic Login Form is super easy. <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/">Log into your Magic Dashboard account</a> and go to Login Form. Try a demo for your very own plug &amp; play login page. You’ll also see a link to download a working implementation using your actual API&nbsp;keys!</p><p>We’ve also written some <a href="https://magic.link/docs/login-form">documentation</a> to help you build a plug &amp; play login experience from the ground up. And, of course, we have added a template to our CLI scaffolding tool to generate a working implementation in under a minute. Simply run the following command in your preferred shell:</p><p>npx make-magic --template plug-and-play</p> So long, and thanks for all the&nbsp;fish! <p>We hope you enjoyed this peek behind-the-curtain of the all-new Magic Login Form (fun fact: our internal code name was “Auth-in-a-box”). By the way, it’s totally free to try.

 Developers: SMS Authentication is Challenging <p>Phones are ubiquitous; the largest segment of the world’s computing base. However, despite significant market adoption of a few operating systems, interoperable standards for messaging are rare, and often segmented.</p><p>SMS (Short Message Service) messaging¹, despite a number of material challenges, has broad adoption, international regulations, and support across platforms.</p><p>This post details the use of SMS as an authentication mechanism.</p> What is a high quality SMS login&nbsp;system?   Easy for Users, Hard for Attackers  Works globally, across all cellular carriers, even in lossy service environments.  Enrollment, opting out, and authentication are beautiful, simple processes.  Confidence the user has access to their phone, and the phone number is&nbsp;valid.  When users change their phone number, they don’t stop using the service; they can migrate to a new phone number smoothly.  When an attacker pretends to be a user, they are prevented from taking over the&nbsp;account.  A user should not be easily duped into helping their attackers.  Authentication is a two-way&nbsp;street SMS can be temporarily undeliverable <p>SMS delivery is not guaranteed, and many implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered.</p><p>💡 Allow users to request a new code as part of the product. Use a different code for each&nbsp;message.</p> SMS can be permanently undeliverable <p>Users can request to stop receiving SMS from a particular sender, often by replying with ‘STOP’. Users will no longer receive messages.</p><p>In the United States, FCC affirms text messages are covered under the “<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/tags/telephone-consumer-protection-act-tcpa">Telephone Consumer Protection Act</a>”, and users have a variety of rights, including to&nbsp;Opt-Out.</p><p>💡 Notify users when their phone number is undeliverable: either in-app, or via&nbsp;email</p> Messages can come from unfamiliar sources <p>SMS standards make spoofing phone numbers difficult. However, no easy way exists for consumers to authenticate numbers or associate them with businesses. Messages appear with only a number to identify&nbsp;them.</p><p>Users are habituated to ignore sender ids, or react with suspicion when numbers are&nbsp;changed.</p><p>💡 Include information about the sender in your message “Your <a href="http://ACME.co">ACME.co</a> Code: 123–123”, or use Domain-Bound Codes</p> Users can be on fraudulent sites <p>Some sites trick users into entering authenticator codes for other sites. A common ploy asks for a user’s phone number, and prompts the user to enter the code they receive. The attacker simply forwards the collected code to the target, and successfully poses as the end&nbsp;user.</p>  User Logs in to Fraud Site.

Allowing paste makes your service more accessible, and a smoother end user experience.   Using numeric codes? Label your input box as `numeric`   Phone soft keyboards use information about the input box to render the most usable keyboard for the use case. Showing a numeric keypad helps make entering codes as easy as&nbsp;possible   Supporting iOS users? Tag login boxes with textContentType   Operating systems such as iOS make it easy to fill in one time codes from SMS messages. Apple uses a text content tag of textContentType=.oneTimeCode to allow users to auto-fill new SMS codes into the&nbsp;page.   Building with Google Play? Consider auto-verification with the SMS Retriever API   Android’s Google Play Services offer a collection of <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview">advanced SMS tools for verification</a> of SMS codes, including supporting background verification.  With the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview">SMS Retriever API</a>, It is possible to build almost silent user and device verification, however, fallback support for traditional SMS is required, and informing users about what is occurring is critical for building user trust and&nbsp;comfort.   Building Web Applications? Use `autocomplete="one-time-code"`   Many browsers facilitate SMS message autofill through input code <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/work/play/emm-api/prov-devices">tags for autofill</a>, such as autocomplete="one-time-code". This can provide smooth user experiences cross-platform, and allow your product to take advantage of built-in browser functionality.

Is it art? Is it the future of the creator economy? Is it just a&nbsp;JPEG?</p><p>GlobaliD software architect /spacemandev had <a href="https://twitter.com/spacemandev/status/1449814635939614722">a spicy tweetstorm on the&nbsp;subject</a>:</p><blockquote>Why most NFTs are a scammy cash grab and a potential model for NFTs that would make it less…scammy</blockquote><blockquote>NFTs have been hailed as a new way to empower creators, and while they provide a unique new tool on how to raise money for artists, their current trend as collectibles is…..well a speculative bubble at&nbsp;best</blockquote><blockquote>Traditionally, a creator inspired model is that of Patreon or Ko-Fi, where the patron pays money over an interval of time to get access to rewards from a creator over that period of&nbsp;time</blockquote><blockquote>NFT Collectibles posit that you can pay a creator upfront large sums of money and over time, they’ll what…return value to you because of what reason? Without interval monetary spends, there’s no incentive for a creator to stick&nbsp;around.</blockquote><blockquote>They can just do a cash grab of an initial sale, make politican like promises about “future” rewards, and have 0 consequences by not living up to&nbsp;them.</blockquote><blockquote>A potential model for NFTs that could side step this hurdle is to actually borrow from the ICO boom of yesteryear. After a creator does an initial NFT drop, create a holding contract for all the funds whose members are controllers of the&nbsp;NFTs.</blockquote><blockquote>Original $ + royalty $ all get spent into this contract. Then the DAO authorizes releases of funds to the creator over some time interval as they continue to stick around and build the community, with NFT resales continuously filling the fund, along with any further NFT&nbsp;sales</blockquote><blockquote>For the creator, they know that they have a market for their work, there’s X$ set aside *just for them* if they produce, and for the members of the DAO, they know the creator won’t just up and leave after the initial&nbsp;sale</blockquote><p>Food for&nbsp;thought.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/galaxy-digital-affiliate-raises-325m-fund-for-nfts-interactive-gaming/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Galaxy Digital Affiliate Raises $325M Fund for NFTs, Interactive Gaming — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/">/pstav</a> — <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/19/coinbase-and-nba-sign-partnership-deal/">Coinbase and NBA Sign Partnership Deal</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/15/nfts-are-an-internet-game-changer/">NFTs Are an Internet Game-Changer</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/jack-dorsey-s-mining-ambitions-steam-bans-nfts-a-bitcoin-etf-preps-launch?rc=wsoyyg">Jack Dorsey’s Mining Ambitions; Steam Bans NFTs; a Bitcoin ETF Preps&nbsp;Launch</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/120917/meet-the-former-parafi-capital-investor-betting-big-on-nfts">Meet the former ParaFi Capital investor betting big on&nbsp;NFTs</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/84121/reddit-building-nft-marketplace-ethereum-token-rewards">Reddit Building NFT Marketplace to Join Ethereum Token Rewards — Decrypt</a>   2. Tweet of the&nbsp;week <p><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSacks/status/1450162259733491715">Adam Sacks</a> — via&nbsp;<a href="http://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a>:</p> 3. How Bonifii x GlobaliD x Indicio enhance financial inclusion <p>From <a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/10/bonifii-increases-financial-inclusion-with-globalid-digital-wallet-and-indicio-network/">the announcement</a>:</p><blockquote>Bonifii, the financial industry’s first verifiable exchange network for financial cooperatives, today announced the Bonifii credential, a decentralized digital identity that provides underserved individuals with access to traditional banking services in a way that maximizes their privacy and security. Bonifii created the digital credential in partnership with GlobaliD, a trust platform and digital wallet. The credential is underpinned by the Indicio Network, a global network built on Hyperledger Indy for decentralized digital identity using distributed ledger technology (DLT).</blockquote><blockquote>The Bonifii credential transforms the way new accounts are created by streamlining the delivery of information needed to open an account at a traditional financial institution. By enabling an end-to-end digital online application process, the credential offers a secure and meaningful entry point into accounts with financial institutions for millions of underbanked people, giving them a pathway to achieving financial stability.</blockquote><blockquote>“Now, financial institutions that use the Bonifii credential can achieve higher levels of assurance than traditional application methods. The identity of the account applicant can be verified from a variety of attributes that create trust and assurance,” said John Ainsworth, CEO and President of Bonifii. “This type of digitally verifiable KYC reduces fraud, increases financial inclusion, and provides friction-free interactions between account holders and financial institutions.”</blockquote><p>In the context of inclusion and interoperability, the vision here is super exciting. Individuals will be able to open an account with a credit union using a simple, universal credential that can later also be accepted by other financial institutions as it satisfies basic compliance requirements for account&nbsp;opening.</p><p>And because the credential is built on self-sovereign identity, there’s huge potential to reach those currently out of reach of the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p> 4. Chart of the&nbsp;week <p>Speaking of Patreon — from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/podcasters-rule-on-patreon-chart-li-jin-joins-a-crypto-firm?rc=wsoyyg">The Information’s Creator Economy newsletter</a>:</p><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/podcasters-rule-on-patreon-chart-li-jin-joins-a-crypto-firm?rc=wsoyyg">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>This shows how well the company has sustained the boost in usage it had early in the pandemic. In March last year, Patreon said more creators had joined the platform than any month in its entire history. In January this year, it said it was generating $100 million in annualized revenue, which it earns by taking a cut of creators’ monthly incomes on the&nbsp;site.</blockquote><p>Established creators are running with the subscription model. What will they do with&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>Also, a crazy stat from&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>The internet employs almost as many creators (200,000 full-time equivalent jobs) as the rest of the U.S. entertainment industry represented by the largest&nbsp;unions.</blockquote> 5.

Description: As we move through Season Two of Hello User and pull apart top cybersecurity themes and myths around cybersecurity, we welcome Candace Worley, Chief Product Officer for Ping Identity. Candace shares some key takeaways from her time at Ping, along with McAfee and a short stint at Amazon. She talks about what it takes to run a mission-critical solution for companies, the changes she has seen in the industry, and how we can prepare against the innate trusting nature of humans. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:55] Throughout her long tenure in cyber, what changes hasCandace seen in hackers, vendors, and the response companies have to attacks? What were the benefits of working for a company that had a very large footprint in the enterprise space? [3:40] Candace and Richard give their take on the intention behind founders building security solution companies. Is it for the revenue? The security? Or maybe a mix of both. [7:19] Candace talks about the switch companies go through from being security first to software, and the typical implications and expectations that go along with that switch. [13:50] Candace feels there are two things at the core of security: data and identity. [14:30] While working as the Chief Strategist at McAfee, it became clear to Candace that if you have a really strong identity practice in place that is integrated into that security stack, your ability to mitigate the risk of material cyber-attacks is pretty good. [17:41] Where have we fallen down as an industry? [22:50] The fundamental issue in cyber security is that humans are innately trusting. [23:28] Why is Candace fascinated by the idea of moving towards risk-based identity? &nbsp; Quotes: •“Most security solutions founders see a problem that has a potential revenue opportunity associated with it.” —Richard   •“If you get your identity wrong, you’d better pray you got the rest of your cyber stack pretty bulletproof, because you just left the front door unlocked.” —Candace •“Vulnerabilities are sexy, yet identity is day-to-day work, and it takes a tremendous amount of effort.” —Richard •“The fundamental issue in cyber security is that humans are innately trusting.” —Candace &nbsp; Mentioned in This Episode: •Candace Worley •Ping Identity

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/suess">Fabian Süß</a></p><p>Donnie Wendt, Principal Security Researcher at MasterCard, will give a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4909/2">Machine Learning: Cybersecurity’s Friend &amp; Foe</a> on Wednesday, November 10 from 14:20 pm to 14:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2021" title="Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Donnie some questions about his presentation.</p>
  
 Could you give us a sneak peek into your presentation: “Machine Learning: Cybersecurity’s Friend &amp; Foe”? 
<p>Sure. My presentation, it's designed to help the cybersecurity professional understand what machine learning is and how it's used for cybersecurity. Because when you look at a lot of the marketing material for most cybersecurity products today, machine learning and artificial intelligence appear to be this magical fairy dust. But in employing machine learning for cybersecurity, it really does offer tremendous benefit and great promise. However, there are many risks that security professionals must understand.</p>
<p>So my presentation really seeks to demystify machine learning and its underlying concept so that cybersecurity professionals can harness its true potential. I'll discuss some of the possible vulnerabilities and risks, including attacks on the process, data and models, and also explore implementing adversarial machine learning to test and protect our machine learning models that we use in cybersecurity.</p>
 How can Machine Learning improve Cybersecurity? 
<p>Well, one of the challenges in cybersecurity is really dealing with the extremely high volumes of data and the rate of emerging threats out there. I've also done a lot of work in security automation and quite simply, the amount of data and the rate of attack variants make manual analysis and detection impossible, or machine learning comes in as it can effectively and efficiently deal with massive amounts of data while discovering subtle changes and patterns in that data. So employing machine learning actually offers tremendous benefits to cybersecurity.</p>
<p>It has become a very vital component in many of our security solutions. There are many cybersecurity use cases that are perfect for machine learning, including things like spam filtering, malware, phishing detection, intrusion detection, biometric authentication, user behavior analysis, anomaly detection. The list goes on. It's like almost every cybersecurity use case we have is good for machine learning. So the power of machine learning is to analyze large amounts of data efficiently and accurately ensures that its use in cybersecurity is just going to continue to expand rapidly.</p>
 What risks are there to consider? 
<p>Researchers have proven that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs and attacks. A lot of times it will classify those attacks based on a machine learning phase, such as training or inference or based on whether they're causative or exploratory. For example, during the training phase, attacks are often what we call poisoning attacks, which can cause the models to learn the wrong behavior.</p>
<p>In the inferent stage, we look for exploratory attacks that seek to understand how our model works, which can then be a precursor to evasion or integrity attacks on our models. In addition to the attacks, we also have to understand the risks associated with bias and the inherent integrity issues within the data or the model we're using. That's why I'm a very big supporter of transparency and explicability of our machine learning models, so we do know what they're doing.</p>
 Which attacks are particularly dangerous? 
<p>Interesting, I see the most dangerous attack on machine learning is the one we don't detect, right? Because one of the leading areas in research right now is how we can detect various attacks during the phases of machine learning process. We have to understand where our weaknesses are with a given machine learning model or data. For instance, if you're doing online learning, you are more susceptible to a training phase poisoning attack because you're actually using live data to train your systems.</p>
<p>Another example is if you're using clustering algorithms for classification, you're much more susceptible to an evasion attack because it's easy to create something that looks like or looks similar to what you're clustering. So it's really, the main attack I see, the main weakness is the cybersecurity professionals not understanding necessarily how the models within the tools they're implementing work. So we really, that's why I came up with this presentation was to try to bridge that gap. It's not to make our cybersecurity professionals data scientists, but make sure they understand how these tools are leveraging machine learning.</p>

 🇺🇸 New York Attorney General Clamps Down on Unregistered Cryptoasset Lending Firms With Cease-and-desist Letters.  
 Last week the New York Attorney General, Letitia James, shared two cease-and-desist letters to cryptoasset lending firms. Under state law, such lending platforms must register with the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) if they operate from New York or offer services to its residents. These services are regulated under New York’s Martin Act which aims to protect investors when engaging with business handling securities. These letters were released to the public but were supposed to have the company names redacted. However, the file names clearly identified the two firms.<br><br>The first letter was sent to Nexo which failed to register as an issuer of securities in the state of New York. The Attorney General stated that it was ‘in possession of evidence that [Nexo] is unlawfully selling or offering for sale securities and/or commodities within or from the State of New York without having registered as required.’ The OAG’s primary concern is that New Yorkers are being exposed to ‘significant undisclosed risks’ by cryptoasset businesses. <br><br>The New York OAG outlined that Nexo has until October 28th to confirm it has ceased such activity and provide more information to the Attorney General as to why they should not investigate this matter further. In response, Nexo’s CEO Antoni Trenchev declared that the company uses IP geo-blocking to prevent New Yorkers from using their services. Nonetheless, the Attorney General urged Nexo to take all the measures needed to ‘preserve all physical and electronic record and data pertaining to the matters raised in this letter.’ This highlights the importance of establishing a strong compliance programme. A similar letter was sent to Celsius asking it to clarify its ownership structure and other operational arrangements. <br><br>In addition, three unnamed cryptoasset platforms received information request letters from the OAG relating to their operational structure, activities and products. On top of this the letter requests details of company policies which mitigate manipulative trading as well as suspicious transactions. This includes an audit of ‘all wallet addresses in which the virtual currency is held’, a list of third parties which may hold cryptoassets on behalf of these platforms and ‘a list of transactions by or through your platform or service [...] including all relevant transaction details.’ The OAG requested receipt all of this material and more by November 1st 2021.<br><br>Overall, this development shows that complex cryptoasset products are attracting increasing regulatory attention and highlights the importance of having robust compliance programmes in place to mitigate exposure to illicit activity and satisfy legal requirements. Indeed, the OAG’s press release reminded the industry of the shutdown of Coinseed and the multi-million dollar penalties imposed on Bitfinex and Tether earlier this year.

<p>Gosh, now that the dev team has moved to weekly releases, there’s a lot to catch up on when I skip a week! The most recent Holochain releases have a number of bug fixes that improve performance and reliability, along with a new feature (<code><a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">post_commit</a></code>) and a few breaking changes.</p> Holochain 0.0.109: Gossip improvements <p>The release from three weeks ago brought some important bug fixes in the network layer, improving performance and reliability.</p>  The conductor no longer tries to join networks that are already in the process of being joined. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1006">#1006</a>)  The genesis process no longer tries to self-validate ops that are produced for the first three source chain entries, which may require a network which isn’t available yet. Instead, a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.109/hdk/prelude/genesis/index.html"><code>genesis_self_check</code></a> callback can run against those ops as a reduced, network-disabled pre-validation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/995">#995</a>)  Multi-peer gossip messages (e.g., publishing and retrieval of DHT data) no longer wait until timeout when enough responses have been received. (<a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.110/hdk/prelude/genesis/index.html">#1009</a>)  Terminate a gossip round initiation if no responses are received. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014">#1014</a>)  Don’t gossip with stale peers. This fixes a bug with long-lived DHTs, in which newcomers couldn’t see old data. The bug had previously been blocking a number of initiatives, including the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">Holochain Launcher</a> and <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp/">DevCamp</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1014">#1014</a>)  <p>There have been some other speed improvements and fixes:</p>  The conductor can now run 50 validations concurrently. This helps speed things up when some validations are slowed down waiting to retrieve DHT data. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1005">#1005</a>).  Commits to the source chain with the new <code>ChainTopOrdering::Relaxed</code> flag now store both header and entry; previously the entry was mistakenly being dropped.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00109">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.110: More gossip improvements <p>The release from two weeks ago brought more networking bug fixes, which have made gossip even more reliable.</p>  Agents now try to republish their authored source chain data until they receive the expected number of validation receipts. This helps ensure the data will stay available when the agent goes offline. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1024">#1024</a>)  Improvement to database write efficiency when storing information about peers. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1007/">#1007</a>)  DHT requests are only sent to local agents if they’re authorities. This saves on internal chatter. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1027">#1027</a>)  ‘starts-with’ queries on link tags now work. This was working in the LMDB storage layer but not in the SQLite storage layer. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1027">#1027</a>)  <p>Lair, the keystore for Holochain, is also undergoing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">a lot of changes</a>. There’s been a lot of work to get Holochain ready for Lair’s new API (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1017">#1017</a>), but your hApps won’t be affected by these changes. It does mean, though, that Lair and Holochain will be getting new features, including:</p>  Seed bundle importing will allow you to use <a href="https://github.com/holochain/deepkey/">DeepKey</a> to create an identity and one machine and connect it to your identity on another machine (Lair <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/70">#70</a>).  NaCl’s <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html">box encryption</a> algorithm will be added to the HDK in addition to the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.110/hdk/x_salsa20_poly1305/index.html">existing</a> secret box encryption (Lair <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/73">#73</a>).  <p>If you manage conductor configs yourself, you’ll need to know that the Lair keystore config section has some breaking changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1031">#1031</a>) as a result of the above.</p><p>Sweettest has also gotten some updates that make it more versatile (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1030">#1030</a>). Not sure what Sweeettest is? Read on; I’ve written a bit about it after the next section.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00110">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.112: Post-commit hook and DNA info <p>Last week’s release brings new developer-facing features and breaking changes. (Note that there is no official 0.0.111 because of a release automation issue.)</p><blockquote>The biggest new feature is the <code>post_commit</code> hook. This lets you write a callback that’s called after every zome call that commits data. Your callback will receive a list of headers that have just been written, and can then do whatever it likes except commit new data. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1000">#1000</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Read more about <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-%60post_commit%60-hook-in-your-zome">how to use <code>post_commit</code></a> in your hApp at the community wiki.</blockquote><p>Breaking/new: Some info available via the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.112/hdk/info/fn.zome_info.html">zome_info</a></code> host function -- the DNA ID, hash, and properties — have been split out into a new <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.112/hdk/info/fn.dna_info.html">dna_info</a></code> host function. This information is no longer available via <code>zome_info</code>, and the <code>zome_name</code> property has been renamed to <code>name</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1044">#1044</a>) Additionally, a DNA’s zomes are now available via <code>dna_info</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1052">#1052</a>) and a zome’s entry type definitions are now available via <code>zome_info</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1055">#1055</a>).</p><p>Breaking: The structs <code>HeaderHashes</code> and <code>HeaderHashedVec</code>, which wrap vectors of other structs, have been removed. As this was only used in the previously unimplemented <code>post_commit</code>, it shouldn’t affect any of your existing code. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1049">#1049</a>)</p><p>New: <code>call_info</code> is partially implemented. A zome call can use this function to get info about how and why it was called. Currently it only gives the current source chain head, but in the future it will give information about capability context and how it was called (by a client, another zome or DNA, or a remote agent). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1047">#1047</a>)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.112/CHANGELOG.md#20211021140006">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Sweettest: Rust-based Holochain testing <p>Sweettest is a Rust-based testing framework for Holochain apps. It has tools for creating conductors, loading hApps into them, and networking those conductors together. The Holochain dev team created it for testing Holochain and its various subsystems in different scenarios. And because it’s written in Rust, they can test everything from within one language ecosystem with simpler tools for automation and continuous integration. Besides the convenience of putting tests inline with code, they can reuse all of Holochain’s public-facing types like HDK and conductor API input/output structs. There’s no need to recreate a bunch of type definitions in TypeScript or depend on JavaScript client bindings.</p><p>Right now the Holochain team’s big focus is on testing sharding and scaling. They need rigorous sharding tests that ensure everything is successfully getting validated by the right DHT peers, no signals or messages are getting lost, and there are no bottlenecks. On top of sharding, they’re also testing how Holochain performs in large networks with lots of traffic, with an eye to analyzing what disruptions it’s encountering when it does struggle. This will become very important in the near future, because we’re just about to open up public access to hosted apps like Elemental Chat. If we can gather good data that pinpoints the source of problems, that helps us find solutions quickly.</p><p>From what I understand, they use Sweettest to run both small-scale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit tests</a> and large-scale integration tests. Because Holochain is a framework for peer-to-peer computing, it becomes important to test the same chunk of code in multiple contexts, such as on different machines as they interact with each other.</p><p>Although its primary usage right now is testing Holochain, Sweettest can also be used as an alternative to Tryorama for testing hApps. That’s because the Holochain conductor is basically a runtime for hApps — much of the functionality can’t be tested without an actual hApp to plug into it. In fact, a lot of our Sweettest tests are built around hApp functionality.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a>, the Node.JS-based Holochain scenario testing suite, is still our ‘official’ way of creating scenario tests for developers to test their hApps. But if you want to try something different — and don’t mind a bit of do-it-yourself — Sweettest might be worth a try.</blockquote><p>All of our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/holochain/tests">examples</a> are specific to testing Holochain, of course, and some of them use zomes generated on the fly rather than compiled into a DNA. But they do show how to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/tests/multi_conductor.rs">construct multi-conductor scenarios</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/crates/holochain/tests/agent_scaling.rs">test time-to-consistency</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat/pull/100/files#diff-bea9f70b22dade9abf9f6a3e7ac3c9c6d34fa336a214077a98761ea757cac7fbR1-R174">test a hApp</a>. Hopefully they’ll give you a decent idea of how to create your own scenario tests.</p> DevCamp 8 <p>How it started: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How it’s going:</p><p>😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;👩‍🏫🤯😤😊😎🤔🤓💪👍👨‍💻👩‍💻</p><p>Seriously, the level of excitement, thoughtfulness, and engagement has been wonderful to watch — and it’s remained high through the first three weeks of DevCamp and this week’s ‘reading break’.</p> Holochain In Action: Mapping important modules <p>The most recent Holochain in Action session explores the current landscape of modules you can use in your hApps already, along with the unknown territory at the edge of the map. Where are the gaps? What modules do we need to build next? How can we make sure we create things that will <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-in-action-composability-in-the-real-world">compose</a> together well? (This is an important subject; composable modules are easier to work with, which means that more people can build better apps. We’ve touched on this in our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-v0-0-107-a-release-to-build-on/#holochain-in-action-composability-in-the-real-world">coverage</a> of a previous HIA session.)</p><p>One thing I really loved about this session is that the participants used <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn</a>, a Holochain app, to do their mapping. You can see their excitement as they all connect to each other, peer-to-peer, and start working together. Hooray for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@zhangkaiyv?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> zhang kaiyv</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/highway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Not every customer who walks through the door of your dealership on a sunny weekend afternoon can breeze through the auto financing process with no issues. This group could comprise as much as <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/research/auto-loan-debt-study/">18% of the borrowers </a>who step into your dealership. In our quickly-evolving economy, many borrowers can have multiple sources of income, thin credit, or a compromised FICO profile. Verifying income with consumer-permissioned data is a digital solution that can help clear stips and smooth out those tricky loan approvals in real-time.</p>
<p>If you have a borrower sitting in your financing department, the team at your dealership has already invested time with them. They’ve shown them several vehicles, developed rapport, and maybe took a test drive. Don’t lose the sale just because the customer isn’t carrying a stack of freshly-printed pay stubs. Using Finicity Lend’s income verification, the borrower permissions access to the data in their bank account, generating a verification of income (VOI) report. The results that are returned show a high level of accuracy in determining actual income. This <a href="http://finicity.com/connect">low-friction experience</a> cuts down total time spent on each loan application, finishing the verification process in real-time. The borrower doesn’t have to scramble to collect documentation from various sources just so they can leave with the car.&nbsp;</p>
 Extend Credit With Confidence. Get More Approvals. 
<p>Tightened auto lending guidelines and a pandemic-influenced drop in consumer demand are causing <a href="https://newsroom.transunion.com/consumer-credit-activity-continues-to-rise-from-pandemic-lows--auto-loan-subprime-performance-lags/">a slump in subprime originations</a>. When your customer falls in love with a car and is ready to buy, you don’t want limited lending options to cost you the sale. Traditional FICO models are a good start, but when credit scores aren’t enough to get the green light, Finicity Lend augments the credit decisioning with real-time income data that makes the credit decisioning process faster and more efficient for lenders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today’s lending process is in the midst of a vast digital transformation, placing Finicity, a Mastercard company and its open banking technology at the forefront of this data revolution. <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/what-is-a-thin-credit-file-and-how-will-it-impact-your-life/">62 million Americans have a thin credit file</a>, with only one to four tradelines listed. While they may be more than capable of financing a car, traditional credit scoring models could result in a denial of these applications. With Finicity Lend’s income verification, permissioned data access to their bank accounts gives a more robust picture of their actual financial health. The borrower can be issued a loan that they can be approved for and repay. Finicity’s open banking network covers 95% of direct deposit accounts in the United States, greatly increasing the number of buyers you can assist in buying a car. Accurate income data helps satisfy loan stipulations and lets buyers purchase a vehicle right away.&nbsp;</p>
 Reducing Risk 
<p>When a borrower misrepresents their income, it’s nearly always to gain access to more credit than they can handle. 2020 was a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210415005688/en/Landmark-Point-Predictive-Fraud-Study-Details-Record-Year-for-Auto-Loan-Fraud-in-2020">record year</a> for fraud in the auto industry, reaching a whopping $7.3 billion in losses. One of the biggest increases came in income and employment misrepresentation. With a 100% year-over-year jump in falsified incomes, one of the most important investments you can make is in prevention. Be sure that you have accurate data with Finicity Lend’s income verification.&nbsp;</p>
 Higher Verification Success Rates Translates to Fewer Lost Sales 
<p>With the increased confidence and efficiency that comes with Finicity Lend’s income verification, good sales don’t walk out the door just because there’s not enough paperwork on hand. Verified, real-time data gets the sale closed. Over the course of a fiscal year, lost sales and fraud can cause extensive damage to your bottom line. Finicity income verification is fast and secure. The speed of the process means you can invest time and effort into higher-return work activity. This positive snowball effect can show up in the win column of your balance sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many design teams, <a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> made the transition from Abstract + Sketch, to Figma in the last couple of years. One of the common resistance points internally before making that switch, was Figma’s lack of Git-style branching that Abstract enabled. The design team had come to rely on branching and had built a lot of our processes around&nbsp;it.</p><p>During the transition we tried to structure our files, projects, and design system in a way that would help maintain some (though not all) of the benefits we got from branches.</p><p>I hope some of the ideas here spark inspiration for ways you could improve your project and file structures, however keep in mind that this system was designed for our specific needs (yours are probably different) and that these decisions should change over time in a culture of continuous improvement. I highlight some of our learnings at the end of the article. As always, your mileage may&nbsp;vary!</p> Structure <p>We are on a <a href="https://www.figma.com/pricing/">Figma Organisation plan</a>, and structure our teams in a way that roughly maps to our cross-functional product&nbsp;teams.</p><p>Each team has three main types of “projects” (folders, if you&nbsp;prefer):</p>  Source files  Work in progress&nbsp;(WIP)  Archive   Source files <p>A source file is like our main branch. They are one or more files that contain a reasonably up to date version of each screen in the product, and typically not a lot more. We try to keep these files as slim as possible, with as little screen duplication as possible. We do this to reduce the impact of breaking changes further down the road, and to simplify manual effort when&nbsp;merging.</p><p>The rule of thumb is that if someone can look at a screen in the live product, and put together an accurate version of that screen in Figma in under 2 mins, then what’s in the source file is enough. We don’t need an exhaustive lists of all the error states for a form, as long as there’s one solid example of what an error looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>These files are often the starting point for design work on existing products. Streamlined source files enable us to quickly duplicate flows and have them be immediately useful without a lot of busy work removing edge and error&nbsp;cases.</p> Work in&nbsp;progress <p>This is usually where the Figma part of the design process starts. We have a project template file which specifies a basic page structure, and a standardised cover sheet. This will be copied into the work in progress folder and named with the project name, and JIRA ticket number where applicable.</p><p>This file acts as our branch. Branching is unfortunately very manual right now, but not too difficult at our scale of two to three designers per&nbsp;product.</p><p>Screens are copied from the source file (which should be up to date), and design exploration is done from there. Our template specifies an Exploration page, which carries the expectation of no pre-defined structure, as messy and exploratory as the designer wants to be. We don’t critique people’s exploration pages.</p><p>We also specify a Handoff page, where engineers know to look for final screens, design specs and flows. Redlines (using <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739918456607459153">Figma Measure</a>), and custom annotation components are commonly used&nbsp;here.</p><p>Between those two pages, the designer can add as many pages as they need. Typically these progress in order, and new pages are often created at points where feedback is required. We’ll limit pages to only the stuff we want feedback on, so design dead ends and exploratory screens don’t distract people away from what you need actual feedback&nbsp;on.</p> UI kits <p>In our design system team we have a UI Kits project. These UI kits contain any commonly used UI components that are more product-specific than our Design System supports. Each product has a UI kit that’s owned and managed by that product&nbsp;team.</p><p>A note on naming: You’ll see the UI kits have an 05 in front of their name. This is part of our design system’s naming convention that I’ll dig deeper in with another article. We use this numbering system throughout our files to keep libraries in a consistent order in the library panel. Themes first, then assets, components, patterns, and UI&nbsp;kits.</p><p>When it comes to how we structure our files, one of our few hard rules&nbsp;is:</p><blockquote>WIP and Source files should not contain any local components</blockquote><p>The reasons we do this are&nbsp;to:</p>  Reduce library management noise<br>If every WIP or Source file is published as a team library, trying to find the right libraries to enable/disable to get a particular version of a particular component becomes a nightmare very&nbsp;quickly.  Make all screens easily portable/reusable by designers<br>If local components are in a file, but aren’t published as a team library, when someone copies a screen to another file, all links to that main component are lost. The result is an orphaned instance that doesn’t update when the main component is updated because changes aren’t published &amp; pushed. This is totally invisible to the designer, as it visually appears like a standard instance.  Unpublished local components lead to broken instance&nbsp;linksHaving a single published team library allows screens to be easily&nbsp;portable Merging <p>Once a design has been approved and development is in progress or completed, the new screens will be copied back to the Source file, replacing existing screens where necessary. Because no published components exist here, screens can be replaced safely without worry of affecting other work in progress.</p><p>For changes in UI kits, components will often be labelled as [BETA] while in progress, or given a version number, or something similar that lets us manage multiple versions of a component existing simultaneously while the work is in progress. When the screens are merged and we want to clean up those UI kit duplicates, we will follow the process here: <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/how-to-deprecate-old-components-in-figma-design-systems-7978ea8e045e">How to deprecate old components in Figma design&nbsp;systems</a>.</p> Archiving <p>Once complete, the work in progress file has the cover status changed to Archived and it is moved to the Archive folder. The archive then acts as an easy way to see the process behind a piece of work, the comment discussions, and document experiments and directions that could potentially be drawn on&nbsp;later.</p> Things we’ve learned so&nbsp;far   Cover status badges are a huge pain to maintain and keep up to date. No one remembers to change them to the right status, so they’re effectively useless. Occasionally we’ll do a big batch-change of everything in the Archive folder, as having these visibly well marked is really beneficial for searches. Some kind of background API integration that synced files with JIRA in real-time would be amazing here.&nbsp;*dreams*  There can be some confusion around what the right level of detail is to keep in a source file. We suggest keeping an open mind, and working with your teams to find the right balance for each team, as their products may have different needs.  Figma’s new Branches feature does not really meet our needs as it is currently designed. Once merged, the process part is a lot more hidden and difficult for others to find than our archived files. That archival side may not be an issue for you, which is fine. The other issue is that our styles and components live in separate libraries. If we need to make a change that includes both a style and component change, that can‘t be done in a single branch. There’s also no good way of testing the effect your branch changes will have on linked instances in other files right now. Again, a multi-file branch system would solve&nbsp;these.  Having a JIRA ticket number in file names is really useful for search, however search only returns results from teams you are a member of, making cross-team discoverability a lot worse than it should be. This is especially true for larger orgs with more teams, or stricter permissions than we have (anyone is free to join any team at&nbsp;Onfido).  <p>I hope that’s sparked some ideas about how you could structure your own teams and files.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the ninth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/ButNeverSaved">John Francisco</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Spanish community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology when I met Sesameseed. They had recently launched staking with Ontology. I really liked their ecosystem and started to learn more about the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>As an end user in my beginnings knowing Ontology, I was very fascinated by its infrastructure and its staking. I later learned that it is aiming to provide digital identity solutions that companies and day-to-day users need, today. I like technology, therefore, this led me to become even more interested in Ontology.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The community is very important in every project. For this reason, building communities and giving them the tools they need to understand the project is vital for the future and its success. Being a Harbinger is having the responsibility of spreading the word about the future, leading new generations to contribute and generate change in all aspects of technology, and that is what Ontology does, day after&nbsp;day.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>As I have mentioned before, the community is very important; it is the heart of every project. It is the starting point because they direct the course of the project anyway; they help to build a better future. For that and many more reasons, being part of Ontology is being that new paradigm of improvements towards the&nbsp;future.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Each community has its own, however Ontology allows all its members to be part of the project in a more direct way, such as via the Ontology Harbinger program. This program is where you can contribute your knowledge about Ontology’s technology and long-term objectives more directly. Ontology makes you special by being part of its community, part of its ecosystem and as an end user you feel that you have done something important for today and the future of Ontology.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Telegram is a very important channel for Ontology; it is the place where the community feels welcomed by the moderators and administrators. There is a more direct interaction and it is the perfect place to disseminate what Ontology is. As a secondary channel, Twitter is an essential part of the communication ecosystem because it interacts with the most technical and intrepid users who also contribute as the Ontology community.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>In the first instance it was an arduous path, but I did it. Now my responsibilities do not merely include being a single guide to a member of the community but also being an ambassador for Ontology anywhere and for everyone. To be a Harbinger, my biggest advice is, be part of Ontology, understand Ontology and be more than a community member. Understand Ontology’s potential and how you can contribute to the project in a healthy way. Learn every day from Ontology because technology advances every day and without stopping.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Amazing, fascinating, visionaries.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Communication is vital for a community to grow and prosper. Ontology and the Harbinger program open the doors for the community to grow and have solid foundations for its expansion to other horizons.</p><p>The members of the community are the visionaries and owners of having the project in their hands, with their contribution, their knowledge, their way of understanding Ontology leaving an enriched legacy of pure knowledge, they make and will make Ontology and its community even stronger in&nbsp;time.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Its decentralized identity solutions that return to the end user control over their data. It is important that community members utilize these tools and be an example to others who may later come to adopt them, too. We need to demonstrate to those around us how Ontology’s tools benefit our everyday lives. We can use ONTO to manage our digital identities or build wealth through staking and show our friends and family how convenient and easy it&nbsp;is.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

             October 2021   
	 
		 
			 Guarantee Asset Ownership with Blockchain Passports 
<p>In the DeFi world, digital assets are stored in blockchain wallets. Obviously, wallets are not identities, they are anonymous addresses and contain no data on the owner’s identity. A private key is the ‘password’ of the wallet, whoever knows it can access the wallet. It cannot be changed, but it can be stolen. In other words,&nbsp;a wallet is more like a browser for blockchain, where you can see what is inside, but you cannot be sure that you are the only one that has access to your assets.&nbsp;This causes a number of issues:</p>
 
 Lack of ownership guarantee:&nbsp;If the private key of the wallet is accessible by another user, then who owns the assets?&nbsp;<br>
 
 Lack of compliance:&nbsp;For token issuers or DeFi protocols, it is impossible to comply with regulations if the owner of the digital asset is unidentifiable and eligibility criteria cannot be enforced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
 
<p>So, what is the solution? Digital identities. Just as our assets are secured by tying our identity to them in the real world,&nbsp;digital identities can serve as blockchain passports in the DeFi world to guarantee the ownership of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
 
 Link digital identity to tokens:&nbsp;Use a token standard that codes ownership of tokens with a digital identity into the token, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-an-official-standard-for-permissioned-tokens/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8CICjIIuDtTtwwrilIOs32jMUt8WvZHzkBCGzD6Fq2JW_uP4pcxEcwOeQ-xfJF4N4CT92b">ERC3643</a>, the official permissioned token standard. With this standard, token recovery is even possible due to the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8CICjIIuDtTtwwrilIOs32jMUt8WvZHzkBCGzD6Fq2JW_uP4pcxEcwOeQ-xfJF4N4CT92b">ONCHAINID</a>, a decentralized digital identity system. 
 A functional blockchain passport:&nbsp;Once the tokens are issued, they will be allocated to a wallet associated with the digital identity. Furthermore, digital identity functions go far beyond this, and can allow you to recover/transfer tokens, add/delete wallets (e.g. Metamask, Ledger), etc. 
 
<p>More interestingly, when personal data (e.g. country of residence, age…) is verified by trusted parties (e.g. government, big four, KYC providers…), the proof of the verification is stored onchain in the digital identity, making these proofs reusable. For instance, identity owners can grant access to their proof of age to a DeFi protocol that only accepts users above the age of 18.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without revealing their personal information, the DeFi protocol can determine if the identity holders are over 18 years old via the verified proof.&nbsp;Digital identity is thus like a privacy-protected blockchain passport, making it easier, safer and faster to explore DeFi.</p>

<p>An important change is beginning to sweep the world of personal data. For many years, people have debated the question ‘what if individuals — e.g. citizens, customers — were able to assert genuine control over their own&nbsp;data?’</p><p>Now the debate is moving on to how to make this happen, at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Look at some recent developments. In recent&nbsp;weeks:</p>  The UK Government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1016395/Data_Reform_Consultation_Document__Accessible_.pdf">legislation to reform UK data protection laws</a>, includes (amongst many less positive things) new provisions for data intermediaries including for “Personal information management systems, which seek to give data subjects more control over their personal&nbsp;data.”  The UK Department of Culture Media and Sport’s latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">paper</a> on its new National Identity and Attributes Trust framework specifically mentions citizens being able to hold verified attributes in their own personal data&nbsp;stores.  The Scottish Government’s proposed <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a> includes a provision “where people can choose to save their personal information securely to an individual ‘locker’ (a digital attribute store), in order to reuse when they wish to apply to other services”.  The UK Government via its Government Digital Service is to provide a One Log-in for Government which includes the concept of a personal data store to enable citizen control over how their data is being shared across Government. Tom Read GDS Chief Executive Officer said that “One Log-in for government is currently the organisation’s most important piece of&nbsp;work.”  Scottish Government has <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">just signed a contract</a> with Mydex CIC to improve recruitment of citizens to participate in projects to co-design public services that ensures privacy via the use of its Inclued platform and personal data stores.The UK NHS and BBC are now experimenting with personal data stores for health and media consumption records  <p>In other words, multiple different parties and people are converging on the same solution — of providing citizens with their own personal data stores — to solve multiple different problems.</p><p>The big question now is how to enable this to happen at scale, safely, securely and efficiently. One key element of this is useful, easy-to-use interfaces, the taps and switches that mean people can use the infrastructure without having to think much about it. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/flicking-the-switch-of-personal-data-4c5d0d368a31">written about this&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>But operational deployment as scale presents its own challenge. It’s one thing to build something in a lab to illustrate an idea’s potential. It’s quite another to make the transition to 24/7/365 operations, working at scale in the real world. Answering the question ‘how’ requires robust answers to many hard questions relating to infrastructure resilience, security, system architecture, governance, trustworthiness, business model and legal compliance. Here’s a checklist of these questions in a little more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>Are its underlying design principles fit for purpose, robust and built to&nbsp;last?</p><p>We talk about this issue <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/designed-for-integrity-13a69bcda0b2">in detail&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Is the individual’s data really&nbsp;secure?</p><p>It’s very easy to make promises about data security, but very difficult to keep these promises permanently, especially when a system is operating at scale. Here are some of the safeguards that need to be&nbsp;built.</p>  All data should be encrypted in motion and at&nbsp;rest  Distributed architecture: every PDS is separately and individually encrypted (which means the system is not creating a massive centralised database that becomes a honeypot for&nbsp;hackers)  No knowledge operations. Every individual should hold their own private key to their own data: the PDS operator does not have access to this private key, and cannot look into the personal data stores it provides or make any changes to who can send or collect data from it only the individual can.  Everything the company does relating to the security of information management should be independently assessed and certified. To be legitimate, the PDS provider should be certified under ISO 27001 for information security Management.  <p>The Mydex platform displays all these criteria.</p><p>How does the PDS operator cover its costs and make its&nbsp;money?</p>  Is the PDS’s business model open and transparent? Does it, for example, publish a public price tariff, where what organisations are paying, for what, is open for all to&nbsp;see?  How does this business model affect the PDS provider’s incentives? For example, some PDS providers have generated business models where they take a ‘cut’ every time data is shared. This generates an incentive for the PDS provider to maximise the amount of data that is shared, thereby creating a potential conflict of interest between it and the citizens it is supposed to be&nbsp;serving.  <p>To make their offerings attractive to organisations that want to retain control, other PDS providers have created halfway-house ‘personal data stores’ which remain inside the organisation’s operational boundaries, where the individual signs in using the organisation’s systems, and where the organisation places restrictions on what data the individual can share with who. Such faux personal data stores may generate revenue streams for the technology provider, but they generate a conflict of interest with the citizen that defeats the object of having a personal data store in the first&nbsp;place.</p>  Does the PDS provider’s business model create revenue streams that are stable, e.g. designed to last in perpetuity?  <p>Mydex’s business model is designed to be open, to avoid conflicts of interest and to be stable. The model is very simple. Organisations pay a fee to connect to the platform, to enable safe efficient data sharing with individuals. There is no limit on what data can be delivered or accessed by who and for what purpose that is under the control of the individual at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>Does the PDS provider have governance structures designed to ensure its trustworthiness in perpetuity?</p><p>In a new ‘market’ like this, many would-be PDS providers are start-ups that are hungry for funding. Many of them seek funding from venture capitalists who, by definition, are seeking ‘an exit’ in the form of an IPO or trade&nbsp;sale.</p><p>This brings two dangers. First, it incentivises the PDS provider to create a business model that focuses on financial extraction — making money out of citizens and/or organisations — rather than genuine service provision.</p><p>Second, it means that any promises it makes in terms of commitments to privacy, data protection, business model or anything else may only last until the venture is sold. For a PDS provider to be legitimate, its business model and governance must include legally enforceable guarantees that mean it cannot simply go back on its promises in event of ownership of the organisation changing&nbsp;hands.</p><p>That is why Mydex has chosen to be a Community Interest Company — because CIC status builds in legal requirements on the company to stay true to its mission of empowering citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>Is the IT infrastructure robust and capable of operating at&nbsp;scale?</p><p>Many people operating in IT today have a ‘hacker mindset’. They love writing bits of code that do cool things, and every time they come across a new technical challenge they automatically start writing another, separate, bit of code. Hackers are often brilliant at creating cool point solutions. But as these point solutions add up, they generate complexity and chaos. People with the hacker mindset are not good at building robust, integrated, efficient solutions that operate at scale. For that, we need an engineering, infrastructure-building mindset that is always asking ‘how does this piece fit with everything else that has already been built? Will it work stably and reliably, at volume?’ This requires an engineering mindset, not a hacker&nbsp;mindset.</p><p>Can the system scale without generating mounting risks, costs or complexity?</p>  Providing a million personal data stores that are being used to store and share data, day in and day out, is very different to building a demo in a lab. Having robust software development, testing and deployment systems is essential if the flaws of the hacker mindset are to be&nbsp;avoided.  If the system can only work on a particular device such as a smartphone, everyone has to have access to such a device, these devices need to be designed so that they can ‘talk’ to each other, and problems arise if the device is lost, stolen or malfunctions. The only way millions of people can access their data from multiple different devices is if their data is stored (safely) in the&nbsp;cloud.  Some ways forward, such as Open Banking, envisage individuals giving permission for their data to be ported from one service provider to another without it being deposited in the individual’s personal data store. This, proponents claim, cuts out the unnecessary extra step of having a data ‘middleman’. The approach works fine for just one or two transactions. But it creates complexity and cost catastrophes as volumes rise. It’s why (for example) telephone exchanges were invented rather than every telephone line trying to create its own unique connection with every other&nbsp;line.  <p>Independent scrutiny and certification</p><p>It’s very easy for start-ups to make grand claims about what their technology can do or what their beliefs are. Selling ‘brochureware’ and ‘vaporware’ is a time honoured practice in software: Step 1) sell what you intend to make. Step 2) Use the money made from these sales to actually make what you promised. But an operation that works day in, day out, at scale cannot be fed by ‘vision’ and the apparent confidence of the salesman. What’s needed is independent scrutiny and certification.</p><p>That’s why Mydex is independently certified for data management security under ISO27001 and with Fair Data and why it has met the requirements to be listed on UK Government procurement frameworks like G-Cloud and to gain an Open Banking&nbsp;licence.</p><p>Built-in regulatory compliance</p><p>For any system to scale efficiently it has to make it easier, not harder, for service providers to comply with data protection regulations. This requires dedicated tools and infrastructure that a) ‘designs in’ compliance with key principles such as data minimisation under GDPR and b) enables both citizens and service providers to manage related processes simply, quickly and where possible, automatically.</p><p>Leaving compliance to data protection regulations aside to a ‘different department’ — creates a gap and disconnect between ‘legal’ and operations and is not something that can work efficiently and effectively at&nbsp;scale.</p> Summary <p>We know, because we’ve been there. Bringing new ideas to life in a lab environment is a positive, necessary thing to do. But making sure they can be implemented at scale, robustly, reliably and resiliently involves another — very different — set of considerations. This blog sums up our experience of what these considerations are.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/deploying-personal-data-stores-at-scale-ad35fb205e73">DEPLOYING PERSONAL DATA STORES AT SCALE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
