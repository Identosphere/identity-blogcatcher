<p>Vibration analysis (or vibration monitoring) is a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying, monitoring and preventing mechanical failures in rotating and reciprocating machinery. It’s an essential component of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-maintenance">predictive maintenance</a> programs, allowing technicians to detect developing problems in equipment before they lead to costly unplanned downtime or catastrophic failures.</p>



<p>Vibration analysis—a component of condition monitoring systems—utilizes vibration sensors to measure frequencies in an asset and detect abnormalities that may indicate a problem. At its core, vibration analysis is the study of the oscillatory motions of machines and their components around an established equilibrium point. These oscillations can result from a number of issues, including imbalances, misalignments, looseness, bent shafts and bearing defects, among others.</p>



<p>By measuring and analyzing machine vibrations, technicians can better assess the health and performance of equipment, enabling them to pinpoint issues and implement corrective actions. And since rotating and reciprocating components (e.g., motors, compressors, pumps, etc.) tend to vibrate more intensely and more loudly as they age, analyzing changes in vibration can help maintenance managers monitor machine conditions in real-time and proactively identify asset wear and damage.</p>



 Understanding vibrations 



<p>Vibrations are multidimensional, so vibration testing requires an understanding of various parameters. The primary parameters are amplitude, frequency and phase:</p>



 
 Amplitude refers to the magnitude of the vibration, typically measured in units like displacement (mils or micrometers), velocity (inches per second or millimeters per second) or acceleration (g’s). 



 Frequency measures the number of oscillations per unit of time, usually expressed in Hertz (Hz). 



 Phase refers to the relative timing of the vibration waveform, typically measured in degrees. 
 



<p>Vibration analyzers can use these factors—along with others like waveform shape and harmonic content—to identify specific machine faults and their severity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also two major types of vibrations:</p>



 
 Forced vibration occurs when an external force is applied to a system, causing it to vibrate. Examples include the vibrations produced by an operating motor or pump. 



 Natural vibration, also known as resonance, occurs when a system vibrates at its natural frequency. This type of vibration can be problematic if the machine’s natural frequency coincides with the operating frequency, as it can lead to excessive vibrations. 
 



 Conducting a vibration analysis 



<p>In today’s competitive industrial landscape, ensuring the smooth operation and longevity of your machinery is paramount. Following a step-by-step vibration analysis process can help you leverage machine vibrations to better understand equipment and system health.</p>



 Step 1. Gather preliminary data 



<p>To conduct a vibration analysis, start by gathering data about the equipment and/or structure you will analyze. Be sure to identify the location and type of sensors you will need for vibration measurements, including any amplitude and frequency ranges, as the sensors will serve as your data collectors throughout the process. It is also important to gather information about the operating conditions of the equipment, such as speed, load and temperature.</p>



 Step 2. Measure vibrations 



<p>The next step in the process is measuring vibrations from the chosen machinery. Vibration analysis typically involves measuring the vibration amplitude of an asset or system.</p>



<p>In this case, you will rely on an accelerometer attached to key vibration sites to take measurements. Accelerometers (e.g., Piezoelectric accelerometers, proximity probes, Laser Doppler vibrometers, etc.) use high-frequency responses to measure the acceleration of a vibrating object in three directions: up-and-down, side-to-side and front-to-back.</p>



<p>You can also measure vibrations using velocity sensors and displacement sensors. Velocity sensors measure the velocity of a vibrating object, offering a mid-frequency response ideal for monitoring overall machine health. Displacement sensors, on the other hand, measure the displacement of a vibrating object, providing a low-frequency response suitable for detecting structural issues and imbalances.</p>



 Step 3. Analyze the data 



<p>Once you’ve collected all the relevant data, it’s time to analyze it. The analysis stage will require you to use computer algorithms and software to identify vibration patterns and data trends, and you’ll need to compare the data to established standards and guidelines.</p>



<p>Maintenance teams can utilize a variety of techniques to analyze vibration data, including the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Time domain analysis: To conduct a time domain analysis, you will analyze the raw vibration signal over time. Technicians can extract and assess data (e.g., peak amplitude, crest factor, skewness, root mean square (RMS), etc.) of the signal directly from the time waveform. This technique is useful for detecting transient phenomena like impacts or shocks.&nbsp; 



 Frequency domain analysis: Using a mathematical frequency analysis operation called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), frequency domain analysis involves converting the time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal. The resulting frequency spectrum facilitates easier identification of the specific frequencies associated with mechanical faults. 



 Envelope analysis: Also known as demodulation, envelope analysis is primarily used to detect early-stage bearing defects. It involves extracting the high-frequency impact signals generated by damaged bearings from the overall vibration signal, allowing technicians to identify the presence and severity of bearing faults. 



 Modal analysis: Modal analysis is a more advanced technique that focuses on identifying a machine’s natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping characteristics. Studying these properties helps analysts assess the dynamic behavior of a machine and identify potential structural problems and/or resonance conditions. 
 



 Step 4. Interpret the results 



<p>A successful analysis will require vibration analysts to understand the specific frequencies associated with various mechanical issues. Some common fault frequencies include the following:</p>



 
 Fundamental frequency: The frequency at which a rotating component completes one full rotation. Deviations from the baseline fundamental frequency can help you identify specific faults, such as unbalance, misalignment and looseness. 



 Harmonics: The integer multiples of the fundamental frequency often associated with gear-meshing issues or other cyclical events. 



 Sidebands: The result of the modulation of the fundamental frequency by another frequency, as in the interaction between a bearing fault and the frequency of a rotating component. Sidebands often appear as symmetrical peaks around the fundamental frequency or its harmonics and can be indicative of bearing issues and/or broken gear teeth. 
 



 Step 5. Take corrective action 



<p>Once you identify potential issues in the interpretation stage, set alarm thresholds that trigger a response when vibrations exceed them. These thresholds can be based on industry standards, historical data or manufacturer recommendations. The most commonly used types of alarm thresholds are absolute thresholds, trending thresholds and statistical thresholds.</p>



 
 Absolute thresholds are fixed values based on acceptable levels of vibration for specific types of equipment.&nbsp; 



 Trending thresholds are dynamic values that change over time based on the historical performance of the equipment. When vibration levels increase suddenly, it may indicate a developing issue. 



 Statistical thresholds are derived from statistical analyses of historical data, taking into account the mean and standard deviation of vibration levels. 
 



<p>When a system or asset exceeds the alarm threshold, the maintenance manager should take appropriate action to address the issue. This may involve scheduling maintenance, adjusting operating parameters or conducting further analysis to pinpoint the cause of the problem.</p>



 Benefits of vibration analysis 



<p>Implementing vibration analysis as part of a predictive maintenance program offers numerous benefits:</p>



 
 Early fault detection: Vibration analysis can detect developing faults in machinery long before they become visible or audible to human senses. These early detection capabilities help maintenance teams schedule repairs or replacements before a failure occurs, reducing downtime and improving overall productivity. 



 Improved maintenance scheduling: By identifying the severity of machine faults, vibration analysis allows maintenance teams to prioritize their efforts and allocate resources more effectively. This targeted approach can result in significant cost savings and improved equipment reliability. 



 Reduced maintenance costs: Finding and fixing machine faults before they lead to catastrophic failures can help organizations avoid costly repairs and equipment replacements. Furthermore, predictive maintenance based on vibration analysis can extend the lifespan of machinery, further reducing long-term capital expenditures.&nbsp; 



 Enhanced safety: Vibration analysis can play a crucial role in maintaining a safe working environment for employees. Proactively detecting and addressing potential mechanical failures significantly reduces the risk of accidents and injuries in the workplace. 



 Improved energy efficiency: Faulty machinery often consumes more energy than it should, leading to increased operating costs. Rectifying issues using vibration analysis helps organizations optimize asset efficiency and reduce energy consumption. 
 



 Applications of vibration analysis 



<p>The versatility of vibration analysis makes it a useful methodology across a wide range of industries and equipment types.</p>



<p>Manufacturing plants use vibration analysis to monitor the condition of motors (including electric motors), gearboxes, conveyors and machine tools. The vibration data can be used to optimize production processes, reduce the risk of equipment failure and improve overall plant efficiency.</p>



<p>In the automotive industry, vibration analysis plays a significant role in designing, developing and testing components. Analyzing the vibration characteristics of engines, transmissions and suspension systems can help engineers optimize their designs for improved real-world performance and reliability and increased passenger comfort.</p>



<p>In the aerospace industry, vibration analysis enables engineers to identify and address issues like excessive vibration, resonance or material fatigue to enhance the reliability and longevity of aircraft systems. And in the wind power sector, vibration analysis helps turbine operators monitor turbine health in order to identify blade imbalances, gearbox failures and/or bearing defects.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, employee experience refers to the totality of interactions employees have with their organization. It starts the moment a potential hire spots a company’s listing for an open position and ends with an employee’s retirement or departure. It includes every aspect of an employee’s professional life—from workplace culture, company mission, title, daily responsibilities and co-workers to workspaces, systems, company policies and interactions with human resources. Significant and consistent employee experiences—the good and the bad—shape the overall culture of an organization.</p>



<p>Customer experience, on the other hand, includes every interaction and touchpoint between a customer and a company. This experience includes everything from in-store and online interactions to seeking assistance from employees throughout the buying or customer-service journey. And like workplace culture, the customer experience is made better or worse by a positive or negative employee experience.</p>



<p>Glassdoor conducted <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/resources/link-between-glassdoor-reviews-customer-satisfaction/">a 10-year study</a> on the correlation between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. The study found that every 1-star increase in a company’s Glassdoor rating was linked to 2.05 points of higher customer satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 100, demonstrating that a happier, more engaged workforce translates into improved customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>A positive employee experience can provide plenty of other benefits too. When it comes to an organization attracting and retaining top talent, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/mission-culture-survey/">77% of potential hires</a> say that culture and company mission are major deciding factors. A fulfilling and positive employee experience also means workers are likely to feel more appreciated and have an overall healthier well-being. This sense of fulfillment and appreciation can reduce employee churn, boost morale in the work environment and increase productivity.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/321725/gallup-q12-meta-analysis-report.aspx">Gallup meta-analysis</a> of more than 450 research studies compared the business performance of companies with positive employee experiences to those with negative ones. The analysis observed that companies with positive employee experiences saw the following:</p>



 
 81% less absenteeism 



 66% greater employee well-being 



 23% higher profit 



 18% higher productivity 



 10% greater customer loyalty and engagement 
 



 Strategies for improving the employee experience 



<p>Companies that foster a positive employee experience can obtain a clear competitive advantage over those that don’t. To improve the employee experience in your own company, you must first frame it across seven stages of the employee journey, also known as the employee lifecycle:</p>



 Stage 1: Recruitment 



<p>Recruitment is how a potential hire discovers your company’s open positions—be it a job posting on LinkedIn or through a recruiter. It’s how prospects can learn about job responsibilities, perks and culture.</p>



 Stage 2: Hiring process 



<p>This is the moment you and a potential hire have agreed to employment terms. At this point, the candidate has transitioned into a new hire.</p>



 Stage 3: Onboarding process 



<p>A new employee’s onboarding experience occurs during their training, which includes teaching them how to use all necessary processes and tools. The employee is also introduced to your company’s culture during this stage.</p>



 Stage 4: Employee engagement/talent management 



<p>Your employee has finished onboarding and is now contributing to the company’s efforts. This stage requires ongoing effort to make sure the employee feels valued and supported as they carry on in their daily tasks. As mentioned earlier, engaged employees are more productive and less likely to leave.</p>



 Stage 5: Performance management 



<p>To help the employee improve on weaknesses and build on their strengths, periodic performance reviews offer a chance to communicate what’s working, what needs improvement and how the company can help the employee succeed.</p>



 Stage 6: Development 



<p>This stage involves helping the employee explore other interests and opportunities for growth within the company.</p>



 Stage 7: Departure 



<p>This stage completes the employee experience lifecycle, and it occurs when the employee either retires or exits the company.</p>



<p>Each stage of the employee experience lifecycle offers opportunities to either reinforce a positive experience or learn about ways to improve. Once you understand how your current experience is performing across these seven stages, you can then develop an employee experience strategy. This is a method your company can use to assess and improve its employee experience at every stage of the lifecycle.</p>



 How to develop an employee experience plan and strategy 



<p>The first step in developing an employee experience strategy is to assess your current employee experience. The goal of this initial assessment is to identify points of friction as well as any positive elements. One way to assess the employee lifecycle is to ask employees to complete employee experience surveys. Encourage your workers to give open and honest employee feedback regarding culture, accommodations, benefits, growth opportunities, work-life balance and every other element of the employee experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When your assessment is complete, HR team members, business leaders and other stakeholders can work together to draft a plan for improving any areas that are negatively impacting productivity, employee retention, engagement and overall job satisfaction.</p>



<p>These are some steps to include when drafting this plan (the employee experience strategy):</p>



 
 Defining strategy goals, top priorities and objectives for achieving desired business outcomes, such as reduced churn, improved morale or increased productivity. 



 Assessing each of the seven stages in the employee experience lifecycle to pinpoint which elements prevent you from reaching your goals. 



 Creating initiatives to take corrective action on the elements that need improvement. 



 Implementing these initiatives in milestones with clear key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure success. 



 Continuously monitoring the employee experience lifecycle to adjust tactics when necessary. Exit interviews are a useful method for HR leaders to continuously monitor the overall experience for potential issues. 
 



<p>There are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/VGJE9J90">several strategies</a> you can use to create a great employee experience, such as the following:</p>



 
 Personalization: This means creating a fit between your employees’ needs and the needs of the organization. When you create personalized experiences for your employees, you provide them with tools and resources that improve their individual wellness and show that you support their growth and success. Offering remote work or hybrid work is one form of personalization. 



 Transparency: This improves visibility and accountability across the entire company, from employee to employer. One way to achieve transparency is to hold routine Q&amp;A sessions. 



 Simplicity: This removes any redundant and unnecessary steps and information that can confuse employees or create needless friction. 



 Authenticity: This makes sure that the employee work experience reflects your company’s purported values and mission statement. When employees believe that the company they work for is authentic, they are more likely to feel that the company has integrity. 



 Responsiveness: Timely communication helps employees feel heard, and it offers an opportunity for you and them to share information and change course on behaviors. One such form of communication is a pulse survey, which is a method used to identify issues that can be addressed in real-time. 
 



 Employee experience and IBM 



<p>As emphasized earlier in this post, companies that foster a positive employee experience—start to finish—can achieve a clear competitive advantage over those who don’t.</p>



<p>The blog post “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/rethinking-recruitment">Rethinking Recruitment</a>“ paraphrases advice from Angela Hood, founder and CEO of ThisWay Global, that provides good direction for any company looking to provide a better employee experience that goes beyond recruitment. When attempting to attract (and keep) top talent, Hood urges companies to be in a position to say two things to job candidates:</p>



 
 We use the best technology to identify you because you and your skills are unique, and we want you to come work for us. 



 When you get here, we’re going help you automate the parts of your job that you’ve never really enjoyed before, because we want you to dig into the areas you’re passionate about. 
 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and automation are two of the best technology solution types to help create employee experiences that boost satisfaction and productivity, especially as it relates to two of the seven strategies mentioned above:</p>



 
 Personalization: Provide tools that show you support your employees’ individual success. For example, enable them to hand off time-consuming tasks, such as pulling reports, to personalized digital workers. 



 Simplicity: Use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a> to remove the friction and bottlenecks from business processes, reduce the number of tools employees have to manage to do their jobs and decrease the amount of time they spend searching for information. 
 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson®</a> solutions can help improve employee experience by providing easy, conversational access to the information and task automations your employees need to better serve customers and get stuff done.</p>

<p>What can your organization achieve with an offensive security platform? According to a new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52201">Forrester Consulting study</a>, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/randori-recon">IBM Security Randori</a> platform delivered a 303% ROI over 3 years and paid for itself in less than 6 months by helping to mitigate risk exposure, better prioritize risk response decisions and act faster.</p>



 About the study 



<p>IBM commissioned Forrester to conduct the Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) study by interviewing four clients about the value of their investments in the Randori attack surface management (ASM) and continuous automated red teaming (CART) solutions. The interviewed security leaders shared that by deploying the Randori platform, their organizations were able to detect <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/shadow-it">shadow IT</a> assets, rapidly respond to vulnerabilities like Log4j and redirect time previously spent triaging exposures to more proactive security exercises.</p>



<p>The June 2023 study noted: “Compared to their prior environments, interviewees reported between 50% and approximately 95% reductions in manual effort with Randori’s continuous security monitoring.”</p>



<p>Based on the in-depth client interviews, Forrester constructed a single composite organization that aggregated the representatives’ experiences with using the Randori platform. The composite matured its security to an ASM-focused posture in the first year with IBM Security Randori Recon and augmented its red team capabilities with IBM Security Randori Attack in the second and third years. Many quantifiable benefits were identified, including the following:</p>



 
 90% fewer hours of vulnerability scanning per year 



 75% labor savings from augmented red team activities 



 30% reduction in time to triage exposures for remediation 



 20% decrease in cyber insurance premiums

<p>En la era digital actual, la autenticación en línea se ha convertido en un desafío cada vez mayor. Las contraseñas tradicionales han demostrado ser ineficientes y bajo constantes ataques cibernéticos. Sin embargo, hoy tenemos una nueva forma de manejar nuestra autenticación: la identidad auto soberana (SSI, por sus siglas en inglés). SSI es un modelo que permite la autenticación empoderando a los usuarios al otorgarles control total sobre su identidad digital.</p>
<p>En este artículo, exploraremos cómo la identidad auto soberana redefinirá la autenticación en línea, proporcionando una solución mucho más segura y eficiente para proteger nuestros datos y privacidad en un mundo cada vez más digital.</p>
<p>El problema de las contraseñas tradicionales y las bases de datos centralizadas</p>
<p>Uno de los principales problemas con las contraseñas tradicionales radica en el hecho de que se almacenan en bases de datos centralizadas. Esto plantea un riesgo significativo, ya que, si un atacante logra acceder a esta base de datos, puede obtener fácilmente las contraseñas de múltiples usuarios.<br>
A lo largo de los años, fuimos testigos de muchísimos casos en los que bases de datos centralizadas han sido pirateadas y millones de contraseñas y datos privados de los usuarios fueron robados. Estos ataques cibernéticos han expuesto la vulnerabilidad inherente de este sistema. Incluso si los usuarios eligen contraseñas fuertes y únicas, si las bases de datos centrales no cuentan con medidas de seguridad adecuadas, sus cuentas siguen estando en riesgo.<br>
Además, estas medidas de seguridad para proteger bases de datos centralizadas se vuelven cada vez más costosas, debido a que las técnicas de los ataques se van refinando y haciendo más eficientes y difíciles de prevenir. Si a esto encima le sumamos la explosión de la inteligencia artificial que estamos viviendo, próximamente será casi inviable poder prevenir ataque cibernéticos y fraudes en internet.</p>
<p>La Identidad Auto Soberana como método de autenticación</p>
<p>La identidad auto soberana es un enfoque revolucionario para la autenticación en línea, que pone a la privacidad y a la seguridad como focos centrales de su diseño. En lugar de depender de terceros centralizados, como empresas o instituciones gubernamentales, la identidad auto soberana otorga a los individuos el control total sobre su identidad digital. Utiliza tecnologías descentralizadas como blockchain para proporcionar un sistema seguro y confiable.</p>
<p>En un sistema de identidad auto soberana, los usuarios tienen la capacidad de crear, poseer y gestionar su propia identidad digital. Esto implica la generación de claves criptográficas únicas que se utilizan para firmar y verificar las transacciones. Estas claves criptográficas se almacenan en una billetera digital personal, que está protegida con una contraseña fuerte o incluso con biometría.</p>
<p>Beneficios de la identidad auto soberana (SSI)</p>
<p>La identidad auto soberana ofrece una serie de beneficios en comparación con las contraseñas tradicionales y otros sistemas de autenticación centralizados. Algunos de estos beneficios incluyen:</p>
<p>·         Mayor seguridad: Al descentralizar el control de la identidad, se reduce significativamente la posibilidad de ataques cibernéticos. Las claves criptográficas y la tecnología blockchain proporcionan un nivel adicional de seguridad.<br>
·         Privacidad mejorada: Con la identidad auto soberana, los usuarios tienen el poder de compartir solo la información necesaria en cada interacción en línea, sin revelar más datos personales de los necesarios.<br>
·         Eliminación de contraseñas: Al utilizar claves criptográficas, la identidad auto soberana elimina la necesidad de contraseñas tradicionales, lo que no solo reduce la posibilidad de robos y ataques basados en contraseñas, sino que mejora ampliamente la experiencia de los usuarios.<br>

<p>Threats to your data are virtually everywhere these days, and too often, data compromises seem almost inevitable. But with a proactive approach to data security, organizations can fight back against the seemingly endless waves of threats.</p>



<p>IBM Security X-Force found the most common threat on organizations is extortion, which comprised more than a quarter (27%) of all <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/DB4GL8YM">cybersecurity threats</a> in 2022. Thirty percent of those incidents occurred in manufacturing organizations. Malware attacks via backdoors made up 21% of all incidents, and 17% were ransomware attacks. For the 12th year in a row, the average cost of a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">breach</a> was the highest in the US healthcare industry at $10.10 million.</p>



 Data protection and data privacy 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-security">Data protection</a>, defined as protecting important information from corruption, damage or loss, is critical because data breaches resulting from cyberattacks can include personally identifiable information (PII), health information, financial information, intellectual property and other personal data. Data breaches can be disastrous for organizations.&nbsp;But the loss of personal information in a data breach can also have significant consequences on an individual, including financial loss, identity theft, other fraud, emotional distress and even damage to reputation.</p>



<p>Closely related to data security and an integral part of taking a proactive stance toward it is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/meeting-todays-complex-data-privacy-challenges/">data privacy</a>, or how data is stored, accessed and secured against improper access, theft or other loss. An example of the importance of data privacy is in the healthcare industry, where it’s critical to protect confidential patient information for patient trust and comply with regulations.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator/data-protection-strategy">Learn how to create a holistic data protection strategy</a>



 Staying on top of data security to keep ahead of ever-evolving threats 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">Data security</a> is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorized access, corruption or theft throughout its entire lifecycle. It refers to the processes and tools used to safeguard a corporation’s data across all platforms and applications—both on-premises and in cloud computing—from unauthorized access, corruption, accidental disclosure, modification and loss.</p>



<p>The key to secure data is maintaining an organization’s data confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) throughout its lifecycle. That can include trade secrets and other sensitive information.</p>



<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xEgSe5RwE">data security strategy</a> includes people, processes and technology. It means physically securing servers and user devices, managing and controlling access, application security and patching, maintaining thoroughly tested, usable data backups and educating employees. But it also means having a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator/data-protection-strategy">comprehensive set</a> of threat management, detection, and response tools and platforms that protect sensitive data across today’s hybrid cloud environments.</p>



 Where do data breaches originate? 



<p>It’s important to remember that sensitive data needs to be protected from both insider and outsider threats. Outsiders can include lone hackers and cybercriminals who can belong to a criminal group or a nation-state-sponsored organization. Threats can come in the form of destructive malware, phishing or ransomware.</p>



<p>Insider threats include current and former employees, customers or partners, and accidental breaches by employees. One such breach occurred in May 2022, when a departing <a href="https://www.code42.com/blog/insider-threat-examples-in-real-life/">Yahoo</a> employee allegedly downloaded about 570,000 pages of Yahoo’s intellectual property (IP) just minutes after receiving a job offer from one of Yahoo’s competitors. In 2021, a <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2021/08/31/dallas-it-worker-fired-for-deleting-city-files-also-erased-data-twice-before-official-says/">Dallas</a> IT employee was fired for accidentally deleting 15 terabytes of Dallas police and other city files.</p>



 Best practices for proactive data security&nbsp; 



<p>Best cybersecurity practices mean ensuring your information security in many and varied ways and from many angles. Here are some data security measures that every organization should strongly consider implementing.</p>



 
 Define sensitive data. Implement data classification based on how sensitive and valuable it is. That tells you which data must be protected from unauthorized access to prevent harm to individuals and businesses. 



 Establish a cybersecurity policy. Create a plan that lays out your organization’s statement of intent, principles and other approaches to cybersecurity. 



 Create an incident response plan, a written document that details how you will respond before, during and after a suspected or confirmed security threat. 



 Consider the increased use of personal computers, tablets and other mobile devices. Such <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mobile-security">mobile devices</a> increase risk because they are authenticated and authorized in different ways and introduce new endpoints that need protection from cyber threats. 



 Use dedicated data security software. An integrated data protection system can protect your assets by monitoring them, automating access control, setting up notifications, and auditing your password management. 



 Put into place data protection tools such as data encryption algorithms, key management, redaction, data masking and erasure, and data resiliency. These tools guard against cybercriminal activity, insider threats and human error. 



 Require strong passwords. Strong passwords are your company’s first defense in protecting data and customer information. Make sure you have a strong corporate password policy. 



 Consider biometric technology, which verifies physical characteristics to identify individuals. 



 Protect data with full, differential, and incremental backups stored in different locations so you know you can <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatabackup/feature/Full-incremental-or-differential-How-to-choose-the-correct-backup-type">back up critical data</a> for data loss prevention (DLP). 



 Use external and internal firewalls to protect against any type of cyberattack. 
 



<p>Monitoring your users and who can access what data is also important.</p>



 
 Monitor user activity to protect overall security. 



 Limit data access to critical assets by only allowing employees needing access. A common data management error is making sensitive data available to the entire organization. 



 Closely monitor users with increased access to view and alter sensitive data. It makes sense to keep tabs on users who can access your more private and essential data. 



 Conduct regular reviews and remove permissions and authentications from employees who no longer need them. Ensuring that permissions are removed when no longer needed lessens the security risk. 



 Manage third-party-related risks. These include vendors, contractors and other outside individuals with access to your organization’s data. 
 



<p>Another critical area is making sure you take care of your platforms, computers and records, both current ones and those you are disposing of.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Educate employees about digital safety, including two-factor or multi-factor authentication. In addition to setting up corporate security policies, ensure your employees understand what they are and how to follow them. Make sure they recognize phishing and other cybersecurity threats. 



 Secure databases in the physical data center, big data platforms and the cloud. Know what practices, policies and technologies will <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/database-security">protect your databases</a>, wherever they are located. 



 Dispose of old computers and records securely. Don’t throw your private data away with your machines. Sanitize computers for data erasure and destroy all records. 
 



 Regulatory compliance efforts are just a start 



<p>Amid growing public concern about data privacy, governments worldwide are introducing stringent compliance regulations. Current approaches to data privacy and data protection are mostly reactive, which can place an onerous burden on compliance officers as current regulations evolve, new industry regulations are introduced, and the penalties of non-compliance continue to rise.</p>



<p>To comply with data protection regulations, highly regulated industries require organizations to maintain high data security.&nbsp;For instance, the <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/how-ccpa-shaping-states-data-privacy/">California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)</a> protects the privacy rights of California consumers, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act&nbsp;(HIPAA) applies to US healthcare organizations. The PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) helps businesses accepting credit cards to process, store and transmit credit card data securely.</p>



<p>There are many reasons it’s vital to be proactive about keeping data safe. The threat of data breaches or losses, failed audits or regulatory compliance failures can not only damage an organization’s reputation and compromise intellectual property, but also bring about substantial fines. For instance, data breaches under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can cost an organization up to 4% of its global annual revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is more.</p>



<p><a href="https://resourcehub.bakermckenzie.com/en/resources/data-privacy-security/north-america/united-states/topics/penalties-for-non-compliance">Fines</a> for not complying with data privacy laws can also be steep in the US. Violating HIPAA Privacy Standards can bring fines ranging from $1000 to $50,000 per violation. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can assess penalties of up to $40,000 per violation of the FTC Act or the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), with each day of non-compliance being a separate violation and fine.</p>



<p>Yet, facilitating compliance is challenging as data sets, organizational structures and processes become increasingly complex. For example, much of today’s data resides across a hybrid multicloud environment, on-prem and in multiple clouds and data lakes.</p>



 The cost of data breaches: Why a proactive approach matters 



<p>Companies need to get proactive about data security since a breach can be disastrous for their bottom line. In 2022, it took an average of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">277 days</a> to identify and contain a data breach. But if organizations could shorten this time to 200 days or less, they could save an average of $1.12 million. Stolen or compromised credentials, the most common type of breach, cost companies $150,000 more than other types of data breaches. They also took the longest time to identify, at 327 days.</p>



<p>Having an open, intelligent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/YZB1K98O">approach</a> to accessing, curating, categorizing and sharing data across the enterprise helps strengthen compliance and also enables more insightful, data-driven decision making. The more you know and protect your sensitive data, the better you can use that data in new projects and increase your organization’s innovation.</p>



 Data security solutions and IBM 



<p>The automated data governance capabilities in IBM data fabric solutions ensure a required level of privacy is enforced as sensitive data is consumed within key endpoints across a distributed data landscape. By combining data fabric and data security, organizations can ensure their data remains compliant and secure, and their networks are protected. </p>



<p>As an organization’s data footprint expands across various environments, partners and endpoints, the threat landscape also expands. Cybercriminals seeking to exploit security vulnerabilities put sensitive and valuable information at risk. It’s vital to confidently protect data, which is a critical foundation of every business operation.</p>



<p><a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/importance-modern-day-data-security-platform">Data security solutions</a>, whether implemented on-premises or in a hybrid cloud, help organizations gain greater visibility and insights into investigating and remediating cybersecurity threats, enforcing real-time controls and managing regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>SpruceID will host the first fully-remote asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations at the end of August. This event will provide a collaboration forum over the course of two weeks for implementers of the draft technical specification for unattended or fully online presentation of mobile driver’s licenses (ISO/IEC 18013-7).</p><p>The objective of this interoperability event is to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption, while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standard.</p> Mobile Driver’s Licenses: Background <p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases than just proving one’s capability to operate a vehicle. A driver’s license serves as the primary form of identification for many people globally. As society shifts to a digital-first world, people need digital versions of identification credentials to represent various facets of their identity in a secure way. </p><p>However, creating a digitally capable version of a physical credential is not as simple as one might think. Digital credentials need to be verifiable, tamper-evident, provably authentic, and (we believe) afford individuals more privacy and control of their personal data in their digital interactions. </p><p>You can learn more about SpruceID’s philosophy on building mobile driver’s licenses in a way that empowers users with more privacy in digital interactions here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">  Credible: Introducing Mobile Driver’s Licenses  We believe that in the modern, technology-driven world, an ID will become much more composable than a piece of plastic that sits idly in your wallet.

<p>Knowledge workers, typically those with advanced training and years of experience, have become a valuable asset for companies worldwide. Businesses lean on these people who “think for a living” to drive innovation, solve problems and manage personnel.</p>



<p>Yet, empowering knowledge workers to stay productive can be a constant challenge. Too often, these skilled workers get bogged down in managing day-to-day tasks or the bureaucracy of the business, leaving less time for creative thinking. When knowledge workers leave the company, businesses face another challenge—finding a way to document, share and retain their knowledge to extend its benefits throughout the company.</p>



<p>Making the most of the skills, creativity and insights of knowledge workers requires thoughtful business management, from integrating company data to deploying well-documented processes. This article looks at how emerging tools can help.</p>



 What is a knowledge worker? 



<p>A knowledge worker is a professional who generates value for the organization with their expertise, critical thinking and interpersonal skills. They’re often tasked with developing new products or services, problem-solving, or creating strategies and action plans that will drive better business outcomes. Knowledge workers have formal training or significant experience, are skilled communicators and can learn and adapt to a shifting work environment.</p>



<p>Knowledge workers are an essential part of the evolving <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/resources/xla-measurement-for-digital-workplace/">digital workplace</a>. You can find them playing the role of a department leader with extensive institutional knowledge or acting as a subject matter expert called in to consult on a specific business challenge. The agility and adaptability of knowledge workers can help organizations foster collaboration and quickly respond to changes and challenges, from technological advances to major global events.</p>



<p>Though they would seem to mean the same thing, knowledge workers differ from information workers. Knowledge workers take existing information and use it to create new information. Information workers, on the other hand, apply information to perform a task. In the hierarchy of today’s workplace, knowledge workers oversee the daily work of the information worker.</p>



 The rise of the knowledge worker 



<p>The term “knowledge worker” was coined by business consultant Peter Drucker in 1959 as a new iteration of the white-collar worker in his book, The Landmarks of Tomorrow. In it, he argued that by the 21st century, the most valuable asset to any organization would be its knowledge worker productivity. In a 1999 <a href="https://hbr.org/2005/01/managing-oneself">Harvard Business </a>Review article, Drucker noted that when people perform the work they are good at and that fits their abilities, they can not only cultivate a more successful career in the knowledge economy, they can ultimately bring more value to the organization.</p>



<p>At the time, Drucker saw how the type of work was shifting from primarily blue-collar jobs using manual labor to white-collar jobs that rely upon the intellectual skills and knowledge of employees to create and execute tasks. Drucker foresaw the impending shift toward information technology and a new class of workers whose valued skill was their knowledge. This increased focus on information and new technology would help the economy grow, but at the cost of many blue-collar jobs, Drucker predicted.</p>



<p>While many of the jobs considered to be knowledge workers today existed when Drucker coined the term (e.g., pharmacists, teachers, construction managers), there are countless other job titles that have emerged from our new information age, such as computer programmers or IT consultants.</p>



 Benefits of using knowledge workers 



<p>Whether it’s analyzing business metrics, reevaluating processes to find new opportunities for automation or encouraging more collaboration in a team’s daily work, knowledge workers bring a number of advantages to a company, including the following:</p>



 
 Providing leadership: Many knowledge-based job roles include managerial and decision-making tasks, such as overseeing employees, providing guidance or generating ideas that team members then execute. Knowledge workers have advanced experience, work collaboratively and are often asked to view problems in a holistic way; these are traits that can also make them good leaders. 



 Fostering teamwork: When persistent problems arise, organizations can benefit when someone provides new knowledge or applies strategic thinking to a team, process or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workflow">workflow</a>. Knowledge workers are able to take a “birds-eye view” of challenges to fully understand and solve them. This approach can help find new ways of bringing different stakeholders and co-workers together, encouraging collaboration across departments and throughout the organization. 



 Enhancing communication: When knowledge workers have great interpersonal communication skills, it helps foster a sense of community and better understanding of the purpose behind an initiative. This work environment also encourages people at all levels to share their expertise and work collaboratively to achieve company goals. 



 Building a growth mindset: Because of today’s rapidly changing digital landscape, companies need knowledge workers who provide a “<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/409178/why-having-a-growth-mindset-is-critical-for-company-success.html#:~:text=To%20have%20a%20growth%20mindset,learn%20and%20develop%20new%20skills.">growth mindset</a>” approach to business, encouraging flexibility and the ability to see problems as opportunities for growth. 
 



 Knowledge workers and knowledge management 



<p>Most organizations today see value in leveraging the expertise of knowledge workers; however, using that information effectively often poses a challenge. How do you scale up knowledge-sharing throughout the organization, throughout the country or across the globe? How do you retain that information when employees are free to take their “know-how” to another company at any time?</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/knowledge-management">Knowledge management</a> offers a solution. It creates a process of identifying, organizing, storing and disseminating information created and used by knowledge workers within an organization. When companies create pathways and processes for sharing knowledge, it increases collaboration, identifies opportunities for efficiencies and helps keep valuable knowledge secure.</p>



<p>Here are some different tools organizations can use to help knowledge workers store, share and use information more efficiently.</p>



 
 Generative AI: Rapidly evolving <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI</a> tools have capabilities far beyond writing content and code. Knowledge workers can use them to quickly gather information about a topic, search for solutions to business problems and flesh out innovative ideas. 



 Business analytics: Data and insights help knowledge workers make informed decisions and find new opportunities. While Big Data and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> provide the numbers, knowledge workers are key to understanding them. 



 Data integration and democratization: Data democratization is an approach to data architecture that allows people throughout the organization to access, use and talk about the data they need with ease. The aim is to break down silos between departments with better data management and integration. The result? Fostering innovation—typically a task driven by knowledge workers. 



 Content management systems (CMS): Knowledge workers need a system for creating and managing documents that disseminate information, insights and data, both internally and with outside stakeholders. 



 Collaborative tools: Intranets, wikis and other collaborative ways to share data help foster data sharing and idea generation in real-time, while also providing a unified knowledge base and place for documenting processes. 
 



 Knowledge worker productivity 



<p>Knowledge workers are known for being highly creative and productive employees; however, their productivity and ability to think about “big-picture” business solutions can be stymied when they have to shift their focus to other tasks.</p>



<p>The challenge for many may simply be time. For example, when scientists, data analysts and computer engineers have tight deadlines and managerial tasks, it limits the time they have available for brainstorming, testing and sharing knowledge.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/boosting-the-productivity-of-knowledge-workers">McKinsey observed</a>, these challenges typically fall into one of five categories:</p>



 
 Physical: Often physical distance, different time zones or hybrid offices can prohibit the collaboration opportunities needed for knowledge workers to share information and develop new ideas. 



 Technical: Knowledge workers need to have the right tools and infrastructure set up for sharing the data they need to collaborate and innovate. 



 Social/cultural: When companies fail to create a culture of collaboration, it hinders the ability of knowledge workers to work with disparate groups to find efficiencies and new processes. 



 Contextual: Silos can also occur when different departments within a company have different systems and ways of looking at business objectives. Companies need to create a common language for talking about goals to break down contextual barriers. 



 Temporal: Time is a challenge regardless of industry or role, yet it can be particularly challenging for knowledge workers who need space for creativity, collaboration and gathering insights from others in their field. 
 



 IBM and knowledge worker productivity 



<p>As mentioned earlier in this post, there are a number of advantages that knowledge workers bring to their organizations—from strategic leadership to innovation. But the benefits can only be realized if their productivity isn’t locked up in non-knowledge work tasks. In other words, it’s better to have your knowledge workers synthesize the information and provide actionable insights than pull the data.</p>



<p>Part of the problem is the number of tools knowledge workers use to do their job—endless screen switching leads to inefficiencies and distraction from the important. Good news: AI and automation technologies are evolving to provide easy, conversational access to the information and task automations knowledge workers need to better serve customers and generate value with their expertise, critical thinking and interpersonal skills.</p>



<p>Pre-built to add value quickly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson®</a> solutions provide ever-expanding skill sets, AI models that constantly learn, and automations that can be orchestrated in real-time so knowledge workers can do the following:</p>



 
 Hand off time-consuming tasks, such as pulling reports, to personalized digital workers. 



 Get the right information at the right time—in the right context—with intelligent document understanding and enterprise search. 



 Remove the friction of providing traditional support and deliver great customer experiences. 
 



<p>From HR to procurement to customer service, IBM Watson solutions are augmenting work to improve customer care and boost knowledge worker engagement and productivity. Customers get an accurate and efficient self-service experience and knowledge workers get the intelligence and tools they need to free up time for higher-value work.</p>

<p>These computer science terms are often used interchangeably, but what differences make each a unique technology?</p>



<p>Technology is becoming more embedded in our daily lives by the minute. To keep up with the pace of consumer expectations, companies are relying more heavily on machine learning algorithms to make things easier. You can see its application in social media (through object recognition in photos) or in talking directly to&nbsp;devices (like Alexa or Siri).</p>



<p>While <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> are related technologies, the terms are often used interchangeably, which frequently leads to confusion about their differences. This blog post will clarify some of the ambiguity.</p>



 How do artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks relate to each other? 



<p>The easiest way to think about artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks is to think of them as a series of AI systems from largest to smallest, each encompassing the next.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence is the overarching system. Machine learning is a subset of AI. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, and neural networks make up the backbone of deep learning algorithms. It’s the number of node layers, or depth, of neural networks that distinguishes a single neural network from a deep learning algorithm, which must have more than three.</p>



 What is artificial intelligence (AI)? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a>, the broadest term of the three, is used to classify machines that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning. AI uses predictions and automation to optimize and solve complex tasks that humans have historically done, such as facial and speech recognition, decision making and translation.</p>



 Categories of AI 



<p>Three main categories of AI are:</p>



 
 Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) 



 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 



 Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) 
 



<p>ANI is considered “weak” AI, whereas the other two types are classified as “strong” AI. We define weak AI by its ability to complete a specific task, like winning a chess game or identifying a particular individual in a series of photos. Natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, which let companies automate tasks and underpin <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/chatbots-explained">chatbots</a> and virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa, are examples of ANI. Computer vision is a factor in the development of self-driving cars.</p>



<p>Stronger forms of AI, like AGI and ASI, incorporate human behaviors more prominently, such as the ability to interpret tone and emotion. Strong AI is defined by its ability compared to humans. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) would perform on par with another human, while Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)—also known as superintelligence—would surpass a human’s intelligence and ability. Neither form of Strong AI exists yet, but research in this field is ongoing.</p>



 Using AI for business 



<p>An increasing number of businesses, about <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/GVAGA3JP">35%</a> globally, are using AI, and another 42% are exploring the technology. The development of <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a>—which uses powerful foundation models that train on large amounts of unlabeled data—can be adapted to new use cases and bring flexibility and scalability that is likely to accelerate the adoption of AI significantly. In early tests, IBM has seen generative AI bring time to value up to 70% faster than traditional AI.</p>



<p>Whether you use AI applications based on ML or foundation models, AI can give your business a competitive advantage. Integrating customized AI models into your workflows and systems, and automating functions such as customer service, supply chain management and cybersecurity, can help a business meet customers’ expectations, both today and as they increase in the future.</p>



<p>The key is identifying the right data sets from the start to help ensure you use quality data to achieve the most substantial competitive advantage. You’ll also need to create a hybrid, AI-ready architecture that can successfully use data wherever it lives—on mainframes, data centers, in private and public clouds and at the edge.</p>



<p>Your AI must be trustworthy because anything less means risking damage to a company’s reputation and bringing regulatory fines. Misleading models and those containing bias or that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfqtFvWOfg0">hallucinate</a> can come at a high cost to customers’ privacy, data rights and trust. Your AI must be explainable, fair and transparent.</p>



 

 



 What is machine learning? 



<p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows for optimization. When set up correctly, it helps you make predictions that minimize the errors that arise from merely guessing. For example, companies like Amazon use machine learning to recommend products to a specific customer based on what they’ve looked at and bought before.</p>



<p>Classic or “non-deep” machine learning depends on human intervention to allow a computer system to identify patterns, learn, perform specific tasks and provide accurate results. Human experts determine the hierarchy of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say I showed you a series of images of different types of fast food—“pizza,” “burger” and “taco.” A human expert working on those images would determine the characteristics distinguishing each picture as a specific fast food type. The bread in each food type might be a distinguishing feature. Alternatively, they might use labels, such as “pizza,” “burger” or “taco” to streamline the learning process through supervised learning.</p>



<p>While the subset of AI called deep machine learning can leverage labeled datasets to inform its algorithm in supervised learning, it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text, images), and it can automatically determine the set of features that distinguish “pizza,” “burger” and “taco” from one another. As we generate more big data, data scientists will use more machine learning. For a deeper dive into the differences between these approaches, check out <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning">Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What’s the Difference?</a></p>



<p>A third category of machine learning is reinforcement learning, where a computer learns by interacting with its surroundings and getting feedback (rewards or penalties) for its actions. And online learning is a type of ML where a data scientist updates the ML model as new data becomes available.</p>



<p>To learn more about machine learning, check out the following video:</p>



 

 



 How deep learning differs from machine learning 



<p>As our article on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/deep-learning">deep learning</a> explains, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. The primary difference between machine learning and deep learning is how each algorithm learns and how much data each type of algorithm uses.</p>



<p>Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required. It also enables the use of large data sets, earning the title of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data">scalable machine learning</a>. That capability is exciting as we explore the use of unstructured data further, particularly since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/structured-vs-unstructured-data">over 80% of an organization’s data is estimated to be unstructured</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Observing patterns in the data allows a deep-learning model to cluster inputs appropriately. Taking the same example from earlier, we could group pictures of pizzas, burgers and tacos into their respective categories based on the similarities or differences identified in the images. A deep-learning model requires more data points to improve accuracy, whereas a machine-learning model relies on less data given its underlying data structure. Enterprises generally use deep learning for more complex tasks, like virtual assistants or fraud detection.</p>



 What is a neural network? 



<p>Neural networks, also called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are the backbone of deep learning algorithms. They are called “neural” because they mimic how neurons in the brain signal one another.</p>



<p>Neural networks are made up of node layers – an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node is an artificial neuron that connects to the next, and each has a weight and threshold value. When one node’s output is above the threshold value, that node is activated and sends its data to the network’s next layer. If it’s below the threshold, no data passes along.</p>



<p>Training data teach neural networks and help improve their accuracy over time. Once the learning algorithms are fined-tuned, they become powerful computer science and AI tools because they allow us to very quickly classify and cluster data. Using neural networks, speech and image recognition tasks can happen in minutes instead of the hours they take when done manually. Google’s search algorithm is a well-known example of a neural network.</p>



 What’s the difference between deep learning and neural networks? 



<p>As mentioned in the explanation of neural networks above, but worth noting more explicitly, the “deep” in deep learning refers to the depth of layers in a neural network. A neural network of more than three layers, including the inputs and the output, can be considered a deep-learning algorithm. That can be represented by the following diagram:</p>







<p>Most deep neural networks are feed-forward, meaning they only flow in one direction from input to output. However, you can also train your model through back-propagation, meaning moving in the opposite direction, from output to input. Back-propagation allows us to calculate and attribute the error associated with each neuron, allowing us to adjust and fit the algorithm appropriately.</p>



 Managing your AI data 



<p>While all these areas of AI can help streamline areas of your business and improve your customer experience, achieving AI goals can be challenging because you’ll first need to ensure you have the right systems to construct learning algorithms to manage your data. Data management is more than merely building the models you’ll use for your business. You’ll need a place to store your data and mechanisms for cleaning it and controlling for bias before you can start building anything.</p>

   Sophisticated identity attacks are on the rise. Learn to prevent them with new anti-fraud protections. 

<p>It's no secret that the bad guys are training their artificial intelligence (AI) engines to crack passwords, perform <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeovers</a> (ATO), and automate their ransomware demands. In fact, they are using AI to not only predict your users' current passwords... but to go one step further and predict their next password well before those users have even had a chance to think of them! Mind blown!</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">2023 ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a>, fraudsters are using generative AI to execute phishing emails, create malicious code, and deliver voice or video-based impersonation attacks, known as "deepfakes," that are becoming more frequent and more difficult for humans to detect. You can learn more about AI-generated identity fraud and how you can use AI to protect your business and your customers by attending our webinar: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/protect-customers-against-identity-fraud">Protect Your Customers Against Identity Fraud.</a></p>

 Introducing "distributed attack heuristics" 

<p>One way ForgeRock is helping organizations stay a step ahead of bad guys is through distributed attack heuristics, which is available in ForgeRock Autonomous Access.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> uses AI to monitor login requests in real time, blocking malicious attempts and adding authentication steps when it detects anomalous behavior. It uses AI, machine learning, and advanced pattern recognition to stop threats before they occur, so you don't have to deal with the unfortunate aftermath of an expensive mitigation effort.</p>

<p>What are distributed attack heuristics? If an attacker is using a rotating set of IP addresses, it can be challenging for traditional detection and prevention tools to recognize the threat, much less stop it. Using bots, the bad guys automate the attack across thousands or tens of thousands of IP addresses, and iterate each attack just a bit to make it appear different. Basic pattern matching breaks down here. If you shut down one pathway by blocking the IP address, you really haven't stopped the attack in any meaningful sense.</p>

<p>The ForgeRock approach looks at the big picture to shut down the attack while at the same time ensuring the legitimate user maintains access. We typically know the location of the legitimate user. When we recognize a distributed attack is occuring on a particular identity, say the bad guys are using multiple IP addresses to try to guess a user's password, we take steps of verifying whether or not the login is legitimate by challenging the user with a step-up multi-factor authentication (MFA). A successful MFA means the user can continue to login and be productive. Meanwhile, the distributed attack IP addresses can be flagged as suspicious and access requests from these addresses blocked. What's more,we allow organizations to set the thresholds on the number of login attempts they allow before an MFA challenge is issued so a globetrotting power user doesn't get fatigued by too many step up requests.</p>

 Avoiding unnecessary friction with double jeopardy avoidance 

<p>Another recent enhancement to Autonomous Access is something we call double jeopardy avoidance. Anomalous user detection, the ability to flag a user based on certain behavioral characteristics, has been around for a long time. When a user is flagged because of logging in from a different location, a different browser or from a non-typical time of day, the normal response is to flag the user and ask for a step-up MFA.</p>

<p>The problem is that many standard anti-fraud solutions don't have a mechanism for avoiding having the user repeatedly asked to enter their step-up MFA once they've successfully passed a challenge the first time. This leads to frustration and lost productivity. Modern solutions need to take into account the new behavioral situation of the user and allow some flexibility – for a defined period of time.</p>

<p>ForgeRock double jeopardy avoidance is a new feature that adds the capability to not flag a user for the same reason twice, and to do this for a period of time that is configurable. The user may be asked for MFA the first time logging in from a previously unknown location or from a new browser or device, but will be unencumbered during subsequent logins – for a period of time determined by the organization – resulting in a more friction-free experience.</p>

 The velvet rope of IP allow/block lists 

<p>Like any good night club, attendees may try to charm their way past the front door security. To prevent bad actors from entering or, conversely, to make sure legitimate users breeze through, ForgeRock can allow or block specific IP addresses and/or subnets regardless of how securely they have been rated or the risk assessment they have been given. The IP allow/block list feature is just one more essential tool to have in your security arsenal.</p>

 It's time for a holistic identity approach, powered by AI 

<p>The reality of our current threat environment is that it takes a complete approach to identity — one that involves authentication, authorization, and governance working together, along with layered intelligence and AI – to effectively counter today's modern threats.

<p>While <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science">data science</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> are related, they are very different fields. In a nutshell, data science brings structure to big data while machine learning focuses on learning from the data itself. This post will dive deeper into the nuances of each field.</p>



 What is data science? 



<p>Data science is a broad, multidisciplinary field that extracts value from today’s massive data sets. It uses advanced tools to look at raw data, gather a data set, process it, and develop insights to create meaning. Areas making up the data science field include mining, statistics, data analytics, data modeling, machine learning modeling and programming.</p>



<p>Ultimately, data science is used in defining new business problems that machine learning techniques and statistical analysis can then help solve. Data science solves a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/discover/business-problem-to-ai-data-science-solution/">business problem</a> by understanding the problem, knowing the data that’s required, and analyzing the data to help solve the real-world problem.</p>



 What is machine learning? 



<p>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) that focuses on learning from what the data science comes up with. It requires data science tools to first clean, prepare and analyze unstructured big data. Machine learning can then “learn” from the data to create insights that improve performance or inform predictions.</p>



<p>Just as humans can learn through experience rather than merely following instructions, machines can learn by applying tools to data analysis. Machine learning works on a known problem with tools and techniques, creating algorithms that let a machine learn from data through experience and with minimal human intervention. It processes enormous amounts of data a human wouldn’t be able to work through in a lifetime and evolves as more data is processed.</p>



 Challenges of data science 



<p>Across most companies, finding, cleaning and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-data-catalog-data-scientists-productivity">preparing the proper data for analysis</a> can take up to 80% of a data scientist’s day. While it can be tedious, it’s critical to get it right.</p>



<p>Data from various sources, collected in different forms, require data entry and compilation. That can be made easier today with virtual data warehouses that have a centralized platform where data from different sources can be stored.</p>



<p>One challenge in applying data science is to identify pertinent business issues. For example, is the problem related to declining revenue or production bottlenecks? Are you looking for a pattern you suspect is there, but that’s hard to detect? Other challenges include communicating results to non-technical stakeholders, ensuring data security, enabling efficient collaboration between data scientists and data engineers, and determining appropriate key performance indicator (KPI) metrics.</p>



 How data science evolved 



<p>With the increase in data from social media, e-commerce sites, internet searches, customer surveys and elsewhere, a new field of study based on big data emerged. Those vast datasets, which continue to increase, let organizations monitor buying patterns and behaviors and make predictions.</p>



<p>Because the datasets are unstructured, though, it can be complicated and time-consuming to interpret the data for decision-making. That’s where data science comes in.</p>



<p>The term <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-science.asp">data science</a> was first used in the 1960s when it was interchangeable with the phrase “computer science.” “Data science” was first used as an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/data-science.asp#citation-6">independent discipline</a> in 2001. Both data science and machine learning are used by data engineers and in almost every industry.</p>



<p>The fields have evolved such that to work as a data analyst who views, manages and accesses data, you need to know <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=fundamentals-sql">Structured Query Language (SQL)</a> as well as math, statistics, data visualization (to present the results to stakeholders) and data mining. It’s also necessary to understand data cleaning and processing techniques. Because data analysts often build machine learning models, programming and AI knowledge are also valuable. &nbsp;as well as math, statistics, data visualization (to present the results to stakeholders) and data mining. It’s also necessary to understand data cleaning and processing techniques. Because data analysts often build machine learning models, programming and AI knowledge are also valuable.</p>



 Data science use cases 



<p>Data science is widely used in industry and government, where it helps drive profits, innovate products and services, improve infrastructure and public systems and more.</p>



<p>Some examples of data science <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-science">use cases</a> include:</p>



 
 An international bank uses ML-powered credit risk models to deliver faster loans over a mobile app. 



 A manufacturer developed powerful, 3D-printed sensors to guide driverless vehicles. 



 A police department’s statistical incident analysis tool helps determine when and where to deploy officers for the most efficient crime prevention. 



 An AI-based medical assessment platform analyzes medical records to determine a patient’s risk of stroke and predict treatment plan success rates. 



 Healthcare companies are using data science for breast cancer prediction and other uses. 



 One ride-hailing transportation company uses big data analytics to predict supply and demand, so they can have drivers at the most popular locations in real time. The company also uses data science in forecasting, global intelligence, mapping, pricing and other business decisions. 



 An e-commerce conglomeration uses predictive analytics in its recommendation engine. 



 An online hospitality company uses data science to ensure diversity in its hiring practices, improve search capabilities and determine host preferences, among other meaningful insights. The company made its data open-source, and trains and empowers employees to take advantage of data-driven insights. 



 A major online media company uses data science to develop personalized content, enhance marketing through targeted ads and continuously update music streams, among other automation decisions. 
 



 The evolution of machine learning 



<p>The start of machine learning, and the name itself, came about in the 1950s. In 1950, data scientist Alan Turing proposed what we now call the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/turing-test.asp">Turing Test</a>, which asked the question, “Can machines think?” The test is whether a machine can engage in conversation without a human realizing it’s a machine. On a broader level, it asks if machines can demonstrate human intelligence. This led to the theory and development of AI.</p>



<p>IBM computer scientist <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/history-of-machine-learning/">Arthur Samuel</a> coined the phrase “machine learning” in 1952. He wrote a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibm700series/impacts/">checkers-playing program</a> that same year. In 1962, a checkers master played against the machine learning program on an IBM 7094 computer, and the computer won.</p>



<p>Today, machine learning has evolved to the point that engineers need to know applied mathematics, computer programming, statistical methods, probability concepts, data structure and other computer science fundamentals, and big data tools such as Hadoop and Hive. It’s unnecessary to know SQL, as programs are written in R, Java, SAS and other programming languages. Python is the most common programming language used in machine learning.</p>



<p>Machine learning and deep learning are both subsets of AI. Deep learning teaches computers to process data the way the human brain does. It can recognize complex patterns in text, images, sounds, and other data and create accurate insights and predictions. Deep learning algorithms are neural networks modeled after the human brain.</p>



 Subcategories of machine learning 



<p>Some of the most commonly used <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers-need-to-know-article">machine learning algorithms</a> include <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression">linear regression</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/logistic-regression">logistic regression,</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decision-trees">decision tree</a>, Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/naive-bayes">Naïve Bayes algorithm</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/knn">KNN algorithm</a>. These can be supervised learning, unsupervised learning or reinforced/reinforcement learning.</p>



<p>Machine learning engineers can specialize in natural language processing and computer vision, become software engineers focused on machine learning and more.</p>



 Challenges of machine learning 



<p>There are some ethical concerns regarding machine learning, such as privacy and how data is used. Unstructured data has been gathered from social media sites without the users’ knowledge or consent. Although license agreements might specify how that data can be used, many social media users don’t read that fine print.</p>



<p>Another problem is that we don’t always know how machine learning algorithms work and “make decisions.” One solution to that may be releasing machine learning programs as open-source, so that people can check source code.</p>



<p>Some machine-learning models have used datasets with biased data, which passes through to the machine-learning outcomes. Accountability in machine learning refers to how much a person can see and correct the algorithm and who is responsible if there are problems with the outcome.</p>



<p>Some people worry that AI and machine learning will eliminate jobs. While it may change the types of jobs that are available, machine learning is expected to create new and different positions. In many instances, it handles routine, repetitive work, freeing humans to move on to jobs requiring more creativity and having a higher impact.</p>



 Some machine learning use cases 



<p>Well-known companies using machine learning include social media platforms, which gather large amounts of data and then use a person’s previous behavior to forecast and predict their interests and desires. The platforms then use that information and predictive modeling to recommend relevant products, services or articles.</p>



<p>On-demand video subscription companies and their recommendation engines are another example of machine learning use, as is the rapid development of self-driving cars. Other companies using machine learning are tech companies, cloud computing platforms, athletic clothing and equipment companies, electric vehicle manufacturers, space aviation companies, and many others.</p>



 Data science, machine learning and IBM 



<p>Practicing data science comes with challenges. There can be fragmented data, a short supply of data science skills, and tools, practices, and frameworks to choose between that have rigid IT standards for training and deployment. It can also be challenging to operationalize ML models that have unclear accuracy and predictions that are difficult to audit.</p>



<p>IBM’s&nbsp;data science&nbsp;and AI lifecycle product portfolio is built upon our longstanding commitment to open-source technologies. It includes a range of capabilities that enable enterprises to unlock the value of their data in new ways.</p>



<p>IBM data science tools and solutions can help you accelerate AI-driven innovation with:</p>

<p>This in-depth analysis follows our <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/blog/global-overview-of-virtual-asset-service/">previous</a> study of geographical references in Virtual Asset Service Providers’ (VASPs) terms and conditions, expanding into the domain of global VASP registrations. The VASP industry, driven by the rise of digital assets, has grown significantly, now reaching more than 2700 entities spanning 106 countries. The geographical spread of these registrations illuminates the international scope of digital assets and the varied regulatory landscapes across the globe.</p>



<p>Comparing the top 10 countries in VASP registrations, we observe the following:</p>



RankCountryShare1Estonia11.4%2United States of America8.1%3United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland7.9%4Lithuania7.2%5Singapore6.3%6Canada3.6%7British Virgin Islands3.3%8Hong Kong3.2%9Seychelles2.9%10Australia2.7%<p>These rankings gain further intrigue when juxtaposed with the top countries mentioned in VASPs’ terms and conditions:</p>



RankCountryShare1United States of America9.94%2United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland9.89%3Estonia8.17%4Singapore6.77%5Lithuania5.27%6British Virgin Islands3.98%7Hong Kong3.65%8Seychelles3.60%9Australia2.42%10Canada2.10%<p>Although the precise rankings differ, the overlap in countries reveals their key role within the VASP industry. Estonia leads the pack in VASP registrations, perhaps driven by its advanced<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset </a>regulations, while the United States tops the list of countries mentioned in terms and conditions, signaling its considerable influence on the world stage.</p>



<p>Analyzing VASP registrations by region, certain areas emerge as leading players:</p>



RankRegionShare1Europe40.43%2Asia15.98%3North America11.75%4Offshore Centers11.76%5Oceania3.31%6Central &amp; South America2.35%7Africa1.14%<p>Notably, Europe holds the largest share of VASP registrations, a fact that could be attributed to the progressive regulatory environment, particularly the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The MiCA framework promotes transparency, fairness, and investor protection in</p>



<p>crypto-assets markets, setting a ‘gold standard’ for digital asset regulations that could be attractive for VASPs.</p>



<p>The fact that the top countries are similar in both VASP registration and terms and conditions highlights the correspondence between regulatory environments and operational preferences. Moreover, the strong presence of Offshore Centers in VASP registrations signifies the strategic advantages that these jurisdictions offer, such as more flexible regulations and tax benefits.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the geographical distribution of VASPs offers rich insights into the global landscape of digital asset regulation. Understanding these dynamics is essential for policymakers, investors, and businesses aiming to navigate the fast-evolving digital asset ecosystem. The influence of regulatory frameworks, such as MiCA in Europe, highlights the potential of well-articulated policies in fostering growth in the sector. Future trends in VASP registrations and terms of conditions references will undoubtedly continue to reflect the unfolding regulatory landscape of digital assets worldwide.</p>

<p>Web3is a vision and technology effort—coupled with economic incentives—to rebalance economic power in the web across service providers, application developers and consumers. This effort envisages a decentralized, more balanced world. Trust and power are distributed across service providers and application or content creators, consumer privacy is honored (as responsibility of data management moves to the edge) and creators are compensated for their creations.</p>



<p>In today’s web architecture (Web2), platform owners make unilateral decisions on the future of applications they support, with no transparency in the decision-making process. The same corporations also manage user data as service providers (such as social media platforms) and maximize their revenue by leveraging user data analysis to optimize their services (for example, the advertisement business on social media). Such architectures are often tuned to protect and extend the business of a few platform owners at the cost of many application developers and consumers. This stifles innovation, and single control points raise risks to application security and user privacy. Privacy concerns are expected to grow as the metaverse (augmented and virtual reality realms) evolves, with higher amounts of data to be exchanged and collected.</p>



 Centralized identity vs. self-sovereign identity 



<p>As the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/web-20-web-30-5208698">Investopedia team</a> and <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/">TBD’s Angie Jones</a> have noted, Web3 concepts revolve around decentralized and transparent governance, transaction processing, and self-sovereignty of user identities, data and assets. Web3 decentralization removes single points of failure, trust or control, leading to systems with higher degrees of resilience to compromise (compared to legacy applications). Self-sovereignty of data refers to the user storing and managing access to their own credentials and application data.</p>



<p>Traditional centralized or federated digital identity models require users to register to service providers or identity providers, who maintain user data and can attest properties or attributes for the user to third parties upon user request. The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) model allows the user to acquire credentials (identities) from one or more identity issuers, and subsequently manage the storage and access of their credentials. Users (also called credential subjects or holders) can demonstrate ownership of these credentials to third-party verifiers. These verifiers can securely check the authenticity of these credentials regarding the claimed credential issuer and the subject.</p>



 How blockchain technology enables Web3 



<p>Web3 is powered by public blockchain technology, which offers decentralized transaction processing and associated economic incentives.</p>



<p>Blockchain systems offer decentralized transaction processing and governance, where decentralization refers to the distribution of trust across multiple potentially distrusting parties regarding each transaction’s validity. System-processed transactions are appended to a system-wide ledger that constitutes the source of truth for the system.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain">Enable trusted data exchange with distributed ledger technology and blockchain</a>



<p>Blockchain systems guarantee that if most of the system participants are not compromised, the system will record and process transactions correctly, update the system’s state and transaction log (ledger) accordingly, and respond to queries as per the ledger’s content. The ledger maintains a critical log of all the transactions that take place in the system. The exact type of participant majority required depends on the underlying blockchain system’s consensus. For example, Ethereum employs a proof-of-stake consensus where the parties who own the majority of the system’s stake (Ethereum cryptocurrency) vote on the verdict of the transaction. In Bitcoin, the majority is defined in terms of computing power.</p>



<p>Blockchain protocols provide transparency, as the system ledger can be shared across system participants. They also provide high degrees of resilience, as the content of the ledger is not vulnerable to single points of control, failure or compromise. The Ethereum and Bitcoin ledgers are available to every participant in the system. They are also verifiable, in the sense that everyone possessing the ledger can check its integrity. In fact, even if nodes in the system are corrupted or compromised, the ledger content is guaranteed not to change, as long as the majority of the system’s stake or computation honors the rules of the blockchain protocol.</p>



<p>Finally, many blockchain systems provide automation, as transaction validation logic is easily configurable via smart contracts.</p>



 The future of the tokenized economy 



<p>Web3 has introduced a tokenized economy, where tokens are abstractions used to represent various types of business assets in a digital system (blockchain), facilitating transparent and cost-effective operations on these assets. These business assets can be physical (a piece of land), digital (a piece of music) or even a right (an access right or a vote). In tokenized economies, tokens also represent application- or system-specific stakes (for example, the overall amount of an application-specific or system-specific currency in circulation). Tokens also transparently distribute power and profit across the application developers, owners and consumers, incentivizing further participation.</p>



<p>Decentralization provides the right foundation for multiple ecosystems or industries to come together and trust or co-govern the same system. This allows the tokens of one system to represent a variety of assets. These include two classes of tokens. Fungible tokens are divisible and equivalent assets. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique physical or digital assets on systems that monitor the respective assets’ ownership or operational lifecycle. Both types of tokens can be traded, exchanged or used as collateral transparently and securely. <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/03/02/crypto-market-cap-2-trillion/">Fortune</a> estimates that the total value of Web3 application stake or tokenized assets is in the trillions of US dollars.</p>



<p>The rapidly evolving world of Web3 holds opportunities for the enterprise that can navigate its risks. To ensure your Web3 success, work with a trusted technology provider.</p>

 Does the release of the UK government’s fraud strategy signal the start of a new era of fraud prevention? 



 



<p>Fraud appears to be high on the UK’s political agenda at the moment, and with good reason. Consistently ranked as the fraud capital of Europe, the UK loses almost <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10955193/Britain-3bn-fraud-capital-world-Probe-reveals-40m-targeted-scammers-2022.html">£3 billion a year to fraud</a>. In fact, Britons are almost 9x as likely to be victims of scams than their German counterparts, with <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/beatthescammers/article-11074643/UK-crowned-card-fraud-capital-Europe.html">134 cases of card fraud per 1,000 people in the UK</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in May 2023, when the UK government published its new <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154660/Fraud_Strategy_2023.pdf">fraud strategy, which it claims will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025</a>, there was a collective sense of relief from the government, private sector and most resoundingly from law enforcement. Despite fraud amounting to 40% of all crime in the UK, the UK’s law enforcement services dedicate less than 1% of their resources to investigate and tackle the fraud epidemic in the UK. The new fraud strategy aims to rectify that and has earmarked £100 million of additional funds to bolster law enforcement efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Foreword to ‘Fraud Strategy: Stopping Scams and Protecting the Public,’ Home Secretary, Suella Braverman spoke of the need for coordinated collaboration between the police, the public and private sectors, as well as “allies abroad.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Industry can do more to protect its customers, our citizens, and businesses. The financial sector has worked with us for a long time on fraud. Whilst I welcome their continued efforts, I challenge them to go further. But it is other industries, especially online technology giants, who should do more to stop criminals exploiting their services and should never profit from online crime.</p>Home Secretary, Suella Braverman.</blockquote>



 What are the most common types of fraud in the UK? 



<p>The definition of fraud is the attempt to gain or cause a loss of money or other owned goods through an act of dishonesty, deception, or breach of trust. Fraud is quite a broad and umbrella term for crimes that vary widely in nature. The most common type of fraud in the UK is <a href="https://www.fool.co.uk/2021/07/25/the-most-common-types-of-fraud-in-the-uk-revealed/">card fraud, affecting almost one in five Brits</a>. The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10955193/Britain-3bn-fraud-capital-world-Probe-reveals-40m-targeted-scammers-2022.html">average UK card fraud incident costs £8,833.20</a>, nearly £3,000 more than its closest rival, France.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraud has been a serious threat in the UK for many years. This is partly as a response to the English language not only being the lingua franca for business, but also for crime. Other explanations for the comparatively high rate of fraud are the kingdom’s comparative wealth, and fast and frictionless payment systems,” said Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</p>



 What is the difference between authorized fraud and unauthorized fraud? 



<p>Fraud falls into two distinct categories: authorized fraud (tricking the victim into willingly transferring funds) like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance fraud</a>, and unauthorized fraud (stealing details from the victim to make unauthorized transactions), like account takeover fraud, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-fraud/">identity fraud.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partly due to banks stepping up controls, and implementing better and more secure KYC processes, there was an 8% reduction in the total amount stolen in 2022 (<a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/over-ps12-billion-stolen-through-fraud-in-2022-nearly-80-cent-app">£1.2 billion</a>) compared to 2021 (£1.3 billion). This was due to a significant decrease in unauthorized fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, unauthorized fraud losses across payment cards, remote banking and cheques still totalled a whopping <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/over-ps12-billion-stolen-through-fraud-in-2022-nearly-80-cent-app">£726.9 million in 2022</a>. Remote purchase fraud was the biggest category of losses at £395.7 million. Fraud on lost and stolen cards increased by 30% (to £100.2 million), and identity theft almost doubled to £51.7 million.</p>



 What is the UK’s new fraud strategy? 



<p>The UK’s fraud strategy is supported by three key pillars:</p>



 Pursue fraudsters&nbsp; 



  Establish a National Fraud Squad with 400 new specialist investigators&nbsp;  Deploy new UK Intelligence Community&nbsp;  Replace Action Fraud with a state-of-the-art reporting system&nbsp;  Imprison more fraudsters&nbsp;  Lead a global partnership to pursue fraudsters worldwide<br>&nbsp;  



 Block fraudsters&nbsp; 



  Ban cold calls on all financial products&nbsp;  Ban SIM farms&nbsp;  Review use of mass text aggregators&nbsp;  Stop more spoof calls&nbsp;<br><br>The UK government is also calling on the tech community to do their part in blocking fraud at an industrial scale. Some of the steps include:&nbsp;  



  Make the tech sector commit to protect their customers through legislation and voluntary commitments&nbsp;  Make it easier to report fraud on social media and the internet&nbsp;  Create new powers to take down fraudulent websites&nbsp;  Publish information about fraud levels on different platforms&nbsp;  



 Empower the public&nbsp; 



  Support more victims&nbsp;  Reimburse more victims&nbsp;  Better communications about how to protect yourself from fraud, how to report fraud, and what to do if you become a victim of fraud&nbsp;  



<p>The 66-page document also goes into detail as to the financial and emotional harm that fraud causes to businesses and victims.</p>



 Who is responsible for enacting the UK’s fraud strategy?&nbsp; 



<p>Collaboration between the below agencies and departments will be integral for enacting the UK’s fraud strategy.</p>


 
 
 
 National Fraud Squad 
 

<p>Perhaps the most important: the UK’s brand new National Fraud Squad is made up of 400 specialist investigators and replaces the Action Fraud division.</p>

 Response to the UK fraud strategy. 



<p>Following hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">creation of the Crypto Cell</a>, which was designed to tackle crypto crime, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has again announced the creation of a brand new, shiny specialised division to tackle the specific problem of fraud in the UK. Will this, alongside the other measures, make a marked difference to one of the world’s most lucrative fraud markets?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IIDnow believes the UK’s fraud strategy is a step in the right direction, but reiterates the need for collaboration between invested parties, and for companies to accept the responsibility they bear as part of concerted efforts to reduce and eliminate fraud in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud manifests at every step of the online customer journey – there is no one single silver bullet or catch-all. As fraudsters continue to innovate and collaborate, so must we across industry and government – the UK’s fraud strategy is the first step in the right direction.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Organizations need to go beyond what is required of them, from a regulatory and legal perspective, and ensure their product offering is safe and secure. In the past, organizations would often be faced with a tough reality: A fully protected and compliant platform would require extra checks and balances, thereby impacting the overall customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, technology offers companies the ability to provide slick, streamlined and fully compliant customer journeys.</p>



 Technology: A gift and a curse. 



<p>The proliferation of online services, such as banking and shopping, has made UK citizens and businesses a prime target for fraudsters. According to the fraud strategy paper, the “adoption of new technologies by consumers, businesses and fraudsters is almost certainly the main driver of recent increases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As explored in our recent blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/work-chatgpt/">‘Learning to live (and work) with ChatGPT and other AI forms,’</a> technology and the online world offers incredible opportunities to supercharge and optimize services and operations, but these same tools are also available to criminals who are exploiting them for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/press-release/over-ps12-billion-stolen-through-fraud-in-2022-nearly-80-cent-app">Most fraud nowadays at least starts online.</a> As huge amounts of data are now stored online, any data breach provides fraudsters with all the information they need to steal personal information and commit all manner of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">Spoofing</a> via bulk text messaging services, enables fraudsters to target thousands of people at once, from seemingly genuine, local numbers. Technological advances like deep fakes have also ushered in a new playground for fraudsters to operate.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/fraudsters-tactics-are-becoming-more-complex-here-is-what-to-look-out-for-12910842">Fraudster tactics are becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated.</a> In fact, according to the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service, which is often asked to assist in cases where an agreement between a consumer and financial firm cannot be reached, complaints are up, and are becoming increasingly complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the UK’s Financial Ombudsman Service received 21,918 fraud and scam complaints in 2022-23 compared to 18,450 complaints in 2021-2022. Some of the most common scams include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams,</a> and scams involving investments and cryptocurrency.</p>



 Fraudsters have become smart. It’s time to get smarter. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring businesses can protect themselves and their customers from fraud. At IDnow, we help put the power of identity back into the hands of businesses; helping to reduce friction for trusted users, preventing fraud, and&nbsp;detecting high-risk or anomalous behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable identity verification services work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, and our industry-leading fraud prevention technology ensures your business remains safe from increasingly complex attacks. With our latest round of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, our identity-proofing methods, including document verification, biometric selfie and video liveness have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>In the last few years, several prominent security-related incidents have originated from inefficient governance of identities such as the Equifax data breach in 2017 where data of 147 million identities was compromised or the Microsoft Exchange Server data breach in 2021 which affected 30,000 organizations from 150 countries. Data theft, loss of personally identifiable information (PII), and industrial espionage through unauthorized access are severe security risks in every industry. Organizations struggle with centralized visibility for identifying who has access to what, who has accessed what and why, and who granted that access.</p>
<p>Access governance concerns the access mechanisms and their relationships across IT systems. As an IAM-focused risk management discipline, access governance focuses on providing centralized visibility for access. It is instrumental in monitoring and mitigating access-related risks. Current access governance solutions provide continuous monitoring of the ecosystem of applications and systems within an organization. Removing risks, enforcing compliance, and automating processes provide security against access breaches and data leaks.</p>
 Oracle Access Governance 
<p>Oracle Access Governance satisfies the above-mentioned requirements expected from an access governance solution. It is a comprehensive tool for fostering the security posture and helping protect organizations against breaches, as well as supporting them in managing access of identities to IT systems within an enterprise. Oracle Access Governance is a cloud-native solution that also supports meeting compliance requirements by automating the processes with machine learning driven recommendations. This provides greater visibility into the access structure of the entire organization’s IT environment.</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance runs as an OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) cloud-native service. It can detect and remediate high risk privileges by enforcing internal access audit policies to identify orphaned accounts, unauthorized access, and privileges. All of this helps to enhance compliance to regulatory requirements (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley, 21 CFR Part 11, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, HIPAA, and GDPR).</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance can run alongside Oracle Identity Governance in a hybrid deployment model to provide identity analytics from the cloud to Oracle Identity Governance customers. Following are the major features of Oracle Access Governance:</p>
 
 Automated access reviews: The solution simplifies access reviews through automation and provides insights for making decisions for high-risk access requests. 
 Machine Learning Based Workflows: Oracle Access Governance uses prebuilt ML-based workflows to further simplify the access review campaigns. The inbuilt model suggests workflows by reviewing use cases and recommending the designated next steps. 
 Insight-driven Dashboard: The insight-driven dashboard provides information related to tracking access review trails, real-time analytics, and powerful filters to focus on high access review priority tasks. The dashboard further provides a risk assessment of each activity using peer group analysis. 
 Cloud Identity Governance: it provides simplified identity orchestration that can collect data&nbsp;about OCI users, groups, and policies across multiple tenancies and compartments, and recognize unseen patterns for security threat and violation with real-time risk and threat monitoring. It also identifies over-provisioned accounts. 
 Access Control: Oracle Access Governance provides access control mechanisms like Request/approval-based, Role-based, Attribute-based, Policy-based and a combination of these access controls mechanisms. 
 Fulfilment/Identity Orchestration: The solution simplifies system integration by providing downloadable agents for systems behind firewalls, handing integration for systems in public domains, providing prioritization of authoritative target systems and supports correlation and all of it without the need for coding. 
 Flexible Licensing Model: It allows customers to mark users as active or inactive and as workforce vs. customer. Only the active users are considered for billing. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Organizations of all sizes and in all industries need access governance to protect digital assets, their data and comply with regulations. Good access governance products address these issues. Oracle’s Access Governance provides the modern tooling required to govern access to the identities within an enterprise and proactively address risks. The centralized visibility required to achieve trustworthy access governance is possible through its various features, such as the use of automation and machine learning, event-based micro-certifications, and a transparent and effective dashboard. With multiple access control mechanisms, Oracle Access Governance enables provisioning and entitlement management to ensure compliance while providing better flexibility. Oracle Access Governance improves orchestration and provides a flexible licensing model. It is a solution that is attractive to customers in various industries.</p>

<p>Many organizations have embraced the hybrid cloud for its flexibility, scalability and capacity to accelerate market deployment. Hybrid cloud enables businesses worldwide to promote data security and accessibility for various projects and analysis. However, managing multiple hybrid clouds can be a complex endeavor, especially considering the evolving nature of enterprise requirements and the sheer number of applications in enterprise portfolios today. IDC reports that <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US50037816">39% of organizations have 500 or more applications in their portfolios</a>.</p>



<p>A mix of institutional knowledge, legacy applications, data and analytics form the backbone of many organizations’ IT operations, however when a single component falls out of harmony, the entire system can fail. Research shows that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/05/11/difficulties-with-deployment-focus-on-changes/?sh=261aefa973ed">60%-90% of outage incidents are caused by changes in an organization’s IT environment</a>.</p>



<p>Economic pressures are driving enterprises to minimize costs as they transition from traditional to more innovative operations. The abundance of data within IT Operations (including tickets, events, logs and metrics) serves as a crucial resource for any organization aiming to cut operational costs. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), they can extract valuable insights to achieve this goal.</p>



<p>However, to achieve this transformation successfully, it is crucial to incorporate a hybrid cloud management platform that prioritizes AI-infused automation. An integrated hybrid cloud equips organizations with the operational agility necessary to capitalize on emerging technologies and new global markets—and to ensure accelerated time to market for goods and services.</p>



 Start with a platform-centric approach 



<p>Standardization is crucial for organizations looking to automate and modernize. In a hybrid cloud environment, standardization helps eliminate inconsistencies, errors and discrepancies that may emerge from a complex mix of people, technology and processes working together.</p>



<p>Proper standardization can be challenging to achieve. Your organization must adopt a platform-centric approach to establish a foundation that promotes standardized practices, shared resources, open communication and streamlined processes.</p>



<p>By adopting a cloud platform as a central foundation, organizations can establish standardized practices for infrastructure provisioning, deployment, scaling, monitoring and security, while aligning with business goals. This ensures that technology implementation remains focused, and it underscores the importance of a top-down approach to an organization’s AI strategy. Through alignment with business priorities, engineers can effectively determine the necessity of AI (or assess whether a more straightforward, rules-based solution would suffice).</p>



 From complexity to simplicity 



<p>Developing a comprehensive, top-down strategy that aligns development goals with business goals enables organizations to quickly identify suitable sources and implement a well-structured and governed AI implementation.</p>



<p>An autonomous IT management system simplifies technological operations, key business processes and design systems. It quickly pulls from disparate data sources with integrated data, enabling faster and more informed decision making.</p>



<p>Generative AI technology is a leap ahead and can simplify application development by enabling engineers to automate code and document generation. By drawing from various foundation models, generative AI uses powerful transformers to generate content from unstructured information. Generative AI technology can be used to accelerate application development, reduce manual effort, and create accurate and compliant documents quickly.</p>



<p>With generative AI, organizations can automate tasks and enhance customer service and sales functions, improving the efficiency of these processes. Existing sales and service engineers can use language-based generative AI to augment their skills and easily find contextual or industrial knowledge to help them deliver better customer experiences or solve problems faster.</p>



<p>Generative AI offers a host of business benefits, including improved issue classification, code generation for issue resolution, enhanced auto-healing systems, context-sensitive automation, faster code debugging, best practice suggestions, better documentation generation, reverse engineering capabilities, and code refactoring—to name just a few possibilities.</p>



<p>Enhancing observability through autonomous IT operations enables system engineers to move beyond conventional IT health metrics. Instead, they can focus on more insightful “golden signals,” which include system latency, network traffic metrics, network saturation and errors.</p>



 Ensuring scalability and security 



<p>When discussing automating IT Operations, it’s critical to note the importance of managing your organization’s security operations (SecOps) with AI technology.&nbsp;By integrating AI into SecOps, organizations can efficiently identify, predict, and address security and compliance anomalies, as well as detect and mitigate potential threats. The goal is to leverage AI-driven automation to enhance an organization’s overall security and compliance posture.</p>



<p>Security and compliance are broad domains that vary across industries. Generative AI is useful for identifying anomalies within data and associating them with various sources of information (such as raw code, platform health and past business failures).</p>



<p>For instance, organizations can use AI tools to audit compliance documentation according to relevant audit standards. These AI tools then flag inappropriate words or phrases for human agents to assess.</p>



 Achieving modernization with AI 



<p>A robust, AI-driven, automation-first platform for managing hybrid cloud workloads will help modernize and accelerate the hybrid cloud transformation and journey for clients. Organizations can now leverage tactics like code generation to automate IT processes and modernize legacy applications for increased organizational agility.</p>



<p>Besides their conventional programming skills, engineers can now add “prompt engineer” to their skill set. Utilizing code generators, they can draft prompts that guide generative AI to create code that the engineers can review, modify and deploy. This significantly accelerates the development of applications and services.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-code-assistant?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076335928533&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0ZKZzfn-_gIV8u_jBx1h3godEAAYASAAEgLotPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Watson Code Assistant</a> leverages the power of AI to make it easier for developers and IT operators to write code with AI-generated recommendations based on natural language inputs.</p>



 Enabling the ideal IT state with AI 



<p>The rise of hybrid cloud architecture has made AI implementation more accessible. By combining private and public cloud environments, organizations can leverage the infrastructure offered by hyperscalers like AWS, Azure and GCP. Training AI models closer to the data itself improves efficiency and reduces costs (compared to dedicated GPU infrastructure).</p>



<p>AI platforms, like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a>, and open-source technologies, like <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/ibm">OpenShift</a>, further enhance AI implementation. They provide the necessary components, flexibility and scalability to support multiple AI models and applications.</p>



<p>As AI continues to advance and becomes more accessible, organizations can harness its potential for fostering innovation, efficiency and decision making. While there is no “single” solution for implementation, IBM Consulting can help address the complexity of innovative transformation by leveraging our technology, expertise and point of view to ensure your organization establishes a robust hybrid cloud strategy.&nbsp;IBM’s unique approach, which incorporates design thinking workshops, can be a valuable tool for navigating the complexities of AI implementation.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be a surprise that Belgium ranks among the vanguards of digital identity. The digital world as we know it may never have existed without this tiny northwestern European country of just 11.6 million people.</p>
<p>After all, the Belgian computer scientist Robert Cailliau proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">first hypertext system</a> for CERN in 1987. Collaborating with Tim Berners-Lee, he went on to help develop <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web#:~:text=Tim%20Berners%2DLee%20wrote%20the,management%20proposal%20in%20November%201990.">the management proposal</a> behind what would eventually become the World Wide Web (WWW).</p>
<p>He was instrumental in forming the European Commission’s first web-based project for information dissemination in Europe (WISE). And his work with CERN’s Legal Service led to the release of web technology into the public domain 30 years ago this year—on April 30, 1993. “When we have all data online, it will be great for humanity,” Cailliau remarked. “It is a prerequisite to solving many problems humankind faces.”</p>
<p>But while the digital world he helped create has transformed how we live, work, learn, shop, and play for the better, it hasn’t been free of some costly and dangerous challenges. At the heart of them all: identity.</p>
 Digital Identity: A Pressing Need Worldwide 
<p>Citizen or resident identity and property rights have long been cornerstones of free market economies. Particularly as digital economies flourish, this makes it critical to enable individuals to prove their identity online for purchases, access to healthcare and to government services, access to entitlements, and more. But verifying identity in digital channels through authentication based on the usernames and passwords that emerged to protect web-accessible user accounts has never been even remotely adequate.</p>
<p>Thanks to endless phishing attacks and corporate data breaches, <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/buyers-beware-cybercriminals-target-your-online-credentials/">over 24 billion</a> recently-compromised login credentials and personal identity files are available on the dark web. Cyber-thieves and threat actors use stolen or synthetic identity information to defraud businesses and governments. And they leverage pilfered logins to swipe money or steal information they can monetize downstream—the price tag: More than <a href="https://financesonline.com/cybercrime-statistics/">$7.8 trillion</a> in global losses expected just this year.</p>
<p>Today, the ability to facilitate fast, convenient, and secure interactions and transactions online is crucial to the digital economy. But that requires a universally-accepted form of digital identity that protects privacy and prevents personal information from being stolen and exploited by others. While the US is beginning to make strides, other countries are leading the way. A compelling case in point is Cailliau’s native Belgium.</p>
 Belgium: A Bellwether for Digital Everything 
<p>From the saxophone to the <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/europe/belgium/articles/11-essential-things-that-belgium-gave-the-world/">Big Bang Theory</a> and beyond, Belgium has always been a center of innovation—and a central hub for Europe’s digital economy. More than 90% of its tech-savvy populace is online. Its kids help design city playgrounds<a href="https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/belgian-town-redesigns-playground-with-roblox-11611"> using Roblox</a>. The country accounts for 35.5% of all <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/belgium-ecommerce">cross-border e-commerce</a>. More than half of all companies operate <a href="https://www.stackscale.com/blog/cloud-adoption-eu-enterprises/">in the cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Belgium’s capital city is a global financial center and home to the EU Parliament, the European Commission, and NATO. It’s also home to a vibrant startup scene—and a government-driven “<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2017/tech-center-eu-capital-city-grows-its-tech-reputation/">Digital Belgium</a>” initiative focused on developing and nurturing digital skills and business, inclusion, infrastructure, and security. It is also a global leader in <a href="https://thepaypers.com/digital-identity-security-online-fraud/the-philippines-to-work-with-china-belgium-on-digital-id--1259823">digital identity</a>.</p>
<p>In 2018, Belgium rolled out the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/customer-cases/belgium">itsme mobile ID scheme</a>, which allows citizens to securely access a range of government and private sector services such as banking, travel, and healthcare through a mobile app. It’s an extension of the card-based national eID cards required of all Belgians 12 and up.</p>
<p>Once tied to their eID, consumers can use single sign-on to log into accounts, share information, conduct transactions, and sign documents. Two-factor authentication, such as a fingerprint biometric or pin code on the user’s device, provides an added layer of security, reducing the risk of identity theft and fraud.</p>
 Convenience Meets Security–But Not Without Complexities 
<p>Typically issued or regulated by a national ID scheme, digital identity is generally comprised of validated digital attributes and credentials designed for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced with government-issued physical world credentials. Think birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, etc.</p>
<p>One of the critical benefits of Belgium’s eID and itsme app is convenience. Citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. And in addition to two-factor authentication, it’s certified for the European Union’s “Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services” (EIDAS) standards. It meets the requirements for <a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-privacy/">GDPR privacy law</a> and <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/regulatory/">PSD2 open banking</a> regulations. And more than 80% of the population has used it, making <a href="https://techmonitor.ai/focus/the-state-of-digital-identity-in-europe">25 to 35 million transactions per month</a>.</p>
<p>But it has yet to be free of issues. EID technology is complex and has significant <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/07/05/eidas-20-turns-to-self-sovereign-identification-to-bring-users-ownership-and-control/?sh=2b2274f77f07">barriers to entry</a> for private industries, holding back its full promise. And detractors have expressed concerns over privacy and government overreach. But the European Union’s updated “Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services” (EIDAS 2.0) could soon help change that.</p>
 A Step Toward Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>Thanks to EIDAS 2.0, itsme and systems may soon give citizens far more control over how their information is used, while making digital identity far easier to apply across all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>EIDAS 2.0 goes into effect <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/24/2023-the-year-digital-identities-go-mainstream/">this September</a>, and requires that all member states offer a digital identity wallet (DIW) that acts like a “digital twin” of hard-copy identity documents. In addition to standards for easier adoption across industry sectors, EIDAS 2.0 introduces other key benefits.</p>
<p>Instead of a “federated” model for digital identity, for instance, EIDAS 2.0 can potentially set the foundation for a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> framework. With SSI, authenticating users no longer requires personal data to be stored centrally on servers belonging to large public or private organizations, where it can be hacked and either ransomed or exploited to commit fraud. Instead, users can control what personal information they share and how that information is used.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>The promise of digital identity is predicated on distributed ledger technologies and the architectural advantages they enable. For one thing, they provide for storing immutable records of identity. This enables financial services firms to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) mandates. It also allows them to accurately log access and activities in alignment with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. Just as importantly, they are key enablers of SSI-based authentication through digital wallets. For instance, when users opt to share data, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/04/04/why-zero-trust-is-all-about-identity/?sh=350d5c6e54ee">zero-trust systems</a> can apply risk, quality, or credit scores without contributing private user information or metadata to the process.</p>
<p>This means that someone applying for a loan can do so without revealing personal information or having a decision tied to outdated or inaccurate information stored on far-flung corporate servers. Or someone entering a bar can prove they’re at least 21 years old without revealing their name, birthdate, address, or other details. Users can also set <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=6740c174584a">time limits</a> so that shared information is deleted after a predetermined period.</p>
<p>Belgium seems set on forging the way. In 2024, the country will hold the EU presidency, and it recently announced plans to lead the creation of “<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/belgium-digital-minister-eu-crypto-blockchain-092425913.html">Europeum</a>,” an official blockchain for Europe designed to further pioneer digital identity.<br>
But to be effective, digital ID wallets must also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and<a href="https://www.ibeta.com/"> iBeta biometrics</a>-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-multi-factor-authentication/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Digi-mfa-sl-Ext&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8JKbBhBYEiwAs3sxNyMKKDUvP5kit_UP4XbwzmqYa5SZLqdolxffbwblB9hNwZ2hzC6VihoCYMMQAvD_BwE">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating virtually any attempt at identity spoofing.</p>
<p>If Cailliau’s vision of the web as a prerequisite for solving many of humanity’s problems is ever to be fully realized, digital identity will need to be solved, most likely with an architecture similar to that baked into 1Kosmos BlockID and discussed in this free research paper on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/analyst-report/reusable-verified-identity/">Reusable Verified Identity</a> from KuppingerCole.

 While the ethos of cryptocurrency may be partly rooted in anonymity, mass adoption and the subsequent increase in fraudulent activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing, has forced legislators to step in and fill the regulatory void.  



 



<p>Binance and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase</a>, both leaders in crypto trading worldwide, are just two major players that have decided to enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> regulations, along with regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>. When registering on one of those platforms, users need to provide a government-issued ID, take a photo identification selfie, as well as provide additional personal data.</p>



 People bypass KYC requirements for multiple reasons:&nbsp; 



<p>• Some users believe identity verification goes against the ethos of cryptocurrency;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Others may want to avoid sanctions, embargoes, or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">PEP</a> screening lists;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Illicit organizations looking to access <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">crypto exchanges to launder money</a>;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Other users may want to evade tax;&nbsp;</p>



<p>• Underage users looking to trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For these reasons and more, some users may resort to dubious methods to avoid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, bypassing KYC and identity verification is likely to have not only serious consequences for crypto users, but also cause regulatory difficulties for crypto operators.</p>



 



 

 



 Upcoming regulatory regimes. 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a>) regulation, which received a majority 517 votes from European Parliament lawmakers in favor of the crypto licensing regime in April 2023, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Countries, such as the UK are devising their own national regulatory framework for the crypto market. Read more on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed crypto regulations in our blog</a>.</p>



 Regulations that apply to crypto companies in Europe. 


 
 
 
 Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>, issued in January 2020, requires crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations. CASPs must conduct customer due diligence (CDD), implement risk-based AML programs, and report suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities.</p>

 
 
 
 Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA) 
 

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a> is a regulation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets in the EU. It introduces requirements for issuers of crypto assets, crypto asset service providers, and digital asset custody providers. It aims to establish a consistent and harmonized approach to regulation across EU member states.</p>

 
 
 
 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
 

<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu">GDPR</a>, in effect since May 2018, applies to crypto companies that handle personal data of individuals within the EU. It imposes obligations on data controllers and processors, including obtaining consent, implementing data protection measures, and ensuring the rights of data subjects are respected.</p>

 
 
 
 Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) 
 

<p><a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">PSD2</a>, implemented in January 2018, regulates payment services within the EU. It affects crypto companies that provide payment services or interact with traditional payment systems. PSD2 establishes requirements for strong customer authentication (SCA) and imposes obligations on payment service providers.</p>

 
 
 
 Capital Markets and Securities Directive (MiFID II) 
 

<p><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/publications-and-data/interactive-single-rulebook/mifid-ii">MiFID II</a>, in effect since January 2018, applies to crypto companies that provide investment services, such as crypto exchanges or platforms offering crypto derivatives. It introduces requirements for authorization, investor protection, transparency, and reporting.</p>

 
 
 
 Various Tax Regulations 
 

<p>Crypto companies operating in Europe must comply with tax regulations applicable to cryptocurrencies. Tax treatment can vary across countries, but typically involves reporting crypto transactions, capital gains taxation, and potential value-added tax (VAT) obligations.</p>

 
 
 
 Electronic Money Directive (EMD) and Payment Services Directive (PSD) 
 

<p>The EMD and PSD provide a regulatory framework for electronic money institutions (EMIs) and payment service providers (PSPs). Crypto companies offering services such as crypto wallets, prepaid cards, or remittance services may fall under these directives and must comply with their provisions.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>It is important to note that regulations and their application can vary across EU member states. Companies should closely monitor updates from regulatory authorities, seek legal advice, and ensure compliance with the relevant regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate.&nbsp;</p>



 Common crypto compliance mistakes.  



<p>There are several compliance mistakes that many new crypto companies make when they first launch. These mistakes can lead to legal and financial difficulties, damage to reputation, and hinder long-term growth. Some of the most common mistakes that new crypto firms make with their compliance programs include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Lack of regulatory compliance. 



<p>Ignoring or underestimating the importance of regulatory compliance is a common mistake. Crypto companies need to understand and adhere to the legal and regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> regulations, securities laws, tax obligations, and other relevant regulations can result in hefty fines, legal actions, or even shutdowns.&nbsp;Read more about how the dangers of money laundering in the crypto sector in our latest blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">‘How criminals leverage non-compliant crypto exchanges for money laundering.’ </a></p>



 Inadequate security measures. 



<p>Crypto companies must prioritize security due to the highly sensitive nature of the data they exchange. Failing to implement robust security measures, such as strong encryption, secure key storage, and comprehensive cybersecurity protocols, can leave them vulnerable to hacking, theft, and fraud. Breaches can result in significant financial losses, legal liabilities, and erosion of user trust.&nbsp;</p>



 Poor risk management. 



<p>Effective risk management is crucial in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Companies need to identify and assess risks related to market fluctuations, operational vulnerabilities, technological risks, and regulatory changes. Failing to implement risk management strategies, such as diversifying investments, establishing contingency plans, and conducting regular risk assessments, can leave companies exposed to unexpected losses and instability.&nbsp;</p>



 Poor governance and internal controls. 



<p>Establishing strong corporate governance practices and internal controls is essential for the long-term success of crypto companies. Inadequate governance structures, such as a lack of independent board members or conflicts of interest, can create reputational risks and regulatory scrutiny. Weak internal controls, including inadequate financial reporting or weak auditing practices, can lead to financial mismanagement, fraud, or non-compliance with regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid these mistakes, crypto companies should invest in robust compliance programs and a dedicated compliance officer, prioritize security measures, and implement effective risk management practices.&nbsp;A KYC program is integral in offering a safe and secure crypto platform. </p>



 Regulatory risks of missing KYC. 



<p>While KYC processes prevent most users from signing in without proper screening, these restrictions have created a business opportunity on the black market. Indeed, for a small amount of money, marketplaces on different dark webs now offer vetted accounts on crypto exchanges and other payments services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For prices ranging from $150-$500, you can now buy an approved account on peer-to-peer trading platforms, professional crypto exchanges, or mainstream payment services. These accounts are either created with a fake name, address, and identification documents, or with genuine data obtained by illicit means.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/19/for-200-you-can-trade-crypto-with-a-fake-id/">an investigation from specialized news outlet, CoinDesk</a>, fake accounts on the exchanges Binance US, Coinbase Pro, and payment services Cash App and Wirexwere were reviewed by a reporter. Analysis revealed that most accounts belonged to genuine United States and European citizens, and came with instructions on how to use VPN networks. Most importantly, it was also found that credentials for email addresses were linked to Google Voice numbers, which is sometimes used as a tool by fraudsters to create fake accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some users went to extraordinary lengths to adopt specific behavioral patterns, for example matching the geolocation of victims, or keeping to transaction limits. It is therefore likely that some users were able to access crypto wallets by using other individual’s accounts, thus evading KYC checks. Fake crypto exchange accounts are just a small subset of the global black ID market; an industry boasting more than 15 billion different types of credentials, as reported by <a href="https://resources.digitalshadows.com/whitepapers-and-reports/from-exposure-to-takeover">cyber consultancy firm Digital Shadows</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraudsters leveraging data for illicit purposes represent a major risk for cryptocurrency platforms and service providers. Regulators including the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have already <a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/sanctions/bitgo-fined-99k-for-digital-currency-sanctions-violations/29889.article">fined cryptocurrency exchanges like BitGo</a> for violations of U.S. sanctions programs, alleging the platform had allowed – even unknowingly – individuals from Syria, Iran, Sudan, and Cuba to access and use its trading services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 KYC as a support for crypto market development. 



<p>Despite the popularity of the black market trade in verified accounts, it is still possible to mitigate those risks by leveraging <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-institution-kyc-process-running/">robust KYC processes</a>. However, to increase the likelihood of customer adoption, onboarding processes must remain as simple, safe and secure as any other financial service. The robustness of KYC processes must be analyzed and put to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although crypto enthusiasts might see KYC processes as a diminishing factor for adoption, Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-16/binance-ceo-cz-zhao-advocates-for-fundamental-crypto-rights">Bloomberg</a> that implementing such rules had had only little impact on business; just 3% of customers were lost after implementing a robust KYC process.</p>



<blockquote><p>We have chosen to go with full compliance, full mandatory KYC for global users, for every feature. We feel that being compliant will allow more users to use us. Most people do feel more comfortable using a licensed exchange. Most people – 97% of users – go through KYC. We lose only 3% of users.</p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO at Binance </blockquote>



<p>By using a layered approach and combining different identification methods, crypto platforms can rest assured that their customers are who they say they are. While a selfie in isolation may not keep the fraudsters at bay, when combined with video identification, in addition to collecting official documents, it forms part of a solid and robust KYC process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC processes must be painless for the user, and take place in a user-friendly environment to keep the onboarding experience as seamless and intuitive as possible. Automated identity verification, powered by artificial intelligence and combined with screening mechanisms and geolocation checks, provide an unparalleled solution to mitigate risks brought by fraudsters trying to circumvent KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respecting these conventions will allow exchanges to participate in the democratization and mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, while deterring fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrency platforms &amp; KYC mechanisms. 



<p>Although it is still possible to buy crypto without completing a KYC check, it is a more complicated and risky thing to do (as such platforms offer no protection if something was to go wrong), when compared with an exchange that complies with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC requirements</a>. </p>



<p>Crypto firms expanding into the European market now have to comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5)</a>. As such, platforms should take steps to enhance their KYC and AML procedures (see our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto KYC Page</a>), which will ultimately benefit both the users, and the platform itself.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Single Sign-On is one thing that, today we take it for granted. So, it’s even hard for us to remember when was the first time we have used it. Today, we’ll go a bit deeper into that and in which direction Single Sign-On is going. And for that we have a special guest, who is Keith Uber, VP at Ubisecure. Hello, Keith.</p>
<p>Keith Uber: Hi, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for joining us for the second time. So, you have been – two years ago. Two years ago, you’ve been here before talking about mergers and acquisitions. So happy to have you back here.</p>
<p>Keith: It’s a pleasure. Thank you for the invite to come back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, nice to have you, Keith. And we’d like to hit a few things about yourself. So, you can tell us about your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So, my entry into the world of identity probably began around the year 2000 when I had just moved to Finland from Australia. I was working for telco provider, who was in the – around the dot-com boom era had been acquiring lots of small businesses. Lots of startups, they had their own projects and all of these have many different types of identity systems and lobbying systems. And my introduction to that process was – my job was to evaluate different solutions to their problem and ultimately, take part in a commercial pilot to implement a product to solve that problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And I already can imagine that a single sign-on had some role on that. Just guessing that yes, single sign-on is something that. I was really trying to remember when was the first time that I used it and it’s quite difficult. Because it has been coming in different, in different flavours I would say.</p>
<p>Probably the first time I used was in one of my first jobs when, you know, you go to the office – people used to go to the office every day, and today is not, not for everyone at least. And then you sit down, and you login to your computer. You login to the domain and then suddenly, you can access some of the internal applications without logging in again. So that is one of the ways. And then later it came, what we see more often today is the web single sign-on, right? So, several applications.</p>
<p>So, in order to start with the basics, how you define single sign-on in a nutshell?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. Single Sign-On is maybe a more technical term that the industry understands. But for the end users, they don’t really understand what the single sign-on means. But they do understand that they don’t want to have to sign in again and again to different parts of the same website or different sections of the same company. So single sign-on is the ability to sign-on once using any form and use that same session information across many different services. For the end user, that’s great. That means that’s one less username and password, or many, many less username and passwords, or many less authentication methods for the user to manage.</p>
<p>And you mentioned the internet, or the web-based applications has a kind of thing they sort of came along. So, a long time ago, we all used to have desktop machines, and we would have PAT [personal access token] client-based applications and we’d even have to sign into those. Early on, there were different solutions for remembering and replaying the usernames and passwords across different PAT client applications. And that’s what we call enterprise single sign-on.</p>
<p>That’s very much faded away as the world has moved to web browser-based applications where people are spending most of their time in a browser or signing into applications based on browser-based technologies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thinking of we, as normal user, like majority of users, we are using without noticing, right? You might ask people what is single sign-on and not sure or maybe they try to find meaning from the name itself, but it’s everywhere.</p>
<p>So, if you can tell us a bit more how people are using single sign-on, SSO, in practice? So, what are the – how many ways, what are the scenarios? How many scenarios? Or just mention of a few of the most common ones.</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So single sign-on in essence is the reduction in the number of times that you have to sign-in to the different services. So instead of signing into different parts of the same website that might be based on different technologies, you only have to sign in once. And then when you transfer to a different section of the website or a different application within an organisation. You’re already logged in, your name appears, and your information appears.</p>
<p>And a lot of what’s happening, or the technology behind that is happening behind the scenes. It’s mainly invisible to the user and that sometimes makes demonstrating single sign-on, for example, quite a boring demo. Because you’re actually removing a lot of the things which you don’t want to see, and the end result is you see nothing. So, the best type of single sign-on is where the user doesn’t notice it.</p>
<p>But there are other advantages. For example, in order to create an account, you only have to create that account once. So, the user registration process is also simplified with a single sign-on. Without single sign-on, you would have to have a registration process for every individual user application. Or at least some way to authorise your account to be used on other applications. So that makes it easier.</p>
<p>And then password reset, or credential management is then simplified. Because instead of having to reset your password in different services, you can reset your password in one spot, and it’s the same password used for many different services.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, that illustrates the advantages that as you also said is the users don’t notice. It’s well, in a way, invisible once it’s set up.</p>
<p>So, going deeper into, what are the nuts and bolts of single sign-on? I’m sure there are many technicalities behind, but what are the main standards that make single sign-on possible?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So single sign-on doesn’t have to be done using standards. But of course, standards simplify the implementation process and simplify the management of the solution. There’s basically two main standards which are in use today. The older standard is called SAML 2.0. And this is an XML-based standard. A way to transfer information about the user and the login session between different services using public key-based technology. In more recent years, and the more modern technology is what we call OpenID Connect, which is based on OAuth 2.0. Different workflows use different parts of those two standards.</p>
<p>And that’s a JSON-based, REST JSON-based protocol. It implements most of the same use cases, most of the same user flows. But of course, as technology has developed, new use cases have come, now OpenID Connect is what we call the gold standard. Even though it’s the gold standard, there’s still a lot of software systems and products which are based on the SAML 2.0 standard.</p>
<p>So, to truly implement SSO in a – as wide range of target applications as possible, the best thing is to have a solution that supports multiple standards. And there’s ways to bridge between these two standards. So that some applications can use SAML 2.0, and other applications we use OpenID Connect and you don’t have to do a lot of your own development work. Because if the products and the servers support those standards, it’s pretty much plug and play.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, as you said, two main standards, even though there are other ways, but then two main standards is SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Yeah, even though there are two main standards, there are a lot of software that can make single sign-on happen. We know because from experience being talking with customers, organisations in different sizes. And even though we feel as user that single sign-on is almost ubiquitous. There are still many organisations, companies that don’t have single sign-on or don’t have single sign-on, at least for all the applications.</p>
<p>So, it’s common that there might be in an organisation, let’s say 20 applications and a portion of them, let’s say four of them, which have some similarity, they have single sign-on. But all the rest are disconnected, different identities for that.</p>
<p>So, there is still some technicalities behind putting that in practice from an organisation perspective. So, if you can tell us how organisations can implement SSO. The main step, let’s say, for setting up single sign-on.</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. What you described is a common scenario that even a company that’s implemented SSO in their environment. There could be a lot of applications which are outside of the system, either they’ve been implemented by a team that was unaware of the technology or unaware of the how to do it, or the product developers were unaware, the people buying it didn’t know what to ask for. So, there’s a lot of situations where a company can be – have SSO in place for maybe their main applications. But maybe for their own employees or different user groups, such as external suppliers, they might really go back to square one where the users have to log in many, many times.</p>
<p>The best way to implement SSO is to pick the most used applications, that are used by most of your customers. Who are probably requesting that today, especially for consumer customers. The most typical situation is that there’s a main application, it might be a web shop, or some service portal, it’s connected to some other related application such as a support portal or documentation system or something. And these two services are used hand-in-hand and they’re used often buy most of the users. So, you try to work on the principle of bringing in the most used applications that touch the most users sort of in a priority order.</p>
<p>SSO isn’t something that you would implement across the whole organisation and across all applications overnight. It’s done as a roadmap project, where over the lifecycle of different applications, you would plan carefully which applications you’re going to switch on for SSO. That might be on-premise applications or cloud services. It’s important at the very start to do an inventory of the applications which you’re offering to different user groups. Clearly define those different user groups, see what dedication they’re using already today, and then prioritise how you’re going to move them across to a true single sign-on system. It’s something that has to be done bit by bit.</p>
<p>Some applications may need to wait until their supplier switches on SSO or makes it available for the customers. Some cloud services might charge additional service fees for enabling corporate SSO, some might already have that today that’s just not turned on for your organisation.</p>
<p>It’s really good to work with pilot organisations, especially in B2B. And these are probably organisations which are already coming to you, already asking, when will you support my corporate login? When will I be able to click through and not have to log in? When will I not have to synchronise my users with your service, for example?</p>
<p>Because one of the big advantages of SSO, when we’re talking about business-to-business use cases. Is allowing customers, not only to move between their applications that you offer but allow them to use the authentication method which they already have. Which is their corporate login. That might be their own SSO system, or typically today, it’s Azure AD corporate login that they use. Not only for the Windows desktop and cloud services, but you can use it for third party applications as well.</p>
<p>And as the project goes forward and people start to see the benefits, then it becomes a little bit like a tsunami. That then you get requests to switch on every application that you have or to have a goal, to have as many as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, for some applications which are used by a very small user group for a very specific purpose, or very infrequently. The cost and effort of implementing SSO for – even if it’s just configuration, may not be worth the effort or the return. But you’d focus on the high volume, high value applications first.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s definitely a good observation. High volume applications and the most relevant applications, those are the ones to do first and then gradually all the others.</p>
<p>In terms of best practices that you could give us – let’s do it from two perspectives. From the end users in which might be easier, and then you can go deeper into the – what are the best practices for organisation. So, what would you say to users, either they’re aware or not, they are using single sign-on. But to users who are regularly using single sign-on?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah. So, for end users, these are the untrained, for example, citizens or consumer users for your services. You have to make it as easy as possible and as simple as possible and use the language that the users understand. So best practices there are to avoid any of the technical terms which are not understandable to begin with. But to make it a very simple and easy process for the user to – for example, register an account, approve terms and conditions, approve attribute consent to allow their information to be processed. To make it easy for them to adopt strong passwords, and have a suitable password policy for the target service.</p>
<p>And then, of course, a way to – or today, it becomes basically standard that you would – enabling a two-factor authentication. Which is familiar for the target audience, something that they’ve done before, they know how to use and something that’s appropriate for the risk, sort of the risk involved in the transaction. You don’t want to have to get the user to do some very complex authentication process just to look at their information. But you might want to have a step-up authentication or a stronger two-factor authentication. For example, in conjunction with some high value transactions, such as a bank transfer or termination of an account service.</p>
<p>My recommendation for end users is just to remember that it has to be understandable and easy to use and configure or design the system accordingly.</p>
<p>Oscar: And for organisations?</p>
<p>Keith: For organisation, it’s really important that the whole process and the whole project around single sign-on is very, very well documented. It’s a core part of security for the applications. It should be regularly reviewed, to understand is it keeping up with the latest threats in the environment? Part of that review is not only the paperwork review of the policies and configurations. But regular automated reviews of logging events, things that happen in the system to trigger evidence of potential attacks or anomalies in the processing. And to address those swiftly and quickly to make sure that there’s no impact on the organisation.</p>
<p>So, it’s important that you dedicate adequate resources either within the organisation or through a partner. Not only through the implementation project, but through the ongoing day to day running of the system. To understand the responsibilities of who is responsible for what and who is monitoring and actioning those events.</p>
<p>Of course, for organisations, one of the downsides for single sign-on is that in some ways, you put all of your eggs in one basket. That if the single sign-on system fails for one reason or another, it can become a single point of failure. But it’s a risk that could prevent users from signing in, and it could prevent customers from buying things. It could prevent customers from moving to a new application within their session.</p>
<p>So, it’s important when the system is scoped and system is implemented, that’s taken into consideration. So, it’s highly available, works at a high performance, can deal with any sort of attacks from the outside world. Because it was, it becomes, in a sense a front door for the organisation. So not only does it have to be welcoming for the user community, and easy to use. But it has to be very well hardened, with very strong locks, so that you’re not a victim of any kind of organised attack on the system.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely, it’s very good that you emphasize this importance of hardening the systems that are – which single sign-on has been built. As you put a piece of software and behind there’s a lot of infrastructure servers. Everything has to be well-secure indeed. Even though, as you see, we haven’t talking about this easiness of its function, single sign-on. It sounds like a solution that you just switch on, and it’s ready. But it’s very good that you emphasize all these security and availability aspects, because it’s so important.</p>
<p>Keith: On that topic, the standards, for example, SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect. They give you a lot of protection. They have well-defined and reviewed and audited protocols and flows, which have been tested and seen the test of time. But even though the specification says something, it’s the implementation which has to be examined. So, it’s very easy for somebody to make a simple mistake, which can put either an individual application or the whole system at risk. For example, incorrectly validating a signature, or looking at the incorrect audience information or so on.</p>
<p>So particularly where in the coding is done by an individual team, it’s important to have the technical reviews and technical audits and importantly, testing of those solutions. Luckily, especially for OpenID Connect there is very, very powerful tools for automated testing of implementations. Which is a great way to give yourself faith in an implementation. To see how it complies with the various risks involved in poor implementation quality.</p>
<p>Oscar: Such tools that – for instance, in especially in the OpenID community there are these, of course products of several years of, I don’t know thousands of organisations contributing to that standard. So, and there has been, of course, evolution of those standards.</p>
<p>So, seeing also the evolution of the standards behind SSO and what other functionality that comes along with single sign-on. What do you see today are trends related to single sign-on?</p>
<p>Keith: Yeah, I think single sign-on is quite mature in terms of, how if for generic single sign-on, for example, for web applications, moving between one application and another. What’s interesting is multi device single sign-on when you’re, for example, signing into a setup box using your mobile phone or signing into applications across devices where a session will follow you.</p>
<p>Today, we’re seeing the better understanding and the commercial release of passkeys. So, this is the culmination of years and years of work on standards such as WebAuthn and the FIDO Alliance standards. Which is now finally wrapped up into consumer understandable services which we know as passkeys. And that kind of takes the user out of the equation when we’re creating – it’s no longer creating passwords of a passkey. They don’t have that risk of creating a credential which is too weak. It’s all, in a way automated and easy to understand. And I think that’s a really exciting thing.</p>
<p>Something new for users to understand how to manage their own collection of passkeys, their own wallet. And how to keep that safe and be able to recover if they lose or break their device. It has its own challenges, but that’s probably the latest, biggest trend. It doesn’t mean that you use the same passkey for every service, still you have a different passkey for every service. So, it’s not like all of the different services are connected in that way. So, it’s privacy protecting.</p>
<p>The related technologies, which I think is a current trend is more of an authentication method. Which is used for single sign-on systems, is related identity wallets. Which are now really starting to come into the public use. Where an organisation can issue a credential and assign that credential and the user can be asked to present that at various services. And they can present as much or as little information as they want. And the service receiving that information can be sure it’s issued by the organisation that issued it.</p>
<p>It’s really exciting, the EU identity wallet projects will bring that into the forefront as more and more governments adopt those type of services. And we’ll see that, we’ve seen that already with, for example, electronic driver’s licenses and electronic professional credentials. So, they will spread, and it will make things easier, I think, for the user. A lot of time and effort into hiding the complexity and the security beneath it all and making the user experience friendly and familiar. Using the service logos and branding and colours and the analogies to cards that you have and so on. So, it’s a big thing.</p>
<p>And this might also drive many, many single sign-on projects. As customers won’t know how to ask for single sign-on, but they say, “Why Can’t We? Why can’t we sign into all of these applications with a passkey instead of using individual credentials for each service?” Those discussions become the underlying discussion of a single sign-on set up with passkeys and authentication method.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I’m sure the user will be pushing the companies or organisations to deliver single sign-on now that these technologies, passkeys and wallets are reaching that usability level. That it’s ready to be used for the masses.</p>
<p>Final question for your Keith, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Keith: I think for single sign-on, one of the related technologies is what’s called federation. And federation is when you have single sign-on across organisational boundaries. So, for example, I could sign in using my Ubisecure login into a third-party application where I do work, for example, with other companies. And this federation signing in with your own commercial credentials across organisational boundaries is something that I think a lot of organisations haven’t benefited from enough today. And that would be – maybe my actionable idea is to look at the B2B applications that you have. Look at the time it takes to manage the users in those systems. For those users to get an account, those users to ask for access, for audits to be done. How do you check what the company is? Are they still in operation? Does that person still work for the company?</p>
<p>A lot of those problems can be solved by implementing cross organisation single sign-on – this federation. And it can be as simple as entering your email address and then signing in using the – or approving the login using your existing home organisation single sign-on. Or are signing in using, Azure Active Directory sign in. In that way, the target application or target organisation gets all of the up-to-date information about the user that they were allowed to get or that they requested to get. They get evidence that the user has a continued relationship with that organisation. And of course, they get single sign-on, so they don’t actually have to sign in again. They might just approve the login and get to work.</p>
<p>It’s got benefits for all parties in the transaction. It improves security, it improves the auditing. It’s easier to use. It’s convenient, less hassle, less clean up, less risk. And I think it’s not anything new in terms of technology, but it’s something that’s underutilised and maybe undervalued.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree with that. I think organisations could use more to fulfil the potential of more collaboration between organisations. By using these techniques that there has been for a while, and we have been discussing today.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Keith, for joining us today. It has been super interesting to hear more in detail what single sign-on can do for different types of organisations. And of course, ultimately, to make our lives and users life much easier. So, if someone would like to follow this conversation with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>

<p>Bluesky is a public benefit corporation with the mission to “to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.” The public benefit corporation status allows us to pursue our mission above profit, but we still need to make Bluesky a sustainable service in order to build an open ecosystem that lasts. In order to do this, we’ve raised an $8M seed round to support our mission and growth, and are taking the first steps towards a services-led business model.</p>
 Our Seed Round 
<p>The hardest part of building a new social network is bootstrapping growth. As you might recall, Bluesky started as a project funded and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/2-7-2022-overview">supported by Twitter</a>, and even after our incorporation as a separate company, we retained a close relationship with them. However, once Twitter changed hands, the relationship was terminated, and our original plan of building the AT Protocol to support Twitter as a client was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Last fall, we started building our own client app to drive adoption and development of the AT Protocol. This summer, we converted from a public benefit LLC to a public benefit C Corp in order to gain more independence from the legacy of the past. Our mission and board have stayed the same, but along with this conversion, we’ve raised funding from an array of values-aligned investors who share our vision for an open and decentralized commons for public conversation. Our goal for this raise was to find new partners and to give ourselves room to grow the network and experiment with new business models.</p>
<p>We raised $8M in a seed round led by <a href="https://neo.com/">Neo</a>, a community-led firm with amazing partners like Ali Partovi and Suzanne Xie, and a wonderful cast of additional investors including Joe Beda who co-created Kubernetes, Bob Young of Red Hat, Amjad Masad of Replit, Amir Shevat of Darkmode, Heather Meeker, Jeromy Johnson, Automattic, Protocol Labs, Sarah Drasner, Katelyn Donnelly, Ali Evans, Stav Erez, Kris Nóva, Brad Fitzpatrick, Abdul Ly, and many other operators who have much wisdom to share.</p>
<p>With this funding, we can expand our team, manage increasing operation and infrastructure costs, and grow the AT Protocol ecosystem as well as the Bluesky app. It’s a lot to tackle at once, but we’re excited to have seasoned allies who want to help us realize our vision of an open commons for public conversation.</p>
<p>Just as we’ve made the source code for the protocol and the client public, we also want to be  transparent about our business plans. We’ll be experimenting with different strategies and services to see what provides real value to our users, and will continue to share what we learn as we build a sustainable social network.</p>
 Our First Paid Service 
<p>Traditionally, social media companies have supported business costs through advertising. While advertising can subsidize services to make them free to the end user, it comes with negative long-term consequences like incentivizing platforms to lock their users in. In the business of advertising, where social media companies exchange user data to serve ads to specific audiences, users become the product.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s business model must be fundamentally different — we are a public social network and our code is all open source, so we have no “moat” when it comes to data. We set out to build a protocol where users can own their data and always have the freedom to leave, and this approach means that advertising couldn’t be our dominant business model. So, we’ve been exploring other avenues of monetization.</p>
<p>We believe that there must be better strategies to sustain social networks that don’t require selling user data for ads. Our first step in another direction is paid services, and we’re starting with <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">custom domains</a>. While setting up a custom domain to use with Bluesky and the AT Protocol is fairly straightforward, it does require some familiarity with domain registrars and DNS settings. Yet, over 13,000 users have already either repurposed domains they already owned to use as handles, or purchased a domain solely because of Bluesky. Domains have so much potential as a personalized way to customize identities and as a decentralized way to verify reputation that builds off the existing web. For example, U.S. Senators have used the <code>senate.gov</code> domain to verify their identity on Bluesky without our involvement, and a third-party developer built a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb">web extension</a> that checks if websites are linked to an AT Protocol identity. The possibilities are wide in the domain-as-a-handle space.</p>
<p>We’re partnering with Namecheap, a popular domain registrar, to <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">offer a service</a> for easy domain purchasing and management. With this, people can set a custom domain as their handle on Bluesky and the AT Protocol in under a few minutes. Of the domain registrars, Namecheap has one of the best reputations for defending their users against unauthorized domain transfers and protecting their domain names. Our shared values of putting users first and moving towards a more open internet makes us confident that together, we can provide a great service to our users. To learn more about how to easily get your own custom domain through Bluesky, read our product announcement <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">here</a>.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce a new feature that allows users to seamlessly purchase and manage domains directly through Bluesky. With this, you can easily set a custom domain as your Bluesky handle and much more.</p>
<p>On Bluesky and the AT Protocol, you can set domains that you own like <code>bsky.team</code> or <code>alice.lol</code> as your username.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 19th June to 4th&nbsp;July <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>In this edition, we shine a spotlight on the significant regulatory strides we’ve seen in recent&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>From the UK recognizing cryptocurrency trading as a regulated financial activity to the European Union adjusting bank regulations to incorporate cryptocurrencies to countries like Argentina and Thailand stepping up their game to align with international standards and tackle unique crypto challenges — the regulatory landscape is continuously evolving.</p><p>So, let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Crypto Regulation Takes Center Stage: A Global Update from the EU, Argentina, Thailand, and the&nbsp;UK <p>Advancements in cryptocurrency regulation are shaping the global financial landscape, with the European Union, Argentina, Thailand, and the United Kingdom taking significant strides in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>Starting off with the European Union, a pivotal consensus has been reached to revise banking regulations, integrating new rules specifically for crypto assets. This reform, as per EU authorities, aims to harmoniously incorporate digital assets into the traditional financial system while mitigating potential risks associated with unbacked cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Moving over to Latin America, Argentina demonstrates a keen interest in adhering to international norms by planning to adopt the crypto regulations outlined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF is an international entity dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. This alignment signals Argentina’s commitment to meeting global standards and could potentially improve its chances of securing a financial aid package from the International Monetary&nbsp;Fund.</p><p>In Asia, Thailand is addressing its unique challenges by imposing fresh regulations on companies providing crypto services. This development comes in the wake of a significant crisis in the crypto lending market in 2022. Under the new rules, companies are barred from investing or lending customers’ money, and the emphasis is on comprehensive risk disclosure to customers prior to providing services.</p><p>Meanwhile, the United Kingdom marks a pivotal moment in its financial regulatory history by legitimizing cryptocurrency trading as a regulated financial activity. This legal transformation underscores the country’s support for the safe and regulated use of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Now let’s look into two of these most important developments in detail and explore their impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p> EU’s Regulatory Revision: Analyzing the Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The European Union’s proposed changes to the Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive signal a critical juncture in the integration of crypto assets within the traditional financial system. This significant regulatory shift is aimed at bolstering the resilience of EU banks while acknowledging the growing influence of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The new regulations include a “transitional prudential regime for crypto assets,” a clear nod to digital currencies. However, an initial high-risk weightage on free-floating cryptocurrencies may deter banks from embracing crypto. This stance softened with a more lenient proposal for regulated stablecoins, hinting at a gradual acceptance of these digital currencies.</p><p>These changes can be viewed as a double-edged sword for the crypto ecosystem. On the upside, formal regulations lend legitimacy to cryptocurrencies, potentially spurring their mainstream integration. Yet, the high-risk weightage could dampen innovation and concentrate power among larger institutions capable of bearing regulatory costs.</p><p>Although the regulatory text is pending approval, the emerging outline indicates a significant, if challenging, path ahead for the crypto&nbsp;world.</p> UK Government Greenlights Crypto Trading, Makes it a Regulated Financial Activity <p>The UK government has made a strategic move, recognizing cryptocurrency trading as a regulated financial activity under the Financial Services and Markets Act&nbsp;2023.</p><p>The law, now enacted after Royal Assent, officially views cryptocurrencies as “cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual rights.”</p><p>Although significant, this development comes with its own national and international challenges and opportunities. For instance, local industry stakeholders must adapt to the new regulatory landscape while maintaining a user-friendly environment.</p><p>Potentially, this could ignite a global race as more and more countries join the fray to stake their claim in the crypto world. Indeed, the UK’s move could inspire other nations to follow suit, shaping the future of global crypto regulations.</p><p>In contrast, the downside of this decision reveals that greater regulation could mean lesser autonomy for crypto entities, which may deter some investors. While the intention is to bolster security, it could also inadvertently stifle innovation due to the strict compliance requirements.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report: Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliance-spotlight-unraveling-the-eus-new-transfer-of-funds-regulation">Compliance Spotlight: Unraveling the EU’s New Transfer of Funds Regulation</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1674788547990278148?s=20">#DiscoverShyft Campaign Wrap&nbsp;up</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Revolutionizing Food Supply Chains:<br>
The UNISOT Reversed Marketplace Solution 
<p>In a dynamic partnership with Amped/Local2Local, UNISOT is shaking up conventional supply chains by introducing a Reversed Marketplace solution – an innovative platform that connects consumers directly to local farmers and producers, thereby fostering sustainable Short Food Supply Chains.</p>
 Shortening the Distance Between Producers and Consumers 
<p>The Reversed Marketplace solution has the potential to drastically transform the way consumers source their food. Instead of relying on traditional retail outlets, consumers can now place direct orders and make advance payments for the products they desire. This model instigates farmers to cultivate to order, creating a supply chain that is responsive to consumer demands and beneficial to the local economy and community.</p>
<p>By eliminating the need for traditional distribution channels, which often impose high fees and squeeze the profit margins for producers, the UNISOT Reversed Marketplace empowers local producers to sell their products directly to consumers. This model not only reduces waste and lowers costs, but it also leads to higher quality products and enhances sustainability.</p>
 A Win-Win for Producers and Consumers 
<p>The direct-to-consumer model offers substantial benefits for local producers. By bypassing intermediaries, they can avoid the additional costs associated with distribution, marketing and other overhead expenses. This increased profitability offers financial stability for local producers, enabling them to reinvest in their businesses and refine their production practices. Consequently, consumers gain access to fresher, locally sourced food products.</p>
 
 
     
 
 Connecting local consumers with local farmers,<br>
creating Short Food Supply Chains. 
 Public Blockchain Technology: The Backbone of the Reversed Marketplace 
<p>The UNISOT Reversed Marketplace is underpinned by public blockchain technology, which ensures a transparent, traceable supply chain. Consumers can trace the products they purchase back to the farm where they were grown, instilling trust and confidence in the products they consume.</p>
<p>Public Blockchain technology is used to secure transactions made through the platform, guaranteeing the integrity of the payment process and protecting against potential fraud. Moreover, the technology provides real-time data about the status and location of products in the supply chain, leading to more efficient distribution.</p>
<p>The UNISOT solutions provide the infrastructure that allows for efficient tracking and tracing of products from farmers to consumers. This secure, transparent, and decentralized solution is enhancing the reliability of the supply chain by ensuring all stakeholders have access to the same, immutable information.</p>
 The Future of Food Supply Chains 
<p>The collaboration between UNISOT and Local2Local is revolutionizing the food supply chain industry. Through the Reversed Marketplace, farmers receive the capital they need to produce, while consumers can influence what is produced based on their preferences. This direct model ensures fair prices for producers and quality products for consumers, setting a new standard for sustainability and trust in food supply chains.</p>
<p>With its potential for significant economic, social, and environmental impacts, the UNISOT Reversed Marketplace is paving the way for a more sustainable and equitable food system.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Benjamin Franklin, the famous American statesman (happy 4th of July, by the way!), once claimed: “in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes”. Well, nowadays, there is another certainty for every organization in the world – eventually it will be hacked. If yours has not yet been attacked by cybercriminals, then it can easily happen tomorrow or even worse: it might have already happened, but you just haven’t found out yet.</p>
<p>Statistics from around the world clearly show that data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other kinds of cyberthreats are on the rise, and the cost of dealing with their consequences is increasing as well, despite companies investing more in cybersecurity solutions. Combined with the ongoing shortage of qualified staff to use those tools, it is completely unsurprising that everyone has high hopes for Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, which promise to reshape the entire field of cybersecurity and finally tip the scale in favor of cyber defenders. According to some predictions, this market will grow nearly tenfold by 2030.</p>
<p>With the latest developments in areas like generative networks and large language models, some of the new tricks AI tools are able to perform look so impressive even for seasoned IT experts that the public perception of AI has quickly shifted from “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mme2Aya_6Bc">I’m sorry, Dave, I’m afraid I cannot do that</a>” to “<a href="https://angryemailtranslator.com/">Can ChatGPT help me be nice to my coworkers?</a>”. And while I’m not going to comment on ethical implications of that, at the very least we need a small reality check on the current and potential capabilities of AI tools in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>First, let’s get one thing out of the way: there is no such thing as “The Artificial Intelligence”. Even leaving aside the philosophical dispute about the nature of human intelligence (hint: we still don’t really know how it works), the very idea that AI is one thing, technology, or process is profoundly wrong. The academic field of AI research is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/ai-landscape-more-complicated-than-you-might-have-thought">very complex and diverse</a>, with numerous methods and algorithms suited for different applications. Perhaps the only common thing among all modern AI technologies is their enormous appetite for hardware resources and demand for huge datasets for training.</p>
<p>So, what are the most relevant applications of AI-related technologies to the field of cybersecurity? Well, the lowest-hanging fruit is pattern recognition and anomaly detection in a stream of security events (such as the telemetry collected from endpoint devices, server logs, or cloud services). Even the most basic unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques can find outliers and thus identify potentially suspicious behaviors, thus massively reducing the number of statistical noise and improving the productivity of security analysts. Clustering methods help group events together based on their similarity and thus recognize ongoing attack timelines instead of single data points.</p>
<p>More sophisticated methods rely on training ML models with data from past incidents and do not just identify anomalies but align them to known malicious tactics and techniques (like <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a>), thus helping classify incidents and measure their risks much better. The biggest downside of such methods is collecting enough quality data for training – thus, large vendors with massive global telemetry networks usually lead in this field.</p>
<p>These AI techniques are perhaps the most popular in modern cybersecurity tools – most endpoint solutions use them in conjunction with traditional methods to detect malware, identify suspicious user behavior, and even to stop destructive activities of ransomware. Whenever you see a “Powered by ML” label on a product box, this is what most vendors actually mean. Unfortunately, their exact capabilities can vary significantly – some early AI-powered antivirus solutions <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/researchers-claim-they-bypassed-cylances-ai-based-antivirus/">could easily be tricked</a> by hackers.</p>
<p>A more recent and sophisticated class of AI techniques is based on neural networks originally designed to perform tasks like image recognition. These deep learning-based solutions can be trained to identify other kinds of complex patterns and features in, for example, binary code or network traffic instead. They have been applied successfully in modern intrusion detection systems or application security solutions that can identify obfuscated malicious code without the need to execute it dynamically first.</p>
<p>The area of e-mail security requires a completely different approach. While even the early anti-spam solutions have utilized some primitive kind of machine learning to identify unwanted mails, preventing modern social engineering attacks and business e-mail compromise requires a much higher degree of sophistication. This is where natural language processing technology (NLP) comes to the rescue. NLP has been used, for example, to identify the sentiment of an e-mail or to check whether it is likely to have been written by the person it appears to have come from. The same technologies are also widely used by brand reputation management solutions.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models</a> (LLM) – the technology behind tools like ChatGPT – have been the focus of public interest. Trained on enormous datasets from various sources, they can generate texts in multiple languages that not only look like they were written by a human, but actually make sense, at least most of the time. Combined with NLP, they enable the creation of chatbots that are potentially indistinguishable from humans, easily passing the famous Turing test. These intelligent chatbots enable truly unique possibilities for cybersecurity as well, allowing analysts to perform tasks like threat hunting, incident analysis, and even preventing future attacks just by talking to an AI assistant. It must be stressed, however, that general-purpose LLMs like ChatGPT are not sufficiently trained to perform mission-critical jobs like this. Specialized solutions for industries like healthcare or cybersecurity are being developed, with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">promising early results</a>.</p>
<p>And yet, however impressive these developments are, ChatGPT is not the holy grail of cybersecurity automation. What many analysts are dreaming about is a solution that is not only smart enough to identify and analyze security incidents, but can also deal with them autonomously, with human involvement reduced to a minimum (ideally, to making only critical decisions, completely spared from the tedious job of reacting to every boring alert). Interestingly, this is perhaps the most controversial area of AI applications, with many people still afraid of letting AIs make their own decisions. However, most people usually agree that letting robots take over the most boring stuff like patching, performance tuning, and maintenance is perfectly fine, and some vendors already have <a href="https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/">working solutions for that</a>.</p>
<p>So, what should we expect from the latest AI innovations in the field of cybersecurity? Will ChatGPT soon replace all human security experts? I seriously doubt that. If your job can be completely replaced by an automated tool (like the job of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/german-tabloid-bild-to-replace-range-of-editorial-jobs-with-ai">journalist writing for a tabloid newspaper</a>), you should probably reconsider your career choice, but I do believe that in cybersecurity, the risks and priorities are still somewhat different. Instead, you should be looking for tools that improve your productivity and leave you more time for critical decisions and creative tasks.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the latest trends in cybersecurity and in meeting real experts, we are planning a conference devoted entirely to this subject. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Check out cyberevolution</a> this November – perhaps we will see you then in Frankfurt, Germany!</p>

 Existing feature changes&nbsp; 
<p>Improved experience for managing passwords in My Security Info&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning October 2023 through a phased rollout, we're improving the end user experience of managing passwords and providing the capability to do so in the My Security Info management portal (<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmysignins.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity-info&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cv-vidhianand%40microsoft.com%7C3de2bd951c21480e592708db62f85b6b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638212591060798838%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=pUMIpaz4LDa%2BLQBdNBukhIb6c7iEcSQMY7yG8oBQVyE%3D&amp;reserved=0">My Sign-Ins | Security Info | Microsoft.com</a>). Users will be able to change their password, and users that are capable of multifactor authentication (MFA) will be able to reset their passwords in My Security Info. By December 2023, the legacy experience to change passwords will be redirected to the new experience. This change will occur automatically for all customers and no action needs to be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introducing voice OTP&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voice call is our least secure authentication method; there are far <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods">better ways of doing MFA</a>, including Microsoft Authenticator (which offers both MFA and Passwordless options), or even better: Windows Hello for Business.&nbsp; Although we encourage everyone to move away from voice, we’re making security improvements to the voice call method for those that are dependent on it. Rather than confirming the authentication by pressing “#” a one-time passcode (OTP) will be read out to the user during the voice call. We’ll introduce voice OTP as part of the “Phone OTP” authentication method, which will be an evolution of today’s SMS authentication method. This authentication method will have two delivery methods (SMS and voice OTP) and as such allows for delivery method optimization. You’ll be able to migrate from traditional voice to voice OTP, and we recommend you do so, as traditional voice will be deprecated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting July 2023, all new tenants using Azure AD free licenses will have this new optimized channel. For existing tenants using Azure AD free licenses, we will begin rolling out this feature from early August. Customers with Azure AD Premium licenses will follow, once all the configurability in the Phone OTP authentication method is available. We’ll share timelines over the course of the next few months in another public announcement. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070717">Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a> where we’ll notify admins when this change will impact their specific organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registration campaign improvements &nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Azure AD tenants that are Microsoft-managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning July 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change starting with tenants with Azure AD free licenses and progressing to all organizations worldwide. We will share timelines in another public announcement. Keep an eye on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2070717">Message center in the Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, where we’ll notify admins when this change will impact their specific organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPv6 enablement in Azure AD may impact users&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IPv6 rollout ends on June 30th across all Microsoft regions, which may impact Azure AD customers. Your users might experience blocks or receive more MFA requests than usual. In such cases, we recommend reviewing your tenant’s sign-in logs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This impact on your tenant could be due to end users connecting from IPv6 ranges that are not configured in your tenant’s Named Locations. To address this, please follow the steps outlined on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/location-condition#identifying-ipv6-traffic-with-azure-ad-sign-in-activity-reports">this page</a> to identify IPv6 ranges in your tenant’s environment and configure the necessary settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please share the following guidance with the relevant members of your IT administration team:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IT / Security Admin: Use the sign-in report described in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fconditional-access%2Flocation-condition%23identifying-ipv6-traffic-with-azure-ad-sign-in-activity-reports&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cv-vidhianand%40microsoft.com%7C3de2bd951c21480e592708db62f85b6b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638212591060798838%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=v573bBB8NL33yGwqS9ktTSUh02tKAVYkQiUtmbYtTl0%3D&amp;reserved=0">Identifying IPv6 traffic with Azure AD Sign-in activity reports</a>.

<p>Modernizing per-user Multifactor Authentication (MFA) Settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of ongoing service improvements, starting in October 2023, we'll be rolling out a modernized <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates">per-user MFA</a> settings experiences which better align to the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> look and feel. No functionalities will be removed as part of this user experience update. This change will automatically occur for all customers, and there is no action that needs to be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement and Powershell Module Deprecation&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2019, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">announced the deprecation</a> of the Azure AD Graph service, and we have <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">communicated</a> that Azure AD Graph will stop functioning at some point after June 30, 2023. We’ve also previously communicated that three legacy PowerShell modules (Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online) would be deprecated on June 30, 2023. We understand that many customers are not yet complete with these migrations, and we confirm our continued commitment to work with our customers during this migration period to minimize and avoid impact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’ve published updates on timelines and details for the Azure AD Graph retirement process and PowerShell module deprecation. The details can be read <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 PowerShell: We recognize that some scenarios supported by the legacy PowerShell modules are not yet available in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, and we have postponed the deprecation date for the legacy PowerShell modules to March 30, 2024, accordingly. 
 Azure AD Graph: As of June 30, 2023, we are entering a retirement cycle for Azure AD Graph. There will be no impact on applications on June 30, but Azure AD Graph APIs do not have SLA or maintenance commitments beyond security-related fixes. We’re committing to retiring Azure AD Graph in incremental steps, with three months of advance notice for each step. The first step of retirement will involve preventing newly created applications from using Azure AD Graph. Our next update will provide a timeline and details of this step.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strongly encourage all customers to prioritize migrating applications using Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph APIs and begin planning for migrating PowerShell scripts using the legacy modules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upcoming change in B2B sign-in experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, when a B2B guest user is prompted to sign in to a resource tenant, the background and logo branding reflects that of the resource tenant. As soon as the B2B guest enters their User Principal Name (UPN), the logo will change to that of the home tenant, but the background branding remains the same. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is working on changing this branding experience for cross-tenant collaboration authentication requests. In the new experience, when a B2B guest user is prompted to sign in, after entering the UPN, they’ll be redirected to their home tenant login page, and the branding experience will reflect that of the home tenant instead of the resource tenant. After successfully signing in, the user will be signed into the app in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to roll out this change starting July 2023 and complete by October 2023, and there are no actions that need to be taken. To understand B2B collaboration, please see: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b">Azure AD B2B collaboration overview - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  The recent FATF report identifies significant issues with most Travel Rule solutions, particularly their difficulty in capturing and relaying data in real-time and their limited scope that cannot accommodate the full range of digital&nbsp;assets.  The FATF report also highlights the lack of interoperability among various Travel Rule solutions, leading to operational complexities and increased compliance costs for&nbsp;VASPs.  Shyft Veriscope, an advanced Travel Rule solution, addresses these challenges through automated detection, comprehensive data retention, and strategic interoperability with other solutions for effective global compliance.  <p>In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory compliance is both a central focus and a complex challenge. As Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) strive to keep pace with these developments, they also have to grapple with the intricacies of global standards. This struggle highlights the delicate equilibrium between innovation and regulation in this evolving&nbsp;domain.</p><p>One such standard is the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, which poses a unique set of challenges that VASPs must address effectively.</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule, whose intended goal is to instill transparency in virtual asset transactions, requires VASPs to gather and share specific user information about transactions. And although the principle behind the rule is simple — greater transparency leads to greater security — putting this into practice while preserving the blockchain privacy ethos, presents a substantial challenge.</p><p>Various solutions have surfaced in the market to address these challenges, assisting VASPs in the multifaceted task of gathering, storing, and sharing the necessary user information for Travel Rule compliance. Yet, even with these existing tools at hand, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/June2023-Targeted-Update-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.pdf">the recent FATF report</a> underscores critical issues prevalent in many of these solutions, some of which are deeply rooted in the fundamental nature of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The Issues With Most Travel Rule Solutions</p><p>The FATF report notes that given the speed and scope of digital asset transactions, existing solutions may struggle to capture and relay information in real-time. Furthermore, these solutions might not be able to retain transmitted data adequately, making record-keeping and transaction monitoring a difficult task.</p><p>Another issue with most Travel Rule solutions, as pointed out in the FATF report, is their limited scope. As such, virtual assets encompass a broad spectrum of digital currencies and tokens, and not all solutions can accommodate the full range of these assets. This lack of comprehensive coverage leads to gaps in compliance, making it challenging for VASPs to adhere to FATF standards fully.</p><p>The report also highlights the pressing issue of interoperability: the ability of various Travel Rule Solutions to work in unison. It noted that many Travel Rule Solutions operate in isolation, hindering a streamlined approach to compliance across different platforms and jurisdictions. This lack of integration contributes to operational complexity, ultimately driving up compliance costs for&nbsp;VASPs.</p>(<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/June2023-Targeted-Update-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.pdf">Image Source</a>)<p>Given these challenges, the FATF has presented a series of questions that VASPs must consider when choosing a Travel Rule solution. These include understanding the timing and scope of data submission, methods of counterparty identification, due diligence procedures, and data retention capabilities. Each of these factors plays a crucial role in ensuring compliance with the Travel Rule, thereby helping VASPs operate securely and transparently.</p><p>Navigating the world of Travel Rule compliance is no simple task, but it is a necessary one. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to mature, compliance will become an increasingly significant marker of a VASP’s credibility and success. Understanding the intricacies of the FATF’s Travel Rule and choosing a comprehensive, interoperable solution will be key in this endeavor.</p> The Solution? Shyft Veriscope <p>In the context of the FATF outlined challenges, Shyft Veriscope comes as the only one that successfully addresses all of them and even more — it is the only frictionless Travel Rule solution in the blockchain space.</p><p>Let’s dive deeper into how Shyft Veriscope distinguishes itself in the crowded space of Travel Rule solutions. Beyond the basic criteria of compliance, it provides a level of sophistication and automation that other solutions fail to&nbsp;match.</p><p>Veriscope’s distinct set of features not only address the immediate concerns highlighted by the FATF but also anticipate future challenges and opportunities in the digital assets&nbsp;space.</p><p>Here’s a closer look at the differentiating aspects of Shyft Veriscope and how they seamlessly tackle the complex requirements of the FATF Travel Rule, making it the go-to solution for&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Fully Automated <p>One of the key issues identified by the FATF report is the lack of an automated system for VASP discovery at an entity level. However, unlike most existing solutions, Shyft Veriscope enables VASPs to auto-detect counterparty VASPs in real-time using just the crypto wallet address. This eliminates the need for users to input additional information or VASPs to publicize their wallet addresses.</p><p>Moreover, Shyft Veriscope’s automated address proofing ensures the accuracy of the identified VASP, thereby reducing the risk of accidental data breaches. It also provides a robust framework for VASPs to reliably identify counterparty VASPs at a legal entity/jurisdiction level, allowing them to make informed decisions based on their risk-based approach.</p> Data Retention and Comprehensive Coverage <p>In addition to real-time detection, Shyft Veriscope facilitates comprehensive data retention, which is critical for record-keeping or transaction monitoring purposes, in line with the FATF guidelines. It enables VASPs to ‘hold’ originator and beneficiary information on their own servers rather than on third-party ones, making this information available upon request to the appropriate authorities.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope can also handle transactions involving all types of virtual assets and transactions of any amount. This broad capability supports the FATF requirement that accurate information must be transmitted for transactions over USD/EUR 1000 involving any type of VA or fiat currency.</p><p>This is an important feature, as the FATF guidelines permit individual jurisdictions to set their own minimum thresholds. For instance, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan has set a higher threshold of $3000</a> at which the FATF Travel Rule is triggered.</p><p>Despite these variances, Shyft Veriscope is equipped to adapt and comply with the unique regulations of each jurisdiction, demonstrating its global relevance and applicability.</p> Peer-to-Peer Data Transfers <p>Shyft Veriscope doesn’t stop there. Recognizing the lack of a standardized framework for secure data transfers between VASPs, Shyft Network has engineered a mechanism for peer-to-peer, VASP-to-VASP data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This ensures that user data is transferred securely, with no third-party servers involved, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or wide-scale data breaches.</p><p>It also fully complies with <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">major data privacy laws such as the GDPR</a>, reinforcing its commitment to user privacy. However, addressing the challenges of the present is only half the&nbsp;battle.</p> Interoperability <p>In a landscape as dynamic as the virtual assets industry, preparing for the future is equally crucial. This is where Shyft Veriscope’s strategic approach to interoperability takes center&nbsp;stage.</p><p>Recognizing the barriers that lack of cross-system collaboration can erect, Shyft Veriscope has entered into strategic partnerships with various Travel Rule Solutions and blockchain analytics providers, including Sygna, Notabene, Crystal Blockchain, and Coinfirm, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>By facilitating seamless interactions between diverse solutions, Shyft Veriscope is fostering a truly global network of compliant VASPs. These partnerships embody the spirit of interoperability that is integral to a comprehensive compliance solution.</p> Sunrise Issue: A Major Challenge and Shyft Veriscope’s Innovative Solution <p>Shining a light on a critical obstacle addressed in the FATF report, we now turn our attention to what’s widely known as the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.”</p><p>While the sunrise symbolizes a new day, ushering in light and clarity, in the world of virtual asset service providers (VASPs), the “Sunrise Issue” brings about more shadows than light. This issue essentially stems from the diverse timelines adopted by different jurisdictions for implementing the FATF’s Travel Rule, and the resultant compliance chaos it creates in an inherently borderless and international virtual asset landscape.</p><p>VASPs in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule has been adopted — referred to as “sunrise jurisdictions” — grapple with immense challenges when executing transactions with VASPs in “non-sunrise jurisdictions.” These are jurisdictions that have not yet enforced the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>This creates an asymmetry, as one VASP may be legally required to collect and transmit specific customer information while the other might not, impairing the ability of the former to execute transactions in a fully compliant manner.</p><p>The Sunrise Issue brings to light a key question: How can a VASP in a sunrise jurisdiction remain compliant while transacting with a VASP in a non-sunrise jurisdiction? Well, the key to solve this issue is Shyft Veriscope.</p> How Shyft Veriscope Solves the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue? <p>Utilizing an approach known as “historic lookback,” Veriscope enables VASPs to retrieve information on any transaction, regardless of when it occurred, even if the receiving VASP hadn’t implemented a Travel Rule solution at the time of the transaction.</p><p>When a VASP joins the network, it can receive historical requests and respond with the necessary information. This feature allows VASPs to be compliant when processing transactions, no matter when their counterparty VASPs begin using a Travel Rule solution or where they operate across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Veriscope’s approach to resolving the Sunrise Issue is akin to enabling someone to see and appreciate a sunrise, even if they weren’t awake when it happened. It does this by allowing transactions to occur based on the sender’s timeline and then retroactively generating the supporting material that shows the receiver is compliant when they ‘wake up’ to their Travel Rule obligations.</p><p>Overall, Shyft Network’s innovative approach to Travel Rule compliance builds on the principles of privacy, security, and AML, aligning with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>By presenting a comprehensive solution to the problems VASPs face in implementing the FATF Travel Rule, Shyft Veriscope proves to be more than just a compliance tool — it’s a step towards a safer and more secure future for the virtual asset ecosystem.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>IAM is not a single solution, but covers a range of areas, from managing users and their access to authentication and control of privileged accounts. This makes it complex for organizations to deploy comprehensive IAM solutions. Converged approaches that integrate several or all IAM capabilities can help in reducing complexity in implementing and operating IAM. While this needs to be carefully considered, there are major benefits in focusing on such converged IAM approaches. ARCON is a provider of a converged IAM solution.

<p><br>We krijgen regelmatig vragen van klanten, consumenten en toezichthouders of Ockto de persoonsgegevens van gebruikers in de Ockto app opslaat. Met andere woorden: zijn jullie een 'sluis' voor mijn gegevens, of een 'kluis'? Met de komst van de Europese ID-wallets lijkt de 'kluis' namelijk de trend te gaan worden. Al je persoonsgegevens in een veilige kluis op je eigen telefoon onder eigen beheer. Dat klinkt veilig en biedt jou als eigenaar van de persoonsgegevens de volledige controle over waar deze gegevens worden gebruikt. Toch bekijken we bij Ockto dit vraagstuk wat genuanceerder - we gaan in deze blog in op de verschillen tussen 'sluis' en 'kluis', en welke afweging wij maken als het gaat om het opslaan en delen van persoonsgegevens.</p> 
<p>Waarom bestaan oplossingen zoals Ockto eigenlijk? </p> 
<p>Waarom zijn we hier bijna 8 jaar geleden mee begonnen? In essentie wilden we één probleem oplossen: Consumenten in staat stellen om veilig, snel en digitaal persoonsgegevens te laten delen met dienstverleners. Deze dienstverleners verwachten gestructureerde, actuele en geverifieerde persoonsgegevens, die beperkt zijn tot alleen die attributen die nodig zijn voor het verlenen van hun dienst.&nbsp;<br><br>Ockto vervult al deze eisen. Met de Ockto app halen personen de gegevens op die hun dienstverlener nodig heeft. Het Ockto-platform regelt de uitwisseling tussen het individu, de bronnen en de dienstverlener. Snel, eenvoudig en veilig.</p>

     <p>Further to our update last week on <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/uk-government-u-turns-on-cryptoasset-financial-promotion-regime/">His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT’s) revised approach</a> to the cryptoasset financial promotions regime, the<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/cryptoasset-firms-marketing-uk-consumers-must-get-ready-financial-promotions-regime"> Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has now published</a> an update reminding cryptoasset firms to prepare for the changes.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>The route to approve a financial promotion – whether a UK-registered or overseas firm – are set out as below:</p> 
     <p>“Subject to Parliamentary approval, when the regime comes into force, there will be four routes to communicating cryptoasset promotions to UK consumers:</p> 
       
       The promotion is communicated by an FCA-authorized person.<br><br>  
       The promotion is made by an unauthorized person but approved by an FCA-authorized person. Legislation is currently making its way through Parliament which, if made, would introduce a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/995565/HMT_WR_113_Consultation_Response.pdf">regulatory gateway</a> that authorized firms will need to pass through in order to approve financial promotions for unauthorized persons.<br><br>  
       The promotion is communicated by a cryptoasset business registered under the MLRs with the FCA.<br><br>  
       The promotion otherwise complies with the conditions of an exemption in the Financial Promotion Order.”  
       
     <p>Route three above would be the typical method for a UK-registered crypto firm to approve a promotion. Cryptoasset firms that are already registered under the MLRs will be able to communicate their own financial promotions for cryptoassets, subject to complying with the conditions of the exemption and the relevant FCA rules. They will not have to apply for any further permissions to communicate their own promotions.</p> 
     <p>In line with existing restrictions to the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents">Financial and Services and Markets Act (FSMA)</a>, financial promotions that are not made using one of these routes will be in breach of Section 21 of the legislation. This is a criminal offence punishable by up to two years imprisonment.</p> 
     <p>We recommend that firms seeking FCA registration have a clearly documented process for approving a financial promotion, and an identified responsible person for oversight and control of this process.&nbsp;</p> 
     <p>Existing UK-registered crypto firms should also take a similar approach to documenting their process and allocate responsibility.</p> 
     <p>The FCA clarifies that it will assess as part of its “fit and proper” assessment:</p> 
       
       When making a fit and proper assessment, the FCA will consider not only the fit and proper nature of the persons responsible for running the firm, but also the financial promotions associated with that firm.<br><br>  
       The company should be able to meet its requirements at the point of application (i.e. systems controls and an identified responsible person). <br><br>  
       As part of this assessment, the FCA will also consider whether the company is carrying on “business in the UK”. The strict obligations have not changed, but because the assessment now includes the activity of approving financial promotions, the regulator may set a higher standard for requiring firms to be established in the UK to ensure supervisory oversight.  
       
     <p>The FCA website provides help with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/register">registration process</a> and <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/feedback-good-poor-quality-applications">feedback on good and poor quality applications</a>. Also, see here for our<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/analysis/the-fca-s-cryptoasset-aml-ctf-regime-applications-feedback-what-you-need-to-know/"> comments on the FCA’s “good and poor” quality applications</a>.&nbsp;</p>

This collaboration aims to facilitate the seamless swap of ONG to ONT, simplifying the user experience within the decentralized exchange. By working together, Ontology and iZUMi Finance are empowering users to navigate the world of decentralized finance and unlock new opportunities.</p><p>Alchemy Pay: To further enhance accessibility and usability, Ontology has partnered with <a href="https://alchemypay.org/">Alchemy Pay</a>, a leading crypto payment gateway. This collaboration offers convenient on-ramp solutions, as well as allowing users to seamlessly convert their digital assets into real-world purchases. By integrating Alchemy Pay’s payment infrastructure, Ontology users can enjoy frictionless transactions and expand the utility of their cryptocurrencies across a diverse range of merchants.</p><p>ONTO Wallet: Serving as the gateway to owning and controlling your decentralized identity (DID), <a href="https://onto.app/">ONTO Wallet</a> allows users to securely manage their digital identities across multiple platforms. With ONTO Wallet, individuals have full control over their personal data and can seamlessly interact with decentralized applications. It acts as a key component in realizing the vision of self-sovereign identity, putting users in charge of their digital presence.</p><p>Orange Protocol: Building on top of the robust foundation provided by <a href="https://ont.id/">ONT ID</a>, <a href="https://www.orangeprotocol.io/">Orange Protocol</a> takes decentralized identity a step further by introducing cross-chain reputation management. By leveraging the capabilities of ONT ID, Orange Protocol enables the establishment and verification of reputations across different blockchain networks. This breakthrough collaboration brings greater trust and transparency to the decentralized ecosystem, fostering a reliable environment for users and businesses alike.</p><p>These partnerships exemplify Ontology’s dedication to removing barriers for developers and users, making Web3 a more open and inclusive experience.

<p>In this final blog in a 3-part series developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.samhallskontraktet.se/">Samhällskontraktet</a>, we want to share some of the things that didn’t go so well in the process. This work is dense, difficult and emotionally demanding. We feel that it is important to acknowledge that, so that we can improve our own work and set realistic expectations for others who might want to build on&nbsp;it.</p>  Throughout these blogs we are using the word citizen to represent the people who live in a country rather than as a statement of nationality or legal&nbsp;status.   Blog 3 (of 3): learning into the&nbsp;future <p>Recently we have given talks about the Cornerstone Indicators at the <a href="https://bmw-foundation.org/en/our-work/releadershipfest/">RE*Leadership Festival </a>in Copenhagen and the <a href="https://creativebureaucracy.org/">Creative Bureaucracy Festival</a> in Berlin. This has been a great privilege, but has also highlighted how rare it is to hear anyone speak about what went wrong in their projects. If you read books and listen to talks describing the numerous wonderfully successful initiatives, you would be forgiven for thinking that everything is on track. Perhaps we should all just relax and feel confident that the knotty problem of urgent systemic change is under control? Except it isn’t and the problem space continues to intensify. It is for this reason that we want to embrace our vulnerability and appeal for help in strengthening and scaling this work. We haven’t quite got it right yet, but we believe the underlying ethos of everyday politics¹ is a foundational requirement in the race to reclaim our&nbsp;futures.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/es/@jontyson?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Jon Tyson</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> What did we&nbsp;learn? <p>Like anyone with an exciting new idea we quickly realised that not everyone would share our enthusiasm. People are busy. They also have their own ideas, value systems, constraints and goals. The five points that follow highlight some of the key challenges that we faced. We have also included some thoughts on how we might approach things differently in the future. We would be curious to know what you think or might&nbsp;suggest?</p><p>Local politicians: our initial assumption was that local politicians would be fully supportive of the project. This assumption came from a belief that the indicators we were planning to co-design, would be viewed as politically neutral and useful to multiple stakeholders. In reality, we found that there was an understandable level of resistance to the proposed strategy. This tension centred around concerns about raising unrealistic citizen expectations, together with potentially creating indicators that clashed with the mandates of elected politicians. In the future we plan to involve politicians early in the process with a quick initial survey about the project and then hold a workshop to explore their responses. We also think it will be important to clearly explain that the indicators chosen by their citizens will not conflict with their current policies and plans. Instead, encompassing the citizen’s views about wellbeing into their work should actually validate their actions. For example, if an indicator shows that citizens value cycling this does not mean that a new road cannot be constructed, but it would indicate that it should include designated cycling&nbsp;lanes.</p><p>Narrative: a strong learning point for us was the importance of having a clear and appealing narrative for the process that could be easily explained in a few sentences. We would suggest that future project leaders dedicate time early in the process, to think about who exactly their audience is and what success would look like. A further consideration is that there may be multiple narratives needed, for example one for the citizens and another for the local politicians.</p><p>Analytical rigour: we undertook both the EFA statistical analysis and the thematic mapping from the questionnaires and workshops ourselves. Within our team we have a talented statistician who was able to run this process for us, but we didn’t have the capacity to really drill into the finer detail. The initial results produced some interesting patterns that we think merit further investigation. In respect of the thematic analysis, we would acknowledge that our process could be strengthened to make it more robust and replicable for future teams. We would propose partnering with a university to develop this knowledge resource, so that results can be more effectively targeted to different scales of&nbsp;project.</p><p>Practical use: when we finished co-designing the indicators we realised that we hadn’t made detailed plans for how they would be used and monitored in practice. Whilst the process is important in its own right, we need a clearer pathway for how the indicators can be practically integrated into existing decision making structures. How for example could they be used to steer investment allocation decisions? Who should be responsible for keeping them up to date? How will the results be communicated to the citizens and what are the implications if they are getting better or&nbsp;worse?</p><p>Avoiding overload: we have been repeatedly asked why we are adding to the growing number of indicators that policy makers have to consider. This is understandable, because at a national level it is extremely difficult to continuously measure, consider and and compare data from multiple contexts. However, the Cornerstone Indicators are built on top of existing data points rather than creating new ones. Our challenge is therefore to make this interface function more easily understood, such as by presenting a clear link to existing frameworks such as the UN SDGs. In the future, we hope that we can develop this area of the work to create a natural mesh between citizen-led and state-led outcomes.</p><p>Despite the challenges outlined above, the energy and interest in the work is growing rapidly. This gives us the opportunity to really build and improve on this exploratory work. For example, we are endeavouring to address many of the above points in the design of the Canadian project. In Scotland, the focus of our work is to establish credible links from the ongoing community workshops back to policy making. We will share more about the progress of our work in both contexts later this&nbsp;year.</p> Some closing&nbsp;thoughts <p>At this point we are still grappling with a number of questions that we would like to invite others to join us in exploring:</p>  Are fully definable metrics (i.e. those that can be held to account) appropriate to quantify a thriving&nbsp;life?  <p>Recently we were approached by a colleague and asked how the Cornerstone Indicators could be used to set the targets for outcomes based investing. Our reaction was quite viscerally defensive, almost as if watching someone kick a small animal. This is interesting! One of the defining features of the Cornerstones is that they embody feelings and a sense of vitality that cannot be directly measured. We see this as hugely important in the fight against the commodification of life; the Cornerstones represent a numerical buffer against further elements of the natural world and human experience being sucked into financial targets.</p><p>2. How can we bridge existing capital (investment finance) into generalised vitality&nbsp;goals?</p><p>When we reduce living stocks and flows to a set of digits, financial accounts and budgets, we are creating an abstracted view of reality. If we can understand these tools as useful approximations then they clearly have merit, but more often than not we see them as hard, technical ‘truths’. When we look at the world in this way, it becomes harder to make good decisions. It also blocks investment into critical elements of society, such as preventative healthcare and coordinated climate adaptation infrastructure.</p><p>3. If GDP and the underlying profits that define it have driven us to the survivable edge of our current system, what is an appropriate goal for the next phase of human civilization?</p><p>In our opinion, anything less than collective thriving is an insufficient goal to strive for. This is both our motivation to continue this work and our challenge to you in&nbsp;yours.</p><p>We would welcome your thoughts and reactions and of course be delighted if you feel inspired to run a process in your own city or region.

<p>In this second blog in a 3-part series we are expanding on the reasons behind the Cornerstone Indicator initiative. We are also grounding the concept in the results from the first prototype process, that was developed and run in tri-partnership with <a href="https://www.samhallskontraktet.se/">Samhällskontraktet</a> and the citizens of Västerås, Sweden.</p><p>* Throughout these blogs we are using the word citizen to represent the people who live in a country, rather than as a statement of nationality or legal&nbsp;status.</p> Blog 2 (of 3) Going deeper: why are we calling for a global movement of citizen empowerment and what could it look&nbsp;like? <p>In our introductory <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-587c48ef16a0">blog </a>we made some bold statements about the need for widespread citizen involvement to drive the critical transitions ahead. Unfortunately the practices of community engagement and citizen participation are often viewed as soft options; a ‘nice to have’ in confirmation of existing policy initiatives or to inform small local decisions. We fundamentally reject this view for a number of&nbsp;reasons:</p><p>Firstly, our current power and governance dynamics are not working. Despite the numerous frameworks that set out aspirational aims (such as the UN SDGs), the unifying goal in our current system is still financial profit. Whilst on a personal level we might intrinsically consider factors such as health to be more important than financial profits, the political landscape has barely evolved to embed alternative metrics into critical decision making structures¹.</p><p>Secondly, many people are struggling to connect the challenges that they face in their daily lives to the structural issues that underpin them. This appears to be leading to increased levels of distrust and social fragmentation and consequently to previously unthinkable outcomes. For example, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2023/06/02/german-far-right-surges-in-polls-alarming-mainstream-parties">German polls</a> are showing that the neofascists of the AfD are the second most popular party in the country, whilst the corrosive effects of the <a href="https://www.institute.global/insights/geopolitics-and-security/three-years-brexit-casts-long-shadow-over-uk-economy">Brexit vote</a> continue to unfold across Europe. Despite Sweden being a country which still has high levels of trust in its government² and a strong welfare system, they too have recently elected a right wing government. People are looking for something different and a lack of viable alternatives is opening the door to widespread authoritarianism.</p><p>Thirdly, a clear observation is that prevalent wellbeing policy initiatives such as Scotland’s National Performance Framework, New Zealand’s Wellbeing Budget and Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index have been designed using a top down approach. Experts have defined the dimensions of wellbeing (e.g. life satisfaction, access to green spaces and education) and these factors are then measured using standardised and universally applied metrics. If the people with the lived experience of the policy decisions being made on their behalf have no say in how they are measured and interpreted, then it is hardly surprising that shock election results continue to roll&nbsp;in.</p><p>These issues are complex, but one way to understand the situation is to view it as an imbalance in the democratic triangle:</p>  The Market: markets create many positive outcomes (for example, innovation and employment) but business leaders are not voted in to make decisions on behalf of the citizens;  The Nation State: a country’s Government has the authority to make and enforce laws and this authority is granted by the citizens. It can therefore direct the market towards things that society needs but would not otherwise be profitable (such as subsidies for green energy or the development of new medicines) and away from undesirable outcomes (e.g. fines for pollution or abusing employment rights);  The Citizens: the people have the power to tell the government what they need to create a thriving society and thus how to use its authority to check and guide the&nbsp;market.  <p>There is an urgent need to displace the current extractive and exploitive GDP paradigm. In our view, this will only be achieved if the next generation policy instruments are anchored in the third, citizen based leg of the triangle. We hope that the Cornerstone Process can therefore provide a scalable stepping stone towards a civic-centred, ecologically viable and just&nbsp;economy.</p> What happened in&nbsp;Västerås <p>The Swedish prototype was run over a period of 9 months with the citizens of Skultana, which is a sub-district within the city of Västerås. The overall goal was to co-design simple, intuitively understandable indicators that encapsulate what thriving means to the people of Skultana. As is the case with any work centred on people, this process was both intensely rewarding and emotionally demanding. We will expand on some of the challenges that we faced (together with lessons for the future) in the <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-ade07d8f06d5">final blog</a> of this series. In summary the key steps were as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Statistical analysis: we used <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/exploratory-factor-analysis">Exploratory Factor Analysis</a> to explore data from existing wellbeing indexes such as the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/wise/measuring-well-being-and-progress.htm">OECD Wellbeing Framework</a>. This analysis highlighted a set of factors³ that have the greatest impact on wellbeing in Sweden (for example, safety and security, access to nature and good infrastructure).  Participatory insights: in parallel, we used an online survey and held a series of in-depth workshops to understand local priorities and views on the factors underpinning wellbeing. Findings included feeling safe, spending time with friends, family and animals and having the freedom to&nbsp;choose.  Thematic sensemaking: the outcomes of these two processes were combined to define clusters of wellbeing dimensions. Using these as a basis, we were then able to identify everyday experiences that could represent the complexity of the data points underpinning the different clusters.  Iteration: we used stories and visualisations to communicate these findings to the citizens. This allowed us to include their feedback and to adjust the suggested measures until we arrived at the final set of cornerstone indicators.  <p>There is a lot of detail behind the steps outlined above that we hope will be of use to others working in this area. A full report of the prototype project that was run in Västerås, Sweden can be <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">downloaded here</a>.</p> Unpacking the indicators <p>The Cornerstone Indicators provide an interface and balance point between scientific measurements and our human lived experience. They are not intended to be used as hard evidence. Similarly, we do not claim that each individual indicator will accurately represent the multiple factors included within it. To do so would be missing the point; the indicators exist to help us think, listen, reflect and learn. Ultimately they are a medium to help us understand our relationship with the world and thus to make better decisions.</p><p>The indicators have been designed to have a strong visual identity that can be understood across diverse contexts. Each indicator consists of an outer informatic frame and an inner intuitive visual:</p><p>Outer frame: the wheel shown below visualises the factors that were drawn from the different parts of the process. The spokes shaded in blue represent factors from the statistical analysis, those in green are from the citizen engagement and red shows the overlaps. The wheel is used as an outer frame in each indicator to allow a quick visual comparison.</p><p>Inner visual: we have then added playful drawings in the centre to express the experiences and feelings that the indicator encapsulates. For example, when you look at the following pictures, what is your instinctive response? How do they make you&nbsp;feel?</p><p>The full picture: when the outer frame and visual are combined, we can quickly get a sense of what is happening and which factors are included. Crucially, they create a quantitative definition to the full lived experience including latent, unmeasurable factors such as how people feel about the indicator itself.</p><blockquote>Example 1: The number of households who enjoy not owning a&nbsp;car</blockquote><p>The narrative here is inclusive climate action: people feel safe to mix, confident in public transport services, physically able to use active transport and empowered to act on the climate emergency.</p><p>Underpinning the story are multiple factors (for example, safety and security and a good work life balance) which can be further broken down into measurable data points such as crime rates and life expectancy.</p><blockquote>Example 2: Regularly doing a leisure activity with people you don’t cohabit&nbsp;with.</blockquote><p>In this example the theme is a balanced life: people feel empowered to enjoy their free time, to mix with others in the community and try new&nbsp;things.</p><p>Beneath the narrative we can identify factors such as a sense of belonging to place, health and wellbeing and personal autonomy. The measurable dimensions include metrics such as people having free time, the availability of cultural activities and life expectancy rates.</p> Our next&nbsp;steps <p>We are incredibly proud that the first Cornerstone Indicators are now being used in the city of Västerås. However, it is important to state that whilst the community indicators are an important element of the Cornerstone aspiration, they are not the end goal. Instead they are part of a longer journey to build the everyday politics of the future⁴. With this in mind we have started working in two additional international contexts, to expand and develop the wider civic Cornerstone Movement:</p>  In Scotland we have partnered with <a href="https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/">Carnegie UK</a> to develop an <a href="https://www.cornerstoneconversations.org/">online playbook</a> which enables diverse communities to run their own conversational workshops. This is currently being used in the Scottish Government’s <a href="https://carnegieuktrust.org.uk/publications/conversations-for-scotland-a-joint-response-to-the-review-of-national-outcomes/">call for evidence</a> as part of their review of the National Outcomes.  In Canada we are collaborating with the David Suzuki Foundation to design a multi-site, multi-year Cornerstone process across a diverse set of communities.  <p>The shared experience of working in partnership with the citizens of Västerås has been an incredibly rich experience. We have been inspired and humbled by the depth and generosity of people’s engagement with the project, and we will work hard to ensure that the final indicators become widely&nbsp;used.</p><p>We hope that this first step might inspire others to join us in playfully fighting for the future we will be proud to leave behind. In our next and <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-ade07d8f06d5">final blog</a> in this series we will share our key learning points and areas that we hope to build on in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you would like more information, or if you have any comments or suggestions on the process so&nbsp;far.</p><p>This blog was co-authored by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) and Linnea Rönnquist (<a href="http://linnea.ronnquist@mdu.se">linnea.ronnquist@mdu.se</a>)</p><p>References:</p>  In Scotland for example, the Government introduced the National Performance Framework in 2009 to set out its ambitions for society and the values that guide its approach. Despite this outcomes based framework being enshrined in legislation, a review in 2022 concluded that ‘the status of accountability against the NPF is at best “patchy” and that the NPF is not always actively used to shape scrutiny, funding decisions, and commissioning’ (<a href="https://scottishleadersforum.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/leadership-collective-responsibility-and-delivering-the-national-outcomes.pdf">Scottish Leaders&nbsp;Forum</a>)  <a href="https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2023-03/3.%20Svenska%20f%C3%B6rtroendetrender%201986-2022_0.pdf">https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2023-03/3.%20Svenska%20f%C3%B6rtroendetrender%201986-2022_0.pdf</a>  In this blog we are using the terms Factors and Dimensions to mean the following: Factors are things that contribute to wellbeing; for example good health, life satisfaction. Dimensions are elements that can be directly measured and contribute to the factors; e.g. levels of depression or mortality rates.  The term everyday politics refers to community centred activities that reconnect citizens with public&nbsp;life.   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Samhällskontraktet X Dark Matter Labs: The Cornerstone Indicators</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

We also give more details about the process that we have designed.

If you looked at the news when you woke up this morning you might have felt a strange yet familiar mixture of emotions. Frustration, hope, resignation, anger, empathy, anxiety, injustice, bewilderment? This feeling of disconnection between the issues that we are facing and what we (as individuals, organisations, communities and nations) can do about them was the underlying driver for this initiative. Our conviction is that meaningful change will only be achieved collectively via widespread citizen engagement. The escalating global situation is too complex and too important to be entrusted to niche system change experts, politicians or economists. The Cornerstone movement is therefore about reconnecting people to public life, to build shared agency and inspire positive civic action. It is a journey towards continuous, reciprocal national conversations that recognise both our shared fates and our collaborative potential. Of course, every journey begins with a first step; for us this involves communities being in dialogue about what it means to thrive and then collaboratively designing indicators to track progress.</p> What is unique about the Cornerstone Indicators? <p>There is certainly no shortage of frameworks and impact measures. In fact it sometimes feels like we are drowning in them! The Cornerstone Indicators were originally co-developed with <a href="https://katherinetrebeck.com/">Dr Katherine Trebeck</a> and have three key qualities that make them different:</p>  Streamlined: each indicator combines multiple data points into a single easily understandable format. For example, the number of people who would recommend their community as a place for others to move to, would represent underlying measurements such as crime rates, employment opportunities and&nbsp;schools.  Co-designed: the indicators are designed by the communities who will use them. This ensures that the things that matter to people, in their unique contexts, are the things that define&nbsp;success.  Intuitive: each indicator is visually appealing and intuitively understandable. When you see the image you can quickly form an impression of the underlying meaning without having to read the&nbsp;detail.   How are they developed? <p>The process combines statistical rigour with deep participatory engagement. This dual approach ensures that both the universal and contextual elements of wellbeing are carefully considered. In the first prototype initiative conducted in the Swedish city of Västerås, the citizens co-designed 5 Cornerstone Indicators which are illustrated below. We have also created a short PDF (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view">linked here</a>) which presents the indicators more fully. In <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Blog 2</a> of this series we will expand on the intention and details that underpin&nbsp;them.</p><p>We hope that this short introduction has piqued your interest and that you will continue to read the next blog in this series (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/samh%C3%A4llskontraktet-x-dark-matter-labs-the-cornerstone-indicators-5701e10c790d">Blog 2</a>).

 Digital payments are everywhere.  



<p>Whether we realize it or not, most of us have incorporated technology into our financial lives. According to the <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/eemea/en/newsroom/press-releases/press-releases/en/2022/august/mastercard-new-payments-index-2022-consumers-in-mena-embrace-digital-payments/">Mastercard New Payments Index</a>, which surveyed 35,040 general consumers across 40 markets, 85% of people globally have used at least one emerging payment method in the last year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the appeal is choice and simplicity. Consumers can buy a new refrigerator with a credit card, digital wallet or using an automatic buy-now-pay-later program. And they can perform most of their financial transactions from anywhere within a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet enabling consumers to bank and pay with ease is anything but simple. Banks and fintechs must carefully conceive and build payment technology stacks that are agile, user friendly and integrated with their organizations’ complex infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Platforms like <a href="https://www.i2cinc.com/">i2c</a> can help. A global banking and payment processing platform, i2c provides financial institutions and fintechs with “building block” technology to create their own unique consumer and commercial solutions. As a partner, the company relies on Mastercard Open Banking’s consumer-permissioned data to get the right information into the right hands, safely and quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent conversation at the Tech Innovation Roundtable in New York, Jess Turner, EVP, Global Open Banking and API and i2c CEO Amir Wain sat down with moderator Sherri Haymond, Head of Global Digital Partnerships, to explain how their collaboration works and why it matters:&nbsp;</p>



 What are the key market drivers that are leading to unprecedented demand for digital payments? 



<p>Jess Turner: The pandemic changed the way people interact with services and products, as well as the way they interact with each other. That change accelerated digitization faster than we expected, providing an opportunity for innovation. People expect more from their digital payment experience. And because of that, everything we do at Mastercard —whether it’s direct-to-consumer or business-to-business products—must have a best-in-class user experience.&nbsp;</p>







<p>&nbsp;Jess Turner and Amir Wain in conversation at the Tech Innovation Roundtable, Master Tech Center, New York</p>



 How does the partnership between i2c and Mastercard help deliver a best-in-class experience to fintech innovators?&nbsp; 



<p>Amir Wain: A significant component to the digital payment experience rests in the hands of banks and fintechs. These financial institutions provide consumers with the ability to bank, borrow and buy what they need. To make those services work seamlessly, a lot of connectivity needs to happen between Mastercard and service providers like i2c. Through our platform, banks and fintechs can access Mastercard capabilities —such as digitization, open banking and APIs—to extend those services to their end users. &nbsp;</p>



 How does open banking strengthen i2c’s platform offerings? 



<p>Amir: The basic tenets of payments—convenience, security and ubiquity—haven’t changed. Now open banking offers the right tools to keep us up to date with the new underlying digital technology, not to mention the consumer’s desire to interact with their finances differently. Through i2c, our clients can use open banking to help sign on new customers. Like mortgages, opening a bank account has largely been a manual process, one that required a lot of paperwork for banks and customers alike. But with open banking, customers can give permission to share their data digitally. &nbsp;</p>



 Jess, can you share other use cases in which open banking creates opportunities?&nbsp; 



<p>Jess: In addition to digital payments, another powerful example is that people can use open banking to get a loan for the first time in their lives. These are people who have been credit invisible or considered thin credit, perhaps because they have a low income, or they lack a credit history. Now they can share open banking data –such as bank transactions or rent payments— to prove they are creditworthy. And that could help a consumer qualify for a loan or empower a budding entrepreneur to kickstart their idea or a small business owner to invest in its growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking is also precise. At Mastercard Open Banking, we are working with permissioned data that we then must clean and categorize to verify things. So, if someone says they make $12.9 million dollars every year, we can check that quickly and accurately.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are you seeing in the landscape of digital payments that you are most excited about?&nbsp; 



<p>Amir: I look forward to seeing consumers benefit from even more payment choice. Different people need different kinds of products that are relevant to them. Cookie cutter products are a thing of the past. Expanding what you know about the totality of a customer through tools like open banking and AI enables the development of more personalized products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At i2c, we work with partners like Mastercard to enhance our building block technology that helps banks and fintechs offer differentiated products and elevated customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jess: I agree with Amir. Right now, these building blocks are critical for innovation because the world is becoming borderless. I am looking forward to seeing how our partnership with i2c will make real innovation happen at scale.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We recently announced our <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW10qzO">2023 State of Cloud Permissions Risks</a> report, which laid out some interesting and eye-opening findings on not just the expansion of cloud environments, but the increase in identity types accessing critical cloud resources. The report reveals interesting findings on why securing workload identities has become more critical than ever:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Workload identities now outnumber human identities 10:1—double that of 2021. This significant uptick introduces new security risks. 
 More than 80% of workload identities are inactive, double the percentage reported in 2021. 
 Workload identities are using less than 5% of their granted permissions. 
 Approximately 70% of workload identities have access to sensitive data. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exorbitant number of inactive workload identities and credentials represents an opportunity for significant risk reduction, especially given how many have high privilege permissions and operate across clouds. Inactive identities and stale credentials make easier targets for compromise and can generally be removed without impact, while expiring credentials can create outages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the whitepaper from Kuppinger Cole, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/cb05bfdbbdb25b6535a42835b77465e2#heading1">Securing Non-human Identities</a><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/reprints/cb05bfdbbdb25b6535a42835b77465e2#heading1">,</a> one significant change is the rapid growth in the number and types of non-human identities, including workload identities. It’s become increasingly difficult to ensure proper identity management to avoid exposure to business, security, and compliance risks. </p>
<p>To help resolve emerging issues with non-human identities, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/managing-governing-and-securing-identities-for-apps-and-services/ba-p/3402816">we launched Microsoft Entra Workload Identities in November 2022</a>. It allows organizations to configure conditional access, identity protection, credential policies, and access reviews for workload identities. This helps detect and remediate risks of workloads that may be acting differently than users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easily recognizing which identities have risky configurations or should be removed altogether is becoming crucial, so we‘re excited to announce a new feature—app health recommendations—within Microsoft Entra Workload Identities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 App Health Recommendations help enhance app hygiene 
<p>With more than 80% of workload identities inactive, visibility on these apps and services is crucial. The app health recommendations capability in Microsoft Entra Workload Identities provides insights and actionable guidance to help you secure your environments and avoid outages with recommended best practices. For example- addressing applications that haven’t been used for more than 30 days, removing unused application credentials, and renewing credentials that expire soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing unused applications and unused app credentials improves the security posture of a workload identity portfolio and promotes good identity hygiene. It reduces the risk of compromise- for example, by a bad actor discovering an unused application and abusing it. Depending on the permissions granted to the unused identity, this could lead to exposure of sensitive organizational data or enable lateral movement to further the actor’s objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Recommendations and how to address them 
<p>These new capabilities are available in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Azure AD recommendations</a>.&nbsp;Each recommendation has a description of the issue, the benefits of taking action, and an action plan with step-by-step remediation instructions. The three app health recommendations initially offered as a part of Microsoft Entra Workload Identities are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Unused applications 
 Unused application credentials 
 Expiring application credentials 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Status of a recommendation can be updated manually or automatically by the system. If all resources are addressed according to the action plan, the recommendation status automatically changes to ‘Completed’ the next time the recommendations service runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find this and determine your best course of action, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Go to the Azure AD or Microsoft Entra admin center and select Recommendations 
 Select a recommendation from the list to view the details, status, and action plan. 
 Follow the action plan. 
 If applicable, right-click on the status of a resource in a recommendation, select Mark as, then select a status.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Try app health recommendations today and align with best practices 
<p>As workload identities accessing cloud infrastructure continue to increase, it’s critical that organizations closely monitor their posture to reduce their risk of attacks and outages. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Web apps continue to grow in complexity. Front-end developers are expected to be experts in security and infrastructure just to get their apps deployed. It's time we change that.</p> How Did Web App Development Get So Complicated? <p>Over the last fifteen years, the complexity of putting a web app online has increased significantly. </p><p>Responsive design is required now that more browsers and device types have emerged. </p><p>Web apps are more feature-rich, and performance optimization is key. Users won’t stick around if it takes too long for their files to load. </p><p>The more features and complexity an app has, the more attack surfaces it has. Security is a big concern, and web app developers must educate themselves on various security vulnerabilities and employ best practices to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and defend against attacks. </p><p>Users expect real-time updates and collaborative features in web apps. This adds complexity to the overall architecture and requires data synchronization. </p><p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Front-end developers shouldn’t have to become full-stack super devs AND security experts. We can’t go back to the way the Web was before, but we can take computing paradigms from the past and engineer them with today’s advancements and know-how to build web applications that are resilient, reliable, and require no backend.</p> Local-First to the Rescue <p>There are plenty of ideological reasons why a developer would choose local-first - no centralized big tech companies holding user data hostage, less susceptible to censorship, etc. But there are also many practical reasons why a developer would opt to build local-first apps.</p><p>Since files are stored locally, users don't need to wait for a server to access their data and send it back to them. We've all experienced trying to use an app only to find that the server went down. This may annoy some, but it could devastate a business or app that relies on real-time data. In 2023, apps should be more resilient than this. Local-first means no waiting around and opens the door to edge computing products and services, like autonomous vehicles and health monitors.</p><p>It is vital that your app is encrypted and safe from hackers. An advantage to using a distributed system is that no central point of failure can be targeted. Many news reports have reported user data being stolen or held for ransom by bad actors. With local-first apps, the data never leaves the user's device, mitigating much of the risk. Marketers also love that it's compliant with <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>. </p> Fission's ODD SDK <p>The <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD App Template</a> with <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">WNFS</a>, our encrypted file system protocol, empowers developers to quickly build local-first, edge-ready applications without a complicated backend infrastructure. &nbsp;</p><p>In addition to solving the issues above, it enables real-time (as well as offline!) collaboration, even though it's a decentralized tool. This is possible because we use CRDTs to guarantee eventual consistency and authorize users with the capabilities-based <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/">UCAN</a> protocol.</p><p>The ODD App Template is responsive, so there is no need to fiddle with the CSS.</p> <p>If you'd like to learn more about simplifying your approach to building apps while keeping them robust and secure, check out the <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD.dev</a> site for templates, demos, and workshops.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Artificial intelligence has transformed the field of cybersecurity by enabling advanced threat detection, automated response systems, and improved overall defense strategies. Although it is considered a game changer in cybersecurity, the adoption of AI presents significant ethical challenges, bias, and the growing risk of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Ethics in AI is a topic that has been discussed for many years, but in today's context, AI is making decisions that directly impact people and organizations, and the importance of considering ethics is a must. A critical examination of the moral and societal implications of AI systems used for threat detection, intrusion prevention, and incident response constitutes AI ethics in the context of cybersecurity. There are five pillars of AI ethics to consider:</p>
 
 Fairness: It should be ensured that the AI model is fair to everyone - especially historically underrepresented groups. 
 Explainable: An AI model should be explainable in the sense that it should be possible to demonstrate to an end user how results and decisions are made, what data was used to curate the model, what methods were used, what expertise was required, and how the model was trained. 
 Robustness: It should be possible to assure end users that the model does not favor one person or segment over another.&nbsp; 
 Transparency: It is important to inform users that an AI model is being used to make decisions, and people and organizations should be able to access the metadata to learn more about the model and how their data is being used. 
 Privacy: An AI model should ensure privacy for all the parties involved. 
 
<p>It sounds good and feasible to achieve, but is it that simple?</p>
 Bias and Deepfakes: Cybersecurity Concerns 
<p>In cybersecurity, algorithmic bias in AI is an evolving concern. Due to their reliance on historical data, AI systems can replicate and amplify human biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. To ensure that security measures do not unfairly target certain groups, inadvertently undermine privacy, or perpetuate harmful stereotypes, it is critical to address bias in cybersecurity AI tools. Similarly, deepfakes pose a cybersecurity challenge because they use AI algorithms to manipulate or fabricate audio, video, or images, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between real and fake content. In the context of cybersecurity, deepfakes can be used to deceive individuals, impersonate high-level officials, or manipulate public sentiment, with potentially destructive consequences.</p>
<p>There are things that can be done to mitigate bias and deepfakes. From a technical perspective, developing AI algorithms that are less susceptible to bias is one possibility. Another requirement is to strive for fairness by including a representative level of diversity in model training data sets. Also, using techniques such as adversarial training to detect and counter deepfakes can improve the effectiveness and reliability of cybersecurity systems. Research and innovation in this area is essential to stay ahead of the curve. On the other hand, industry, academia, and society must work together to raise awareness of the ethical implications, biases, and threats that deepfakes pose to cybersecurity. Today, there are conferences, seminars, and public campaigns to promote knowledge sharing, best practices, and the responsible use of AI technologies. Governments and regulatory bodies also play a critical role in establishing ethical AI practices in cybersecurity. By establishing guidelines and standards, frameworks promote transparency and regular audits of AI systems to make it easier to detect and counteract bias.</p>
 A Long-term Journey 
<p>As AI continues to transform the cybersecurity landscape, it is important to proactively address the interrelated issues of ethics, bias, and deepfakes. It is possible to mitigate the potential risks associated with biased AI systems and the malicious use of deepfakes by taking a multi-pronged approach that incorporates technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and collaborative efforts. There is still much work to be done to create a safe and inclusive cybersecurity environment that protects individuals, organizations, and society by prioritizing ethical principles, promoting fairness, and using AI for the greater good. Most importantly, it is necessary to understand that the use of AI in business should augment human intelligence, and in no way replace it, which indirectly leads to transparent and accountable AI systems.</p>

<p>Pride month is a time when we celebrate the diversity of human identity and recognize the importance of embracing and honoring individuals for who they truly are. It is a reminder that everyone deserves to be seen, respected, and acknowledged, regardless of who they are, where they come from, who they love or how they pray.</p>
<p>Here at 1Kosmos, we believe that individuals should be recognized for who they are in both the physical and digital world. It’s in the way we run the business and in the products we build. That’s why we are so proud of having created a digital <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/iba-friday/nist-compliant-identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> platform that is fair and inclusive. Unfortunately, this hasn’t always been the case in the digital identity proofing world.</p>
<p>In the past, many identity proofing and authentication systems have excluded individuals by using technology with built-in decisioning bias, relying on AI that may not adequately represent the diversity of the population. This can exclude various segments of the population from accessing services intended for them. This is NOT how 1Kosmos solutions are built!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our solutions do not use AI facial recognition, but rather leverage anti-spoofing AI to establish a one-to-one facial match. Our innovative LiveID capability is certified to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">iBeta PAD-2</a>. In plain language, this short “selfie video” requires facial movements that can be randomized when matching an individual’s realtime likeness to that displayed on a verified credential. The result: the top rated NIST algorithm for non-bias racial and gender decisioning to drive objectivity, equity, and fairness into remote identification proofing benchmarked at 99.6% Target Accept Rate (TAR) and .01% False Accept Rate (FAR).</p>
<p>Unlike traditional methods that fail to recognize the nuances of individual identity by comparing facial characteristics in mass to an AI database, 1Kosmos adopts an innovative approach to identity proofing and authentication based on deterministic verification of an individual to truly identify the user behind a device rather than assuming identity based on how closely they resemble a static, unverified biometric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of relying on an external AI database, 1Kosmos utilizes government-issued identification documents and live biometrics to identify and authenticate individuals. At no time is an individual compared to others in a database. Their real, live biometrics and government issued IDs are used to verify their identities digitally, just as they would be verified in person, but without human error.</p>
<p>By employing this approach, 1Kosmos has established the most fair and inclusive identity proofing and authentication system to date. This system recognizes the multifaceted nature of identity and ensures that individuals are not excluded or denied access to digital services based on biased comparisons with AI trained by sample data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to promoting fairness and inclusivity, 1Kosmos prioritizes the security and user-friendliness of our identity proofing and passwordless authentication solutions. User data is securely stored on a private and permissioned <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/iba-friday/why-blockchain/">blockchain</a>, ensuring protection against unauthorized access and data breaches. The double encryption of data adds an extra layer of security to safeguard individuals’ personal information.</p>
<p>1Kosmos recognizes the importance of giving users control over their own personally identifiable information. In an era where data privacy concerns are at the forefront, 1Kosmos allows users sole access and control of their own data. This transparency empowers individuals to have a say in how their personal information is handled and used, instilling trust and confidence in the identity verification process.</p>
<p>As the annual celebration of Pride Month concludes this week, we will continue to advocate for inclusion and equality in our identity proofing and non-phishable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/multi-factor-authentication/">multifactor authentication</a> solutions. 1Kosmos is determined to set a new standard, prioritizing fairness, inclusivity, security, and user-friendliness. By embracing this innovative methodology, we take a step towards ensuring a more equitable future where everyone’s identity is recognized and respected – not just those who can afford the latest, expensive handsets.</p>

<p>A typical scene at a car enthusiasts motorhead event involves souped-up cars with their hoods propped open and a bunch of grease monkeys gathered around staring at the powerful V12 combustion engine. With the migration to electric cars it is probably a scene that will start to phase out over time. A bit like classical asymmetric cryptography!</p>
<p>There has been a lot of coverage on the anticipated advance of quantum computers: the boon they will bring to medicine, science, and chemistry; and the curse on IT security, with Shor’s algorithm sounding the death knell for traditional classic asymmetric cryptography, which underpins the security for most of what we do on the internet. For this blog post I decided to focus on some of the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) related activities that are going on as we speak, under-the-hood. I’m talking specifically about the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), who are tasked with preparing the public internet for a post-quantum world, figuring out how to retool and migrate the protocols and standards built on classical algorithms that we rely on extensively today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: &nbsp;NIST forms the nucleus of the PQC migration, surrounded by a shell of other standards bodies</p>
<p>First to provide a bit of context, it is worth reviewing where the IETF fits in to the PQC story. At the nucleus of figure 1 is National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Their ongoing competition tasked with identifying and standardizing on the PQC primitives has been well-documented. You might already be au fait with some of the short-listed PQC algorithms including SPHINCS+, CRYSTALS-Dilithium and CRYSTALS-Kyber, as well as XMSS and LMS, which are already NIST standards [SP 800-208]. The output of the NIST’s work will then be used by a shell of orbiting standards bodies such as the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), EMVCo, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the Wi-Fi Alliance®.</p>
<p>Outside of the NIST’s area of responsibility, updating the protocols and technologies that rely on cryptography deemed vulnerable to quantum attacks falls to each of the respective standards bodies to make them ready for a post-quantum world.</p>
<p>Consider the IETF, who own the specifications for many of the internet’s cryptographic and security protocols:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Some of the security protocols and standards maintained by the IETF</p>
<p>You might not recognize all of these protocols, but you should be at least vaguely familiar with TLS, SSH, HTTPS, TCP/IP, and DNSSEC, fundamental building blocks for internet communication and security. Fortunately, there is an opportunity to reuse and recycle. The protocols highlighted below are those that need to be retooled with PQC algorithms. The remaining protocols actually don’t need updating. They get their cryptography for free by embedding another PQ-safe protocol. So the list is perhaps less daunting than it first appears but still some non-trivial work lies ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: IETF security protocols and standards with those requiring PQC retooling highlighted</p>
<p>A couple of my Entrust colleagues, Mike Ounsworth and John Gray, are fully embedded in the IETF Working Groups. They have been working for the past 5 years on defining the standards for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs/">composite digital certificates</a>, utilizing a combination of classical and PQ cryptography. Last time I counted they have authored or co-authored 13 papers that will eventually define and specify how communication protocols operate in a post-quantum world – pretty cool stuff! They reported back from their recent IETF 116 session in Tokyo/Yokohama, Japan, where the general MO is “Hurry up and wait.” In essence it means get drafts of these protocols started, then put them in a holding pattern until final NIST specs for CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, SPHINCS+, and CRYSTALS-KYBER are standardized. As I chatted with my colleagues, one of the things that was clear is their appreciation for just how well-crafted and versatile the classical algorithms and APIs were. I’m referring to those which came from the pioneers of modern-day cryptography such as public key cryptography defined in the ’70s by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA), Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, and others. I imagine it is the equivalent of modern-day car designers gazing under the hood of a vintage E-Type Jaguar or Ferrari in appreciation of its design, power, and finesse. We’re talking about the nuts and bolts of cryptographic algorithms and APIs here: key transport, key agreement, key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), double ratchets, and 0.5 (round-time trips) RTTs! What the IETF working groups are finding is that some of the classic algorithm and mechanism properties are very hard to retain when migrating to PQC equivalents. It is proving challenging even for some of the sharpest minds in the industry. However, in a slow and steady pace they are making good progress.</p>
<p>One of the initiatives I learned about from Entrust’s participation in IETF 116 was our support for the new IETF PQUIP (Post-Quantum Use In Protocols) working group. The name PQUIP, a post-quantum spin on the word “equip” was actually coined by my colleague Mike Ounsworth. The PQUIP group was founded in Jan 2023 and recently had its first meeting at IETF 116. The PQUIP charter is here: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/">https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/</a> I know my Entrust colleagues are super proud to be founding and active members of this group focused on bringing the entire internet community together to share knowledge and best practices for how to integrate the new PQC algorithms into the myriad IT security protocols that we rely on every day. This is about mathematicians, subject matter experts, software engineers, and cryptographers coming together across academia and industry to pave the way for a smooth transition to PQ. Architecting the largest cryptographic migration that humanity has ever done is no small feat! It involves juggling security against ease-of-deployment for IT admins through often politics-ridden public discussion groups while under a tight and unforgiving deadline!</p>
<p>So far, the primary output of PQUIP is this document cataloging all of the PQC efforts across the IETF. Check out <a href="https://github.com/ietf-wg-pquip/state-of-protocols-and-pqc">https://github.com/ietf-wg-pquip/state-of-protocols-and-pqc</a> to see how much design work is involved. Also note the listing at the bottom “Security Area protocols with no PQC-specific action needed” referring to the protocols that will get PQC for free.</p>
<p>Eminent mathematician and PQC academic Michele Mosca when asked for his advice to enterprises on preparing for PQ said “make this about lifecycle management not crisis management.” I think it is fair to say that the IETF working groups are implementing those wise words, figuring out the tricky low-level stuff while we have time. I look forward to seeing the output of their good work in the coming months and years.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Sybil attacks present a distinct challenge in safeguarding the security and equilibrium of a system, among other types of cybersecurity threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advancement of modern technology has enabled malicious individuals to generate highly convincing fake, digital identities. Therefore, the difficulty in distinguishing between a malevolent bot and a genuine human being becomes especially challenging.</p>
<p>Even when targeting smaller online groups or individuals, counterfeit digital duplicates can inflict significant harm. On a larger scale, within a private system, the infiltration of these malicious replicas can lead to catastrophic consequences. Not only do they endanger individual security, but their calculated intentions have the potential to disrupt the overall security and equilibrium of the entire system.</p>
<p>To combat this issue, SelfKey is aiming to develop decentralized solutions that may prevent the unauthorized access of these malicious bots to private online accounts and systems. By harnessing the very technology used to create fraudulent identities, SelfKey's online security methods aim to counterattack Sybil attacks and establish a secure digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>This article provides an in-depth exploration of Sybil attacks and their detrimental impact on the security of digital spaces. Additionally, we’ll elaborate on how SelfKey strives to reinstate security and balance to private accounts and systems.</p>

 Sybil Attacks: The horrifying truth 
 In a nutshell 
<p>According to literature, Sybil attacks are a method of network-based attacks in which a perpetrator creates multiple fake identities or accounts to gain control or influence over a system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the term "Sybil" comes from the book "Sybil" by Flora Rheta Schreiber, which portrays a case of multiple personality disorder. In the context of digital security, this refers to a multitude of counterfeit identities which may be controlled by one, single, malicious individual.</p>
 What happens in a Sybil attack? 
<p>During this kind of cyber attack, bad players create numerous fake identities, also known as Sybil nodes or Sybil identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perpetrators then use them to deceive a network or system into believing that each identity represents a unique and independent user. By controlling multiple identities, the attackers can manipulate the network's behavior, disrupt its operation, or undermine its security.</p>
 Who do they target? 
<p>Sybil attacks are commonly associated with decentralized systems, such as peer-to-peer networks or blockchain networks. Here, participants rely on the assumption that each identity is unique and represents a distinct user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating a large number of Sybil identities, an attacker can:</p>
 
 gain disproportionate influence. 
 compromise consensus mechanisms. 
 launch various malicious activities, such as spreading misinformation, performing <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/">Distributed Denial of Service</a> attacks, or controlling a majority of voting power. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks can be challenging since traditional identification methods may not be effective in decentralized systems that rely on pseudonymous identities. Mitigation strategies often involve:</p>
 
 implementing reputation systems. 
 proof-of-work mechanisms. 
 identity verification protocols to establish trust and distinguish between legitimate users and Sybil nodes. 
 
<p>Overall, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. Therefore, robust security measures and consensus algorithms are necessary to prevent or minimize their impact.</p>
 The dreadful consequences of Sybil Attacks 
<p>Sybil attacks can be highly dangerous to digital systems, especially in decentralized networks or systems that rely on trust and consensus. Some reasons why Sybil attacks are considered a significant threat include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
 Undermining Consensus&nbsp; 
<p>In decentralized networks, like blockchains, where consensus is essential for maintaining integrity and security, a Sybil attack can disrupt the process. By controlling multiple identities, malicious individuals may manipulate voting or decision-making processes. And this may potentially lead to false consensus or control over the network.</p>
 Disrupting Network Operations 
<p>Sybil attacks can disrupt the normal operation of a network or system. For instance, an attacker may flood the network with fake identities, overwhelming the resources and causing performance degradation or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
 Spreading Misinformation 
<p>Bad players can leverage Sybil identities to spread false information or manipulate the perception of consensus. By taking control of a significant number of identities, they can amplify their influence and create the illusion of broad support for malicious content.</p>
 Exploiting Trust and Reputation Systems 
<p>Many digital systems rely on trust and reputation systems to establish credibility and make informed decisions. During a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create a large number of fake identities with positive reputations. This way, they may mislead others into trusting them and granting them privileges they shouldn't have.</p>
 Security Risks 
<p>Lastly, Sybil attacks can compromise user security. For instance, if a Sybil attacker gains control over multiple identities, they may have access to sensitive user information, financial data, or private communications. Horrifyingly, this may lead to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a>, fraud, or unauthorized access to personal accounts.</p>
<p>Because the consequences of Sybil attacks can be devastating to a decentralized system, it’s crucial for certain security measures to be implemented, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identity verification protocols. 
 Reputation Systems. 
 Proof-of-Work mechanisms. 
 Consensus algorithms that incentivize honest behavior. 
 
<p>By doing so, individuals may help minimize the risks and consequences of Sybil attacks, before they corrupt whole systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of all these security methods, though, developing strong defenses against Sybil attacks remains a continuous challenge. Therefore, constant vigilance and research are necessary to ensure the security and integrity of digital systems.</p>
 Ways in which Sybil attacks may occur 
<p>Unlike other methods of cyberattacks, which target one type of individual in particular or have a single scope, Sybil attacks can occur in many ways, with many specific purposes. Let us examine a few of them.</p>
 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks 
<p>In this type of attack, malicious individuals can create multiple Sybil nodes and use them to flood a target system or network with requests. This process can overwhelm the system’s resources and cause it to become unresponsive. And, by controlling a large number of identities, the attackers can amplify the impact of the attack.</p>
 Influence Manipulation in Social Networks 
<p>In social networks, attackers can create multiple fake profiles and use them to manipulate discussions, spread propaganda, or artificially inflate the popularity of certain content. Because they can appear as different individuals, the attackers can exert undue influence and manipulate the perception of consensus.</p>
 Blockchain Network Attacks 
<p>In blockchain networks, malicious individuals may create numerous Sybil identities to gain control over the consensus process. By controlling a majority of identities or computing power (known as a Sybil attack on proof-of-work), the attackers may:</p>
 
 manipulate transaction verification. 
 double-spend coins. 
 launch other malicious activities that undermine the security and integrity of the blockchain. 
 
 Spamming and Reputation Manipulation 
<p>In online platforms that rely on reputation systems, such as e-commerce or review websites, an attacker can create multiple Sybil accounts to spam or manipulate ratings and reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the aid of numerous, fake identities, the attacker can artificially inflate or deflate the reputation of products, services, or individuals. And, this way, they can mislead other users and affect their decision-making.</p>
 Influence in Online Voting Systems 
<p>In online voting systems or opinion polls, attackers may create multiple Sybil identities to sway the results by casting multiple votes or skewing the perception of public opinion. In doing so, the perpetrators can distort the outcome and compromise the integrity of the voting process.</p>
<p>These examples shed a light on how Sybil attacks can be used to manipulate, disrupt, or deceive various digital systems. Preventing and minimizing these attacks often requires implementing strong security measures, such as:</p>
 
 identity verification protocols. 
 reputation systems. 
 consensus mechanisms that can differentiate between genuine users and Sybil nodes. 
 
 Sybil Attacks against Decentralized Systems 
 A brief introduction to Decentralized Systems 
<p>Decentralized systems are computing or network architectures in which authority, control, and decision-making are distributed among multiple nodes or participants. This comes in stark contrast to centralized systems, in which a single entity or central server has authority.</p>
<p>In decentralized systems, no single entity has complete control or ownership over the entire system, and participants collaborate to achieve shared goals.</p>
 Why do Sybil attacks target decentralized systems? 
<p>Sybil attacks specifically target decentralized systems because these systems rely on the assumption that each node or participant represents a unique and independent entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By creating multiple fake identities, or Sybil nodes, malicious players can exploit the inherent trust and consensus mechanisms of decentralized systems. And this, in turn, could lead to various malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us discuss a few reasons why Sybil attacks are particularly effective against decentralized systems.</p>
 1. Exploiting Consensus Mechanisms 
<p>Decentralized systems often employ consensus mechanisms to achieve agreement among participants. Sybil attacks can undermine these mechanisms by creating a large number of fake identities that skew the consensus process. This way, attackers can manipulate voting, decision-making, or transaction verification, compromising the integrity and security of the system.</p>
 2. Gaining Disproportionate Influence 
<p>What’s commonly known about decentralized systems is that they strive to give equal power and influence to each participant. However, in a Sybil attack, a perpetrator can create numerous Sybil nodes, effectively giving them disproportionate influence over the system. This can enable the attacker to exert control, manipulate perceptions, or disrupt the normal operation of the network.</p>
 3. Exploiting Trust and Pseudonymity 
<p>Many decentralized systems rely on pseudonymous identities to protect user privacy. Unfortunately, this anonymity also creates opportunities for Sybil attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malicious individuals can create multiple fake identities that are almost indistinguishable from legitimate ones. And using these, they can deceive others into trusting them and granting them privileges or access they shouldn't have.</p>
 4. Undermining Network Resilience 
<p>Decentralized systems often emphasize resilience and fault tolerance. But, a Sybil attack can compromise these attributes by flooding the network with fake identities.</p>
<p>An attacker can overwhelm resources, disrupt communication, or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, undermining the stability and availability of the system.</p>
<p>Due to these factors, Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to decentralized systems. In turn, this highlights the importance of implementing strong security measures, to prevent and reduce the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 SelfKey’s Defense against Sybil Attacks and Malicious AI 
<p>The significance of digital security is amplified in decentralized systems, given the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities they entail. Some crucial aspects that require strong security measures in decentralized environments include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 preserving data integrity. 
 upholding consensus integrity. 
 mitigating network threats. 
 safeguarding digital assets. 
 fostering trust among participants. 
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks in decentralized systems can be challenging, but there are several measures that can help mitigate the risk. Let us discuss some strategies which may prevent Sybil attacks.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>The first step is implementing strong identity verification mechanisms to ensure that participants in the decentralized system are unique and authentic individuals. This can include verification through trusted third parties, KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, or reputation systems that assess the trustworthiness of participants based on their past behavior.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a possible solution to combat identity theft and digital duplicates. SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) to detect fake, AI-generated digital identities and identity thieves, which could considerably lower the risks associated with Sybil attacks.</p>
 Sybil Resistance Mechanisms 
<p>Another important step is to design the decentralized system with built-in Sybil resistance mechanisms. These mechanisms aim to make it difficult or costly for attackers to create and control a large number of fake identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of Sybil resistance mechanisms include proof-of-work or proof-of-stake protocols, where participants must provide computational resources or stake tokens to participate in the system.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a>, members may mint SELF tokens as a part of the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-id-poi-staking/">proof-of-individuality staking</a> protocol. Again, this is developed utilizing the power of AI to gain more accurate and quick results, as AI can read and analyze patterns which may be impossible for the naked human eye to detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through this process, SelfKey aims to prevent duplicate accounts, malicious bots, or identity thieves from accessing private accounts or systems. Staking, in this context, is done solely with the purpose of increasing digital security.</p>
 Reputation Systems 
<p>Implementing reputation systems that track and evaluate the behavior of participants in the decentralized system is another crucial step. Reputation systems can help identify suspicious or malicious activities, making it harder for attackers to blend in and gain influence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants with positive reputations may be given more privileges, while those with negative reputations may be subject to additional scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this purpose, SelfKey has developed an <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">engagement system</a> which offers active members the opportunity to mint SELF tokens for their contribution to the DAO.</p>
 Consensus Algorithms 
<p>Consensus mechanisms like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">Proof of Stake</a> (PoS) or <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/practical-byzantine-fault-tolerancepbft/">Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> (PBFT) can require participants to prove ownership of a significant stake. Additionally, they may require them to demonstrate a high level of computational resources. This may make it more challenging for attackers to create a large number of identities and control the network.</p>
 Randomized Node Selection 
<p>Another method which may be efficient in preventing Sybil attacks is to incorporate randomized node selection in the network's protocols and algorithms. By randomly selecting nodes for tasks, such as voting or validation, the likelihood of multiple fake identities controlled by the same attacker being chosen is reduced, making Sybil attacks less effective.</p>
 Network Monitoring and Analysis 
<p>Analyzing network traffic, node behavior, and communication patterns can help identify patterns that are indicative of Sybil attacks. Therefore, employing network monitoring tools and techniques to detect unusual or suspicious activities is crucial.</p>
 Community Engagement and Auditing 
<p>Lastly, encouraging active participation from the community in detecting and reporting potential Sybil attacks is vital. It’s also important to conduct regular audits and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities and address them promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging the community can create a collaborative effort to identify and mitigate the risk of Sybil attacks.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that preventing Sybil attacks entirely is challenging, and a combination of preventive measures is often necessary. The specific prevention techniques employed will depend on the nature of the decentralized system, its objectives, and the potential threat landscape.</p>
<p>What’s vital is for the community to work together and for members of a DAO to be consistently active. Not only to keep the DAO alive, but also to protect their common goals and the security and balance of the system they are a part of.</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO aims to become a digital environment which may offer both security and convenience. By utilizing the amazing potential of AI, and with the contribution of its participants, SelfKey strives to prevent cyber threats that threaten the security and balance of our digital future.</p>

<p>The verifiable data landscape has experienced exponential growth in recent years, with the pace of innovation accelerating rapidly. Within this dynamic landscape, the presence of competing standards poses an interoperability challenge. To address this issue, Veramo was designed to offer flexibility, modularity, and scalability. It empowers developers to create a customized system from a growing list of standards, without concerns about interoperability or fast-changing specifications.</p><p>Competing standards can burden product owners and developers, who prefer to avoid vendor lock-in or invest extensive resources in building upon standards that are prone to change. However, this should not prevent businesses from bringing the immense value of verifiable data to their users. Over the past year, we’ve been working with a growing community, to build an ecosystem of interoperable functionality made possible through specialized community plugins that respect open standards.</p> Our Story <p>Veramo was born out of the uPort project (now defunct). uPort, which started at ConsenSys in 2015, entered the self-sovereign identity landscape during its early stages. Back then, self-sovereign identity was primarily theoretical, lacking standards and practical implementations. Undeterred, uPort took the initiative and developed its first architecture using smart-contract-based identities.</p><p>As time passed, the limitations of on-chain identities became evident as maintaining compatibility across various technology stacks (web, mobile, backend) hindered rapid iteration, which is crucial in a rapidly evolving standards landscape. In 2021, uPort embarked on developing the next architecture iteration, which was internally referred to as DAF (DID Agent Framework) — which would later become&nbsp;Veramo.</p><p>Our primary goal was to create a flexible, modular and extensible architecture that dApp developers could use as a base layer for using decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. Our mission is to empower developers to build better trust layers in their applications irrespective of any particular tech stack or&nbsp;vendor.</p> Why Open&nbsp;Source? <p>There are some reasons why organizations and projects choose to go the open-source route but for us, three (3)&nbsp;things:</p>  Community First: We were open from the start, even before being close to done because we wanted to connect with other projects and collaboratively build a product that the community loves.  Trust in the code: If the code is open source, it is easier for people to trust that their data is safe, and not uploaded to a certain server without consent. Since trust is one of the things that web3 seeks to achieve, building an open and transparent community will ensure that our users can fully trust in the project, and contribute to steering its direction as&nbsp;well.  Collaboration over competition: In a regulated industry, organizations focus on intellectual property software. However, as an open-source project, the competitive line is blurred, and we can all come together to form an ecosystem building the future of identity. We maintain a “Found a bug? Need a feature? Bring along” ambience and it benefits the whole ecosystem.   Where we are&nbsp;today <p>Veramo has experienced tremendous growth over the past year, with a vibrant and engaged community of users and contributors. With over 300 stars on GitHub and thousands of weekly downloads, Veramo is becoming an essential tool for developers in building decentralized Identity into their applications without having to build from scratch or bother with the changing standards.</p><p>You have the opportunity to shape the future of identity, by getting involved. You can start by leaving a star on our <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo">project repo</a>, providing valuable feedback on GitHub, participating in discussions on our <a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">Discord server</a>, or testing new and existing features, your input is invaluable.</p> What Next? The Future of Decentralized Identity <p>As we look ahead, the future of decentralized identity holds immense promise and potential. Veramo, as an open-source project, is hands-on-deck in shaping this future, driving innovation, and empowering developers to build better trust layers in their applications. Let’s take a closer look at what this could&nbsp;mean:</p><p>Enhanced Privacy and Security: Decentralized identity puts individuals in control of their data, allowing them to selectively share information while maintaining their privacy. As technology evolves, we can expect even stronger encryption and privacy measures to ensure that user data remains secure and protected.</p><p>Seamless Interoperability: The issue of competing standards and interoperability challenges within the verifiable data landscape is being actively addressed. Veramo’s modular architecture enables developers to navigate this complexity effortlessly, integrating multiple standards and protocols into their applications. The future will bring further advancements in interoperability, making it easier for different systems to communicate and exchange verifiable data seamlessly.</p><p>Mainstream Adoption: Decentralized identity is gradually gaining recognition and acceptance in various industries and sectors. From finance to healthcare (<a href="https://www.caro.vc/">Check out the CARO project by Spherity</a>), supply chain management to social networks (<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/">Bluesky</a>), decentralized identity has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with digital services and entities.</p><p>Empowerment and Inclusion: Decentralized identity has the power to empower individuals by providing them with ownership and control over their digital identities, bridging the identity gap, and enabling underserved populations and marginalized communities to access essential services and opportunities.</p><p>In conclusion, the landscape of decentralized identity is dynamic and ever-evolving. New technologies, standards, and protocols will emerge, pushing the boundaries of what is possible. As an open-source project, we will continue to adapt and incorporate these advancements, ensuring that developers have the tools they need to stay at the forefront of innovation.</p><p>Join us on this exciting journey as we pave the way for a future where individuals have control over their digital identities and trust is embedded in every interaction.</p><p><a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">Join our Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/veramolabs">Follow us on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo">Check us out on Github</a> | <a href="https://veramo.io">View our&nbsp;website</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veramo/open-source-for-greater-good-why-we-chose-to-make-veramo-open-source-d335fbda3bf">Open Source for Greater Good: Why we chose to make Veramo Open Source</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veramo">Veramo</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As consumers, we’re increasingly attracted to websites that ask for less information, not more. Imagine your hair trimmer is not doing the job it used to do when it was brand new. Should you buy a new one? Of course not, let’s get a blade replacement instead. Often, such parts are not available from your usual ecommerce sites. After searching and comparing prices through websites, you find a good deal on an online shop. However, you’ve never heard of this shop before, but it looks trustworthy. Once the part is added to your basket, you proceed to the checkout and what you see makes you cringe: a long form that asks not only for your name, email and postal address — which would be reasonable—but also age, gender, phone number, marital status, and date of birth as mandatory fields.</p>
<p>The result is simple: you close that browser tab and go to another shop. These days, increasingly more online businesses realise that the opposite is more likely to result in a sale: they ask for as little data as possible.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, there is a solution that not only removes the user’s pain but also provides more in-depth customer analytics over time. Its name? Progressive profiling.</p>
 What is progressive profiling? 
<p>Progressive profiling is a technique in which a business collects users’ data incrementally, during different touchpoints of the customer’s journey. The goal is to build and constantly update a profile for every user, to enable a customised user experience. Let’s bear in mind that the customer journey starts from the first visit (unknown, anonymous user), next becoming a customer, continuing to upselling, and only ending if the user account is deleted.</p>
<p>To convert and retain customers, a company aims to go from knowing almost nothing about the user, to building a detailed user profile. All this can be accomplished without violating the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other similar stringent regulations.</p>
<p>Building (and maintaining) a user profile takes several steps, which may include forms to download an asset, user registration, questions with an incentive, surveys, etc.</p>
<p></p>
 Benefits of progressive profiling 
<p>Progressive profiling offers benefits for both users and companies. Let’s review the strongest.</p>
 
 Improved user experience
 
 Reduced customer frustrations. Asking users for their data all at once is not only time-consuming but perceived as aggressive by most people. I think all of us has had such an experience, got annoyed and decided not to come back to that service. By asking for information bit by bit, and with the right incentive in place, users will be much more willing to provide additional information. 
 Improve the onboarding process. If a visitor decides to create a user account for your service, you will have some of their data already available, so instead of asking again you can shorten the user registration. Alternatively, after account setup, you can ask a couple of questions to enrich that user profile. But keep those questions optional so they don’t feel obliged to share that data with you. 
 Personalise the buyer’s journey. As a result of building a good user profile, your company will be able to personalise every step of the customer journey. 
 
 
 Increased security and data protection
 
 Minimise the impact of a potential data breach. In the unfortunate event of a data breach, the less data a company has in its data repository, the smaller the damage. Don’t collect data you don’t need, and progressive profiling helps you achieve that from the start. 
 Be an ally for security awareness. Another reason people don’t like putting information in forms is because they are becoming more aware that the data can be misused. Show that your company is careful about its customers’ personal data. 
 
 
 Marketing benefits
 
 Helps update and strengthen user profiles. Typically, a user profile is created at the time a person registers for a service. Within months, this data can become outdated. What if your company decides to launch a great campaign to send a gift or greetings card to your users, only to realise that more than half of your users’ postal addresses are empty, wrongly typed, or outdated? Well, not many of your customers will be delighted as you expected. Nobody wants to miss out on great experiences. 
 Increased conversions. By collecting only information that is necessary and relevant to the customer experience at hand, the customers will be less likely to abandon your form or page and instead press the Submit button. 
 
 
 
 Keep it clear and simple 
<p>When presenting requests for more information, always present the reason for collecting the additional information in terms of the user benefits. Provide easy access to the relevant data processing and privacy policies.</p>
<p>Where possible, make the data collection as quick and easy as possible, such as structuring questions in a yes or no format, or a choice of 1 to 3 options for quick selection.</p>
 Why CIAM is better than marketing tools for progressive profiling 
<p>Most marketers talk about progressive profiling as merely a marketing topic and preach that the magic solution is buying an advanced marketing tool. From a marketing tools perspective, progressive profiling is often applied to leads, from a person’s first interaction through to becoming a customer. In this marketing world, it’s mostly about filling data in forms, sometimes surveys, in which the customers enter more personal data themselves. The purpose is to convert a form visitor to lead to customer. Progressive profiling is clearly advertised as an advanced feature in marketing tools, available only in premium plans or the exclusive products in the portfolio.</p>
<p>But is progressive profiling something that can be achieved with just a marketing tool? Not really. For progressive profiling to become magic, it needs a few spells of Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM).</p>
<p>From a CIAM systems perspective, progressive profiling is applied to registered users who can already log in to one or many services. A login session is the key here. Those users can be leads or converted customers.</p>
 Some advantages of using a CIAM solution for user profiling: 
 
 Marketing tools can’t use attributes from an identity provider. As the user is never authenticated, data must always be entered by the user themselves. Instead, an authenticated user brings to the relying party (the service) at least a few attributes from the identity provider: first name, surname, email, country etc. The list depends on how the identity provider’s system administrator has configured its attribute release policies. 
 You can use a user verification tool to improve the accuracy of a user’s data. If users enter personal attributes for themselves, how do we know if such data is accurate? When users authenticate with a high level of assurance method such as a national e-id, your service can add new verified attributes and correct inaccurate data. 
 Profile differently based on the user’s level of assurance. If more than one authentication method is enabled in the login pages, the service can trigger different questions if the user is authenticated by social media or a bank-based authenticator app. 
 Follow through devices. Marketing tools cannot add more data to the same user’s profile if this person has logged in with different devices. What if the user frequently switches between a laptop, tablet, mobile phone? The cookies are set up in the browser per device. Instead, an authenticated user will be the same regardless of which device is used. Your service can trigger progressive profiling at any touchpoints, whenever the right time comes. 
 
 Can marketing and CIAM join forces? 
<p>If at the time the user creates an account, this person already exists as a lead in the marketing automation platform (or mail automation), the user registration workflow – which is powered by the CIAM system — can make a backend call to synchronise the identity with the already collected data. With the user’s permission, it is also possible to link the new account to an existing browser history on a device, even if created before user registration or a logged in session. This allows wider insight into the same user’s behaviour across all their devices.</p>
<p>All in all, progressive profiling is a powerful technique that helps companies in both their business and security goals. The best way of achieving progressive profiling is putting CIAM into the equation.

<p>The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables the creation of an open identity infrastructure that allows parachain projects to delegate identity management to other parachains that provide identity solutions. As DIP can be easily integrated into systems that can communicate via XCM (the cross-consensus message format), this also extends beyond the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> The Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Provider <p>With increasing regulation worldwide, a reliable and trustworthy identity component is becoming even more critical.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) protocol is a decentralized alternative to OpenID — an industry-standard protocol that allows the delegation of user’s identity management and verification to trusted third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>DIP allows any blockchain that supports XCM (cross-consensus messages) to delegate users’ identity management and verification to one or more third-party identity providers, such as KILT Protocol.</p><p>As part of the integration process, an XCM channel would be opened between the integrating parachain and the identity provider, allowing the parachain to verify identities existing on that provider. In this way, for example, an identity built on KILT can also be used across other chains that choose to use KILT as their identity provider.</p><p>In other words, a user with a KILT identity can use this identity to log into any dapp and authenticate transactions on any parachain that integrates DIP — for example, they could use the same identity across Astar, Frequency, Zeitgeist, etc.</p> DIP Actors <p>DIP has three&nbsp;roles:</p>  The identity provider: A blockchain that has an identity system in place and makes it available for other chains to use, for example, KILT Protocol.  The identity relying party: A blockchain that has chosen to delegate identity management to the provider.  The user: An entity that has an identity on the provider chain and wants to use it on other chains without setting up a new identity on each of&nbsp;them.   The Tech <p>The following components are currently available for integration to enable cross-chain decentralized digital identities:</p>  A pallet for deployment on identity providers. The pallet allows entities on these systems to bridge identities of given subjects to a destination, and manages the entire XCM communication with that destination.  A pallet for deployment on identity relying parties. The pallet provides other pallets in the runtime with a DIP origin and manages the entire XCM communication with the identity providers. The DIP origin contains identity provider-specific information. For example, in KILT this includes DID signature verification.  Support crates, suitable for use within an identity relying party’s runtime, including common type and trait definitions.  <p>DIP integrates with existing runtimes with minimal changes. This&nbsp;means:</p>  The fee model of the relying party remains unchanged.  The identity subject only needs a wallet to generate a signature and does not necessarily need to submit the transaction and pay the fees (subject to specifications of the relying party / provider)  The relying party only needs to perform per-transaction origin verification to have access to the identity of the submitter, as defined by the identity provider.   Why Integrate KILT as an Identity Provider? <p>KILT provides practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standards</a>, identity on KILT begins with a unique <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> generated by the user on their device and anchored to the KILT blockchain. This DID can be customized with a user-friendly web3name that provides a 1:1 link to the DID. <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> from trusted entities can then be added to the DID, building the identity. These credentials are stored on the user’s device in their wallet, under their control. They decide who to share them with, and how much information they want to share (selective disclosure).</p><p>For a parachain, integrating DIP with KILT results&nbsp;in:</p>  Less effort: The parachain doesn’t have to build and maintain its own identity solution as identity management and verification is handled by&nbsp;KILT.  Focus: Parachains can focus on what they do best without having to worry about identities.  Risk mitigation: The parachain doesn’t have the risks stemming from managing and storing users’ identities.  Access to the KILT user base: Parachains can gain access to the identity information graph composed of all existing KILT’s&nbsp;users.  <p>For builders and users, additional KILT benefits&nbsp;include:</p>  Portable identities: The parachain users just need to create and maintain a single identity on KILT and use it on all supporting chains.  Support for unique <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/web3names/">web3names</a>. Enabling cross-chain identity means that these web3names are usable anywhere they are supported.  Support for <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/develop/sdk/cookbook/account_linking/account-link">cross-chain account linking</a>. These accounts have explicitly been linked to the DID by the DID subject. Polkadot and Ethereum are currently supported, with more chains&nbsp;planned.  Support for verifiable credentials and service endpoints will be included in the next&nbsp;phases.   OpenID <p><a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> has become the industry standard, with Facebook, Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Auth0 as the most well-known providers, making OpenID very centralized.</p><p>In addition to providing a decentralized alternative to OpenID, DIP can potentially also be used in conjunction with OpenID in future iterations: the OpenID community is already pushing for the integration of W3C DIDs and verifiable credentials, and are working on the specifications.</p><p>If integrated, any website that relies on OpenID as the authentication method could start accepting users that own a DID and present requested credentials.</p><p>All the building components to implement these features are already available and ready to use in the KILT&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This development is a huge milestone for the intersection between Web2 and Web3, moving blockchain and decentralized identity into the real world and giving control of identity back to the person it belongs&nbsp;to!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world, while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/one-identity-across-all-parachains-using-kilt-infrastructure-c87b1115fe64">One Identity Across All Parachains Using KILT Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digital-first, but not digital only! This is what we found consumers prefer based on a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">recent survey</a> of 1,000 consumers in the United States.</p>
<p>This survey (<a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic">see this infographic</a>) generated unique insights around the state of the American consumer, including their preferred ways to pay and which digital banking innovations excite them the most.</p>
<p>We learned that consumers ask for digital experiences, but not exclusively digital: Indeed, physical cards are still widely utilized and will remain a valuable tool for for issuers looking to provide a complete payments experience.</p>
<p>The survey showed that consumers continue to prefer physical payment cards in-store (69%), while 14% prefer using a digital wallet (Apple Pay or Google Pay, for example). Another 14% of respondents prefer paying with cash. Even so, digital payment experiences and digital touchpoints are very relevant to the consumer. Read <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/12/are-mobile-banking-and-payments-capabilities-the-answer-to-your-cardholder-acquisition-problem/">this article</a> on the importance of digital onboarding, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/from-app-to-branch-and-beyond-cardholder-acquisition-starts-with-choice/">this article</a> on how offering more payment choice will help push customer acquisition.</p>
<p>We see this preference for both digital and physical also when we have a look at interactions with the bank. We asked: How do you prefer to interact with your bank? Respondents told us that while they prefer to engage with their banks digitally (51.2% say they mainly use the mobile app, and 22.7% say that they prefer to interact via their banks website), nearly 20% of the surveyed people still listed in-person (or in a branch) as their preferred way of engagement. This shows us that banks must rise to the challenge and offer customers a variety of ways to interact to stay relevant and meet their needs.</p>
<p>Seamless, sustained payment enablement is key.</p>
<p>Net-net, consumers were loud and clear in their responses: Providing seamless, sustained payment enablement is key. And they want this not just when it comes to the types of cards that are offered, but also for every interaction with their bank, from account opening to onboarding, issuance, and payments.</p>
<p>We see a strong need for a complementary and complete card portfolio to answer the very diverse needs of cardholders and to cover all requested touchpoints along the banking and payment journey. Without these offerings in place, banks will find consumers are unwilling to compromise when it comes to finding a bank that will provide them with this flexibility, convenience, and efficiency.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity">Executive Order 14028 (EO 14028), Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a> directs the federal government to improve its efforts to identify, protect against, and respond to malicious cyber campaigns and their actors through bold changes and significant investments in cybersecurity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released the Federal Zero Trust Strategy <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">Memorandum M-22-09</a> adding specific guidance where federal agencies should focus their efforts with regards to identity, specifically, (1) A centralized cloud-based identity solution, (2) Strengthening authentication by implementing phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) and (3) Include device signals in authorization decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many agencies are struggling to implement these requirements by the deadline without severely disrupting their business. Since the announcement, we’ve been diligently working to make it faster and easier for our customers to deploy Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of the Microsoft Entra family, features to meet EO 14028 requirements. We’re excited to share how Azure AD can support your scenarios so your organization can meet EO 14028 requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, we’ll walk you through our top five curated tips and tricks, and how you can leverage them for your migration. In the second half we’ll share some of our deployment best practices we’ve developed that have been instrumental to minimize risk and maintain business continuity, all while consolidating identity providers (IDPs) and moving to phishing-resistant MFA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Top five tips to ensure requirements are met 
<p>Over the last year, we’ve released several features to extend the capabilities of Azure AD and ensure they also meet EO 14028 requirements. Here are our top five tips and tricks and how you can use them: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Consolidate your identity providers and use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication">Azure AD certificate-based authentication (CBA)</a>. Historically, federal agencies and customers who wanted to use CBA had to federate Azure AD with other IDPs (such as AD FS). Now, Azure AD CBA eliminates the need to federate, making it easier for you to consolidate your Identity Providers (IdPs) and move to the cloud faster (Azure AD CBA as a central IdP meets the federal requirement).  
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-single-sign-on">Phishing-resistant MFA for your Azure Virtual Desktop users</a>. We’ve implemented RDS AAD Auth to authenticate a user to an Azure AD-joined device or to a Hybrid Azure AD-joined device. This means that any authentication method supported by Azure AD can be used to authenticate to Azure Virtual Desktop, and Windows 365.  
 Phishing-resistant MFA on mobile (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-mobile-ios">iOS</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-mobile-android">Android</a>). Users can now authenticate on mobile devices using certificates stored on security keys. Unlike software certificates installed on the mobile device, these certificates are hardware protected and require an activation factor making them a true MFA solution. This solution also eliminates the need to issue certificates for every mobile device since the user can roam with the same security key across multiple devices. 
 Enforce phishing-resistant MFA for all your users. Use pre-configured <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths (or define your own custom authentication strength) as a control in conditional access policy</a> to allow granular access to specific resources, actions and applications for your users and groups. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-authentication-strength-external">Configure cross-tenant access settings</a> to require phishing resistant authentication for your external users who are coming from other Azure tenants. And, if you have users coming from other Microsoft Clouds, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-cloud-settings">configure Microsoft clouds settings for B2B collaboration</a> to apply the same phishing resistant policies to these users.  
 Leverage device signals for authorization. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device">Configure conditional access policy to require Hybrid Azure AD Join or compliant device</a>. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration#to-change-inbound-trust-settings-for-mfa-and-device-claims">Configure cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration to require the same for external users</a>.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s dive into some actual customer deployment scenarios to help you with your migration even more. </p>
 <br>Customer deployment story 
<p>We’ve worked with countless customers in various stages to help them maintain business continuity and minimize risk and disruption to their users while deploying their EO 14028 solutions. We’ve seen agencies with many 10's of thousands of users and devices do this as quickly within a few days. Below are the best practices we’ve refined over the last few years that will help you as well:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Moving CBA from on-premises IdP to Azure AD. Switching CBA from on-premises IdP to a cloud IdP can be disruptive if the only options are to move users to another domain or to move all users at once. Azure AD supports a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-staged-rollout">staged rollout</a> approach providing federal agencies the ability to granularly pilot and then move to Azure AD CBA en masse, mitigating the risk and disruption to your business and your users. To do this, designate a test group of users to start authenticating using Azure AD CBA in the cloud. Once you’ve validated everything is working as expected, gradually migrate your users in phases until all your users are migrated. After all users have been migrated it is safe to cut over to cloud authentication. 
 Gradually enforce phishing-resistant MFA. Configure <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods-manage">authentication methods policy</a> and scope the use of individual authentication methods to specific groups, reducing the overall availability of non-phishing-resistant methods. For scenarios where non-phishing-resistant methods are still needed—such as legacy apps or interoperability—<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">configure conditional access policies with authentication strength control</a> restricting the level of access granted when authentication is done with such methods.  
 Quickly add device signal as part of authorization decision. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/howto-hybrid-azure-ad-join">Configure Hybrid Azure AD Join (HAADJ)</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-partners">configure Intune to work with a device compliance partner</a>. Create conditional access policies requiring Hybrid/compliant devices to quickly bring device signal into your authorization decision. We’ve seen agencies with 10's of thousands of devices do this within a few days. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude, Microsoft is very committed to helping our US government customers meet the EO 14028 requirements by the September 2024 deadline. We have more features lined up to further assist you, make your migration easier and help you achieve your Zero Trust goals. To get started, here are some helpful resources: </p>

 Categorized as a major threat to the stability of the financial system since the late ‘80s, what more can be done to tackle the global trade in dirty money?&nbsp; 



 



<p>In 1989, the <a href="http://Financial%20Action%20Task%20Force%20(FATF)">Financial Action Task Force (FATF</a>) was created to address the emerging threat posed by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorism financing</a>, and&nbsp;provide some much-needed stability to the financial system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, more than 30 years later, the dangers of the trade in dirty money still looms large. In fact, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, up to <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">$2 trillion</a> is laundered every single year. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In a June 2023 report, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-finds-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-risks-payments-institutions-are-not-managed">European Banking Authority</a> announced that money laundering and terrorist financing risks were still not being managed effectively by EU payment institutions, citing insufficient AML/CFT internal controls. Findings from the report indicated that as some authorities were not supervising their sector effectively, payment institutions with weak AML/CFT controls were still managing to operate in the EU by establishing an entity in a member state where authorization and AML/CFT supervision processes were&nbsp;less stringent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Money laundering leads to unreliable changes in money demand, major risks to a bank’s soundness, affects the legality of financial transactions, and wreaks havoc on exchange rates due to unanticipated cross-border asset transfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what more can be done, and how can you better protect your business and your customers from the scourge of money laundering? Below, we share some of the most common red flag indicators associated with money laundering. </p>



 What is money laundering? 



<p>In short, money laundering refers to the act of obscuring the source of ill-gained funds, and injecting them into the legitimate financial system. In 1988, the United Nations Vienna Convention Article 3.1 defined money laundering as: </p>



<blockquote><p>The conversion or transfer of property, knowing that such property is derived from any offense(s), for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in such offense(s) to evade the legal consequences of his actions.</p>The United Nations Vienna Convention Article 3.1 (1988)</blockquote>



<p>For a more detailed explanation of how money laundering works, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/3-stages-of-money-laundering/">‘Explaining the 3 stages of money laundering’</a> blog.</p>



 Organizations fighting back. 



<p>As money laundering is transnational by nature, many international coalitions have been developed in a bid to tackle the issue. Some of the major groups focused on combating money laundering and adjacent offenses include the FATF, the <a href="https://egmontgroup.org/">Egmont group</a> (composed of 166 Financial Intelligence Units [FIU]), <a href="https://www.interpol.int/">Interpol</a>, Europol and UNODC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different legal frameworks and regulations have also been created to support anti-money laundering efforts. For example, in the European Union (EU), there have been multiple AML directives (the latest being <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD 6</a>) featuring&nbsp;requirements, tools and processes for EU countries, their respective authorities, and “<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0421">selected obliged entities</a>”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/new-eu-authority-for-anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-partial-position/">proposal</a> part of a legislative package to strengthen European AML/CFT rules also laid ground for the creation of a supranational body – the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amla-eu/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority</a> (AMLA), which should be created this year and become fully operational by 2026.</p>



 6 money laundering&nbsp;red flag indicators. 



  Unusual transaction patterns: Different transactional patterns can indicate when money laundering is taking place. Fast-paced transactions coming and going, significant increases in frequency or value, structuring schemes to break down deposits as well as inconsistent transactions regarding the client’s activities should all raise eyebrows and hint at suspicious activities.&nbsp;<br>  Cash-intensive activities: As cash is&nbsp;the major&nbsp;facilitator of money laundering, cash-related businesses are prime targets for money launderers. They offer an unparalleled opportunity to move funds with extremely limited monitoring, and relatively easy ways to escape controls. Businesses with a high volume of cash transactions (casinos, restaurants, grocery stores) or with no apparent justification for cash transactions (construction companies, service providers) may contribute to money laundering schemes. Important controls have been implemented in regulatory frameworks to hinder money laundering, such as reporting thresholds for cash transactions, deposits, or withdrawals.<br>  Third party relationships: Finding the beneficial ownership of companies in tax havens is an <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/blog/cjeu-ruling-eu-public-beneficial-ownership-registers-what-next-for-corporate-transparency">uphill battle</a>, and will remain so, especially in countries with less clear regulations. Money launderers may use third parties to create complex transaction chains, involving multiple accounts or intermediaries, to obscure the trail and source of illicit funds. Some laundering schemes will also appeal to complex international ownership structures, and leverage shell or offshore companies with nominees to hide beneficial ownership. Transactions from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/#:~:text=A%20Politically%20Exposed%20Person%20(PEP)%20is%20someone%20who%2C%20through,bribery%2C%20money%20laundering%20or%20corruption.">Politically Exposed Persons</a> must also be considered when looking for signs of money laundering.<br>  Specific geographical areas: Some countries are more exposed to corruption, organized crime, and money laundering than others, due to weak regulatory systems and poor governmental oversight. When monitoring transactions, geolocation data might be an indicator of suspicious activities. To support transactional analysis, the <a href="https://index.baselgovernance.org/">Basel AML index</a> and <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022">Corruption Perception Index</a> are always helpful to put into perspective global money laundering risks per country.<br>  Deficient financial systems: “Finding the weakness” could be the&nbsp;motto for money launderers. Whether it is corruption-enabled, lack of&nbsp;proper KYC/AML program implementation,&nbsp;or simply weak regulatory framework, some <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions.html">financial systems are easier than others to launder money</a>. In particular, inadequate due diligence processes or weak internal controls within a financial institution are especially interesting for people looking to hide the source of their funds.<br>  Technology-enabled money laundering: Digitalization and technological developments have been powerful enablers of money laundering, and opportunities are countless. The emergence of cryptocurrencies and virtual assets provides an additional layer of anonymity to be exploited, on top of decentralized or peer-to-peer exchanges. For example, funds going through an account and instantly converted into crypto might be flagged as suspicious.&nbsp;Read more about the need for cryptocurrency compliance and regulation in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">‘How criminals leverage non-compliant crypto exchanges for money laundering’ blog.</a><br>&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-takedown-darknet-cryptocurrency-mixer-processed-over-3">Darknet marketplaces also facilitate illicit transactions</a> and provide means to acquire fictitious identities. Darknet visitors are able conceal their identity or location thanks to specific protocols, VPNs, or proxy servers. &nbsp;  



 AML measures and deterrence mechanisms. 



<p>Having a robust AML program is essential to&nbsp;effectively deter money laundering. Countries with strong AML regulatory frameworks now enforce fines and administrative sanctions on actors who fail to demonstrate effective AML programs. For example, the French institution Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution&nbsp;in charge of monitoring the activity of banks and insurances can impose fines up to €100 million or 10% of a company’s annual turnover. In 2020, the UK’s <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a>&nbsp;fined the London branch of the German Commerzbank <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-commerzbank-london-37805400-over-anti-money-laundering-failures">£37 million</a>, “for failing to put adequate anti-money laundering (AML) systems and controls in place between October 2012 and September 2017.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>To remain compliant and avoid being sanctioned by authorities, having your reputation damaged, and incurring fines, improving these three pillars can drastically help:</p>



  KYC processes: Implementing thorough KYC procedures is crucial for financial institutions. This involves verifying the identity of customers, understanding their business activities, and assessing the legitimacy of the funds involved in transactions. Enhanced due diligence measures may be applied for higher-risk customers, such as PEPs or high net worth individuals. KYC obligations are now largely informed by national or supranational regulations, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Anti%2DMoney,based%20closely%20on%20FATF%20guidance.">AML directives</a> in Europe.<br>  



  Transaction monitoring and reporting: Transaction monitoring plays a vital role in tackling money laundering by identifying and flagging suspicious financial transactions for further investigation. Rule-based and behavior-based analytics, detection of unusual activity and real-time monitoring are all actions that can help detect suspicious patterns and support further investigations.<br>  Collaboration and information sharing: Financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports&nbsp;(SAR) through dedicated channels with their respective authorities, whenever there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering. Enhancing public-private partnerships is therefore one of the main ways to&nbsp;successfully tackle money laundering. As a global issue, money laundering also requires international cooperation and information sharing among different countries and regulatory bodies. Collaboration facilitates the exchange of intelligence, supports investigations, and assists in tracing and recovering illicit assets across borders.  



 Combating money laundering for the better good. 



<p>Money laundering poses a significant threat to the integrity of financial systems and can have severe consequences for global security. <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781589067738/ch014.xml">According to the International Monetary Fund,</a> “Countries with weak AML/CFT regimes are subject to the negative effects that large international criminal organizations can have on their economic growth and financial stability.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>With IDnow’s proprietary fraud prevention technology, you can conduct identity verification checks to prevent fraudulent activity such as<a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/"> account takeover</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>.</p>



 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 


 
 
 
 What are the main AML red flags?&nbsp; 
 

<p>Common red flags include large cash transactions, structuring transactions to avoid reporting thresholds, rapid movement of funds, unusual customer activity, lack of business justification, dealing with non-resident customers or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons</a>, offshore transactions, unregistered or unlicensed entities, and lack of proper documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What is an example of a red flag in AML?&nbsp; 
 

<p>One example of a red flag in AML is a sudden and unexplained increase in cash deposits or withdrawals in a customer’s account. For example, if a customer who typically makes small transactions suddenly starts depositing or withdrawing substantial amounts of cash without an apparent reason, it could indicate potential money laundering activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 What are some red flags in banking?&nbsp; 
 

<p>In banking, unusual cash deposits or withdrawals, rapid movement of funds, multiple accounts with similar names or unusual customer behavior could indicate&nbsp;money laundering activities, prompting the need for further investigation or the need to submit a SAR to the national FIU.&nbsp;</p>

 A Complete Custody Solution for Tokenized Securities 
<p>Welcome to our monthly product newsletter, featuring Tokeny’s latest solutions and innovations available to our clients.</p>

		 
	 
                <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Last month, we discussed our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/network-agnostic-tokenization-platform-for-enterprises/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--ofZm8n3SJwcPbEky_ddwlGgm7VUE8JJnnBq_f8RrY7_cOTSrl1tMJ04hR6LPap2zwkwzL">network-agnostic approach</a>&nbsp;for enterprises seeking to tokenize assets. This month, we’re focusing on our&nbsp;‘Custody’ solutions, highlighting our strategy for&nbsp;smart contracts management and wallet services.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way we think about digitization of finance. One of the key components of this technology is the blockchain wallet, which allows users to interact with the blockchain by signing operations.&nbsp;Wallets are used to sign transactions on the blockchain in order to validate information, authenticate, or trigger smart contract functions.</p>
<p>However, despite its numerous benefits, blockchain wallets can often be complex and difficult to use for the average user, increasing the risk of user error, such as misplacing private keys or sending funds to the wrong address. These errors can have serious consequences, including the loss of funds and the potential for fraudulent activities. To address these issues,&nbsp;it is crucial to simplify the user experience of wallets for institutional players. This can be achieved through the development of user-friendly interfaces, permission systems, and automation.</p>
<p>For years already, Tokeny has provided solutions to facilitate operations for users, being issuers, agents, or investors. Tokeny has not and doesn’t plan to develop a proprietary solution for blockchain wallets. We believe in self-control and direct ownership of assets and want to&nbsp;remain agnostic in terms of wallet solutions. Our role is to integrate these blockchain solutions into the <a title="T-REX Platform" href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX tokenization platform</a> in order to provide a good and secure user experience.</p>
<p>Each of the different roles presented below has a defined set of available actions that can be signed by a wallet:</p>
 
 The issuer&nbsp;(i.e., owner) is the top level administrator. An issuer can mostly appoint/revoke agent(s). 
 Agents&nbsp;manage the day-to-day operations on behalf of the issuer, such as the token supply, investor qualification, redemption… Agents use their wallets to sign these actions (i.e., blockchain transactions). 
 Investors&nbsp;use their wallets to control their identity and the tokens assigned to them. 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We distinguish several types of wallets:</p>
 Custodial Wallets vs. Non-custodial Wallets 
<p>We usually talk about custodial wallets when a third-party keeps and/or manages the private keys of the wallet. Custodial wallets solutions enable a high-level of automation and security, but can be subject to operational constraints linked to crypto-assets regulations.</p>
<p>Non-custodial wallets are managed directly by the end-user. With recent developments, they are now much easier, secure and cost-effective to use and are probably the future of this industry.</p>
 Integrated Wallets vs. Connected Wallets 
<p>We’ve integrated custodial and non-custodial wallet providers into our platform. These integrated wallets can be provided automatically to Issuers, Agents, and Token holders.</p>
<p>Signatures are made from the front-end, or automated if using custodial wallets, and the platform is connected to the wallet provider by API to trigger the blockchain operation. A gas tank feature enables gas-less transactions. As a result,&nbsp;the platform handles both the preparation and the signature information of the users’ transaction.&nbsp;It enables a simplified UI flow and facilitates automation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, thanks to connections with Metamask and WalletConnect, the T-REX platform is compatible with all the key wallet providers and digital assets custody solutions of the industry.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, our ultimate goal is to foster comfort and confidence among users when using our wallet solution. Regardless of their choice of wallets, we aim to empower our platform’s users, ensuring ease and confidence in wallet navigation.</p>

<p>The primary objective of this data challenge was to develop data analysis reports and machine learning models that accurately assess investor sentiment towards the OCEAN token over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Twitter, and specifically ‘Crypto Twitter (CT)’ has risen as a unique economic indicator in global sentiment for a particular project and token. Ocean Protocol provided two datasets for this exercise: one contained a record of all tweets featuring “$OCEAN” since 2020, while the other included the price history of the OCEAN token since 2019. Entrants were asked to find correlations between Twitter sentiment and token price and to develop a machine-learning model capable of classifying tweets as bullish, bearish, or&nbsp;neutral.</p> Winners are as&nbsp;follows: <p>1st Place: Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize)</p>  Nicolas’ in-depth analysis report and machine learning model caught our scoring team's eye. The paper included Nicolas’ methodology, clear explanations of the asked data analysis questions, data, and visual expressions of said data to support the thesis. Nicolas dug deep to find correlation coefficients, explain his query scripts, and test more than one ML model in his findings.  <p>2nd Place: Alexis Gassmann ($1500&nbsp;prize)</p>  Alexis was immensely thoughtful and results-oriented in the data analysis portion of this quest. Using HTML notebooks, Alexis was able to find averages and make assumptions backed by data to prove when and how bearish/bullish sentiment was most prominent in the time frame provided for this challenge.  <p>3rd Place: Mohammad Jamali ($1000&nbsp;prize)</p>  Mohammad took a unique approach in polishing and re-preparing the data by language, time, and price movement of the data set provided in this challenge. By doing so, Mohammad found patterns in the correlation between Twitter sentiment and price movement that we hadn’t thought of before. This creativity and exploration is a prime example of how Ocean data challenges empower the data scientist and lead to better informed, data-driven decision&nbsp;making.  <p>Are you curious about how the performance of your project, protocol, or favorite team reflects on the town hall of crypto, Twitter? Let us know in our community channels, and your protocol may be selected next to run a sentiment challenge on.</p><p>Congratulations to the winners, and thank you to all the participants for their hard work and dedication.

 Polimec and Deloitte Switzerland Introduce New KYC Credentials to Enhance Regulatory-Compliant Fundraising <p>Use case sets the basis for regulatory compliance in decentralized finance (DeFi), reducing the risk of fraud and accelerating Web3.</p><blockquote>“We are excited that only 8 weeks after our <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/deloitte-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-7ea12c0e0806">initial announcement with Deloitte</a>, we can already announce Polimec as the first use case for reusable KYC credentials. We are confident that many more will follow soon, inside and outside the Polkadot ecosystem.” — Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Press Release by Deloitte and&nbsp;Polimec</p><p>June 28th, 2023 — Switzerland — <a href="https://www.polimec.org/">Polimec</a>, a decentralized funding protocol developed on Polkadot, and Deloitte Switzerland are joining forces to issue reusable KYC (Know Your Customer) credentials enabling access to global fundraising of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Banking grade standard KYC credentials, issued by Deloitte, streamline the process of participating in early-stage fundraising on Polimec. The credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain, providing an additional level of regulatory compliance, security, and data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Users share their KYC documentation exclusively with Deloitte, a company trusted by the largest multinational enterprises and governments worldwide. Deloitte Managed Services then provides KYC credentials in Web3, an evolved version of the internet that incorporates blockchain technologies and decentralized systems. These Deloitte KYC credentials present a more efficient and secure alternative to traditional KYC methods, which typically involve significant time and resources to confirm the identities of customers.</p><p>“We are proud to share the result of the last nine months that we’ve been working together with Deloitte. This enables us to take a step closer to a vision of Web3, where everyone controls their own data, identity, and destiny — and with Polimec they can own parts of the most exciting Web3 projects from the very earliest fundraises. This collaboration will bring additional funding possibilities to the Polkadot ecosystem and lead the way to a more decentralized community-focused Web3, while also satisfying regulatory criteria”, said <a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/kmjoergensen">Kasper Mai Jørgensen</a>, Co-Founder of&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>Credentials will be available for natural persons as well as for legal entities in consideration of their respective needs:</p>  Issuers: The credentials serve as authenticity certificates of the legal entity raising funds, instilling trust and accountability in funding&nbsp;rounds.  Participants: The credentials allow access to Polimec and enable the categorization into retail, professional, and institutional.  <p>With the introduction of reusable KYC credentials, Polimec revolutionizes fundraising practices by creating a compliant and transparent fundraising environment with the goal of ensuring data ownership for all stakeholders. Now each credential holder gets to choose who holds their data and decide what data to share with&nbsp;whom.</p>  Issuers are able to offer contribution tokens to individuals/entities that have been appropriately certified by using the required KYC/AML (Anti Money Laundering) standards, reducing their risk of fraud and ensuring a more secure, more compliant and pseudonymous investing environment. This enables the customization of funding round criteria such as jurisdiction and participant types and provides access for investors based on criteria specified by the&nbsp;issuer.  Participants no longer need to share KYC/AML documentation with multiple intermediaries and issuers to be compliant. Their sensitive documentation is shared with Deloitte exclusively; they save time and reduce the risk of potential data breaches and identity theft. Participants are also assured of project legitimacy due to the issuer and the founders obtaining KYC credentials.  <p>The result is a fast, accessible, privacy-preserving, and compliant authentication experience.</p><p>“After announcing our partnership with KILT Protocol at the Decentralized conference in Lugano, we are proud to announce our first use case,” said <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/de/profiles/mbitterli.html">Micha Bitterli</a>, Head of Deloitte Managed Services. “With this first of many expected use cases, we demonstrate that we are not only talking about potential projects but executing on our promise. Together with the Web3 community joining us as either a user or as a use case for our solution, we want to enable blockchain technology to move toward a compliant DeFi environment.”</p><p>The KILT infrastructure ensures that KYC credentials can be verified at any time. That verification is documented on the Polimec blockchain, ensuring that all transactions and network participants can be processed in a regulatory-compliant, transparent, and secure manner while preserving data privacy. As a result, Polimec is able to create a secure and regulatory compliant fundraising environment for all involved stakeholders.</p><p>”I’m thrilled to see Polimec evolve into a fully-fledged decentralized funding mechanism. This is due to the fantastic and dedicated team at the Polimec Foundation. Together with the Polimec and Deloitte teams, we have created a seamless entry point for new teams to join the Polkadot ecosystem”, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingo-ruebe-0915068/">Ingo Rübe</a>, Founder of KILT Protocol.</p><p>The Polkadot ecosystem exemplifies effective collaboration between Protocols and Enterprises, establishing a streamlined workflow through interoperability and shared security. This synergy fosters innovation, yielding products that enhance user experience and community value. While KILT Protocol and the Polimec fundraising protocol undertake extensive tech operations and XCM (Cross-Consensus Message) transactions, complexities are rendered user-friendly. This simplicity catalyzes Web3 adoption, facilitating accessible, compliant, and decentralized products.</p><p>Polimec will go live as a Polkadot parachain in late 2023, after which the first projects will be supported in reaching their fundraising goals, enabling them to focus on building new and exciting technology for Web3. Everyone in the ecosystem will be able to participate via&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>There will be possibilities to use your KYC credential early on to get acquainted with this new way of performing KYC and managing your data on chain. We invite you to join our <a href="https://polimec.link/did-signup">waitlist</a> to stay updated on the next&nbsp;steps!</p> About Polimec: <p>Polimec is a decentralized community-driven funding protocol developed on Polkadot to accelerate the Web3 ecosystem. Polimec facilitates fundraising in a regulatory-compliant and sustainable manner using on-chain credentials, by providing an automated framework for projects to raise funds within a broad and diverse community with transparent and fair access for all. The protocol provides access to fundraising and governs the issuance, distribution, and conversion of tokens to&nbsp;mainnet.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/polimec-and-deloitte-switzerland-introduce-new-kyc-credentials-to-enhance-regulatory-compliant-5a6bb0654dd4">Polimec and Deloitte Switzerland Introduce New KYC Credentials to Enhance Regulatory-Compliant…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A summary of the mechanics of OCEAN, circa Jun&nbsp;2023 [Image: <a href="https://freerangestock.com/photos/129158/waves-in-sea.html">freerangestock.com</a>] Summary <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/token">OCEAN</a> mechanics currently include locking OCEAN for curation of data assets, burning OCEAN as a function of network revenue, and as a unit-of-exchange.</p><p>OCEAN has a generalized design that can incorporate new features, towards the overall goal of growing traction.</p> Introduction <p>OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage volume&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">[1]</a>:</p>  A rise in usage volume → leads to more network revenue, which goes to Ocean community via (a) burning OCEAN (b) other community initiatives  A rise in usage volume → leads to more OCEAN being&nbsp;locked  <p>So the name of the game is to drive usage&nbsp;volume.</p> On Network&nbsp;Revenue <p>The baseline revenue: anytime a data asset is consumed, 0.1% of the value goes to Ocean community; a portion of that is burned. It’s independent of what currency the data asset it sold for. The higher the data consume volume (DCV), the more OCEAN to the community, the more value to OCEAN. So the name of the game is to drive DCV&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">[1]</a>.</p><p>Over time, other revenue-generating mechanisms may be&nbsp;added.</p> OCEAN Distribution Towards&nbsp;Traction <p>The majority of OCEAN supply is earmarked for the community, distributed over decades, to incentivize locking OCEAN and driving&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">2</a>][<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">4</a>] has the main mechanics:</p>  Passive DF. Lock your OCEAN for veOCEAN → earn weekly OCEAN rewards&nbsp;.  Active DF.

<p>When we last left off, Dhiway had a new narrative but the same identity. We were only half there! Let us unfold the rest of this rebrand story….. see you on the flip side (Wink wink).</p>



 <br>Out with the old, in with the new? 



<p>Rewind the clock by three years! When we embarked on our Dhiway journey, all we cared about was verification. But things have changed! Our story has grown broader.</p>



<p>It’s like showing up to the office in your cricket gear. Something just feels off. We realized we needed the right attire to look the part.</p>



<p>Our path to design was clear</p>



 
 We need to shed our startup vibes and embrace the look of a serious tech player. Think established, timeless, with a touch of class. 



 The visuals need to match our personality – We are bold, authentic, thorough, rational &amp; dependable 
 



 <br>Visualizing Dhiway 2.0 



<p>What does ‘reshaping the digital future’ look like? Could it be a majestic rising sun, or perhaps a precious pearl tucked away in an oyster, or maybe an animal that shakes up its entire ecosystem? The ideas were flowing during our brand creation process.</p>



<p>But then, someone chimed in, saying, “What if it’s all about turning over a new page?” Intriguing, we thought. It sounded simple, yet held a profound meaning. It also had a visual element that excited our creative senses!</p>



<p>But the kicker: it fit perfectly into our brand story.</p>



<p>‘Turning the page’ going once, twice, thrice. Sold. We had our visual concept.</p>







<p>Concept note</p>



<p>In a world rampant with data breaches and digital clutter, we find our trust and convictions often being put to the test. It has become the need of the hour to begin a fresh chapter, to turn over a new leaf. Dhiway is here to drive change, and belief and open doors to a new world.</p>



<p>Achieving certainty in the digital world is no longer a far-off dream. With Dhiway, it’s just the turn of a page.</p>







 <br>Introducing Dhiway 2.0 







<p>The Dhiway identity visualizes the story of ‘Reshaping the digital future’, about creating a better digital world. The identity boasts three essential elements</p>



 
 Circle: A powerful symbol embodying a better digital world 



 The Fold: A bold depiction of the transformative path from darkness to light 



 The ‘W’: The dynamic slant of the ‘w’ symbolizes forward movement (We are ‘reshaping’ the digital future &amp; not just ‘reshape’ the digital future) 
 



<p>On a side note:</p>



<p>We actually had three different design approaches in mind, and we were leaning towards going with something completely different. You know what changed our minds? During the Dhiway Townhall, someone said, ‘I really miss that tilted W from approach 2.’ And that statement made us pause and reflect. Looking back, it’s pretty funny how we were drawn to the ‘Turning the page’ approach, but we reluctantly chose a different one. We genuinely think that these unexpected twists are where the real fun happens.”</p>



 <br>Redesigning a cohesive visual language 



<p>Building from our identity, the new visual language needed to portray a forward-looking tech company while conveying our brand narrative.</p>



<p>We did this through 3 main components</p>



<p></p>



<p><br>1. Colour system</p>



<p>Most tech and blockchain companies have the usual visual tropes of blues &amp; blacks. For us, the opportunity lay in ‘purple’ and ‘yellow’ basis of our competitive research.</p>



<p>Our colour pallets give Dhiway a fresh new look while not letting go of our bold yet dependable image. The balance between solid and gradient palettes communicates the confidence of a well-established ecosystem while retaining a timeless appeal.</p>



<p>Additionally, the gradients act as a visual representation of frictionless interactions; dipicting a smooth flow of data.</p>







<p></p>



<p><br>2. Typography</p>



<p>Our brand typeface, Aeonik, complements our colour systems by embodying our brand’s personality while maintaining a sense of boldness and dependability. A meticulously crafted and versatile typeface, its extensive range of styles and characters makes it ideal for creating a timeless brand identity. Aeonik is ideal for large &amp; small sizes; something that is essential for the ecosystem we deal in.</p>







<p><br>3. Circle</p>



<p>Our core visual element represents a better digital world. This is widely used in most of our creative expressions and is the center of our brand.</p>







 <br>Extending beyond Dhiway 



<p>Taking inspiration from our parent brand, our offerings embrace the central element of the fold. This deliberate design choice establishes a cohesive and harmonious visual language that unifies our entire product family.</p>







<p><br><br></p>



 Finally…….making the brand live 



<p>And here we are, bursting with excitement! On June 7th, 2023, we proudly unveiled our brand to the world. We had a blast teasing the launch with cryptic messages on our social media platforms.</p>















<p></p>















<p>That’s the end of our rebranding adventure. We hope you enjoyed reading about it as much as we enjoyed writing it.</p>



<p>Of course, we don’t have everything perfectly figured out just yet. We know we have a long road ahead of us, but we also know we’re heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>Protocol Engineer Brian and Head of Design Ryan recently attended <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWeb Camp 2023</a> in the California redwoods. DWeb Camp is a five-day retreat for builders and creators constructing tools, making apps, and cultivating a community around the decentralized web. While there, they presented a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">workshop</a> on the ODD SDK using <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> and the <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD App Template</a>. The workshop invites participants to create ODD Avatars, like the one below. </p>Our marketer Becky, transmogrified! Creating Your ODD Avatar <p>After grabbing a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">workshop code</a> from GitHub, you'll first complete the Transmogrify activities. These activities will enable you to upload a photo in the public file system (WNFS) and run <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Tensor Flow.js</a> over it. This adds the signature ODD eyeballs to the image over the eyes of the person in the image (this mostly works for people, but we've also seen it work on illustrations!). </p>The ODD Haskell High Priestess<p>First, create a public avatars directory path. Then, create the directory on your local machine and verify it is in your local file system.</p><p>Now it's time to complete the Summon activities. Summon enables the gallery view. The activities are similar to the previous ones, with an additional activity enabling the "delete" function. When finished, you can view your transmogrified image in the gallery. There is also a link to the image hosted on IPFS. </p> Served with Your Choice of Nodes <p>IPFS doesn't persist an image - instead, it assigns it a CID (content identifier in the form of a hash) and enables storage and sharing across the nodes in the network. Over time, if a file isn't being requested very often, eventually, it will be "garbage collected" and removed from the node to make room for other content. To ensure that your files remain on IPFS, you must use a "pinning" service to persist them. When you use ODD SDK, Fission persists (or pins) them to our node. (NOTE: We don't run a paid pinning service, but we currently offer complementary pinning to ODD SDK users). </p><p>However, if you choose to move your content to another node or change the delivery gateway, all of this can be done very easily! For example, to change the delivery gateway, you only need to change the domain in the code and refresh the ODD Avatars app. When you click on the IPFS link, you'll see it's using a different gateway. The content is being pulled temporarily to the node behind that gateway. But again, make sure to use a pinning service if this is content that you wish to keep around! </p><p>Fission will never lock you into our services, and we always build to open source and interoperable standards. </p> Collect Your Favorite Avatars <p>This activity utilizes the public file system in WNFS. Since all the files are public, you can use the CIDs of those files and add them to your own gallery. Currently, there is no way to search for CIDs in IPFS (<a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-nns/">though we're working on it!</a>), but if you know the CID, you can plug it into the function we built into the app. </p> <p>This was a lot of fun to put together, and we hope you enjoy making your own ODD avatars. We'd love to see what you come up with! Tag us on social media so we can see your ODD creations.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/dwebcamp-workshop-2023">Workshop Code</a></p><p><a href="https://ugly-thick-brass-whale.fission.app/">ODD Avatars App</a></p><p>And if you'd like to learn more about ODD SDK, you can visit the <a href="https://odd.dev/">website</a> or join the #ODDSDK channel on <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord</a>.</p>

   The Antidote to Costly Security Risks and Unhappy Customers is Enterprise-Grade Digital Identity 
	
<p>For five years running, the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_campaign=reports&amp;utm_content=2023-breach-report_healthcare_blog">ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a> has uncovered the fact that cybercriminals target healthcare more than any other industry. Attackers aim for the path of least resistance, and, According to Accenture,<a>1</a> the call center has become that path due to legacy and siloed authentication processes and technology. The security risks associated with healthcare call center, front desk, and help desk authentication include weak passwords and credentials, insider threats, social engineering, unauthorized access, and account takeover (ATO).</p>

<p>The customer experience authenticating with traditional healthcare call centers, front desks, and help desks is similarly poor. Customers often have to repeat their weak credentials at multiple points within their journey – a frustrating experience that diminishes customer confidence and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Overhauling call center authentication security and experiences may seem daunting, but with the right digital identity solution, healthcare leaders can realize significant cost savings and profit gains.</p>

<p>For example, a recently commissioned study, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/186-roi-new-total-economic-impacttm-study">Forrester® Total Economic Impact™ (TEI) of ForgeRock CIAM</a>, shows that over three years, healthcare enterprises could achieve:</p>

  40% reduction in security-related calls to the call center 
   $4.7M reduction in costs associated with fraud 
   400% increase in customer engagement 
   133% increase in customer conversions 
 <p>ForgeRock offers enterprise-grade digital identity security solutions that not only protect healthcare customers and enterprises from breaches, fraud, and ransomware, they also enable great call center, front desk, and help desk experiences. These include:</p>

 CIBA and Secure Impersonation 
<p>Rather than having callers answer weak authentication questions, client-initiated backchannel authentication (CIBA) enables front-desk, call-center, and help-desk representatives to authenticate callers with methods such as sending a prompt via a mobile app or text. CIBA also enables secure impersonation, which, upon an authentication prompt, allows consumers to hand over temporary control over their account to another party, such as a call-center agent, for a set period of time. Both of these security methods make it much harder for fraudsters to achieve their mission.</p>

 Passwordless and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> eliminates the need for a password during authentication using a variety of alternatives, such as passkeys, biometrics, or by gathering contextual authenticators such as device, IP address, geo-location, and so on.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> validates a user's identity through multiple authentication mechanisms in addition to standard login credentials. These may include a push notification or biometrics like facial recognition or Touch ID.</p>

 No-Code Identity Orchestration With Continuous, Contextual Authentication 
<p>To predict whether fraud is likely requires context. ForgeRock offers a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">no-code identity orchestration engine</a> that enables administrators to design authentication journeys for all users that detect anomalies both before and after authentication. Anomaly detection goes on behind the scenes and is invisible to legitimate users; their experience isn't impacted. Suspicious actors, on the other hand, are required to provide added proof of their identity.</p>

 Autonomous Access 
<p>Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> is a threat protection solution that helps healthcare security leaders prevent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover (ATO)</a> and fraud at all points of authentication. It uses AI to analyze threat signals and anomalous behavior patterns, and provides risk scores to help stop bad actors in real time. AI-informed risk scores can be incorporated into the design of call-center and help-desk journeys, allowing healthcare security leaders to remove unwanted friction and improve the experience of legitimate users.</p>

 Autonomous Identity 
<p>Internal actors are the second-highest cause for healthcare breaches.<a>2</a> ForgeRock Autonomous Identity leverages AI to disrupt the traditional, static identity governance models used to grant workforce access by looking at an organization's entire entitlement landscape. It then provides insights to make informed provisioning and governance decisions, and identifies high-risk areas that may require more governance. This helps healthcare security leaders significantly reduce the number of users that have access to things they shouldn't.</p>

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity capabilities, listed above, can address risks and vulnerabilities to significantly improve healthcare call center, front desk, and help desk security while enhancing end-user experiences.</p>

<p>What’s the secret to overcoming common roadblocks when implementing Zero Trust</p>
<p>The concept of Zero Trust dates back more than a decade, when forward-thinking CIOs realized that digital expansion was making perimeter-based security obsolete. As digital connections with acquisitions, contractors, customers, banks, government agencies, and business partners proliferated, the traditional wall of security surrounding the enterprise became increasingly porous. The global pandemic accelerated trends like remote work and work from home, extending the perimeter to remote locations and people’s homes, making security extremely difficult to manage with traditional perimeter-based technology, identity, and policy frameworks.</p>
<p>As enterprise technologies moved to the cloud and remote worker populations soared, the need for security beyond the traditional perimeter took on greater urgency. In 2010, a Forrester researcher – let’s give John Kindervag his due credit – crafted the term “Zero Trust” to describe a modern framework for enterprise security in a perimeter-less ecosystem. Kindervag made it clear that Zero Trust could not be achieved through a single product or technology. Rather, the framework guided a highly disciplined approach that called for all users, devices, and systems to be authenticated before connecting, then continually verified while engaged with accessing networks, systems, and data.</p>
<p>Growing risk drives big talk, but little action on Zero Trust</p>
<p>That was 13 years ago. Since then, we’ve seen cybercrime become an <a href="https://itbrief.com.au/story/cyber-crime-costing-the-world-8-trillion-every-year#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20by%20Cybersecurity,space%20to%20protect%20cyber%20rights.">$8T (USD)</a> annual industry, <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach#:~:text=The%20latest%20IBM%20Data%20Breach,one%20data%20breach%20during%202022.">83% of organizations</a> have suffered a breach, and the average cost of those events has surpassed $4.5M (USD). Analysts warn that cybercrime will surge to even higher levels as hackers increasingly add the power of quantum computing and tools such as phishing-as-a-service and ransomware-as-a-service to their arsenals. Most cyber incidents can be tracked back to compromised credentials and security frameworks not planning for cyber resilience – i.e how to ensure business continuity in case of a breach.</p>
<p>And yet, adoption of Zero Trust principles has been slow due to several factors:</p>
 
 Fuzzy line of sight to business outcomes: IT and security professionals have been challenged to create a line of sight between Zero Trust implementation and goals for the business. 
 Big bang IT project orientation: With limited budgets and a long-term shortage of cybersecurity staff, moving to a strategy where every user, device, system, and application represents a new perimeter can appear daunting – and easy to put off until more time and more resources are available. 
 Cyber insurance was sufficient: We’ve seen in some the attitude that risk of a cybersecurity incident is tolerable – and the cost would be covered by cyber-insurance policies. 
 
<p>Finally, there remains confusion over what Zero Trust is. Technology vendors get some of the blame here, often presenting Zero Trust as a tech re-platform project, rather than an infosecurity paradigm shift, where you can measure and plan your road to maturity.</p>
<p>No more. Today, we’re clearly at an inflection point. In the U.S., the White House has directed federal agencies to adopt Zero Trust principles by 2024. And the release of the latest Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/zero-trust-maturity-model">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> has moved the concept from buzzword to blueprint, providing that roadmap for addressing the key pillars of a Zero Trust architecture. Version 2 of the model adds an additional maturity level, recognizing the fact that getting to an optimal maturity level is a huge leap for any organization. Enterprises are rapidly engaged as well, with PwC reporting that 36% of CISOs say they’ve already started to implement components of Zero Trust and another 25% plan to start in the next two years.</p>
<p>But achieving maturity will take time; Zero Trust is a journey and an ongoing effort to coninuously improve and enforce controls. CISA makes it clear that there is no one solution to get to Zero Trust maturity, and that implementation will take strategic backing, time, and investment. The upside: With each step a maturity model approach enables improvement to the organization’s risk posture.</p>
<p>Breaking through roadblocks to overcome inertia</p>
<p>Success requires two high-level commitments – with a number of practical steps to support them. The first comes from the board or C-suite. No senior leaders or board members are unaware of the cost and ubiquity of cyberattacks. They get it. IT is the environment for innovation, the conduit for sales, the connectivity to customers, and the engine for market expansion. Boards and CEOs need to invest in digital infrastructure like it’s the core business, not just departmental overhead. Building the business case for that mindset shift requires a dedicated strategy on the part of IT and security leaders.</p>
<p>The second commitment is patience – across the enterprise. Start by evaluating your current state, and from there plan out how you will grow into a Zero Trust posture – rather than simply buying a new tech platform and, inevitably, underdelivering on results. Getting to Zero Trust maturity require integration of carefully selected and integrated security technologies. But you can’t deploy a new tech stack and say, “Check Zero Trust off the list.” What you can do is work with your team and your partners to make sure the tech meets you at your Zero Trust maturity level. Your IT security teams and business leaders need to be in sync with an evolving framework that gets smarter, more agile, and more secure over time.</p>
<p>These two high-level commitments provide the sustained momentum for change. But building an effective Zero Trust framework requires strategic guidance to funnel that momentum in the right direction. Entrust has helped a number of organizations design, launch, and maintain their frameworks over the past several years. We’ve collected several insights and best practices from those engagements and distilled them into a quick-read ebook titled “Building a Solid Foundation for Your Zero Trust Framework.” You can download the ebook <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/ebook/entrust-report-zerotrust-eb.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Account takeover prevention actively reduces attack surfaces by which hackers can break into and use system accounts for malicious purposes.</p>
 What Is an Account Takeover Attack? 
<p>Account takeover (ATO) refers to identity theft, where an attacker gains access to a user’s account. This can be any account, including those associated with online banking or an enterprise platform.</p>
<p>Account takeover is often a lengthy process, following a few common steps:</p>
 
 Reconnaissance: The fraudster gathers the victim’s information through tactics like, such as phishing, credential stuffing, or purchasing the information on the dark web. 
 Unauthorized Access: Using this information, hackers will then take control of these accounts… including any access privileges that account and user enjoy. 
 Malicious Activity: The hacker may now carry out various malicious activities. This can include using email to send phishing emails (in what is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bec-attack/">Business Email Compromise attack</a>), stealing information from secure sources, changing roles and privileges, or simply monitoring networks or emails for more information about the organization. 
 
<p>Account takeovers are a severe security issue that can significantly impact the immediate and future sense.</p>
 How Do Attackers Launch Account Compromise Attacks? 
<p>Hackers can use several methods to execute account takeover attacks. More importantly, very few attacks utilize a single technique–sometimes single attacks are used to breach an account, but more often than not several forms of attack are strung together to trick users and gain access to their information.</p>
<p>Here are some common ones:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">Phishing</a>: In this method, hackers send fraudulent emails or messages posing as legitimate organizations to trick recipients into revealing credentials like usernames and passwords. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/credential-stuffing/">Credential Stuffing</a>: This attack involves hackers using stolen usernames and passwords to “stuff” them into common platforms (with the understanding that many users will reuse passwords across different accounts). 
 Malware: This includes any viruses or spyware that can exploit vulnerabilities such that they may be embedded into systems to track user behavior, steal information, or break system usability. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/man-in-the-browser-attack/">Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (MitM)</a>: These attacks occur when hackers intercept network traffic to steal or manipulate communications. 
 Data Breaches: Database hacks can result in lost credentials and fuel additional attacks like credential stuffing or rainbow table attacks. 
 
<p>Not all of these attacks are the user’s fault (especially related to data breaches). Still, it is often the case that user behavior can be one of the most significant contributors to account takeover threats.</p>
 How Can My Organization Detect Account Takeovers? 
<p>Detecting account takeover can sometimes be challenging because perpetrators often try to hide their activities (and, in the case of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/advanced-persistent-threat/">advanced persistent threats,</a> these efforts are very sophisticated). However, there are several tell-tale signals for account takeover.<br>
Some of these signs include:</p>
 
 Unusual User Behavior: Uncommon or risky user behavior can signal an account takeover. In enterprise settings, this is much more sophisticated than detecting individual anomalies and falls under a discipline called User Behavior Analytics. 
 Account Activity Monitoring: A critical part of any behavior and threat analysis is monitoring. Regularly monitoring account activities can help detect suspicious behavior. Look for sudden changes in account details, unfamiliar transactions, unexpected password resets, or unanticipated email subscriptions. 
 AI and Machine Learning Systems: While traditional monitoring has contributed to mitigating fraud and account takeover, modern AI-driven tools can model risk and odd behavior with much more sophistication than those managed by humans. Advanced AI and machine learning systems can learn patterns, detect anomalies, and flag suspicious behavior that might indicate an account takeover attempt. 
 Device Identification and Tracking: By identifying and tracking the devices typically used to access an account, enterprises can spot when an account is accessed from a new or unusual device. 
 Login Velocity Checking: By tracking logins’ frequency and geographic location, systems can flag when an account is being accessed repeatedly (a sign of account takeover threats). 
 Risk-Based Authentication: This method analyzes several risk factors (like the reputation of an IP address, the user’s device, geographic location, and behavioral biometrics) during the authentication process. If the risk score is high, it will trigger additional security measures. 
 Threat Intelligence Feeds: Enterprises can subscribe to threat intelligence feeds, which provide real-time information about ongoing cybersecurity threats. These services can alert enterprises to known malicious IP addresses or newly discovered vulnerabilities that might be exploited for an account takeover. 
 
 How Can I Prevent 
<p>Preventing account takeover fraud involves passive and proactive measures to secure personal and financial information.</p>
<p>Enterprises can take several measures to prevent account takeover attempts. Here are some key strategies:</p>
 
 Implement <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>: MFA adds security by requiring users to provide at least two forms of identification before accessing their accounts. This can be factors like fingerprints, facial scans, or hardware tokens. 
 Force the Use of Strong Passwords: Enforce policies for password strength and regular password changes. Consider implementing a password manager enterprise-wide to help users manage their unique, strong passwords. 
 Require Training: Regular training can help employees recognize the signs of phishing attempts and other security threats through the use of security best practices (particularly authentication practices). 
 Automate Updates and Patches: Automatically maintain the latest patches from software and hardware vendors to protect your enterprise from many known vulnerabilities that could be exploited for account takeover. 
 Scan and Flag Emails: Implement email scanning and filtering to detect and block phishing emails and other malicious content that could lead to account takeovers. Most email providers offer ways to flag emails from outside the organization so that users will not fall for phishing attacks. 
 Follow the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">Principle of Least Privilege</a>: Apply the PoLP, giving employees only the necessary access to perform their tasks. This reduces the number of high-value targets for attackers and minimizes impact if an account is breached 
 Monitor Account Activity: Use tools that can help monitor account activities, such as log analysis and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems. These can help you spot unusual patterns that may indicate an account takeover. 
 Conduct Regular Audits: Regular audits can help you identify potential security weaknesses before they can be exploited. These include both technological audits and process audits.

<p>As a leader in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) sector, Coinfirm not only provides solutions for businesses to stay compliant and secure but also helps victims of cryptocurrency fraud through our project, ReclaimCrypto.com. Here, we offer victims a platform to report crypto crimes and assist them in the possible recovery of their stolen assets. In this article, we delve deep into the data from ReclaimCrypto.com to identify the shifting trends in cryptocurrency-related crime over the past five years.</p>



<p>The data, reflecting the percentage of claims associated with different cryptocurrencies from 2019 to 2023, provides a comprehensive view of the changing landscape of crypto crimes. This analysis identifies notable trends and anomalies that offer a clearer understanding of how the crypto-crime scenario has evolved over the years.</p>



 Declining Bitcoin Claims: 



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, unsurprisingly, featured heavily in the claims in the earlier years. In 2019, Bitcoin accounted for 39% of all claims, which surged to a peak of 66% in 2020. However, the percentage of Bitcoin-related claims has shown a consistent decline since then, falling to 35% in 2021, then to 21% in 2022, and finally to 28% in 2023. This trend could be attributed to increased awareness and security enhancements around Bitcoin transactions, but also to the growing diversity in the crypto market.</p>



 Varying Ethereum Claims: 



<p>Ethereum (ETH) claims have varied over the years, starting at 8% in 2019, peaking at 22% in 2021, and dropping to 14% in 2023. The popularity of Ethereum for smart contracts and the rise of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) projects built on its platform could account for the peak in 2021.</p>



 Emergence of Binance Coin (BNB) Claims: 



<p>Interestingly, Binance Coin (BNB) claims made their first appearance in 2021, accounting for 5% of claims, and maintaining that proportion in 2022. As Binance Smart Chain’s native token, BNB’s growing involvement in fraudulent activities could be tied to the rapid expansion of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem and its increasing adoption.</p>



 Resurgence of Ripple (XRP) Claims: 



<p>Ripple (XRP) claims have remained relatively low, accounting for 5% in 2019, falling to 4% in 2020, and then further reducing to a negligible presence in 2021 and 2022. However, 2023 witnessed a resurgence of XRP claims, rising back to 4%.</p>



 Rising Tether (USDT) Claims: 



<p>Most notably, the percentage of Tether (USDT) claims, a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, saw a significant increase over the years. Starting from a mere 3% in 2020, the USDT-related claims rose to 7% in 2021, then significantly jumped to 19% in 2022, and finally reached a peak of 32% in 2023.</p>



<p>The surge in USDT-related claims is noteworthy, as it marks the increasing involvement of stablecoins in crypto crimes. Tether (USDT), being a stablecoin, is designed to maintain a stable value against a specific asset or a pool of assets, most commonly USD. The appeal of stablecoins lies in their ability to provide stability in a highly volatile crypto market. They allow users to escape volatility without exiting the cryptocurrency space entirely, and hence have seen widespread adoption for transactions, trading, andvalue storage.</p>



<p>The increased use of USDT in fraudulent activities could be attributed to several reasons. First, the widespread adoption of USDT might have attracted criminals due to its high liquidity and ubiquity across exchanges, making it easier for them to move funds while avoiding detection.</p>



<p>Second, the relative stability of USDT may provide an additional layer of security for fraudsters. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, whose value might drastically fluctuate, the value of stolen USDT is relatively stable, reducing the risk for criminals holding these assets.</p>



<p>Third, the perception that stablecoins, being pegged to real-world assets, are somehow ‘safer’ or ‘less traceable’ might be playing into this trend. It’s important to debunk such misconceptions and continue to improve the tracking of stablecoin transactions in the fight against crypto crimes.</p>



<p>Finally, the rise in DeFi and yield farming platforms, many of which use USDT as a base currency, might have also indirectly contributed to the increase in USDT-related claims. As more users engage with these platforms, the opportunities for fraud also increase, leading to a higher number of reported incidents.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while we have seen an increase in USDT-related claims, it does not necessarily imply that the USDT network itself is less secure. Rather, it’s a reflection of its widespread usage and certain characteristics that might be exploited by bad actors. Despite these challenges, we are confident that with continuous improvements in tracking technologies and regulatory practices, we can tackle this issue effectively.</p>



<p>As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving crypto landscape, it’s crucial to stay vigilant and informed. At Coinfirm, we are committed to aiding in the fight against crypto fraud and providing support for victims of these crimes. Through continuous innovation, advanced tracking technologies, and regulatory partnerships, we strive to make the crypto world a safer place for all.</p>

<p></p><p><a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/">Web5</a> introduces a paradigm shift in the way we build applications. App-centric logins and data storage are replaced with decentralized identity and personal data stores.</p><p>While Web5 abstracts away a lot of the complexity of building decentralized apps, it would be nice to have a helping hand to answer all of your Web5 questions.</p><p>That's why we've created a Web5 Assistant in the form of a ChatGPT plugin. The Web5 Assistant is built on GPT-4 and was trained on all of our available documentation.</p><p></p><p>So, instead of digging through several tutorials to find the one piece of information you need, simply ask your question to the Web5 Assistant and it will be happy to help you.</p>  note  <p>To add a plugin to ChatGPT, you must be a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus">ChatGPT Plus subscriber</a>. Find more info on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/stories/best-chatgpt-plugins-how-to-add-install-use">installing ChatGPT plugins</a>.</p>  <p>After installing the Web5 Assistant plugin, you can use ChatGPT as normal, and include Web5's knowledge base when answering your questions.</p><p>For example, maybe you need insight on what's a DID?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps you need assistance with an API call.</p><p></p><p>Or you can get into more complex things like asking the Web5 Assistant to generate a protocol for the app you're building!</p><p></p><p>So, as you can see, the plugin can help you with all things Web5. And of course, we've <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-chatgpt-plugin">opened sourced</a> the knowledge base so feel free to contribute anything we may have missed.</p>

<p>Dhiway is abuzz this week.</p>



<p>We have all been excited, nervous, pumped, and more. Who knew a rebrand would have this effect? But before this turns into a gushy session, let us take you through all the fun parts.</p>



 <br>How it all started! 



<p>Sometime last year, we were working on creating new offerings, launching version 2 of our Blockchain (The fastest, most scalable blockchain in town – a humble brag?) and our new wallet application.</p>



<p>And as we were juggling all this, one of the founders said out loud ‘How do we really make our clients understand all this?’ Not everyone understands tech. And honestly, we were very close to our work – read ‘really really close’. And why not, it was our baby. But now it was time to bring in a sounding board. Enter Small Town Folk (STF) – the design agency we worked on the rebrand with.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>Digging deeper than deep tech 



<p>Although we all knew what we did at Dhiway, it was not articulated in a common language. So STF and us did several workshops to answer numerous questions related to our business, our offerings, and even the most existential question – our why?</p>



<p>But every time we started, we came up with too many answers. All of us had the same sentiment but a different articulation.</p>



<p>“Maybe we should just document the building blocks” – said a team member. So we locked ourselves in a room and just started whiteboarding.</p>



<p>Finally ending up with this. Some documentation this …. phew!</p>







<p>The clarity of putting something down on paper can’t be underestimated. We understood the relationship between Dhiway, Cord &amp; Mark. A proper brand architecture was now ready.</p>



 <br>And now back to the big one – The Why? 



<p>“At the end of your life, what fundamental impact would you have made on this world?”</p>



<p>This powerful question got the most passion out of us. Someone said ‘Dhiway would be fundamental to our lives’ others said ‘Dhiway will put power back in the hands of the people’. And then the aha moment – ‘Dhiway would make the digital world comparable to or better than the current physical world’</p>



<p></p>



<p>Hold on…. this is interesting. So this meant</p>



 
 The current digital world is not comparable to the physical world 



 Which meant that there is mistrust in the current digital world 



 This translates to – the current digital world in its current form is broken 
 



<p>And voila our brand purpose</p>







 <br>Swiftly moving on to The How 



<p>By now it was very clear what we were solving for.</p>



 
 Dhiway is about friction-free interactions 



 Dhiway is about population-scale technology 



 Dhiway is about collaborations 



 Dhiway is about ever-adaptive solutions 
 



<p>We needed a single narrative that tied it all together. Easy right? </p>



<p>Introducing Dhiway’s brand promise…. (Drum rolls)</p>



 “Reshaping the digital world” 



<p>At first glance, it seemed right. We shared it with our existing investors &amp; select people in our ecosystem. It seemed right to them as well.</p>



<p>Did we just crack our narrative? I think we did. Clap Clap</p>



 <br>Wait…..there’s more – A new brand identity? 



<p>You know those conversations that rain on your parade? Ours goes something like this.</p>



<p>“What about the logo?”</p>



<p>“The logo? What about it?”</p>



<p>“You do know the logo talks about our Mark Studio &amp; verification story, don’t you? Shouldn’t the logo reflect our new brand narrative”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this was true. Our identity was designed when we launched MarkStudio. And that’s when it dawned on us.</p>



<p>We were only half there!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Almost every website, app, and user platform now requires usernames and passwords. And for user data to remain secure, passwords must be strong—most platforms require a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Many users now employ passphrases so they won’t have to remember different passwords to protect their accounts from cyber threats and hackers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Keeping track of multiple passwords or generating endless passphrases becomes quite unwieldy after a while. Fortunately, we are on the path to a bright future of passwordless technology.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Passwordless Technology?  
<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless technology</a> is a type of user authentication that does not require the use of a password.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This is being done in different ways:</p> 
 Biometrics  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">Biometric authentication</a> refers to the automated capture of an individual’s unique characteristics, which are then saved and encrypted into a security system. When the user logs in, their biometrics will be recaptured to verify their identity and provide access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Biometric authentication can use any of the following body parts:</p> 
  
  Fingerprint  
  Palm print  
  Face  
  Voice  
  
<p>This technology is being leveraged in place of or to supplement simple passwords on smart devices, transport, banking, and more.&nbsp;</p> 
 Credentials  
<p>Possession-based authentication leverages personal credentials that are unique to the user. They are usually information saved on hardware that only the owner controls.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some examples of possession-based credentials include:</p> 
  
  Software tokens  
  Soft Token Software Development Kits or SDKs  
  Smart cards  
  Security keys  
  Mobile credentials  
  
<p>Credential authentication is complex and more difficult to compromise. However, malware attacks may lead to access to the hardware where the unique keys are found.&nbsp;</p> 
 Email OTPs and SMS  
<p>Most websites or apps require users to register an email address or mobile number, often both. Whenever you try to access your account, two-factor authentication will be triggered, and a one-time pin (OTP) will be sent to your mobile number or email address. You must enter the OTP into the login system within a certain period.</p> 
<p>Some sites send multiple OTPs or use authentication apps to generate random codes. It should be noted that these methods are discouraged by the OMB, CISA and other agencies as they are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">susceptible to phishing and interception</a>.</p> 
 Magic Links  
<p>Similar to OTPs, if you have a registered email address or mobile number, the site or app will send a magic link that will give you access to your account. Similar to OTPs, these can pose security risks.</p> 
 Push Notification  
<p>Users receive a push notification to their device, which serves as verification of their identity. When the user clicks the notification, they will gain access to their account.</p> 
 Benefits of Using Passwordless Technology  
<p>According to a study, <a href="https://fox8.com/business/press-releases/globenewswire/8825620/composecure-launches-security-awareness-campaign/#">90% of internet users are worried</a> that their accounts will be <a href="https://dialanerd.co.za/5-ways-hackers-can-get-into-your-network">hacked due to weak passwords</a>. Weak passwords have been identified as a leading cause of data breaches in numerous studies.</p> 
<p>While a <a href="https://cybernews.com/best-vpn/cheapest-vpn/">reliable VPN</a> or Cloud DLP can help curb security breaches, protection and security can be improved with passwordless authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It’s about time sites and apps leverage passwordless technology to protect user data. Here are the benefits of such methods of authentication:</p> 
 Better Security Protection  
<p>Most users only have one password for every site and app that they use. This is a well-known security risk, but many still do it as the alternative is more complicated for them to attempt.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With hackers becoming more sophisticated by the day, simple or complex passwords are no longer dependable as protection. When a cyber attacker breaches one password, multiple accounts become vulnerable. An individual can lose money or their identity in an instant. And when it happens to a company, it can lead to millions of dollars in losses.&nbsp;</p> 
 Reduced Long-Term Costs  
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/12/11/go-passwordless-strengthen-security-reduce-costs/">Passwords are expensive to manage</a>, according to Microsoft. Why? Because users often forget them, and constantly resetting them leads to a loss of productivity when the user can’t sign in. Based on Microsoft’s experience, there are associated hard costs for every hour the Microsoft Helpdesk administrator helps a single user figure out or reset a password.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since rolling out passwordless technology, Microsoft experienced an 87% reduction in soft and hard costs, estimated at $6 million and $3 million, respectively.&nbsp;</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>Most passwordless technologies provide better user experiences. Biometrics, for example, is easy to accomplish each time, with just a touch of a finger or a glance at a camera. Users gain access to their accounts in no time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Compliance With Regulatory Bodies  
<p>Regulatory bodies like the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) have a set of standards that industry players must satisfy when it comes to access controls in a bid to protect sensitive data.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The most common requirements are multi-factor authentication, encryption, and hashing. Passwordless authentication will achieve all these and more. When complemented with automatic bot detection and secure session management, it can prevent broken authentication attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
 What To Look for in Passwordless Authentication Technology  
<p>Now that you know how important passwordless authentication is in the digital age, let’s look at the basic requirements when shopping for solutions.&nbsp;</p> 
 MFA for Desktop Login  
<p>While much passwordless authentication is used for mobile apps, it is best to look for vendors with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for desktop logins. For one, most employees work with desktops in the office. This is also a legal requirement of the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity#:~:text">Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The work login must be complemented with offline capabilities so employees can maintain access while traveling or working remotely.&nbsp;</p> 
 Certifications  
<p>Passwordless technology providers obtain specific certifications as proof of their efficacy and credibility. Some of the top certifications for the technology include:</p> 
  
  <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html">NIST Authenticator Assurance Level</a> - a NIST authentication process with three levels: AAL1 provides some assurance, AAL2 provides high confidence, and AAL3 provides very high confidence.&nbsp;  
  
  
  <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO Certification</a> - the Fast Identity Online (FIDO) alliance grants certification to validate a product’s conformance and interoperability.  
  
  
  <a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa">CISA Certification</a> - the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) certifies companies that audit, control, monitor, and assess an organization’s IT and business systems.  
  
 Easy to Deploy  
<p>Using brand-new technology could disrupt productivity and may even intimidate employees. Find solutions that are easy to integrate into your operations so you can launch the system as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Passwordless technology with a robust SDK is easy to integrate. It should have built-in security controls for optimal functionality.&nbsp;</p> 
 Are Passwords a Thing of the Past?  
<p>Not quite yet, as passwords are still used in many sites and applications. But they are no longer dependable on their own as cybercriminals become more creative and sophisticated in breaching passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Passwordless technology is no longer a luxury; it is the present. Elevated authentication technology will be the future.</p>

 Now that the white paper has been released and the UKGC has outlined its plans, what do players and operators need to know? 



 



<p>After much frustration and numerous delays, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s Gambling Act White Paper </a>was finally released in April 2023. The white paper, which contains proposed changes to the UK’s Gambling Act 2005, aims to more accurately reflect gambling in the digital age, by addressing issues related to VIP customers, slot limits, financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks), and other facets of the UK’s gambling sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the policy paper, many of the main measures will be effective by the summer of 2024. So, as the government initiates a series of consultations to convert policy into practical measures, what challenges lie ahead for the UK gambling sector, and how should UK gambling operators be prepared for the new era?</p>



<p>Numerous conferences and webinars featuring high-profile personnel with close connections to the gambling industry have also been held since April to discuss the white paper’s proposals. The much-anticipated document has certainly given the gambling industry plenty to think about, with many gambling operators pondering how best to react.&nbsp;</p>



 The UK Gambling Commission’s 3-year plan. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission (UKGC)</a>, which will work toward implementing the proposals in the coming years, has recently disclosed its <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/evidence-gaps-and-priorities-2023-2026">Evidence Gaps and Priorities</a> program, set to run from 2023 to 2026, mapping out areas in the UK gambling sector requiring further data collection and research.</p>



<p>In reference to <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/evidence-gaps-and-priorities-2023-2026#:~:text=The%20document%20outlines%20a%20cohesive%20and%20consistent%20framework%20for%20improving%20the%20evidence%20base%2C%20in%20line%20with%20our%20regulatory%20duties">its plan</a>, the UKGC states: “The document outlines a cohesive and consistent framework for improving the evidence base, in line with our regulatory duties.”</p>



<p>The UKGC also plans to enhance its research and evidence-based principles over the next three years, highlighting collaboration and transparency with the <a href="https://www.gamcare.org.uk/about-us/get-involved/lived-experience-forum/#:~:text=The%20Lived%20Experience%E2%80%AFForum%E2%80%AFis%20a%20group%20of%20people%E2%80%AFwho%20have%20been%20affected%20by%20gambling%20related%20harm%20which%20helps%20to%20influence%20wider%20developments%20in%20the%20prevention%2C%20support%2C%20and%20treatment%20of%20gambling%20harms%20at%20GamCare.%C2%A0">Lived Experience Forum</a>, which brings together a group of people that have lived experience of gambling related harms, either from their own gambling or from someone else’s. One of their chief aims is to share stories and insights to help influence wider developments in the prevention, support, and treatment of gambling harms.</p>



<p>The UKGC has designated six key themes of research that will function as the primary focus of its investigations:</p>



  The impact of operator practices<br>  Early gambling-related experiences and gateway products<br>  The variability and range of gambling experiences<br>  Harms and vulnerability related to gambling<br>  Gambling product characteristics and their risks<br>  Illegal gambling, fraud, and crime  



<p>Ultimately, the research process is set to examine how players respond to different gambling-related activities and the associated potential hazards. The Commission looks to understand the variability and range of different gambling experiences. For example, how betting on slots and sports betting can produce dramatically different behavior.</p>



<p>The UKGC also seeks to further its knowledge of the adverse impacts of gambling and the elements contributing to player vulnerability. By determining such potential hazards, they hope to create effective strategies that will potentially protect vulnerable individuals and safeguard them from harm.</p>



<p>With the UK’s gambling white paper now released, the Commission believes the coming years will provide more opportunities to make genuine progress toward making gambling in the UK fairer, safer, and free from crime.</p>



 How can operators prepare for the new UK gambling laws? 



<p>Operators can prepare by reviewing their ongoing policies and practices. This includes ensuring they comply with all relevant laws and regulations and identifying areas that might benefit from change. For instance, increasing the use of KYC checks. It is also crucial for operators to stay updated on any developments in the white paper, including any new proposals or updates to existing regulations.</p>



<p>According to panelist Chris Elliot, partner at law firm Wiggin, in a recent <a href="https://webinars.igamingbusiness.com/iGB/Hitting-the-jackpot-or-coming-up-short-Has-the-Gambling-white-paper-really-hit-the-mark?bmid=7936f8c37ba3">webinar</a> held by iGB in partnership with the Department of Trust, operators will face an imminent demand to figure out which consultations are most impactful for their business. As a short-term response, operators can focus, in the next few months or years, on which consultations matter. Overall, Elliot noted that the white paper presents operators with a clear and coherent policy direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial risk checks are perhaps the major cause of anxiety, with many licensees rowing back from offering VIP or loyalty clubs at online casinos. VIP services are designed to reward customers who spend large sums of money. However, after a report in 2020 that narrowed in on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/02/gambling-report-shows-industrys-reliance-on-loss-making-customers#:~:text=One%20of%20its%20rivals%20took,blow%20to%20the%20industry's%20revenues.">industry’s reliance on problem gamblers</a>, some operators decided to remove VIP schemes altogether.</p>



<p>The now obligated<a href="https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2023/global/gambling-white-paper#:~:text=Unsurprisingly%2C%20the%20white%20paper%20proposes%20new%20obligations%20on%20operators%20to%20conduct%20%E2%80%9Cfinancial%20risk%20checks%E2%80%9D%20on%20customers%20who%20may%20be%20at%20risk%20of%20harm%20due%20to%20unaffordable%20and%20unsustainable%20gambling%20losses"> financial risk checks</a> are likely to significantly impact the quality of the gaming experience. Operators must now carry out financial checks if players incur a £125 net loss within a month or a £500 net loss in a year, with the most rigorous checks effective at a £1000 net loss in one day or £2000 net loss in 90 days.</p>



<p>Bodies such as the <a href="https://www.britishhorseracing.com/">British Horseracing Authority</a> questioned how intrusive these checks might be. However, ministers were quick to emphasize their desire for the checks to be as frictionless as possible. Consequently, operators must conduct these checks with the least friction possible or risk losing customers to other brands where checks feel less intrusive. Operators failing to comply with the new financial risk checks and keeping up to date with new requirements <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/05/02/white-paper-finance-risk/#:~:text=Operators%20could%2C%20therefore%2C%20be%20wary%20of%20the%20new%20finance%20risk%20checks%20and%20ensure%20they%20keep%20up%20to%20speed%20with%20new%20requirements%20to%20avoid%20fines.%C2%A0">could risk fines</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC will also undertake consultation on design rules for online gaming products, to take into account the impact of features such as the speed of play, the illusion of player control, and other features prone to heighten risk.</p>



<p>Considered a high-risk product, online slots are typically associated with long, binge sessions, large losses, and no statutory stake limits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, stake limits will be introduced, consulting on a limit ranging from £2-£15 per spin. Greater protections have also been considered for 18-24-year-old players who are considered more vulnerable, e.g., options of a £2 stake or £4 stake limit per spin or a separate approach predicated on individual risk.</p>



 Who wants to be a VIP anyway? 



<p>There are two parts of the white paper that, either intentionally or not, will heavily impact the online gaming experience of VIPs or high-spending customers: slot limits and financial risk checks. It is highly likely, therefore, that the operators that are currently offering services to VIPS may decide to change tact, and refocus on the mass market.</p>



<p>However, although the now compulsory slot limits will make the process of attracting high rollers more challenging, gambling platforms shouldn’t necessarily neglect this player base. After all, the problem doesn’t lie with high rollers, who can afford to gamble significant amounts, but the one-size fits all approach. Operators must therefore look for innovative ways of offering VIP services, rather than just avoiding offering them altogether. It is therefore crucial for such consultations to find a voice for all customers. Operators need to put customers at the forefront.</p>



 3 further steps toward the new UK gambling laws.&nbsp; 



<p>To prepare for the new, updated and more accountable UK gambling landscape, operators should focus on three specific areas to ensure they meet new and upcoming compliance requirements:</p>


 
 
 
 Evidence 
 

<p>Evidence will remain a keyword for the next five years for the UKGC, and should be for operators too, who must now provide evidence of the decisions they make and the programs they implement.</p>

 
 
 
 Innovation 
 

<p>Innovation will become the answer to many of the challenges posed by the white paper, particularly open banking: one of the key drivers for innovation, alongside  artificial intelligence.</p>

 
 
 
 Collaboration 
 

<p>Collaboration will be essential across different business units and operations to effectively utilize innovative technologies. The goal is to protect consumers and enhance operations by automating processes, all while ensuring consistency and coherence in a thorough and comprehensive manner.</p>

 
 
 
 


 How can operators prepare for the future? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open up, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gambling-latam/">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">Canada</a>, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology that enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer checks</a>. Many current IDV platforms utilize the latest data analytics tools to ensure their players are who they say they are, the age they claim to be, and with the financial means they claim to have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another crucial consideration for operators is the need to focus on and further enhance responsible gambling practices. The key to preparing for the future of the UK’s gambling industry is to be agile, innovative, collaborative, and focused on offering the best possible customer experience.</p>



<p>Our highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">platform for identity proofing in the gaming market</a> allows operators to keep abreast of constantly changing regulations, and new fraud schemes and scams, while ensuring a safe, secure and seamless gaming experience. With our latest round of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/platform-automated-document-liveness-data-check-uk/">platform enhancements</a>, we now offer UK-specific data checks, and financial risk checks, which provide operators with insights into a player’s affordability indicators to comply with the latest updates to the UK Gambling Act.</p>



<p>This not only helps businesses avoid potential fines and reputational damage, but also allows for ongoing monitoring of changes in player circumstances and verification of reported income without the need for additional documentation.</p>

   2023 ForgeRock Breach Report underscores the need for AI-powered identity 

<p>We are excited to announce the release of our fifth annual <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock Identity Breach Report</a>. Our goal each year is to discover what's trending — how enterprises are being breached, how many records are being exposed, and how attackers are getting past security controls that cost companies roughly $88 billion a year.<a>1</a></p>

<p>As in previous years' reports, we have published our key findings, including the industries most vulnerable to attack, the rising costs, and the leading cause of breaches (unauthorized access wins that dubious honor once again!). But this year's report revealed one trend we have not seen before: a significant drop in the number of breached records. In fact, the number was the lowest we've seen in five years. So can we infer that the bad guys are giving up, taking their keyboards and going home? If only!</p>

<p>An obvious challenge of storing so much sensitive personal information in digital form is that this data is highly valuable to criminals. And it appears in the last year that they've been going for quality over quantity – the number of records containing protected health information (PHI) rose by 160%. Why? Because a single healthcare record in the U.S. is now fetching $675 on the black market. Such records can be used widely for fraud, from filing false insurance claims to obtaining prescription drugs illegally. No wonder healthcare is the most highly targeted sector, accounting for 36% of all breaches.</p>

 An emerging threat: they're using AI to devise new attacks (and we can use AI to stop them) 

<p>This year, we've all been hearing a lot about generative AI, which produces various types of content, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data. Expect to hear a lot more about how generative AI makes it easier to impersonate others and perpetrate fraud.</p>

<p>Researchers recently discovered underground hacking communities using ChatGPT to generate malware, create encryption suitable for ransomware, and devise other fraudulent schemes. The new AI wave is contributing to a huge increase in voice and video deepfakes.</p>

<p>As criminals find novel ways to use AI, we can use AI to thwart their efforts. Decisioning AI, which fuels our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a> product, is essential for elevating protection against AI-based threats in a granular and responsive way.</p>

<p>AI that specializes in risk decisioning can take in a range of signals about who is trying to do what –&nbsp;and then determine what they can or cannot do next. Decisioning AI can also prevent attempts to gain unauthorized access by incorporating multiple contextual signals into the decision process, such as login location, IP network reputation, and the distance between login attempts and registered MFA devices.</p>

<p>Organizations with AI-powered identity and access management (IAM) can detect unexpected activity, stopping intruders in real time as they try to authenticate. They can also automate the process of eliminating over-provisioned access that enables attackers to use one compromised account to move laterally to higher-value targets.</p>

 Third-party attacks: do your partners' security practices measure up to yours? 

<p>The 2023 report shows how a tactic that emerged in last year's report is now routine: breaching high-value organizations through their third-party partners and vendors. These attacks increased 136% from the year before and accounted for more than half of all breaches this time around. Attackers know that hospitals, for example, face strict regulations for protecting patient data – but hospitals' suppliers may be less stringent.</p>

<p>In one breach alone, an accounts payable vendor supporting hundreds of healthcare organizations was the victim of a ransomware attack, which allowed attackers to access systems and documents containing patient-related data. The breach affected more than 657 healthcare organizations and almost two million people.</p>

<p>Poorly protected integrations between third-party suppliers and the organizations that rely on them — weak access controls, vulnerable API integrations, or a lack of MFA for employee accounts — can be used to exploit third-party providers. Without strong identity security and governance, API security, and a least-privileged access model, an attacker can breach one workforce user's account and move laterally, not just across a vendor's systems but also its partners' systems, to find and exploit valuable data.</p>

<p>Our report shows that ransomware and unauthorized access were the leading attack vectors in third-party service provider breaches.</p>

 High-value data needs high-quality protection at the identity perimeter 

<p>The underlying theme of this year's report is that it takes only one compromised credential to pave the way for unauthorized access and the exposure of sensitive data, including customer data. This is not news to most of us, but it's worth reasserting now, in light of so many attacks on partner ecosystems.</p>

<p>This trend means that every identity must be secured — not just your workforce users and contractors, but every identity in your partners' organizations as well. Implementing single sign-on (SSO), passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA), and effective identity governance practices is vital for preventing unauthorized access. And this year we're seeing AI become essential in stopping breaches and for handling an onslaught of threats that are themselves AI-generated.</p>

 Creating dynamic data registries allows applications to build authenticated data sources, including collections of identifiers and data schemas. 
 



<p>CORD also introduces additional technological innovations that enhance trust in data exchange over the network. These include verifiable attributes, auditable history, and a comprehensive stack featuring tiered transactions, delegations, authorizations, and governance. The persistent identifiers available on CORD enable long-term verifiability, a requirement for sectors like supply chain management, healthcare, IP management, notarization services, public sector services and other systems where the capability to independently verify the integrity and authenticity of data over extended periods is crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sparknet is designed to provide a fully functional sandbox for application development. It comprises different types of nodes – boot node, full node, validator node and archive node. Today, the CORD project has pre-built binaries available, which can be used to get started quickly <a href="https://dhiway.notion.site/CORD-Sparknet-Deployment-643a902b3d714927b447f42b66c7f55e">view documentation</a>. Coming up – machine instances will be made available to reduce the time required for setting up a node and attaching it to a running network.</p>



<p>The CORD project and Sparknet have been designed to offer an improved experience of blockchain technology specifically for applications which need high scalability and throughput. Applications on Sparknet can be designed around the W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for use cases such as identity verification flows, data sharing and data exchange needs and controlling access to services.</p>



<p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/yaGg4WFEVe">CORD community on Discord</a> to start today.</p>

<p>Fission is ecosystem-obsessed. We believe in collaboration over competition and use this approach to build protocols and invent new tools that benefit everyone. In some cases, we've initiated these efforts. In others, we're active contributors. But in everything, we strive to make the Web more sustainable, equitable, and secure.</p> Fission-Led Efforts <p>UCAN - <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">User Controlled Authorization Networks</a> are a secure way of handling authorization in a distributed system. They use capabilities rather than an access control list, removing the need for a centralized server. UCANs were created by Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, in 2019. <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/">The protocol is open source</a>, and the lovely team at <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3storage</a> has co-authored UCAN specs. Brendan from their team also created a <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/go-ucan/tree/master">go-ucan</a> implementation. We also run <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan">monthly community calls</a> where library implementers, spec maintainers, and users come together to ask questions and build out new features.</p><p>WNFS - Webnative File System is a versioned content-addressable distributed file system with private and public sub-systems. It offers concurrent writes and offline access. <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/spec">The protocol is open source</a>, and we have worked with the community to build a <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/rs-wnfs">Rust implementation</a>. Special thanks to the <a href="https://banyan.computer/">Banyan</a> team, who worked on large files, and the <a href="https://fx.land/">Functionland</a> team, who worked on mobile. Functionland also made a React native version. </p><p>RhizomeDB - RhizomeDB is a far-edge database for querying decentralized data in local-first applications. <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">The protocol is open source</a> and currently under construction.</p><p>IPVM - The Interplanetary Virtual Machine brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">The protocol is open source</a>, and our friends on the <a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a> team have co-authored IPVM specs. We run <a href="https://lu.ma/ipvm">monthly community calls</a> where library implementers and users can collaborate to build out the VM. The <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> Rust implementation is available today. </p><p>Distributed Systems Reading Group - The DSys RG is a monthly virtual meetup led by our Staff Research Engineer, Zeeshan, for folks interested in learning more about distributed systems. The group picks a paper to read each month (classic or contemporary), a volunteer presents a summary, and then a general discussion follows. Check out the YouTube <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey_Adz2pUZFQdw7sp2mSiSbV">playlist</a> for call recordings. </p><p>Secure/Design Working Group - The Secure/Design WG is a product and UX-focused community seeking to make secure outcomes more probable in distributed systems. Initiated by Ryan, Fission's Head of Design, the group hosts <a href="https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-FOmHnDL7EZJ6P5F">monthly community calls</a> and has a <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/secure-design/discussions">GitHub discussion board</a>.</p> Places We Contribute <p>Filecoin - &nbsp;Filecoin is an open-source, public cryptocurrency and digital payment system intended to be a blockchain-based cooperative digital storage and data retrieval method. Fission is a member of the Permissioned Data Working Group, which is focused on enabling permissioned and private data on Filecoin. We're also a FIL Accounts Working Group member, working to integrate UCAN and WalletAuth into FIL Accounts in 2023.</p><p>Protocol Labs Network - The <a href="https://www.plnetwork.io/">PLN</a> comprises hundreds of DWeb and blockchain companies working together to enhance the IPFS and Filecoin ecosystems. Fission is deeply involved with the PLN, from events to the marketing council to building the PL Network Mastodon server. </p><p>CASA - The <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a> is a collection of working groups dedicated to blockchain protocol-agnostic standards. CASA also publishes <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs">Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals</a>, which describe standards created by the different working groups to make blockchains interoperable. Fission initiated <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> in response to MetaMask deprecating ETH encrypt/decrypt, and we are working with others in CASA to document a secure way for blockchain key material to be used for encryption and decryption.</p><p>IPFS - IPFS is a P2P hypermedia protocol that powers content-addressable data storage across a distributed network. Fission submitted one of the first accepted IPIPs, <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-redirect-support-for-ipfs/">Redirect Support for IPFS</a>.</p><p>In conclusion, Fission is involved in many ecosystem projects, with more in the works. If you're building in the distributed or decentralized web and want to work together, please join our Discord and let us know about your project. We'd love to see how we can support you! </p>

<p>The goal of Bluesky is to turn social media into a shared public commons. We don’t want to own people’s social graphs or communities. We want to be a tool that helps communities own and govern themselves.</p>
<p>The reason we focus on communities is that for an open commons to work, there needs to be some sort of structure that protects the people who participate. Safety can’t just be left up to each individual to deal with on their own. The burden this puts on people — especially those who are most vulnerable to online abuse and harassment — is too high. It also doesn’t mirror how things work in the real world: we form groups and communities so that we can help each other. The tooling we’re building for moderation tries to take into consideration how social spaces are formed and shaped through communities.</p>
<p>Today, we’re publishing some proposals for new moderation and safety tooling. The first focuses on user lists and reply controls which can be used for community-driven moderation. The second will focus on moderator services and how they can handle problems that small communities can’t. The third is for Hashtags, which are not directly related to moderation but can have a large effect on customizing what you see. (We wanted to include this to distinguish between the labeling proposal, which is intended to address moderation, and mechanisms for discovery.)</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0001-user-lists-replygating-and-thread-moderation">User Lists, Reply-Gating, and Thread Moderation</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0002-labeling-and-moderation-controls">Labeling and Moderation Controls</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0003-hashtags">Hashtags</a> 
 
<p>These proposals are <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals">published on GitHub</a>, and we’d love to hear your feedback and discussion there. In the rest of this post, we want to first share some insight into why we believe a public commons is important for social media.</p>
 Why build a public commons? 
<p>We’re a public benefit company that was formed with the mission “to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.” We believe that public conversations, which form the basis of a democratic society, should be held in spaces that can be a shared public commons.</p>
<p>A company is an efficient structure for building out a cohesive vision of how things should work, but locking users into our systems would be antithetical to our mission. An open commons can’t be governed at the sole discretion of one global company. We offer services like professional moderators so that we can help protect people and provide a good experience, but we shouldn’t exert total control over everyone’s experience, for all time, with no alternative. Users should be able to walk away from us without walking away from their social lives.</p>
<p>The reason we’re building in decentralization is because we observed that business interests and the open web have a habit of coming into conflict. Third-party developers often get locked out. Moderation policies come into conflict with the diverse interests and needs of different groups of users. Ads push towards algorithms that optimize for engagement. It’s a systemic problem that keeps playing out as centralized social media companies rise and fall.</p>
<p>Some might think this isn’t a big deal. Maybe social media is like a club, and the place can be happening one day and dead the next. Would it be so bad if people just moved on to the next joint...? The problem is that people put their lives and livelihoods into these networks. When a network shuts down, people lose out on a lot: they lose their connections, they lose their creative work, and they lose their places of business. Social networks are not just products; they’ve become digital homes.</p>
<p>Even when things are working correctly on social platforms, there are weird dynamics caused by people’s relationships being mediated by a single company. The Internet is pretty obviously real life in the sense that its management has real-world consequences. When these places control our identities and our ability to connect and to make money, having no way out from the founding company is a precarious situation. The power difference is daunting.</p>
<p>The goal of Bluesky is to rebuild social networking so that there’s not a lock-in to the founding company, which is us. We can try to provide a cohesive, enjoyable experience, but there’s always an exit. Users can move their accounts to other providers. Developers can run their own connected infrastructure. Creators can keep access to their audiences. We hope this helps break the cycle of social media companies coming into conflict with the open web.</p>
 What should this feel like? 
<p>Social media has a reputation for being emotionally chaotic. Some days it can be fulfilling, and other days it can be a box of horrors. If we’re going to succeed in our mission of creating social media that operates as a sustainable public commons, these tools need to not just be good in theory, but actually help create a better social space than what has come before. Our goal for investing in moderation tooling and processes is to create a better public commons for conversations to take place in. Perhaps it can even be a happy, healthy, and predominantly enjoyable space.</p>
<p>Here’s some of what we think it takes to create a great experience:</p>
<p>A great experience should be simple to use. It shouldn’t be overly complex, and there should be sensible defaults and well-run entry points. If things are going well, the average user shouldn’t have to notice what parts are decentralized, or how many layers have come together to determine what they see. However, if conflict arises, there should be easy levers for individuals and communities to pull so that they can reconfigure their experience.</p>
<p>A great experience should recognize that toxicity is not driven only by bad actors. Good intentions can create runaway social behaviors that then create needless conflict. The network should include ways to downregulate behaviors – not just amplify them.</p>
<p>A great experience should respect the burden that community management can place on people. Someone who sets out to help protect others can quickly find themselves responsible for a number of difficult choices. The tooling that’s provided should take into account ways to help avoid burnout.</p>
<p>A great experience should find a balance between creating friendly spaces and over-policing each other. The impulse to protect can sometimes degrade into nitpicking. We should drive towards norms that feel natural and easy to observe.</p>
<p>A great experience should reflect the diversity of views within the network. Decisions that are subjective should be configurable. Moderation should not force the network into a monoculture.</p>
<p>Finally, a great experience should remember that social networking can be pleasant one day and harsh the next. There should be ways to react to sudden events or shifts in your mood. Sometimes you need a way to be online but not be 100% available.</p>
 What’s our development process? 
<p>During the private beta, we’ve been actively responding to user feedback. For example, based on user feedback, we recently introduced an optional “context” field to add a few lines of text to reports so that moderators can better understand issues that require more context to make a decision on. With these upcoming proposals, we’re looking for feedback ahead of time so we can get to the best outcomes quickly and prepare for opening up the network.</p>
<p>The proposals we’re publishing have been in the works for awhile; we focused on moderation and safety from the earliest moments of developing Bluesky and the AT Protocol, even if they didn’t always appear to be front and center. We’ve been fleshing out our ideas over the last few months through the practical experience of engaging with users during the Bluesky app’s beta. In designing these, we researched existing tooling implemented on other sites, discussed with users from different communities on the app, consulted with trust &amp; safety advisors, and above all, constantly asked ourselves what tools would reduce harm, protect people, and decrease the likelihood of bad outcomes.</p>
<p>Decisions such as who has the right to speak or moderate an online space are intrinsically controversial. And it isn’t just about platforms making moderation decisions. For example, the ability to moderate replies to your own threads introduces complex tradeoffs around safety, counterspeech, and accountability. Replies are an area where some of the nastiest forms of abuse can happen, so we felt that per-thread moderation was a good idea. But there are downsides, too: For example, if a thread contains misinformation, then giving reply controls to the author means they might use it to suppress corrections from other users. Our hypothesis, reflected in the moderation proposals we’re sharing, is that giving users more tools to protect themselves from harassment is worth some downsides like not always having the record corrected in the replies.</p>
<p>We’re presenting proposals for community discussion and developer feedback to help develop a rough consensus around these approaches — these tools won’t be effective unless people actually use them. They’re a set of tools that are meant to overlap, work together, and provide the building blocks for new ideas.</p>
 An updated Community Guidelines 
<p>In addition to working on moderation tooling, we’ve also been developing new policies and processes to moderate the services we run. As we explain in the community guidelines:</p>
<p>Bluesky Social is one service built on top of the AT Protocol. While we won’t always be able to control everything that happens on other services that use the AT Protocol, we take our responsibility to the users of Bluesky Social seriously. Our community guidelines are designed to promote a safe and enjoyable experience. To achieve this goal, we moderate the content on Bluesky Social, and you can also adjust content filters within the app according to your preferences.</p>
<p>An important site of moderation is the servers themselves, and we want our policies to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for users who enter the network through our services. If the moderation tooling we’re building is like the building blocks and foundations of a city, the norms and policies we’re setting are how we’re actually going to run the city.</p>
<p>For the Bluesky servers we run (that is, the Bluesky app you’ve been using up to this point), we’re publishing updated Community Guidelines next week, linked to in our Terms of Service, which includes the following:</p>
 
 Treat others with respect. For example, no:
 
 Threats of violence or physical harm, or content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies violence against people, groups, or animals 
 Repeated harassment or abuse directed at a specific person or group 
 Encouraging self-harm or suicide 
 Promoting hate or extremist conduct that targets people or groups based on their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation 
 Depictions of excessive violence, torture, dismemberment, or non-consensual sexual activity 
 Misleading impersonation of other individuals, organizations, or entities 
 
 
 
<p>The actions that we take to enforce these guidelines will include removing individual posts and suspending and removing users from our services.</p>
<p>In the future, other services built on the AT Protocol might choose to adopt their own community guidelines that differ from ours. In a federated model, each server has discretion over what they choose to serve and who they choose to connect to. If you disagree with a server’s moderation policies, you can take your account, social connections, and data to another service.</p>
 Proposals 
<p>We’ve created a new GitHub repository to host some of these proposals to streamline discussion. You can find the links to them here:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0001-user-lists-replygating-and-thread-moderation">User Lists, Reply-Gating, and Thread Moderation</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0002-labeling-and-moderation-controls">Labeling and Moderation Controls</a> 
 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0003-hashtags">Hashtags</a> 
 
<p>These proposals, and our implementation of them, are not the end of what is possible in an open network — they are part of a process of development that will go through multiple iterations. Other companies or communities can also help set norms and build tooling, but we are investing in a best-effort first pass at creating a safe, pleasant, resilient public social commons. Your feedback, both in the app and through GitHub, is appreciated. Thanks for joining us on this journey.</p>

<p>This Dev Pulse brings a new release for the 0.1.x branch of Holochain. We’re still recommending that you stick with this branch for now, as we’re still troubleshooting performance issues in the 0.2.x branch.</p><p>Meanwhile, a goodly number of our team and community are en route or at DWeb Camp, where we’ll be involved in all sorts of ways — including being a sponsor!</p> Holochain 0.1.5: Backwards compatibility fixes <p>As you may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-01x-series-skip-014-wait-for-015">read</a> in the last Dev Pulse, I recommended that you not upgrade your hApp and userbase to Holochain 0.1.4, and instead wait for 0.1.5. Well here’s 0.1.5, with a bugfix for the broken dev environment (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2252?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2252</a>) as well as:</p>  There’s a compatibility path for a change to the database schema introduced in 0.1.4, so you can use 0.1.5 on databases created by older conductors (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2253?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2253</a>).  Some housekeeping tasks backported from 0.2: removal of the testing framework from the default build of the conductor (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>), and repair of a remote signals test (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2318?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2318</a>).  Breaking (sort of): 0.1.4 fixed a bug whereby a DNA’s name was mistakenly included when hashing the DNA. This broke some apps in the wild, so it’s been reverted (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2312?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2312</a>) and the correct functionality will appear in 0.2 onwards. This is not a breaking change if you’re updating your hApp from Holochain 0.1.3 to 0.1.5; it’s only breaking if you’re updating from 0.1.4.  <p>Additionally, you may want to read all the changes in 0.1.4 (with the exception that the last bullet point above reverts a change introduced in 0.1.4). Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/compare/holochain-0.1.3...holochain-0.1.5?ref=blog.holochain.org#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed">full changelog since 0.1.3</a>.</p> Known issues   In large-scale stress tests (around 200+ highly active nodes per conductor) we’re noticing some performance issues. These show up as zome call timeouts, high virtual memory usage, and dropped WebSocket connections — in short, the conductor gradually becomes unresponsive and needs to be restarted. We’re all-hands-on-deck troubleshooting this issue right now, and we believe it might also be present in 0.2.x and 0.3.x.  An out-of-bounds memory error is occasionally happening; depending on the circumstances, this can cause subsequent zome calls to fail. We’re putting in more tracing throughout the codebase to diagnose issues like this.  There’s a rounding error in the sharding algorithm that causes mismatches in the region of data being synced. (You can find out about regions in this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00147-quantised-gossip">Dev Pulse</a> from last year.) As we’re nearing the end of the six-month support promise for 0.1, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2332?ref=blog.holochain.org">fix for that</a> will land in 0.2.1.   Launcher release notes  0.9.4: UX improvements, bugfixes <p>This version has a few fixes, including better App Library download feedback, improved German translation, better error handling, and a bugfix for web forms on Linux.</p> 0.10.0: Holochain 0.1.5 support, more UX improvements <p>This version comes with Holochain 0.1.5. And it continues to get UX polish thanks to our friend Tibet Sprague from <a href="https://terran.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Terran Collective</a>. He’s been redesigning various parts of the UI to make things more accessible for everyone.</p><p>The most important UX change is mostly invisible — the hApp store no longer requires you to be part of the DevHub DNA and sync all the data. Instead, your node will look for a DevHub host and request the download from them. This means you don’t have to wait until you’re a full peer in the DevHub network before you can download hApp packages, which speeds up the first-run experience.</p>A screenshot of the new settings pane in the Launcher UI, showing the amount of resources each Holochain version is using, along with settings for each hApp, which used to be on the main pane.&nbsp;<p>There are a lot of changes; too many to list here. Just <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">download the Launcher</a> and see for yourself. And this is just a start — you’ll see more UX work in future releases!</p><p>This version is a breaking change, in that hApps that you installed in previous versions of the Launcher won’t show up in this version.</p> Known issues <p>Launcher is built on a Rust library called <a href="https://tauri.app/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tauri</a>, which is similar to Electron but of course Rust-based. It uses the operating system’s default web view library to display UIs. As such, we inherit any bugs that exist upstream in Tauri. Here are the ones we know about:</p>  Downloading files from a hApp that supports it is not supported on macOS.  App windows don’t have their own menu on macOS.  Trying to open a hApp UI that’s already open but minimised will not bring it to the front on some Linux distros.  Because of the dependency on the system web view, your hApp UI should target the built-in browser of the oldest desktop OS that your userbase is using.  As an example of this from the Launcher UI itself, on macOS Monterey the toggle switch for the new ‘developer mode’ (which allows you to become a DevHub host and upload packages to the hApp store) doesn’t toggle on.  hApp UIs that use WebRTC aren’t supported on Linux.  Launcher can freeze on macOS when an app is opened in full-screen view.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.10.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Download Launcher 0.9.5</a>.</p> Quick update on Holochain 0.2.1 progress <p>We were planning to release a new version quick on the heels of Holochain 0.2.0 to repair both a peer discovery issue and some network performance issues. The peer discovery issue is fixed, but we’re still troubleshooting the performance issues where there is less to no gossip between peers until one of them publishes a new piece of data. In doing so, we're also building more robust testing tooling to get finer-grained insight into them. We expect to release 0.2.1 soon given what we've recently learned.</p><p>At this point, we recommend that you stick with 0.1.5. You’re still welcome to try out the 0.2.x series releases (and dev candidates in the 0.3.x series — in fact <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a> is in the process of upgrading to 0.3 already); just be prepared for the aforementioned bottlenecks. We’re also planning to roll some of the work already done on 0.3 into 0.2.1, giving it features we didn’t expect the 0.2.x series to have. Stay tuned!</p> Getting ready for DWeb Camp <p>We’re really looking forward to <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> in Navarro, CA, USA, which started on Wednesday, 21 June. A good number of us from the Holochain community and team from across the world are attending, volunteering, giving talks, hosting discussions, and taking care of meeting spaces. Not only that, but we’ll be a camp sponsor for the first time this year.</p><p>DWeb Camp will be a time for connecting, making new relationships with devs who don’t yet know that Holochain is the thing they’re looking for, and of course showing the DWeb community what Holochain can do. The theme this year is ‘Discovering Flows’, which is a lovely description of what happens there. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-dweb-is-an-ensemble-piece/">really enjoyed</a> last year. We’ll be sharing how this year went when we get back!</p>Art and Eric lead a conversation on DAOs at DWeb Camp 2022, with a few others from the Holochain community also among the participants.&nbsp;<p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@promemouse?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Dian Yu</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ZV7CO7hpZdA?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

  WTR II applies to EU-based Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and also comes into play when these EU-based CASPs send crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.  CASPs must collect and retain sender and receiver information for crypto transfers exceeding 1,000&nbsp;Euros.  Through WTR II, the EU is actively seeking to enhance transparency and accountability in crypto transactions.  <p>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies, regulatory frameworks are constantly playing catch-up.</p><p>The European Union (EU), known for being a forerunner in policy changes, has once again taken a bold leap forward with the introduction of Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II), sometimes called Transfer of Funds regulation. And as these regulations tighten, the crypto sector must step up to the challenge of ensuring compliance while preserving user privacy and security.</p><p>WTR II, in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel Rule, aims to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terror financing. It mandates the exchange of sender and receiver information during crypto transactions.</p><p>With this requirement, the EU aims to usher in a paradigm shift, significantly affecting anonymity, which many would rate as the most prized feature of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The key to navigating these new regulatory waters lies in finding a solution that can reconcile the need for compliance with the equally important need to safeguard user data. One such promising solution is <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Veriscope</a>, Shyft Network’s very own Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>With Shyft Veriscope, we not only allow for the seamless exchange of user data amongst VASPs, but we also manage to do so without storing data on third-party servers or our own, keeping data privacy&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s peer-to-peer model also helps VASPs comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. Moreover, it offers an automated process that minimizes any negative impact on user experience, a major concern for many crypto businesses.</p><p>Although the EU isn’t likely to endorse a specific method for user data exchange, the onus is on VASPs to find a way to conform to the new regulations with minimal disruption. This means adopting a solution like Shyft Veriscope that can offer the necessary balance between compliance and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As the crypto industry grapples with these challenges, solutions like Shyft Veriscope represent a beacon of hope. It demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence between regulatory compliance and user privacy, thereby shaping the future of cryptocurrencies in a progressively regulated environment.</p> When Does WTR II&nbsp;Apply? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) primarily applies under two key circumstances.</p><p>The first is when a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP), such as a cryptocurrency exchange, is involved in facilitating a crypto transaction. This facilitation includes activities such as executing, managing, or advising on the transaction.</p><p>The second circumstance is geographic in nature. If the CASP operates or has its registered office within the European Union (EU), the WTR II comes into effect. This geographic condition makes the WTR II relevant not just within the EU but also when an EU-based CASP engages in crypto transactions with entities outside the&nbsp;EU.</p> Information Obligations <p>For crypto-asset transfers, WTR II places obligations on the CASPs to gather and retain specific information about the transaction’s sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary). The aim is to ensure traceability of transactions, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability.</p><p>In case of missing or incomplete information about a transaction, it could be flagged as potentially risky. This necessitates the CASP to assess whether the transaction might be suspicious, possibly warranting reporting to the relevant financial intelligence unit under the EU’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing legislative framework.</p><p>As such, WTR II, in its essence, functions as a comprehensive guideline, not merely a regulatory rule. It fosters transparency, safeguards users, and combats illicit activities in the dynamic world of crypto-assets. And hence, for businesses, comprehending the nuances of its scope is crucial to navigating the compliance landscape where the stakes are high, and adherence to rules is paramount.</p> Exceptions to the&nbsp;Rule <p>EU’s Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR II) has a broad reach, yet it’s not an all-encompassing rule for every crypto transaction. There are certain scenarios where WTR II doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>For instance, when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) acting independently, WTR II provisions do not apply. Why is it so? WTR II assumes that both parties involved are aware of their actions and responsibilities.</p><p>The same goes for person-to-person crypto transfers without a CASP’s involvement. In such cases, the transaction happens directly between individuals, not unlike a cash handover, and thus, WTR II doesn’t apply in such a circumstance.</p> Self-Hosted Nuances <p>Now, let’s navigate the complex world of self-hosted wallets. These are personal crypto wallets that users manage independently, unlike wallets provided by a crypto exchange.</p><p>If a CASP’s client sends or receives funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must collect information about both parties. However, they typically aren’t required to verify the self-hosted wallet user’s identity.</p><p>But here’s the twist: when a transaction involves more than 1000 Euros and is facilitated by a CASP to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP has to ensure that the client indeed controls the self-hosted wallet.</p><p>Picture this as a safety check to verify the identity of the individual involved in a high-value transaction, similar to the protocols banks&nbsp;follow.</p><p>However, for transfers that occur between accounts managed entirely within the framework of the CASPs — like those on a cryptocurrency exchange — this 1000 Euro threshold for additional verification doesn’t&nbsp;apply.</p><p>So, while WTR II applies to most crypto transactions, it still leaves room to provide enough flexibility.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR&nbsp;II)? <p>The Wire Transfer Regulation II (WTR II) is an initiative of the European Union intended to curb the purported use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> Q2: Who does WTR II apply&nbsp;to? <p>WTR II applies to all EU-based CASPs and cases where an EU-based CASP sends crypto transactions to a non-EU-based party.</p> Q3: What information obligations does WTR II place on&nbsp;CASPs? <p>WTR II imposes specific obligations on CASPs with regard to crypto-asset transfers. CASPs are required to collect and hold detailed information about both the sender (originator) and the recipient (beneficiary) involved in a transaction. And if the necessary information is incomplete or missing, the transaction could be flagged as potentially risky.</p> Q4: Are there exceptions to WTR&nbsp;II? <p>Yes, exceptions to WTR II exist. For instance, the regulation does not apply when both the originator and the beneficiary of a transaction are CASPs acting independently. Similarly, it does not govern person-to-person crypto transfers conducted without a CASP’s involvement.</p> Q5: How does WTR II affect self-hosted wallets? <p>WTR II has a specific impact on self-hosted wallets. When a client of a CASP transfers funds to or from a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must gather information about both parties. However, when a transaction exceeds 1000 Euros and involves a self-hosted wallet, the CASP must confirm that the client truly controls the self-hosted wallet.</p> Final Note <p>As the crypto industry continues to expand and mature, regulatory frameworks like WTR II are playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of crypto transactions. The key challenge lies in balancing the need for robust AML and CTF measures while preserving the privacy and security that make cryptocurrencies attractive.</p><p>Amid this shifting landscape, solutions like Shyft Veriscope are proving instrumental. By enabling CASPs to comply with WTR II and FATF’s Travel Rule in a manner that respects user privacy, Shyft Veriscope demonstrates the potential for harmonious coexistence of regulatory compliance and data protection. This is a significant step forward in navigating the compliance challenges and the fast-paced evolution of the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>Indeed, the introduction of WTR II serves as a stern reminder that regulations are as much a part of the crypto industry as innovation and disruption. By understanding and adapting to these changes, the crypto sector can continue its upward trajectory while ensuring a safer and more transparent environment for all participants.</p><p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>With the explosion of Software as a service applications, organizations are juggling a lot – from rollout out hybrid/remote work policies; supporting employee, contractor and vendor hiring and off-boarding; managing various identities, and ensuring only authorized users have access to what their job requires. This work has become critical to ensuring smooth processes, preventing account take over (ATO) attacks and reducing costs.</p>
<p>System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is transforming Identity and Access Management in SaaS platforms, workflow, and Identity lifecycle management. SCIM is an open standard protocol designed to simplify the management of identities in cloud-based applications and services. SCIM provides predefined schema for users and groups, and a RESTful API, for automatic user provisioning and deprovisioning, making it easier for systems and applications to communicate identity-related data.</p>
<p>The key benefits for using SCIM based provisioning are preventing account takeover, mitigate the risk of dormant accounts, and achieve cost savings through permission rightsizing and streamlined onboarding &amp; offboarding processes.</p>
<p>User Provisioning &amp; De-provisioning</p>
<p>For an organization that uses multiple SaaS applications like O365, Salesforce, Slack, WorkDay, Webex, and Dropbox amongst others, manually creating and managing user access for these applications is time consuming and carries high security risks. For example when a new employee joins the organization, an IT administrator would have to individually create access across all these applications, a process that can take hours, if not days. Similarly, when an employee leaves or changes roles within the organization, it is critical to swiftly revoke all access to prevent potential misuse. Implementing SCIM can streamline and automate this process. For instance, when integrated with an Identity Provider (IdP) like Entrust IDaaS, any change in the user status gets automatically updated across all the SaaS applications connected with IDaaS. So, a new user added to Entrust IDaaS gets automatically provisioned in Salesforce, Slack, Workday, Webex, and Dropbox, while an employee leaving the organization gets deactivated immediately, thus preventing unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Streamlining Workflow Management</p>
<p>Each application has it’s own user management, making it challenging to maintain data consistency. For example, if an employee moves from one department to another, their access rights need to be updated in each application – which can lead to inconsistencies if done manually. However, with SCIM, changes made in the central identity management system like Entrust IDaaS is automatically propagated through all connected applications, ensuring up-to-date and consistent access privileges, which enhances workflow management and overall efficiency.</p>
<p>Identity Lifecycle Management</p>
<p>For a rapidly growing tech startup, frequent identity lifecycle events include onboarding new employees, assigning them to projects, updating their roles, and offboarding them when leaving the organization. Each ‘identity lifecycle event’ must be accurately reflected in the organization’s systems and applications to prevent dormant or under / over privileged accounts that could cause potential security threats.</p>
<p>Automating user provisioning and deprovisioning process across different platforms through SCIM will ensure that the update is mirrored across all integrated systems and applications. Direct integration with HR Systems like Workday can kickstart the entire Identity Lifecycle Management of the new, moving or departing employee. Such automated governance with least privilege access helps organizations deploy zero trust framework / architecture (ZTA) that leads to sustained high levels of security.</p>
<p>Cost-Saving</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening security and lifecycle management, deploying SCIM can also yield cost savings through automation, reducing the manual effort involved in identity management. For example, if an IT administrator typically spends 20 minutes managing each user’s access rights across five different applications, then an organization with 1000 employees will need to invest more than 330 hours just for a single round of access updates. With SCIM, this effort can be cut down, saving substantial labor costs while also minimizing the possibility of human errors that could lead to even more costly security incidents.</p>
<p>SCIM is not only a protocol for managing digital identities; it is an essential tool that can enhance an organization’s security posture through a Zero Trust framework, streamlined workflows, and yield cost savings. By automating and standardizing identity management, SCIM alleviates the risks associated with account takeover, reduces the potential security threats posed by dormant and over privileged accounts, and introduces significant efficiency into identity lifecycle management processes.</p>
<p>Entrust IDaaS provides out of box SCIM capabilities to organizations of all sizes.</p>

<p>In a recent survey that spanned six countries, Entrust found that while progress is being made in the way that governments and citizens interact, there is definitely room for improvement.</p>
<p>The vast majority of respondents (84%) interact with governments between one and five times each year, pursuing typical outcomes – a driver’s license, paying taxes, and traveling. It’s no surprise that almost four out of ten respondents (39%) prefer the convenience of web portals over more traditional interaction methods such as mail (5%) and in-person (15%). And while preferences favor digital interactions, governments still must deliver the services and the credentials that citizens require − offering both digital and physical to ensure equal access to services and meet the preferences of its citizens and service providers alike.</p>
<p>Citizen interaction preferences</p>
<p></p>
<p>To meet the evolving needs of its citizens, governments are working with the private sector to deliver the outcomes citizens require. We’re heading toward a simple, smooth, and secure user experience from entry into the system, through the issuance of credentials and completing the required transactions – all relying on a single chain of trust that ensures the privacy and security of personal information and government systems.</p>
 Only half rated their digital interactions as positive 
<p>Overall, respondents rated their last government interaction at 7.1 on a 10-point scale. But when it comes to their last digital interaction, barely half (54%) rated those interactions as positive. While a 7.1 overall rating isn’t terrible by any means, there’s room for improvement. And it’s telling that only half of citizens, who are moving to faster and more convenient methods of interaction, were left with a positive impression. There’s clearly work to be done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Citizens’ pain points with government interactions</p>
<p></p>
 Governments are paying attention…and taking action 
<p>In the countries we surveyed, citizens improving customer service is important to respondents. And many governments know it’s time to step up and simplify end-user experiences, as well as drive operational efficiencies and greater security. In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2023/entrust-wins-uk-home-office-tender-to-expand-digitization-of-immigration-processes">a new solution</a> enables a streamlined, more seamless way for travelers coming to the UK to be identified via biometrics, bringing more secure border control and speeding up identity and border checks. In the United States, “Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience” is the number two priority on the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/pma/cx/">President’s management agenda</a>. The administration has gone so far as to designate 14 agencies as “High Impact Service Providers” and put the following strategies in place:</p>
 
 Improve the service design, digital products, and customer-experience management of Federal <a href="https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/HISP-listing-2021.pdf">High Impact Service Providers</a> by reducing customer burden, addressing inequities, and streamlining processes. 
 Design, build, and manage government service delivery for key life experiences that cut across Federal agencies. 
 Identify and prioritize the development of Federal shared products, services, and standards that enable simple, seamless, and secure customer experiences across the Federal Government1. 
 
 Digital interactions are important and preferred, but phone, mail, and in-person remain important 
<p>Undoubtedly, phone calls, mail, and in-person interactions will remain among peoples preferences, and governments have the responsibility to make these services equally available to all. Citizens must have digital, physical, and hybrid credentials to fulfill the outcomes they’re after and the Entrust survey responses bear that out. People are asking for quick, convenient services at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Below is how respondents ranked what is important to them:</p>



1
Service when and where it’s needed
55%


2
Secure, easy, and convenient identity verification
53%


3
Customer data privacy and security is a priority
49%


4
Self-service capabilities
44%


5
Ability to track progress
44%


6
Online forms
43%


7
Consistent user experience across government organizations
36%


8
Engage on behalf of others
8%



<p>People are asking for the customer experience they’ve come to expect from their favorite retailers and banks. </p>
 Getting to simple, smooth, and secure. There’s good news and bad news. 
<p>The bad news is that from a technical perspective, simple, smooth, and secure experiences crash head-on into:</p>
 
 Legacy apps 
 Multiple independent solution providers 
 A growing and dynamic threat landscape 
 
<p>The good news is that the challenges presented on the journey to becoming simple, smooth, and secure are being overcome and improvements are within reach.</p>
 
 Composable systems break older models of rigid software development practices and introduce modularity − allowing organizations to quickly design, build, manage, and change systems as the needs of organizations evolve. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) address connectivity to legacy systems and stem the proliferation of vendors, and costs, simplifying and shortening the citizen experience. Systems become easier to deploy, maintain, and scale. 
 A single chain of trust reduces the attack surface and keeps citizen information safe. 
 Enabling the right credential for the right transaction means
 
 No citizen is left behind 
 People get what they need for the outcome they seek leading to happier citizens and increased trust in government 
 Strong identities and authentication methods can lower the risk of fraud 
 
 
 
<p>The next blog in our government-citizen series interactions will explore the similarities and differences among countries and age groups. Are we all really all that different?</p>
 Methodology 
<p>To assess the perceptions, experiences, and preferences of citizens about their interactions with government, Entrust engaged an independent research firm in May 2023. 3,501 online survey responses were received from people between the ages of 18 and 75 residing in Australia, Canada, France, Germany UK, and USA. Only responses that met age and geographic qualifications were included, and respondents had to have interacted with the government in the previous 12 months.</p>

 Exploring the challenges, opportunities, and necessity for cross-functional collaboration. 



 



<p>Attempting to draw similarities between two different industries may not seem the most productive use of one’s time, but there are valuable insights to be gained, if you look hard enough. Let us take the financial services and gambling industries, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides the obvious risks in the financial market and the speculative nature of trading, the banking and gambling industry have more in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5370364/">common than one might expect</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both face similar risks, <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/handle/123456789/86115">including</a> operational risk, regulatory compliance, money laundering, liquidity, solvency risk, IT and cyber risks, and reputational risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both invariably have an Enterprise Risk Management function, which, as the name suggests, carries out risk management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As financial services and the gambling industry are both prime targets for fraud and money laundering, there is value in organizations from both sectors implementing a dedicated KYC program to help them comply with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">Terrorist Financing</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ0KHXidf_AhWCgVwKHacTBaQQFnoECA8QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgdpr-info.eu%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1akHzzz224Oq1yU0pd6qSw&amp;opi=89978449">GDPR regulations</a>.</p>



 Blocking new illegal, intertwined paths. 



<p>In April 2023, a first of a kind trial took place in Basildon Crown Court in the UK. <a href="https://www.essex.police.uk/news/essex/news/news/2023/april/man-jailed-after-betting-fraud/">Jon Howard was found guilty of defrauding Bet365</a>, after the Essex Serious Crime Directorate confirmed he had used more 1,000 identities to abuse bonuses, which, had he been successful, would have netted him £236,000. (Read more about some of the ways that criminals abuse sign-up bonuses in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">‘Exploring bonus abuse in gambling’</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Howard tried to legitimatize these funds via a mortgage application where he added details of a fake job. He was recently sentenced to a five-year jail sentence. In both gambling and financial services, fraudsters continue to find more creative ways in exposing weaknesses in controls. And, as the latest tricks tend to appear in one sector before the other, there is significant incentive for collaboration between the two industries.</p>



 Desperately seeking a global gambling regulatory framework. 



<p>The gambling industry has encountered fast-paced growth in recent years. Indeed, the proliferation of high-speed internet and mobile devices have made it even easier for individuals to access online gambling platforms from the comfort of their own homes or on the go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This convenience factor has attracted a larger number of people to engage in online gambling activities. COVID-19 and multiple quarantine periods further cemented the expansion of online gambling. Despite the rapid growth, many national authorities and regulatory bodies have been slow off the mark in updating regulations or providing the industry with some much-needed clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the UK’s much delayed revision of the Gambling Act 2005 in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">‘Preparing for the UK gambling white paper’</a> here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gambling industry is categorized as a Designated Non-Financial Business and Profession (DNFBP), providing gambling services for entertainment purposes. The gambling industry also engages in similar activities to financial institutions, such as accepting and withdrawing funds. As such, players in both the gambling industry and financial services industry are required to hold a license to operate in most European Union (EU) countries. Traditionally, if you wanted to operate in multiple EU countries, then you would need multiple licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, however, there have been substantial efforts to ease the headache of operating throughout Europe. In fact, <a href="https://www.egba.eu/eu-market/licensing/">multi-licensing has been adopted in 25 out of 29 European countries</a>,&nbsp; introducing full multi-licensing for all regulated online gambling products, according to the European Gaming &amp; Betting Association. In 2018, the EGBA <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2018/12/Manifesto-A-EU-Framework-for-Online-Gambling-2.0.pdf">published a manifesto</a> to appeal for a globalized regulatory framework for online gambling operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recommending a deepened standardization in the business, the Association is pushing for a more comprehensive regulatory framework to avoid “unnecessary compliance and supervision costs” and limit the risks of non-compliance. This would also have a direct impact on the risk exposure to fraud and money laundering. In fact, during its <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en#documents">periodic supra-national risk assessments</a> in 2022, the European Commission said it <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/compliance/eu-ups-money-laundering-risk-in-online-gambling-to-highest-level/">considered online gambling</a> “to be especially vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing, with this risk categorized as&nbsp; the highest possible risk level.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, gambling operators would be wise to take a few lessons from the financial services industry to better understand its regulations, and the processes they use to protect themselves against fraud, money laundering, and other types of financial crime. As KYC programs are slowly becoming the norm within multiple industries – from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> – gambling operators should follow suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Step one should be for all gambling operators to familiarize themselves with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering</a> (AML) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/#:~:text=Terrorism%20financing%20encompasses%20numerous%20actions,instruments%20to%20support%20terrorist%20operations.">Terrorist Financing</a> regulations. Step two is to implement stronger KYC mechanisms. With a robust KYC program in place, gambling operators can anticipate potential regulatory developments and be ready with top notch compliance programs.</p>

 The opportunities that lie ahead. 



<p>Banks encounter significant challenges when collaborating with gambling operators due to the elevated levels of risk and potential for fraud. One of the key challenges is to navigate complex regulatory requirements and AML laws that apply to gambling activities. The cash-intensive nature of the gambling industry further exacerbates the risk, as large financial transactions only increase the potential for illicit funds to be circulated. Understandably, therefore, banks are far more reticent to work with gambling operators, as they represent a higher risk. But there is still value in collaboration, or as mentioned, at least being aware of what is happening in the other&nbsp; industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between credit card fraud, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse</a>, price scraping or account takeover, gambling platforms are often at the forefront of fraud trends, and how best to counter them. Additionally, the gambling industry’s ability to deal with multiple means of payments (<a href="https://www.egba.eu/home-page/at-the-forefront-of-online-payments-innovation/">33 different types in 2018 alone for EGBA members</a>) just goes to show how expansive their experience is in tackling online payment fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, it is no secret that gambling operators are leaders in cultivating customer engagement. Many utilize the latest technology and data analytics to provide seamless, personalized customer journeys, enhance the user experience and retain players. Both <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintechs</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">traditional banks</a> should learn from gambling operators and take similar steps to improve the customer experience by meeting and even exceeding customer expectations.</p>



 United we stand. 



<p>While the regulatory framework may bear a heavier weight on financial services than gambling operators, the latter can certainly learn from the best controls and monitoring practices of the former.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To protect against fraud and money laundering, collaboration is a must. As most fraudsters tend to work across multiple industries and targets at any one time, banking and gambling operators can benefit greatly from exchanging information and best practices. For example, by providing feedback on fraud detection systems, secure payment processing or even staff training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professional associations, such as <a href="https://www.egba.eu/">EGBA</a> or <a href="https://www.acfe.com/">Association of Certified Examiner</a>, are two legitimate places to collaborate and exchange. More informal channels like forums or event panels are other valuable channels to gain intelligence on the latest fraud techniques and money laundering trends, and the best ways of identifying criminal and suspicious activities.</p>

<p>The eco-conscious movement is unmistakably a global environmental concern that continues to gain momentum as we see the impacts to our daily lives. Consumers and <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement">world leaders</a> recognize that carbon footprints must be reduced, requiring and challenging their business partners (vendors, customers, etc.) to make measurable changes now. Many organizations are taking calculated eco-actions in various product segments: everything from electronics, housewares, clothing, and batteries to heavy duty motors and industrial equipment. Careful lifecycle considerations are evaluated at every product stage, from design and concept to end-of-life.</p>
<p>Credit cards are no different. Consumers demand eco-friendly materials, card recycling programs, and even more importantly, the assurance that their bank or credit union is actively engaged in these programs. Increasingly, many products now demonstrate their own unique eco-journey to include these lifecycle eco-considerations along the way – packaging, production efficiency, waste, green-certified buildings, etc. The mere ability to recycle something isn’t enough and even though the term “eco” is many times in absentia of standards or regulations, it’s becoming one of the highest priorities in consumer goods.</p>
<p>What exactly is the scope of eco-cards and why is it important? Traditional credit card materials are typically some variant of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), widely known as the <a href="https://www.ciel.org/project-update/plastic-climate-the-hidden-costs-of-a-plastic-planet/">biggest contributor to global plastics proliferation</a>. Although the credit card form factor is small, global annual card production is estimated to be 3.3 billion cards in 2023, drawing scrutiny around the total lifecycle, use case, and further debate around physical vs. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/04/trends-in-passport-personalization/">digital card</a> issuance. Purists believe the ultimate form of an environmentally conscious card is a digital one. Realistically, the continuation of hybrid credential issuance (the issuance of both digital and physical credentials to cardholders) will remain steady in the near future as <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2022/us-consumers-prefer-seamless-and-fully-integrated-payment-experiences-new-entrust-survey-reveals">consumers demand both alternatives for different use cases</a>.</p>
<p>More and more companies are driving sustainability efforts into their initiatives, with an increasing trend in qualifying eco-materials. The breadth of these green programs is far and wide, varying from a fractional percentage in material reduction to biodegradable, recycled PVC, PLA, PETG, reclaimed ocean plastic, and everything in between. <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/blogs/2022/11/30/sustainable-banking-payment-cards/">ABI forecasts an 18% decrease</a> in the use of PVC in global card production by 2026, but the full impact of material changes can only be realized if cards are fully recycled at the end of their life vs. ending up in a landfill. Educated consumers recognize companies who promote their <a href="https://www.entrust.com/legal-compliance/environmental-social-and-governance">sustainability programs</a>, looking to bridge environmental awareness with overall product viability. In the absence of eco standards and regulation, companies are looking to partner with material suppliers, equipment providers, and logistic services who have demonstrable programs in place that can help meet overall sustainability goals. To this end, it’s imperative that vendors, customers, and everyone engaged in product-centric decision-making is aware of eco-friendly initiatives and sustainability programs as well as broader ESG program goals and the related benefits and value proposition.</p>
<p>In a capitalistic world, consumers, world leaders, and companies alike are at the same crossroads, demanding more from eco and sustainability efforts to make the environment we live in safer and cleaner. For their part, organizations are looking for trusted advisors to lead them through materials research, equipment capabilities, or aligning with industry trends ahead of standardization. This critical juncture is where Entrust has invested resources to bridge the gap between technical feasibility and demand for sustainable practice. We’ve dedicated resources − from our R&amp;D, business teams, material suppliers, and equipment suppliers to logistics services − to co-create meaningful solutions to meet these critical goals now and into the future. We are leveraging an eco research and innovation platform that was designed to build the knowledge base for holistic solutions vs. driving product-led materials or features.&nbsp;In simpler terms, eco R&amp;D is the foundation required to build diverse enterprise relationships supporting the broader initiative. The mere existence of an eco-project doesn’t automatically generate “trusted advisors,” but the collective effort will create a roadmap where partners feel comfortable collaborating on technical concepts to support consumer demand.</p>

<p>From inflation and conflict, to rising interest rates and the growth of neo banks, to synthetic identities and deepfakes – banks and credit union leaders are navigating tumultuous times. Yet, through it all, these same leaders recognize the immediate need to meet the demand for an enhanced customer experience to drive loyalty and increase revenue. And it all starts with a streamlined secure onboarding process – one that provides digital-first customer experiences with an accelerated time to value.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the quicker a financial institution can move a prospective customer from account opening to card issuance to making their first purchase, the more satisfied the consumer becomes and the faster the financial institution realizes value. And, if that can all happen in less time than it takes to brew a cup of coffee – all the better! Of course, it’s equally as important to be Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliant, as well as secure through each and every transaction. Fraud is a large and growing problem that can cost banks as much as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">$4MM per breach (IBM</a>), not to mention the potential reputational damage and lost consumer trust that has the power to seriously damage future growth potential.</p>
<p>What follows is a roadmap to navigate this journey.</p>
<p>Enable digital customer onboarding.</p>
<p>We’ve heard from many customers that banks and credit unions alike only have a 90-second to 5-minute window of time that consumers are willing to spend verifying their identity and opening an account. Any longer than that and you risk application abandonment – that isn’t a lot of time to provide a great consumer experience that will lead to top-of-wallet status. That’s why it’s critical for banks to adopt technologies that allow them to offer remote customer onboarding enhanced with biometric identity verification; identity and device reputation authentication (also known as Electronic Know Your Customer, or eKYC); and digital contract signing.</p>
<p>Provide digital and physical payment card options.</p>
<p>Once a new customer account has been approved, it’s time to provide a method to make payments. Traditionally, a customer would need to wait for a physical card to be mailed to their home address after opening their bank account. While this process is still an important part of any bank’s card issuance program, it can be beneficial to offer other methods of card issuance that will help the bank realize time to value more quickly, and to exceed customer expectations.</p>
<p>For those customers that open an account remotely via their mobile device, doesn’t it make sense to instantly issue them a digital card to their newly installed banking app so they can start using it right away? Enhancing existing card programs with digital offerings with functionality like digital card issuance, NFC payment, tokenization, wallet push provisioning, and card controls allows banks to streamline processes, reduce cost of ownership, and provide a boost in customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Many banks and credit unions also offer the option to instantly print a card in-branch. This method is a nice addition to any payment card issuance program because it gives branch employees the autonomy to surprise and delight customers by printing them a new replacement card, or a new card for those who choose to open an account in person.</p>
<p>The key to a successful card issuance program is to ensure that your bank can rise to the customer’s immediate challenge and provide the flexibility to open an account and receive their card via the method that works best for them, and as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Secure the end-to-end experience.</p>
<p>Securing the end-to-end customer experience (from account opening to transacting), is vitally important to mitigate costs and reputational damage resulting from banking fraud or a breach. As mentioned in the consumer onboarding and account opening phase, it’s important to make sure to adhere to the latest eKYC and AML compliance requirements.</p>
<p>When it comes to protecting transactions once an account has been opened, banks and credit unions should look for solutions that provide risk-based authentication to proactively identify fraudulent patterns through fraud detection algorithms, device identity scans, and adaptive risk analysis. Applying those solutions across all e-commerce transactions, high-value transactions, and irregular locations will help identify and mitigate potential fraud.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a unique alphanumeric code for legal entities, funds and trusts participating in commercial, trade, or general financial transactions. It enables identification across a wide range of financial applications and has the potential to play a significant role in the modern financial system by enabling counterparty bona fides verification. This verification is essential for the know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) processes required in traditional and modernized financial services activities. </p>
<p>Amit Sharma is the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://finclusive.com/who-we-are/about-us">FinClusive</a>, a global Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) infrastructure provider that enables increased compliant and equitable financial engagement by facilitating traditional banking’s connectivity with emerging technology networks, existing and alternative payment rails, and financial services providers. FinClusive’s CaaS is a globally orchestrated anti-money laundering/financial crimes compliance toolkit with modernized KYC/KYB- backed digital identity credentialing and LEI issuance and validation.</p>
<p>How are Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) transforming businesses—and emerging markets in particular? What requirements does the LEI meet?</p>
<p>As both traditional and non-traditional financial markets incorporate cross-border transactions, there is a significant need for a uniform identifier across jurisdictions that is precise, digitally verifiable, and interoperable across global regulated financial services providers. The hurdles for verifying identities across the world has resulted in financial fraud, crises, and other abuses, which has become even more complex in the virtual assets space, internet-native financial services applications (web3), and decentralized financial services (DeFi). The LEI has both the necessary infrastructure and simplicity for ubiquitous application across bank and non-bank transactions for businesses around the world.</p>
<p>What are the challenges with know-your-business (KYB) and legal entity verification more broadly? How do we enable businesses to interact seamlessly, transparently, and compliantly in a cross-border world with next generation banking and payments needs?</p>
<p>The biggest challenges for KYB across the industry arise from inconsistent regulatory requirements for identification and compliance across jurisdictions, coupled with the disparate nature in which corporate identities are issued, validated, stored, and accessed. In these cases, entities involved in cross-border transactions often lack the ability to verify that their counterparty is legitimate, non-fraudulent, and not posing a significant business risk. Adding processes like Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) goes a long way in addressing these concerns by systemizing the issuance and validation of legal entities, and further, enabling them to verify each other while ensuring adherence to global financial crimes compliance practices and requirements. Broader compliance solutions that are purpose-built for know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) application, including FinClusive’s full-stack compliance-as-a-service (CaaS) platform, are another way that businesses can take security and compliance into their own hands, while enabling near real-time verification and coverage of essential business/entity verification—including the validation of an entity’s beneficial owners.</p>
<p>How are these changes going to happen? Who is driving the changes? </p>
<p>While the best outcomes are reached collaboratively between the public and private sectors, it is important that industry-focused solutions are carefully considered by lawmakers when debating how to regulate the rapidly evolving financial services industry, including and especially those engaged in cross-border payments and virtual assets. As such, industry associations like Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and companies like FinClusive can work hand-in-hand with government actors to guide policy in order to achieve the safest and most effective results for customers. This collaboration enables efficient due diligence, verification of identity, and applications across multiple jurisdictions, financial services operations, and increasingly between counterparties directly (peer-to-peer/business-to-business).</p>
<p>What timescales are we working towards with adoption and resulting benefits for the areas we’ve discussed? What are some examples of low hanging fruit (use cases)?</p>
<p>Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) have a wide range of use cases, some of which can be actualized more quickly than others. FinClusive already uses LEIs in know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) use cases, allowing organizations to gather key information about a client or counterparty before entering a transaction and conduct the requisite verification of legal entities wherever located. LEIs can also reduce error and friction for banks, creditors, invoicing, and a wide range of other business relationships. For example, organizations often have minor variations in names used across different official platforms, leading to significant confusion when trying to track the financial history of an entity or ensure adherence to global sanctions requirements and individual jurisdiction-based know-your-business and monitoring requirements.</p>
<p>A uniform LEI makes KYC/KYB exercises significantly smoother for all parties. The removal of these hurdles also allows for faster engagement between counterparties and financial transactions around the world. G7 and G20 countries have increasingly looked to LEIs as a strong way to bring global consistency and efficiency to legal entity verification and validation. Coupled with FinClusive’s global KYC/KYB, due diligence, monitoring, and digitally verifiable identity credentials, entities can ensure requisite background checks that mitigate identity fraud, and enable engagement between trading/financial counterparties—and their financial intermediaries—seamlessly and securely, while bringing needed efficiencies to their financial transactions.</p>
<p>How do we drive further adoption and enablement at scale?</p>
<p>Adoption at the international level must come from a coordinated government and private sector approach. FinClusive is one of several organizations globally offering Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services, but there are only a few based in the United States. Additionally, regulatory mandates are yet to be made requirements—although financial services regulators around the globe are increasingly indicating their importance and use. Building broader infrastructure for LEI adoption around the world and coordinating with federal policy is crucial for widespread use. Enabling multiple financial services providers with LEIs alongside the essential monitoring and other controls to combat fraud and illicit finance, will advance know-your-customer/know-your-business (KYC/KYB) modernization, especially as alternative accounts and payments products and services continue to proliferate in the market.</p>
<p>What potential does the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) have for global financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Reliable, easily accessible identification has the potential to transform businesses in developing markets. LEIs give trading partners and their financial institutions a new way to interact with unprecedented efficiency and is expected to have immeasurable benefits for global trade and business-to-business (B2B) money flows in the developing world. Small businesses, entrepreneurs, non-profits, development organizations, global corporations, and even alternative financial services providers themselves can seek out and receive a fully credentialed LEI through FinClusive or another provider, enabling them to engage meaningfully in the global economy with legitimacy and transparency.</p>
<p>With more than 99% of global growth stemming from small and medium enterprises (including micro enterprises and commercial entities of all types—corporate, LLC, non-profit/public benefit, and others), LEIs can enable seamless engagement and verification alongside financial system controls that can benefit those enterprises struggling to access or maintain their financial services.</p>
<p>Why is FinClusive working with Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs)? How does the LEI fit into your services?</p>
<p>Thanks to our partnership with Ubisecure, FinClusive is one of the only United States-based GLEIF Validation Agents. This allows us to streamline validation of legal entity data and really speed up the registration of LEIs. We are also the only nonbank/non-financial institution to do this. We have integrated the LEI and our proprietary Customer Due Diligence (CDD) Check utility into one platform for our clients, allowing our customers to confirm their partners’ identity, beneficial owners, know-your-business risk, and financial crimes compliance status in one tool. LEI on its own can lack due diligence and jurisdiction validation, both of which FinClusive can cover by integrating LEIs with our <a href="https://finclusive.com/products/fincid">FinCID</a> solution. Integrating anti-money launder controls, know-your-business capabilities, and compliance into our full-stack platform allows us to maximize our global orchestration of providers and analytics partners, as well as the reliability and efficiency of cross-border payments and business relationships, thereby advancing financial inclusion of businesses around the world.</p>

<p>LinkedIn has joined the ranks of social media platforms offering ID verification badges designed to assure users that the person associated with a profile is in fact who they claim to be. Given <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/3cx-breach-was-a-double-supply-chain-compromise/">organized fraud on LinkedIn</a>, it’s about time. But, while I applaud the move, it’s important to note what identity verification is and what it means to users like you and me.</p>
 ID Verification: The Good, the Bad &amp; the WTF 
<p>While social media users and brands have long been able to apply for checkmark-style verifications, these badges have traditionally been bestowed by the platforms themselves. But last November, Twitter changed the game by announcing it was replacing its existing verification system with Twitter Blue. The idea: Enable anyone with a profile (and $8 a month) to add Twitter’s coveted checkmark to their profile.</p>
<p>Quite predictably, chaos ensued as pranksters and cybercriminals purchased blue checkmarks and impersonated brands and their executives with abandon. The Eli Lilly and Lockheed Martin impersonations occurred on Twitter during this time. So did an exodus of top advertisers, contributing to an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-30/twitter-s-revenue-drops-amid-advertisers-concerns-over-elon-musk?leadSource=uverify%20wall">89% drop in ad revenue</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter has since paused, re-launched, and continued to modify its approach to verification. But it’s hardly alone. Impersonation occurs on every platform, including TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, and even new Twitter rivals like Mastodon. The Bird Network is also no longer an outlier in offering ID verification to all users. Meta’s Facebook and Instagram have rolled out paid verification, and now LinkedIn has announced no-fee verification.</p>
<p>As a B2B marketing leader, it’s LinkedIn that matters most. The platform is expected to capture <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/linkedin-will-capture-nearly-25-of-us-b2b-ad-spending-by-2024">25% of all B2B ad spend</a> by 2024, to the tune of $4.5 billion, for a simple reason: It’s an indispensable channel for brand, direct, and account-based marketing. LinkedIn ID verification can serve an essential role in preventing impersonation. But it should be done in a privacy preserving way. Here’s what I mean.</p>
 LinkedIn: More Reassurance—But Not Without Risk 
<p>LinkedIn’s approach includes options for verifying personal identity and place of employment. In the US, users can confirm their identity by uploading their government-issued ID and phone number and then displaying this verification on their profile. Worldwide, users can verify where they work with their company email address.</p>
<p>But while this is a step in the right direction, there are two significant blind spots in this approach. The first is the requirement to provide a government-issued ID. While this can undoubtedly cut down on fake profiles, it forces users to place the scanned drivers license in the care and control of a 3rd party. As if we haven’t seen enough identity data spread all over the Web and compromised in countless ways.</p>
<p>Consumers (AKA LinkedIn users) should be able to control their own data at all times and have the ability to share it with consent and on demand. The dangers are all too real as thousands of data breaches over the years prove in stark detail.</p>
<p>The second issue is as large or larger. Identity verification somewhere at or after account origination doesn’t prove identity at login. It does nothing to prevent <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/98367-social-media-account-takeovers-increased-over-1000-in-2021">social media account takeover</a> (ATO), which is up more than 1,000%, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). Roughly 40% of all victims of social media ATO reported either having their personal information misused, while half lost funds or sales revenue. More than 70% were permanently locked out of their account while the intruder continued to post new content.</p>
<p>Just imagine the potential damage to victims and the platform itself if (and when) a verified LinkedIn account gets pirated. The good news: It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
 Verification Made Simpler &amp; Safer 
<p>Today, verifying identity at login is not only attainable, but readily achievable. At 1Kosmos we’ve implemented passwordless login with verified identity in a number of different ways. What does this mean?</p>
<p>For the LinkedIn and other social media use cases, user enrollment feels much the same way as it does today, but with identity verification, anti-spoofing and privacy baked in. For starters, when the user scans the front and back of their driver’s license, it is verified against AAMVA records to ensure validity, and more broadly can be verified in 205 countries worldwide. Scanned information is sharded, encrypted and stored in a blockchain under the sole control and management of the user. Importantly, the user never gives up control of their PII.</p>
<p>A facial scan is performed and compared to the likeness on their ID. This is configurable, can include liveness detection and is backed by iBeta PAD-2 certification, verifying identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy.</p>
<p>When it comes to use cases that require higher levels of assurance, many organizations look for NIST 800-63-3 certified Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) identity proofing and authentication (AAL2). This typically requires a passport scan, which is then verified with the Country Signer Certificate Authority (CSCA) .</p>
<p>Here, privacy by design means that personally identifiable information is stored and managed solely by the user who can grant access on demand. Their personal information is never stored in a central server accessible by a 3rd party and can be transferred only with explicit user consent.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, our solution can use LiveID technology, device-level biometrics, one-time passcodes and various other authentication mechanisms all bound to the verified identity to ensure the user at login is who they claim to be. Because the 1Kosmos solution is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">iBeta PAD-2</a> certified, the user’s biometric can’t be spoofed using a stolen photo, video, or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>For LinkedIn and other social media platforms, it would ensure that all verified user profiles and interactions are legitimate, with more than 99% accuracy. This is a significant improvement over knowing that at one point in time the account was in effect claimed by a verified, legitimate user. It truly identifies the user behind the device ad first and every login.</p>

   The key to secure, seamless experiences 

<p>Would you be surprised to learn that 91% of all new car sales in the U.S. are "connected vehicles." Not me. I've been watching the automotive world evolve, creating an ecosystem bristling with distinct entities and relationships that shape the modern driving experience.</p>

<p>The complexity of this ecosystem can be overwhelming. There's the vehicle itself, with its multitude of sensors and software components, plus subscription-based services and smart city infrastructure. And, of course, there are the people involved –&nbsp;car owners, drivers, manufacturers, sales and service personnel, and more. By placing identity at the core of this ecosystem, we can unlock a world of possibilities and ensure secure connections between all entities, with seamless and personalized experiences for all stakeholders involved.</p>

<p>It's not just about any one of these parties or services; it's about the entire web of identities connecting within and around the vehicle – including the head unit in the car that connects to a manufacturer's control systems in the cloud, the sensors and cameras that connect with each other and to the cloud, and even person-to-person and person-to-device connections. With unified identity, we can protect, manage, and govern these entities, while personalizing experiences and supporting sustainable business models. Now that's what I call smart mobility.</p>

 Smart mobility requires identity 

<p>When identity is infused into every part of an automotive manufacturer's connected strategy, it becomes a powerful driver for success.</p>

<p>Consider digital buying journeys. Car manufacturers are shifting towards digital sales models, where customers lead the conversation and have full control over the process – from initial research, to customizing and ordering a vehicle online, to finalizing the purchase at the dealer or directly with the manufacturer. In many ways, this experience is heading towards becoming much like any other retail e-commerce experience.</p>

<p>Once a customer sets up an identity online at the beginning of the buying journey, that identity stays with them through the sales cycle. It lets them receive digital and physical car keys and sign up for in-car services. The vehicle-to-be can be represented with a digital identity, too, ultimately synchronizing its characteristics with its "physical twin" once manufacture is complete.</p>

<p>With a unified approach to identity, the owner can even apply meaningful access controls to other drivers, ensuring safety and personalization – think seat settings for different drivers or automotive performance guardrails for new teen drivers in the family.</p>

 The current reality: identity as an afterthought 

<p>&nbsp;In the absence of a unified identity framework, the integration of physical and digital security measures becomes disjointed and prone to vulnerabilities. The risk of leaking customers' personally identifiable information (PII) increases when each service and application handles identity management independently.</p>

<p>Without an identity-centric approach, it's easier for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. You can see this for yourself when you connect a smart mobile device to a rental car – often, you'll lose control of your entire contact list and driving history. Without proper identity management, the potential for unauthorized or unintentional data sharing becomes a real concern, jeopardizing privacy and leaving individuals vulnerable to unwanted solicitations or misuse of their personal data.</p>

 The vision: identity at the center 

<p>By placing digital identities and relationships between them at the core of the connected car ecosystem, we can solve these challenges from the inside out. Gradually building the security posture over time as digital identities are added, we can ensure a smooth and secure experience for car owners. From tracking the manufacturing process using digital identities to providing real-time updates through a digital key in the owner's phone wallet, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Unified identity requires a powerful, scalable, and flexible solution. It involves storing identity profile information, ensuring synchronization with non-identity data feeds, and delivering a seamless human experience during registration and onboarding. At run time, checking identities and access rights becomes effortless, and reliable communication with various applications and APIs is established.</p>

<p>ForgeRock, a leading provider of identity solutions, drives these powerful, scalable, and flexible solutions. With components that separate policy enforcement from decision-making, ForgeRock empowers enterprises to adopt a Zero Trust architecture for all identities – both <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">human</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT "things."</a> By leveraging strong authentication standards like FIDO2 WebAuthn and federation protocols like OAuth and OpenID Connect, identity-related issues, such as impersonation and unauthorized access, can be mitigated effectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with the integration of AI-driven technologies, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">Autonomous Access</a>, identity provisioning and authentication become self-driving and adaptive. This automation enables continuous authentication checks, ensuring a secure environment for all connected vehicles.</p>

<p>Putting identity at the center of the connected vehicle ecosystem is the key to unlocking seamless, personalized experiences. By embracing a unified identity, we can overcome challenges, enhance security and privacy, and foster a thriving connected car environment. With ForgeRock's powerful solutions, the future of connected vehicles looks brighter than ever before. So fasten your seat belts and get ready for a journey where identity drives innovation, convenience, and peace of mind on the road.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective — June&nbsp;2023 <p>As decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, its allure has expanded to a broader demographic, offering financial services to those unserved or underserved by the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>Indeed, one of the main reasons for DeFi’s existence is to bank the unbanked and provide a platform for moving assets in a decentralized and permissionless way. However, DeFi is not without its own unique set of challenges.</p><p>One of the most glaring problems in the DeFi landscape is the unknown paths the assets travel — the commingling of funds. This issue threatens to significantly hamper the growth and acceptance of DeFi if not addressed promptly and effectively.</p><p>Thomas Jefferson once said, “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance and personal responsibility.” It is crucial to recognize that there are many misuses of decentralized finance&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>Malicious actors are abusing DeFi protocols for money laundering, terrorism financing, corruption, and scams, among other things. Addressing these issues at the current moment has become paramount for the vitality and growth of the DeFi ecosystem.</p> The Commingling of Funds in DeFi — Ride in the Wild&nbsp;West <p>Commingling of funds in DeFi refers to the pooling of assets from different participants into a single wallet or smart contract. While this helps facilitate transactions and optimizes liquidity, it also blurs the lines of ownership and raises critical questions about the security and accountability of&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Such funds, often with a suspicious or unknown origin, create a profound barrier to the sound operation and regulation of the DeFi platforms.</p><p>Envision a scenario where an illicitly obtained large sum of money is deposited into a DeFi liquidity pool. Once mixed with other funds and redistributed through returns, these funds become nearly untraceable, providing a difficult puzzle for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulators.</p><p>The gravity of this issue extends further as it risks ‘polluting’ the liquidity pool with unverified funds, potentially affecting all participants in the&nbsp;pool.</p><p>In an environment that already battles with the problems like lack of oversight, this further compounds the regulatory challenges, potentially putting the entire DeFi space at risk of stringent regulatory measures. As the DeFi space matures, it is crucial to address these pressing concerns.</p> DeFi Investors: Seduced and Often&nbsp;Betrayed <p>Despite all the challenges, many who have tipped their toes in the crypto water perceive DeFi as an attractive and potentially lucrative investment opportunity. But the less adrenalin-tolerant, yet major investment players, are carefully observing the space and waiting for their safe moment to&nbsp;come.</p><p>What’s this irresistible DeFi power of seduction? The yield farming strategies inherent in DeFi platforms, whereby users provide liquidity to earn rewards, are particularly compelling. The DeFi protocols usually offer significantly higher yields than traditional financial instruments, presenting an enticing proposition for investors.</p><p>On top of that, DeFi also introduces a new level of accessibility, allowing anyone with an internet connection to participate in high-yield opportunities, regardless of geographical or economic constraints.</p><p>As the allure of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to seduce the highly risk-tolerant investors, a surge of new participants is entering the scene. Enticed by high yields and unparalleled accessibility, they contribute to a significant inflow of capital, defining it as an expansion beyond borders of infinite financial opportunities.</p><p>Amid this growing interest, the importance of Compliant DeFi is coming into sharper focus. However, the adventure in the wild DeFi land might be quite tragic for some, so now the issue at hand is how to be better safe than&nbsp;sorry.</p> Compliant DeFi — Is it Safe to&nbsp;Play? <p>Simply put, compliant DeFi is the innovative fusion of decentralized finance with traditional regulatory standards. It marries the borderless, open-access ethos of DeFi with the security and transparency of conventional compliance measures like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a>, and CFT. The goal is to cultivate a more trustworthy and secure DeFi landscape that attracts institutional investors and compliance-friendly users.</p><p>One of the significant areas where Compliant DeFi shines is in dealing with regulatory complexities that wild DeFi land is&nbsp;facing.</p><p>Compliant DeFi is the answer to the misuse of financial freedom in DeFi. It eliminates the wild chaos and introduces a level of order, enhancing the sector’s security while maintaining its decentralized nature.</p> Why Compliant DeFi Matters at&nbsp;All <p>Compliant DeFi has the potential to shine bright in the land of finance and attract institutional investors, including those less or none traveled in crypto&nbsp;land.</p><p>By providing an environment that adheres to preventing the notorious comingling of funds and applying regulatory standards such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML), complaint DeFi effectively bridges the divide between the decentralized finance world and the traditional financial ecosystem, creating a symbiotic relationship that mitigates risks substantially.</p><p>As the DeFi space swells with new funds, trust and security become increasingly significant concerns. Traditional DeFi platforms, while operationally efficient, often end up nesting commingled funds, and at any moment, unknown toxic issues might crawl out of this Pandora’s box.</p><p>Though at first glance, Compliant DeFi might be less seductive, it confronts these challenges head-on and secures a safe investment environment. This is the new brave new DeFi world where user interests are guarded, safer, more transparent, and accountable. It is a world where major investors (the non-adrenalin driven) feel comfortable interacting and looking at the long-term prospectives.</p><p>In a nutshell, this is the one, and most probably the only, alternative for DeFi, the moment that opens the road to sustainable growth and expansion without the shadows of malpractices or security concerns.</p> Keeping the Books in Check: Accountability in the DeFi Ecosystem <p>The skyrocketing influx of investors in the DeFi space, especially the more traditional institutional ones, calls for a level of accountability. Yet, again, Compliant DeFi stands tall, providing an environment that marries the innovative opportunities of DeFi with the professionalism of conventional financial services.</p><p>By aligning with regulatory standards and ensuring enhanced transparency, Compliant DeFi has the potential to attract an even broader investor base. And logically, such increased and secured participation can foster a robust, sustainable growth trajectory for the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>In this dynamic era of digital finance, for DeFi, balancing high-return prospects with security, trust, and regulations is a tightrope to walk. Compliant DeFi appears as a reliable solution in this balancing act, solidifying its role as an integral part of a maturing DeFi landscape.</p> Final Note <p>Marking a transformative shift, Compliant DeFi indeed emerges as a significant catalyst, spearheading the drive towards expansive growth and wider acceptance within the DeFi landscape. This innovative approach is not just a tool but a comprehensive solution, proficiently harnessing the extraordinary potential of DeFi, while simultaneously addressing its inherent challenges.</p><p>As we navigate the complexities of the future, it becomes increasingly apparent that compliant DeFi, with its robust approach to security and regulation, is poised to decisively influence the evolution of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> The Flash &amp; his Love for&nbsp;DeFi <p>____________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 As I was walking around Identiverse last week, I was reminded of the old Barbara Mandrell song, “I Was Country, When Country Wasn’t Cool.” HYPR has been doing passkeys since passkeys (then known simply as FIDO credentials) weren’t cool. It’s given us a unique point of view on the overall impact and security of passkeys.

<p></p> 
<p>As I was walking around Identiverse last week, I was reminded of the old Barbara Mandrell song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRHjl3xMB3o">I Was Country, When Country Wasn’t Cool</a>.” HYPR has been doing passkeys since passkeys (then known simply as FIDO credentials) weren’t cool. It’s given us a unique point of view on the overall impact and security of passkeys.</p>  
<p>First off, passkeys are so vastly more secure than passwords that you should run — don’t walk — to implement them everywhere that you can. Seriously. Stop reading this blog and go implement some passkeys. One of the notable moments of Identiverse was when Ryan Rowcliffe and Cisa Kurian highlighted that CVS has implemented passkeys on cvs.com faster than Google has deployed passkeys. (Go check out cvs.com and register for a passkey. It’s pretty cool.)</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T98/reports/2023-dbir-executive-summary.pdf">Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> highlights that more than 50% of breaches come from attackers using credentials and a large number come from phishing attacks. The beauty of passkeys is that they’re not susceptible to phishing and can’t be compromised in the ways that passwords can.</p> 
 The Different Flavors of Passkeys  
<p>However, it’s also worth looking at the question of the security level of different types of passkeys. As a quick refresher, synchronized passkeys (the type that you’re hearing the most about) can be synchronized or passed between devices by features in your operating system (iCloud Keychain, etc) or by your password manager (Dashlane, 1Password, LastPass, etc). Device-bound passkeys are tied to a single device.</p> 
<p>As most security practitioners know, meeting the requirements of multi-factor authentication requires having at least two independent factors of “something you know,” “something you have,” or “something you are.” Synchronized passkeys only meet the requirement of “something you know” or “something you are” depending on whether you verify identity with a PIN or biometric, respectively. Because of how they can be shared and transmitted, they don’t meet the possession requirement. This means that some organizations are looking at how they add multi-factor authentication on top of passkeys. (This feels a little bit like buying the latest Tesla and sticking a 1970’s spoiler on it.)&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations also need to be comfortable with who will be managing their passkeys. For implementations of synchronized passkeys, organizations need to accept that they won’t know who is managing the passkeys that they’re provided. The passkey could be managed by the iCloud Keychain, Android, Dashlane, 1Password or another solution yet to be identified. Users will be in charge of who manages the passkeys on their devices.</p> 
<p>(Let me reiterate the earlier point: passkeys are so much more secure than passwords that you should absolutely go implement them right now.)</p> 
 Passkeys Built for the Enterprise  
<p>There are several scenarios where enterprises may want an authentication solution that meets the requirements of MFA and doesn’t have the same challenges highlighted above. This is where HYPR’s Enterprise Passkeys come into play. At their core, these are device-bound passkeys and are the same FIDO credential that HYPR has been based on since we were founded nine years ago. Enterprise Passkeys meet the requirements of MFA, are fully under the enterprise’s control, and can be used for other applications that require proof of possession such as digital signing and funds transfer.</p>

<p>We have the tools to build a greener Internet, one app at a time.</p> The Climate Crisis <p>The United Nations classifies the climate crisis as the defining crisis of our time. Businesses everywhere are called to revamp their infrastructure and processes so that we may stave off calamity.</p><p>In the tech industry, data centers are often the focus of concerns, and rightly so. Water is used to cool data centers to keep them from overheating, causing a big drain on our water supply. In fact, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119938708/data-centers-backbone-of-the-digital-economy-face-water-scarcity-and-climate-ris">a mid-sized data center consumes around 300,000 gallons of water a day, or about as much as 1,000 U.S. households</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, the amount of data we create every day is astonishing. It's projected that by 2025, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/">181 zettabytes of data</a> will exist. The processing power and electricity it takes to compute and store the massive amounts of data we produce daily is already at about <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/5-ways-big-tech-could-have-big-impacts-on-clean-energy-transitions">1% of global energy consumption</a>, with no signs of lessening.</p><p>These statistics are bleak, but there is hope for a brighter future. While working to make data centers more energy-efficient should be prioritized by those who utilize them, there is another option. </p> Edge Computing and the Decentralized Web <p>Building apps on the distributed and decentralized web comes with several green🌱 benefits.</p><p>Decentralized Data Storage - Instead of sending data to a server at a data center, data can be stored locally or at or near the edge. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> is a distributed file system built on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, a hypermedia P2P protocol that stores data on various nodes in the network. Apps with WNFS also enjoy offline access, reducing the need for constant Internet access to use the app!</p><p>Reduced Data Transfer - Local-first edge apps can process data locally, meaning fewer data transfers to the network! Our smartphones are sophisticated computers in their own right, and we can do many computations without needing to access additional servers or the cloud.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a>, Fission's capabilities-based authentication network, doesn't rely on ACLs or Access Control Lists. Therefore, permissions can be validated with fewer calls between the user, the app, and the resource server.</p><p>Energy-Efficient Computing - Instead of running the same computations repeatedly and sending those requests to a server or even the distributed network, why not "cache" the results or save time and compute power in other ways? </p><p>Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>, or Interplanetary Virtual Machine, takes arguments and applies them to a Wasm function. This outputs a CID or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> to inform us if an operation has been run before so we can optimize our efforts and copy the CIDs of those outputs (the receipts) into our work. This saves both time and compute power! </p><p>In addition, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a> and make popular operations faster by hardcoding frequently called arguments. </p><p>Finally, we can choose the order of operations that is most efficient while not impacting the results. This is done in IPVM, where we ensure mutations always happen at the end. In <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">RhizomeDB</a>, Fission's decentralized database, this is done with CmRDTs that enable data replicas to process updates in any order.</p> <p>We are working at the protocol level, but many ways exist to help make the Internet greener. What are some ways you are reducing your footprint?</p><p></p><p></p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode over Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. What are the cultural aspects of digital identity? So that’s definitely a good question and very relevant questions and this is one of the questions that our guest today is going to answer.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Kalev Pihl. He has worked with digital identity over 25 years. He started with a topic in governmental side, preparing Estonia for electronic identity, or national identity cards. Since then, Kalev has worked in the financial sector and in Microsoft. During the last 15 years, he has been the CEO of SK ID Solutions, a trust service provider that serves digital identities in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Hello, Kalev.</p>
<p>Kalev Pihl: Hi, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s nice talking with you, Kalev.</p>
<p>Kalev: It’s been a while.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, Kalev. So, let’s talk about digital identity. And the first thing we want to hear from our guest is something about yourself and especially your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: I think of the journey to digital identity for me went through this very physical, governmentally controlled national identity. So that was my starting point. And I guess that’s where I’m a bit stuck with my mindset as well, sometimes. And this is my limit. But that’s how it started.</p>
<p>So, it started from the idea that in the world of physical human beings. Governments tend to have this role in society to name, number and identify the residents, they treat as their residents of the country, we are speaking about.</p>
<p>And whilst we have probably different other nicknames in different other societies. And somehow, globally, these governmental-issued identities have become the norm of; How do we know each other across the world. How do we identify the people whom we don’t know beforehand. So, I think from that angle, I’ve stuck with the idea that governments have the role of naming and identifying who we are.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. I think it’s – I mean, in my view, probably in the constitution in most countries, I’m not a lawyer, but I’m sure it’s written in some of the laws. So that’s one of the functions of the government. And yeah, and that has been translated in our very, let’s say, not very recent time. But talking, especially in the last maybe 20 years that we have such digital identifications, like Estonia is pioneering and in a few other countries as well. It’s pretty digital, pretty well-established.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah. I think that the – for the beginning of any country or state in the physical world, some limit, some borders, what is the ground they own. Then we are talking about some legal framework, what is the agreement. Then we need to know; between whom is the agreement? And those are then the human beings in the society, and that’s kind of what every state or country is made of, I would say.</p>
<p>And that’s something that if we go now, from this real-life identity and tried to tackle the digital identity, the idea. Then there are two kinds of attitudes. One is that digital world is borderless, global or universal even. And therefore, doesn’t require and there’s no relation to any, these kind of physical limitations and countries, states and therefore, like no borders, no anything. And then the other is that it is just – it should be, is and will be always a reflection of something that physically makes sense. Only then it becomes meaningful in a larger context when it is physically meaningful.</p>
<p>So, I think that’s one of the staring points if we say that there is point to the cultural differences. Then the culture that we started off is clearly not so much digital, but rather what is the culture before any digital and then definitely, we have different digital cultures as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, that’s true. Every country has internally a different culture while some often several cultures inside a country as well. And this is something that shapes digital identities that we, the ones who are in this industry have been shaping and continue shaping today. So, yeah, tell me more about that role that the culture plays in shaping and influencing the current and the ones that are coming in the digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yep, sure. That’s the topic for today. So, the culture that we can see in the digital identities is quite a lot, related to, the ways how we culturally trust our own governments. How the government trusts its citizens, residents. And also, it’s very tightly connected to the idea of what is and how the privacy as such is defined in the society. A&nbsp;couple of episodes ago, you discussed heavily again, this kind of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/" title="ISO standard on the privacy">ISO standard on the privacy</a>. And privacy is something that is cultural as well, and it’s not globally, universally defined as a value. And where the value kind of lies actually and these cultural differences. How they look in the digital identity is exactly, I would say, let’s take the two extremes.</p>
<p>One of those extremes is that digital identity is something that is central, that binds all of the digital actions that one does in a digital world together. And therefore, makes you, in essence, traceable, recognised everywhere. You cannot hide in a digital world, based on that identity. This identity reveals you everywhere.</p>
<p>And then we have the other extreme. We have digital identity that must, in essence by definition, protect you from being recognised from one environment to another. You must have different representation in different contexts. You have to have the right not to be recognised and not to be traced.</p>
<p>So, I would say that, culturally, the need might be on both of those extremes and something in the middle. And that’s I think, something that we are struggling globally now, that we are trying to talk about digital identity and what this identity does. What kind of privacy does it guarantee and what the privacy means to anybody.</p>
<p>And then we – then we are stuck with the fact that we don’t define the digital identity. We believe that everybody understands the identity and digital identity in the same manner. And then we also tried to say that the privacy is preserved. Privacy is granted. Privacy is by default as we like to say, or by definition and by default. But what this privacy means in this context of digital identity and usability also is not defined. So, we kind of use the buzzwords, and we neglect the background from which we come from. And therefore, we don’t understand each other, and we try to regulate that into different places. And well, do a lot of mistakes in that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah.</p>
<p>Kalev: I don’t know if that makes sense to you, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Of course, a lot of sense. So, one concept, one particular concept you mentioned is privacy, right? Which can – well, not can but means different things in different cultures, in different countries. That’s true. I understand that. And it’s a challenge to try to have a definition and based on that create the laws, create the technologies that support that. Yeah, indeed. It’s a very, very good reflection that you are doing.</p>
<p>Kalev: I think that with the privacy, again, similarly, those extremes. And as I said, one of those extremes is on this identity and the definition regarding that privacy is that: OK, the privacy means that there is no data about me anywhere that I specifically didn’t reveal myself knowingly, giving the consent to that specific data to be revealed about me. Which makes me in the centre of all the transactions about me. And well, gives me a lot of work, let’s be honest, because there are several institutions all the time that work kind of for me. Make my digital life easier, and they need to make decisions. And if those decisions need my data, then therefore I need to make a lot of decisions to reveal or not reveal that data to them.</p>
<p>And the other side of that is and I would say the other way of looking at the same privacy, kind of, from the same concept. Still saying that privacy is preserved, privacy is kind of granted and by default, by definition. Is that whenever your data is used, then you, by nature of the setup, have the control over who and where and for what used your data. And therefore, you can kind of trace back it and say that, well, why did you do one or the other thing? And if they didn’t have the right, didn’t have your permission, didn’t have legal rights to something then they will be punished by the law.</p>
<p>So, it’s kind of – one is preventing anything to happen upfront. The other is giving the privacy through the control that you know everything that has happened with your data. And therefore you are able to take the parties involved and make them responsible for their actions. So, like these are maybe couple of ideas of how to look at the privacy from different angles as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, in the case of privacy, just to give a concrete example. But how this would start if privacy or any other concept has to be defined based on the culture of our country, or our region? So how it has really defined?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, the question then, when we talk about like, building creating digital identity. We kind of often think that this is one type of things to be done everywhere. What I’ve learned over the years, and I’ve really had happy accidents of meeting so many different countries, cultures, in different places talking about digital identity now, really tens of years. Then it still turns out that we are building the digital identity for a specific set of human beings. And those human beings have some connection to a culture, even if that’s a digital culture. Even if we say that digital identity in a social network, like Instagram, is a digital identity. For the people who use Instagram, who have some cultural preferences, otherwise, they wouldn’t use that environment. So, they have kind of agreed to a cultural norm there.</p>
<p>Or if we say that we are looking at the country, somewhere in the world, like Thailand or Mexico. Then we are building the digital identity for that culture that suits the beliefs and traditions of that set of human beings. It’s not a one-size-fits-all. But rather that this one-size-fits-one kind of thinking that I’m now become to believe, more into recent years. That there is not this one single solution that everybody will, kind of, inherently fell in love into. They have so many things in their historical backpack that it will definitely tilt their preference.</p>
<p>They have some bias to expect something that any other culture would never ever expect from the same solution. And we have to be designing mindfully those digital identity solutions for a specific culture, and I think that this is a value in the world. That we do believe in different things, we do act based in different preferences, culturally and that makes us interesting as human beings. We are not the same everywhere in the world and how to preserve that in the digital world. How not to become culturally one the same. Following one and the same set of rules everywhere, having the same solutions everywhere is an interesting, very interesting challenge, I would say for the humanity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, it is, and I agree with when you said that there shouldn’t be like one solution to be somehow imposed to the globally. That is a reason why they are in practice. I mean, the reason why then – just in the case of the national digital identities. The one from Estonia is different from one from Finland, Sweden, Singapore, et cetera. They are based on similar underlying technologies; open ID connect, publicly infrastructure, et cetera. But in the end, they are – they were designed differently because they’re solving a problem for different cultures. That is correct.</p>
<p>Kalev: Like facial recognition anywhere in the world, fingerprint-based identification somewhere like. Those are things that either are or are not culturally meaningful. I would say Western Europe has some kind of cultural connection in taking, giving and recognising fingerprints, and it’s deeply I would say, related to the criminalistics and then crime. And therefore, this kind of feeling when somebody asks your fingerprint somewhere, well, wasn’t very, very pleasant, I would say. Touch ID and other similar kinds of things have now a bit eased this feeling. But if we’re talking on the national level, fingerprint collection, fingerprint-based recognitions, then this feeling is still there, whilst it isn’t there with a face.</p>
<p>Although like, if we talk technologically then it doesn’t matter based on which kind of biometrics, I recognise you. But the acceptability within the culture, like face versus fingerprint was really, really different, still is a bit different. And the same kind of routing in the criminology didn’t appear in many Asian countries, in some Middle East countries where these fingerprint-based quick recognition tools in physical interactions were introduced. And there was no objection from the society. It was very, very acceptable.</p>
<p>So, all of those, kind of, bits that we are taking from different either literature, or some really historical reference that we take with us. Those too change the way how we are able or not able to roll out any given technology for the digital identity, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a very good example, the one of the fingerprints. I didn’t think about that. But yeah, it doesn’t surprise me that in different parts of the world, the perception is completely different. And it’s just the culture as you said.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, facial recognition in Middle East countries, revealing your face in public for female citizens, well, it’s not very common. And something that again, we from Western Europe don’t recognise easily, but it is, it is a thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Could you share now some successful examples, or I mean maybe not, it sounds like from these discussion site, like there are not many, at least 100% successful examples. But some, in some extent, successful examples of how these cultural human aspects have been taken into account to deliver good solutions for digital identity.</p>
<p>Kalev: Well, being a CEO for SK ID Solutions. Of course, I have to tell that I believe that we have been able to deliver for at least the Baltic States, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, solutions which are relevant for the culture where we are providing those services. And in that regard, we have also faced some clear opposition from the cultural perspective in some areas here. But yeah, that’s one of the things that maybe is possible here and isn’t possible in some other countries. So, our current service that is really used for more than half of the population in the Baltic countries is based on the fact that people know and use their national identity code as a unique identifier for themselves. And it is used in different environments now but is kind of creating unique identifier per any kind of system.</p>
<p>The same pretty much applies to the other countries. But then when we will take that concept, the same concept that is successful in variations also in Finland, in Sweden, in Norway, those are all kind of based on the single one identity. And all of them have like bank ID in Sweden is definitely a success story, from the usability and amount of users behind it. They are based on this idea that there is this one unique identifier, and you can reuse that in different environments. And it’s really serving the culture there and here. So, I would say that this is the way how it has been functionally well rolled out.</p>
<p>And we have to then say that the same ideology would not be allowed, possible, accepted, for example, in Germany. That kind of falls to the pieces in the border, of Germany. Simply isn’t welcomed there, by constitution. Because the constitution in Germany says that: well you shouldn’t, you should never ever create a solution where user is reusing its attributes in a manner that you can trace them. From one, let’s say government institutions to another, from one company to another. You have to be messed up everywhere. Where you try to figure out if that same person came from one institution to another, you are bound to by constitution to be puzzled by that.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, well, interesting. Well, that’s defined by law in that case.</p>
<p>Kalev: Similarly, it is not allowed in Hungary, for example, to have a unique identifier for a person.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what were the objections or the reactions you had in, you mentioned earlier in the Baltics. So, what, what was not culturally accepted, let’s say there?</p>
<p>Kalev: One of the things was that really this identity code is semantically meaningful, and to use that as user ID at some points definitely was kind of a controversial and needed longer and public debate. In Estonia, I think, 15 years plus, quite long public debate about whether really the identity code as such can be publicly shared. And then it turned out that the reason actually – well, there’s definitely this semantic part that it really reveals your birthdate, which means that well somebody can understand how old you actually are.</p>
<p>But the more practical reason for objecting that was that, and it turned out that and it still is the case. For example, in US a lot of, that kind of identity breaches that we are discussing, and which are like big, big, big fuss around the world. Those are based on the notion that’s kind of user identity, for example, the social security number in US, it is not treated as user ID, but rather as a password. And those are very different things.</p>
<p>So, one is the link like this is who you are. And the other is proof that it is you that the claim is actually correct that this is your user identity. So, when it turned out to be kind of public, then what use cases were hit. And what was discussed quite a lot towards this type of phone-based service when you call in and the operator asks to identify you, your unique identifier. Which is public, which is listed everywhere where you have ever been, which is written into your identity documents. But still, as there was no better alternative then they opted for asking you for the identity code. And therefore, if that was now used publicly everywhere, well, everybody understood that cannot be used anymore.</p>
<p>And somehow the discussion, thankfully, has gone to that direction, at least in this region. that it wasn’t the right thing to do from the beginning to ask this identity code as a password. Because it has never been meant to be secret. The fact that not everybody in the world knows that doesn’t make it a secret.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah. So, what is nowadays, in Estonia, what is the kind of called, the username? Or there is such a username in – for this identity? Tell us a bit on how it works.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, it is like 11 number identity code. It really consists of your, like, six numbers of that represent your birthdate and one of those. Then the seventh one gives the century and the sex you are being given. Then there are four digits that you have to really randomly kind of remember. And it has been long discussion whether those should be or could be changed. And now, in Finland, in Latvia as well. We have had this experiment of introducing another identity code instead of the semantically meaningful one. And this semantically meaningful identity code can be like, in Latvia, you can once in a life, go and replace your meaningful, semantically meaningful identity code to this new identity code, which doesn’t mean anything anymore.</p>
<p>It’s only a couple of years old, this project there so I cannot say how successful it is. But what is interesting with this 11-digit code really that is based on a birthdate is that most of them are able to remember it, because the birthdate is something that you can remember. If a society like Estonia would be able to remember just random 11 digits correctly, I’m not sure. But like bigger populations, I’m even less sure because they should have like more digits remembered, maybe. Then should be based some kind of – and somehow already based in letters and names and so on.</p>
<p>So, in Estonia, it really is semantically meaningful 11 digits which you can easily remember, and people normally do remember their identity code. They are reusing that on a daily basis in different contexts. Therefore, it is something that is not also easy to forget, because the society requires you to remember it. That is also this identifier we are using to allow you to kind of state who you are in the electronic identity context, and the same applies to Latvia, Lithuania.</p>
<p>And then the other, maybe just remember the other part of what was discussed in this context of electronic identity then yeah for the identification maybe the semantical information to recognise person is maybe OK. And then – but is it OK for the signature and then therefore, we have had a discussion of where in the signature this type of information should appear or not appear at all.</p>
<p>So again, something that we are now discussing, not so much on this user identity but still on this, on signature part. You should still uniquely identify who signed something. But do you need anything other than this identification of this unique person? Whether it makes any sense and discussion, culture discussions not happening in all countries in a similar manner. Some countries are more kind of prone to say that it shouldn’t be there. Others say that it is actually well, impossible to do without. It’s very, very different already in those three countries. I don’t know if I answered your question, actually.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you have definitely illustrated pretty well how it works in Estonia and also in the Baltics. And that gives us a clearer idea that the –yeah, the problem that you are bringing here is, of course, is big and it continues. As you say, there are some experiments in Latvia, Finland, and there are discussions in Estonia. So, this continues, even though there are good solutions, but this continues, this discussion continues.</p>
<p>So, if we focus now on, let’s say, you and I. We are working in companies who are building digital identity products. There are also, for instance, governmental institutions, who are building also digital solutions or services that rely very heavily on these digital identity solutions. So, from – what is the role of technology developers and designers in addressing these issues, these cultural aspects of digital identity?</p>
<p>Kalev: I think the biggest responsibility we carry is to be mindful about these phenomena of the cultural differences. And not to sell this kind of digital utopia that, that whenever we go to technical solutions, and your culture doesn’t matter, your infrastructure readiness doesn’t matter. It’s just “Buy my tech and you will be happy.” Promises should be avoided everywhere where it’s possible, even if there is a customer who’s willing to buy that promise. That’s really, I would say, the threat in the world what I see.</p>
<p>And maybe the other thing that is culturally important and must be addressed, I would say. In those, kind of, sales processes and discussions about future tech. Is focus on really the cultural position of government, of public sector, how capitalism and making money is perceived in society. All of those things have different perceptions and therefore, your solution must suit the ideology that this culture is accepting. Either the government is the trusted, and well-meaning party in the society where everybody is welcoming stuff that comes from the government because it’s always for the benefit of the bigger goods. Or the government is perceived as somebody who is sneaky. Who is always spying on you, who you suspect of making you guilty over the things that you maybe did or maybe didn’t. So, basically, being paranoid about the government.</p>
<p>Similarly, you have to be mindful about if the private sector is something to be perceived as innovative, as providing service for the value they are actually getting from the market. If they are actually stealing behind the people who are paying to them, who are overcharging everybody, who are greedy. Or if they are really making the economy work and able to kind of collect the taxes in the country at all.</p>
<p>So, like, these perceptions are also reasonable to know and to remember. When we are offering – what type of setup should a country, should a society, should this bunch of human beings were requiring the digital identity. What they should ask for, what they should build for, what is the way how to fund, how to make that environment sustainable? Me, being a capitalist believer, I’m always kind of telling that, that when we are building digital identities, we have to see if there is a way how somebody can earn something from the fact that digital identity is successful. That it is used, that it is spreading, that it’s actually making sense to people.</p>
<p>And if such, for example, motivation is in the society, then there is a possibility that somebody will go after this benefit and therefore make the digital identity successful. If the, like monetary value is taken away from the system, there is kind of everything is free of charge, paid by this anonymous taxpayer or government. Then there might be that we have an environment where if the government is trusted, if the government’s promotional speeches about take it, use it, it’s for better, good. Those could be trusted and could be a good vehicle for rolling out a digital identity.</p>
<p>But it again, very much depends on like, did we provide the same model that this culture accepts? Or we took a model from some other culture and tried to sell it to a totally foreign environment for that proposal? So, I think that what we have to – the technology providers do, we have to really build for those cultures that we are selling into and building into.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes, yes, we need definitely to understand very well the cultures and where we are selling or helping with these technologies. As you said in some countries, the government is highly trusted, in others don’t. Then can be the banks are highly trusted in some countries, and in other countries, not at all. And then same can happen with telcos, as you said, also the private sector, some technology vendors from the private sector. So yeah, that’s very important. And the first thing you say is about, yeah, be mindful what you promise. That’s definitely a good reminder.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah. I think that this kind of naivety about technology being all good for every different situation still lives on. Similarly, of course, exists this naivety that technology, whatever it is used is evil. So, I think that both exist, but you should never fall into one or the other. It is never so simple.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. All right. I will ask a final question. So, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, I think that the message I hope has been quite clear that when building and when asking for technical solution, and especially as we are talking now digital identity. If asking for digital identity, ask: What is the fundamental belief of the environment where you are building it to? Don’t try to change culture through technology. It goes the other way around, culture defines technology.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you said it very clear don’t try to – don’t try to change culture with technology. Yeah, absolutely. Very simply and well said.</p>
<p>While hearing you, your explanations, came to my mind that for business when people are – businesspeople are traveling to other countries, there are some books that I, for every or for most countries say “what is the business etiquette” of every country. So, you should read that before traveling to that country. So, there should be a similar book but for the digital identity, right? We should have for every country, what and how you should – “what is the culture in every country in terms of digital identity and identity?” So, we know before doing business. So that’s something that came to my mind when I was hearing you.</p>
<p>Kalev: It would be nice if those books exist.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, maybe, maybe I think you could be one of the co-authors, at least, you know a lot about this. Thank you very much, Kalev, for this very insightful conversation. So please let us know if people would like to follow this conversation with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, you can definitely find me through LinkedIn or write me. Our contacts on the <a href="https://www.skidsolutions.eu/">skidsolutions.eu</a> site are quite publicly available as well. So, I’m very public person in a sense, nothing is hidden.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. Again, thank you very much, Kalev for joining us and all the best.</p>
<p>Kalev: Yeah, all the best to the listeners as well.</p>

  <p>Today, we’d like to highlight a dangerous anti-pattern in the identity world: the&nbsp;false identifier anti-pattern.  An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern">anti-pattern</a> is a common response to a recurring problem that’s usually ineffective and risks being highly counter-productive. You may have also heard of the <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/1357/">password anti-pattern</a>. Today's discussion represents a possibly even more dangerous practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The false identifier anti-pattern occurs when an application or service assumes that an attribute other than the subject of an assertion from a federated identity provider is a unique, durable, and trustworthy account identifier during single sign-on.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>A structured security document like an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-token-claims-reference">OpenID Connect id_token</a> or a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-saml-tokens">SAML 2.0 assertion</a> can contain personal user data like phone numbers, social media handles, and email addresses. These details are used as unique identifiers in some contexts (like sending email or making phone calls) and they are also used as login identifiers in some cases, but there’s a critical difference between using identifiers when they’re informational attributes for the purposes of communication or collaboration, and picking up that value in a federated context from a part of the token that comes with no guarantees of uniqueness and then using that value as a uniquely identifying index, backing authorization decisions and data access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
 Use of claims other than subject identifier to uniquely identify an end user in OpenID Connect is non-compliant&nbsp; 
<p>The authors of OpenID Connect 1.0 were aware of this anti-pattern ten years ago when the specification was designed. There is normative text directly in the spec that requires all relying parties—the applications and services consuming identity information from SSO transactions—to always use the sub attribute as the primary account key. <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">Section 2 of the OpenID Connect core specification</a> defines sub as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimStability">Section 5.7 of the OpenID Connect specification</a> explicitly states:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an OpenID Connect relying party uses any other claims in a token besides a combination of the sub (subject) claim and the iss (issuer) claim as a primary account identifier in OpenID Connect, they’re breaking the contract of expectations between federated identity provider and relying party, operating in non-conformance to the specification, and potentially incurring risk to users. If you’re a relying party for whom the conditions of business include standards compliance, there’s only one option.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s worthwhile to determine the explicit requirement in the OpenID Connect spec. Why is a generic payload claim used in the critical security capacity of a unique account identifier so problematic? The specification text in section 5.7 gives all the hints that we need.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Unique local identifier&nbsp; 
<p>When an identifier is locally unique, the identity provider is actively detecting and preventing value duplications across users in the domain. If local uniqueness is enforced, there can never be a case where two different identity provider accounts are represented at time of single sign-on (SSO) by the same string. In modern identity infrastructure, organizations manage multiple user communities, and it’s entirely possible those communities have overlapping or recurring communications channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee who has a test account and a production account might set their phone number to be the same for both accounts. A non-employee might have an invited guest account for corporate collaboration and a customer account because they use the identity provider’s retail services, both using the same email address. In these examples, the email and phone number are not locally unique and insufficient to distinguish accounts, but they’re acceptable claims to include in the token, because the attributes are part of a token payload without a uniqueness requirement that describes a token subject that has a uniqueness requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Never reassigned within the issuer&nbsp; 
<p>The next statement in section 5.7 refers to the attribute’s lifecycle. Various events can occur to disassociate a user from their email address or phone number. The question is what happens next. If an identifier can be assigned to two different users at two different times, there’s a risk of the later user getting assigned to the permissions and data of the earlier user. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, imagine an organization hires Fred Smith and assigns an email address of fsmith@company.com. Fred eventually leaves, and Frida Smith is hired and assigned the same email address. The token subject should be a different value for Fred and Frida, even if the email address is the same. This prevents any chance that Frida ever sees Fred’s data.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Stability over time&nbsp; 
<p>There’s a simple consideration that guests and partners may need to intentionally change their communications channels at some point, like during mergers and acquisitions. If company A takes over company B, the communications values need to change for the entire company, without affecting users’ ability to perform SSO. Token subjects must be durable enough to survive name changes, corporate transitions, office moves to new area codes, and other volatile events.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Real-world examples&nbsp; 
<p>Time to talk about a real-world example. Frida is an accountant who works for Company3 and contracts services out to Company1 and Company2 (for Company1 she works for two separate departments). Her expertise is a SaaS Accounting application called RP.com, and she spends the whole day in that application working for various customers, but Frida only has one email address, the one through her employer. What will happen when she signs in to each of her four identity provider accounts and tries to SSO to RP.com?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frida uses one email with four different accounts at three companies. What token subject mappings should occur?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1: False identifier anti-pattern avoided at RP.com</p>
<p>If RP.com is conformant to the OpenID Connect specification, Frida will happily sign in to each of her accounts to see relevant data and interact with the appropriate users. RP.com will be putting the right user in the right security context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frida's four identity provider accounts are securely mapped to four unique relying party accounts. Yay!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Option 2:  RP.com falls for the False Identifier Anti-pattern</p>
<p>If RP.com has fallen into the trap of assuming email addresses are acceptable as durable identifiers, a few things may happen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is local conflation within a single tenant. This is where the identity provider is sending RP.com tokens for two different accounts that happen to have the same email address attached. If RP.com is not indexing on the subject, Frida (and her employer) will experience “unnecessary challenges”. When RP.com sees tokens that represent two different accounts as representing a single account, the authentication process becomes unstable, possibly preventing Frida from being able to perform her job. The resulting user session might only grant access to one of Frida’s two accounts, or the data on the backend might become conflated between her two RP.com accounts. What if the reason why Frida has two accounts at Company2 is because one of those accounts is for a highly confidential investigation, and the confidential data comingles with normal data within the RP tenant for Company2? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frida's four identity provider accounts encounter a mis-mapping of token subject. This is bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 3: RP.com hits the false identifier anti-pattern worst-case scenario&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If RP.com seriously overcommits to a false identifier, the worst-case scenario is that RP.com only looks at the email address when creating identifiers across multiple relying party tenants. In this case, four different tokens representing four different user accounts will end up identified at RP.com by the same string.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determining then which of the four accounts are accessed under what circumstances would come down to how the relying party architects their service. It could be that Frida can only always get to one of her RP accounts no matter what IDP account she signs in on. It could be that there is a tenant-specific starting page that drops a cookie, or that each tenant has its own subdomain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario can escalate if the mechanism that dictates which tenant session is loaded can be manipulated. While Frida might not think of impersonating one account from another account, attackers will. If an attacker could register their own tenant, connect it via SSO, and specify Frida’s email address, they could potentially compromise each of the three companies Frida interacts with at RP.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frida's four identity provider accounts are mis-mapped both within a tenant and across tenants. This is really bad.</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 False identifiers in SAML&nbsp; 
<p>You may be wondering, with all this talk about OpenID Connect, what happens in the world of Security Assertion Markup Language (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/auth-saml">SAML</a>)? The anti-pattern is the same for both protocols, but the SAML specification is where the industry learned those tough cross-domain identifier lessons. SAML implementations can still be an issue, but implementation details can change the nuances:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The complexity of the SAML specification makes it difficult for relying parties to roll their own implementation. While relying parties can still make mistakes when they map identity attributes, the libraries and tools that validate SAML assertions are often mature enough to have mitigated risk where possible. 
 In the SAML specification, an email address is a valid and commonly used token subject. However common use of SAML is in captive workforce cases where the organization "owns" the email and enforces uniqueness. This captive paradigm is breaking down due to the use of bring your own identity (BYOI) and B2B federated use cases—which may mean risk is growing for identity providers, not just relying parties. 
 The SAML specification has no commonly implemented parallel to the end-user consent flow that OAuth-based OpenID Connect uses, where if an administrator allows it, end users can virally ‘opt-in’ to access an app (this is managed in Azure AD via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/EN-US/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/user-admin-consent-overview">User and Admin Consent</a> feature).&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The higher education world is ahead in recognizing and taking action to counter this anti-pattern. Section 2.1 of the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml-subject-id-attr/v1.0/cs01/saml-subject-id-attr-v1.0-cs01.html#_Toc536097222">SAML V2.0 Subject Identifier Attributes Profile Version 1.0</a> stated in 2019 that: “Identification of subjects in security protocols and applications has a fraught history of inconsistent syntax, bugs, terrible but deeply cemented practices such as misuse of email addresses, vertical market-specific approaches, and failure to precisely communicate intended semantics and constraints.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both SAML and OpenID Connect identity providers can be at risk for the false identifier anti-pattern, but the work the OpenID Connect specification editors put in up front results in a certified identity provider is being well-protected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token subjects tend to be generated at the library or cloud infrastructure level and are not usually a claim that is individually mapped per connection from a data store by an admin. If a SAML identity provider admin chooses to map email address into the subject identifier of a SAML assertion, and the user population authorized for the target relying party includes accounts with email addresses that are not guaranteed to be locally unique, never reassigned, and stable over time, the organization has fallen prey to the false identifier anti-pattern and has incurred dangerous risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
 The simple takeaway 
<p>At the end of the day, the message for the RP.coms of the world is simple: always and only use the token subject and issuer together to form the primary key when identifying a federated account. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message for anyone who’s an identity provider is simple: always ensure every token subject generated for SSO is locally unique, never reassigned, and stable over time.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these two rules to evade the anti-pattern and securely map all your users in all the right places.&nbsp;</p>

   In 2019, we announced deprecation of the Azure AD Graph service. One year ago we communicated that Azure AD Graph will be retired and stop functioning after June 30, 2023. We also previously communicated that three legacy PowerShell modules (Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online) would be deprecated on June 30, 2023. &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
 We want to provide an update on timelines for these changes

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>In 2019, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">announced deprecation</a> of the Azure AD Graph service. One year ago we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library/ba-p/1257363">communicated</a> that Azure AD Graph will be retired and stop functioning after June 30, 2023. We also previously communicated that three legacy PowerShell modules (Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online) would be deprecated on June 30, 2023. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to provide an update on timelines for these changes and offer further clarity on what to expect going forward. No new investment is going into Azure AD Graph and the three PowerShell modules, making it very important that all customers prioritize migration to Microsoft Graph APIs and Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to ensure continued support and functionality. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we understand that many customers are not yet complete with these migrations and we confirm our continued commitment to work with our customers during this migration period to minimize and avoid impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure AD Graph Updates:&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 No changes will be made to Azure AD Graph availability on June 30, 2023, and no applications using Azure AD Graph will be impacted on this date.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 June 30, 2023 marks the completion of a 3-year notice period for deprecation of Azure AD Graph. We will now enter the retirement cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 We will make no further investment in Azure AD Graph, and Azure AD Graph APIs have no SLA or maintenance commitment beyond security-related fixes.&nbsp; 
 We will retire Azure AD Graph in incremental steps, with the intention of allowing sufficient time for migration of applications to Microsoft Graph APIs. The first step will involve blocking newly created applications from using Azure AD Graph APIs. We will clarify the date for this first step in a future update, with three (3) months of advance notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 We will provide regular updates on the steps for this retirement cycle with further details on what to expect and required actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 PowerShell Module Updates:&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 As previously <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/migrate-your-apps-to-access-the-license-managements-apis-from/ba-p/2464366">communicated</a>, the legacy licensing assignment PowerShell cmdlets (Set-AzureADUserLicense, Set-MsolUserLicense, -LicenseAssignment or -LicenseOptions parameters of New-MsolUser) and Azure AD Graph API (assignLicense) are retired. For customers who were provided an extension for these cmdlets and API, migrations to Microsoft Graph licensing APIs/PowerShell must be completed by September 30, 2023.&nbsp; 
 We recognize that the legacy PowerShell modules are required for some scenarios not yet available in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Therefore, we are postponing the deprecation date for MS Online, AzureAD, and AzureAD Preview PowerShell modules to March 30, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph on June 30, 2023?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be no impact to applications using Azure AD Graph at the June 30, 2023 milestone. Applications will continue to function, but Azure AD Graph APIs do not have SLA or maintenance commitments beyond security-related fixes. We will provide a near future update to clarify the timeline and details of our first step of retirement – blocking newly created applications from using Azure AD Graph. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to PowerShell scripts using Azure AD, Azure AD-Preview, or MS Online modules on June 30, 2023?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be no impact to PowerShell scripts using these legacy modules on or after June 30, 2023. They will continue to function and be supported until deprecation announcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to PowerShell scripts using Azure AD, Azure AD-Preview, or MS Online modules after March 30, 2024?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We plan to deprecate Azure AD, Azure AD-Preview, and MS Online PowerShell modules on March 30, 2024. After this date, the only support offered for these PowerShell modules will be support in migrating to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. Only security fixes will be offered for these PowerShell modules after deprecation is announced. Once these modules are deprecated, they will continue to work for a minimum of six (6) months before being retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are committed to working with our customers to enable smooth migration to the Microsoft Graph platform. We will provide further communication, updates on tools to help these migrations, and clarifying information regularly throughout this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Current support for Azure AD Graph and legacy PowerShell modules: 
 &nbsp; 
 
 Azure AD Graph is currently&nbsp;deprecated and&nbsp;will be supported with only security-related fixes.&nbsp; 
 Azure AD, Azure AD Preview, and MS Online PowerShell modules are not yet deprecated. These modules are supported, but no new feature capabilities are being added to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Required Actions&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio. &nbsp;<br>Reference: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-overview">Migrate from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph to Microsoft Graph</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>2. Identify and update PowerShell scripts that use the legacy modules to use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK. &nbsp;<br>Reference: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Migrate from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>The&nbsp; Indicio Academy expands the company’s expert-led training into a new certification program of courses for engineering, sales, marketing, and business development teams who want to master open-source decentralized identity and use verifiable credentials to build Trusted Digital Ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SEATTLE, June 20, 2023/Indicio, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, today announced the launch of the Indicio Academy and three new professional certifications. The goal of the Indicio Academy is to nurture expertise in open-source decentralized identity technology so that businesses, organizations, and the public sector can use verifiable data to build and deploy successful Trusted Digital Ecosystems.</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is a way to issue, share, and verify high-value data in a direct, secure, and privacy-preserving way that enables the data and its source to be trusted. Solutions built on Trusted Digital Ecosystems remove the need for direct integrations between different data systems, avoid the need for third parties to store personal data, enable mobile devices to function as highly secure APIs, and transform how we create and manage digital relationships. Easy to integrate into existing IT infrastructure, flexible, and scalable to any use case, this technology is increasingly being used to drive digital transformation through seamless and secure processes that support Web 2.0 and Web3 applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A certification course from Indicio Academy provides teams with a comprehensive understanding of how to architect, build, and deploy a complete Trusted Digital Ecosystem using open-source verifiable credential technology and how to capitalize on the value of using trusted, verifiable data. With the launch of the first certification program specializing in this technology, Indicio recognizes the urgent need for more expertise in the marketplace, both to support emerging deployments and to drive innovation in a dynamic, open-source, and interoperable technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our goal is to help teams to get to market quickly by giving them an intense training in the technology,” said Heather Dahl, Chief Executive Officer at Indicio. “Verifiable credential technology is driving digital transformation across every industry, fueling a vast number of new products and services. And right now, there is an urgent need for the kind of training that we are meeting with the Indicio Academy. Simply put, the more people we help master this technology—and the business of using it—the more value will be created, the more innovation will happen, the more benefit will be reaped.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each course is based around real-world case studies, how they were developed, and what made their implementations successful. Teams will work through course materials under the guidance of Indicio’s instructors, who all bring extensive experience in building solutions for global enterprises and the public sector using this technology. Interactive demos will help you grasp processes, information flows, and best practices for development and deployment. At the end of each course, there will be an opportunity to take an exam on what you have learned and earn a certificate.</p>
<p>The Indicio Academy offers three certified courses:</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystem Certification (3 hours): This foundational, three-hour course introduces participants to the concepts and components of decentralized identity technology and is designed for anyone who wants to learn about the technology and its business applications. There are no technical requirements for enrolling. Over three one-hour modules participants will learn about the power of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, how to design solutions for commercial and public sector applications through creating Trusted Digital Ecosystems, and how to communicate the value of these ecosystems to non-technical audiences. This course is a prerequisite for taking the advanced certificate courses.</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystem Business Professional Certification (+2 hours): This advanced course is designed for executives, directors, business development, marketing, communications, public relations, and sales. It focuses on the business of decentralized identity, value creation, and how to monetize verifiable data in Trusted Digital Ecosystems, especially through creating seamless processes. Participants will also learn how to manage the governance requirements for decentralized identity infrastructure and how to simplify the process of implementation of governance rules for participants in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem.</p>
<p>Trusted Digital Ecosystem Technical Professional Certification (+2 hours): This advanced course is specifically designed for developers, engineers, and architects and covers agent architecture, with a focus on&nbsp; mobile holder agents, mediation, connections, holding and presenting credentials, and using advanced DIDComm features. The second component focuses on how to successfully run a solution demonstration, including what to test prior to demonstration and how to present an effective solution deck.</p>
<p>The Indicio Academy is the companion to the recently announced <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-sandbox/">Indicio Proven™ Sandbox</a>. Sandbox offers a fast, simple way for teams to dive in and explore verifiable credential technology for seamless, trusted data sharing and verification using Indicio’s award-winning Proven ecosystem.

<p>The unique nature of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Digital Travel Credential (DTC) presents an exceptional opportunity to build a next-generation system for passport issuance and inspection, setting a new standard for the traveler experience. Entrust fully supports the vision set out by the ICAO for technological advances from the current eMRTD standard for ePassports to a future state that will see only virtual eMRTDs. But the journey to paperless passports will take many years.</p>
<p>There have been several policy and technical papers released – and, despite the gaps in technical specifications, we’ve seen many seamless travel pilots already. However, much of the policy work at the ICAO level to enable the passport-issuer created DTC remains in-progress or has yet to begin. Governments and industry should begin to contribute to policy discussions now to support future technology decisions.</p>
<p><a></a>DTC Standards</p>
<p></p>
<p>VC = Virtual Component&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PC = Physical Component</p>
<p>There remains significant work to do on communications protocols between the DTC and inspection systems. Most of the Type 2 and 3 specifications are yet to be developed.</p>
<p>DTC Pilots</p>
<p>Pearson Airport, Toronto</p>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency worked with Entrust and Face4 Systems Inc. on smartphone-based enrollment including DTC derivation for a touchless arrivals process for returning Canadian citizens. The goal was to test passing identity information and traveler declarations to the CBSA back-end for processing, essentially replicating kiosk-based traveler processing, but via a self-service touchless process.</p>
<p>UK / EU</p>
<p>Eurostar is working with iProov and Entrust on smartphone-based enrollment including DTC derivation for a touchless train journey check-in and border processing for passengers departing the UK from St. Pancras International. The DTC can be reused for subsequent journeys. Hundreds of transactions demonstrated improved traveler throughput without compromising security. Eurostar is deploying the service as an operational system before rolling out to stations in the EU.</p>
<p>Netherlands / Canada</p>
<p>This pilot is a collaboration between the Ministry of the Interior, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (KMar), the National Service for Identity Data (RvIG), Schiphol Airport, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and IDEMIA. Funding is provided by the European Commission. Canada’s engagement is limited to facilitating temporary procedural changes to waive the presentation of a physical passport prior to boarding. The project scope is for Netherlands and Canadian citizens departing Canada for the Netherlands.</p>
<p>DTC Use Cases</p>
<p>ICAO identifies the following potential DTC use cases:</p>
 
 Enable seamless travel 
 
<p>Using the packet of verifiable traveler data as the enabler of touchless travel experiences.</p>
 
 Improve the Advance Travel Authorization process 
 
<p>Authentication of data submitted to Electronic Travel Authorization and similar schemes, and elimination of data errors.</p>
 
 Streamline border management 
 
<p>Pushing the border out before travel starts by enabling the passenger to send data in advance, allowing authorities to make early watchlist checks.</p>
 
 Emergency Travel Document (ETD) 
 
<p>Type 3 DTCs could be issued by authorities to citizens whose passport had been lost or stolen during travel, saving significant costs and inconvenience for traveler and government alike.</p>
<p>What can document issuers do now?</p>
<p>Document issuers could follow the path being paved by the Netherlands Ministry of the Interior by getting involved in seamless travel pilots. Historically, document issuers have had little influence over how their documents are utilized. A pilot of this sort would require forging close relationships with immigration authorities and airlines. A pilot under the control of a document issuer would perhaps be easier to implement. The two obvious use cases within the control of a document issuer are streamlining border management and the issuance of emergency travel documents.</p>
<p>The rate of adoption of innovations in the passport world has some very understandable friction. Most passports are valid for 10 years, and ICAO’s policy to be backward compatible with previous technology whenever possible may make changes appear slower in implementation. But for the people directly involved, whether from industry or government, there is a growing excitement for the changes the DTC will bring to the world of travel.</p>

<p>HYPR recently announced the appointment of Matt Hartley as our Chief Revenue Officer. With more than two decades in cybersecurity and technology, Matt brings invaluable expertise in sales leadership and go-to-market strategies to propel HYPR through the next stage of growth.</p>  
<p>Prior to joining HYPR, Hartley held senior positions driving rapid scale and predictability across the revenue lifecycle at security organizations including iboss, Forescout, Optio Labs and MobileIron. As Chief Revenue Officer at iboss, Hartley led go to market growth in the SASE/SSE market. During his tenure at Forescout, he built their US Federal unit and then scaled the business as the VP of Americas Sales. Before Forescout, he served as General Manager of Optio Labs, head of Federal sales at MobileIron, and held regional sales positions at various technology companies.</p> 
<p>HYPR spoke to Matt Hartley to talk about his new role, the state of the market and why he chose HYPR.</p> 
 What gets you excited about this role? How do you think your previous roles and experiences prepared you for this position?  
<p>MH: I'm excited to join HYPR because the transformations happening in the market, particularly a shift of applications and people off traditional campuses and "perimeters," present security challenges and business opportunities that HYPR uniquely addresses.&nbsp; Identity is a critical market that spans beyond security into risk, HR, compliance and other business-critical functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While the security industry has been talking about the importance of identity for years, it rapidly accelerated with the pandemic.&nbsp; We have also seen legacy MFA solutions built on the password collapse under the onslaught of automated attacks. Importantly, we've now reached a point where we have novel solutions that can address the authentication pain point that has been the top vector of breaches for many years.</p> 
<p>My experiences to this point have shaped an understanding of the cyber security issues and also how solutions to these problems can create lasting business value for our customers.&nbsp; And HYPR is already leading in that direction with the most demanding customer environments at global scale who attest to the enhanced security of the HYPR platform but also of tremendous productivity gains for their end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why HYPR?  
<p>MH: HYPR’s vision, culture and world-class talent is what ultimately drew me to the company.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR stood out in its level of expertise, technical breadth and platform approach. I saw a team of collaborative doers, focused on solving problems and moving forward.</p> 
<p>Moreover, I understood that HYPR has a proven Identity Platform used by over 16 million users in 125 countries with a transformative roadmap informed by their global clients. HYPR sits in a unique position with control and visibility at the endpoint, browser, and mobile device.&nbsp; This distinctive advantage provides a powerful combination for customers at the point of authentication where many cyber incidents begin today. I am thrilled to join this team as the company enters a next-level growth phase helping more organizations fix the way they log in and create identity trust.</p> 
 Where do you see the market headed in the coming year, what are some of the major trends and themes we’ll see?  
<p>MH:&nbsp; We are beginning a sea change in the identity industry. The FIDO standard is being broadly adopted for consumer and enterprise use cases. The support of Apple, Google, and Microsoft for passkeys will certainly accelerate user adoption and acceptance. The transition to passkeys will present challenges and opportunities for the market. Companies will need to make critical decisions&nbsp; about how they implement, use and manage passkey-based authentication. Companies need an identity security partner with expertise in change management and a solution that provides flexibility along with the controls enterprises require. HYPR is&nbsp; already helping organizations accelerate their rollout of passkeys to meet internal and customer demand for modern authentication.</p> 
 Anything else you want people to know?  
<p>MH: The next generation of authentication is here NOW. If you're tired of passwords and want a consumer experience for users that makes logging in a delight, while simultaneously more secure, <a href="https://get.hypr.com/contact">contact us </a>to have a conversation.</p>

   Extra Virgin Olive Oil is often inauthentic, according to the article on Well and Good. Not only that, those mislabeled oils can cause health issues due to the unhealthy seed oils or nut oils that are added and which some people are sensitive to. The fake oils make life harder for the honest people of those Olive Brands that put so much work and dedication into producing the real stuff!

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 5th June to 18th&nbsp;June <p>Welcome to the latest edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, keeping you up-to-date with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency regulations.</p><p>From the UK’s Crypto Parliamentary Group advocating accelerated crypto regulations to Brazil embedding robust laws for crypto transparency, we’ve seen significant strides on the regulatory frontlines over the two&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>The US, on the other hand, is grappling with regulatory uncertainty as industry leaders call for comprehensive oversight.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Shift: Countries Align Towards Robust Crypto Regulations <p>In a bid to streamline and fortify the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector, legislative assemblies across the globe are taking decisive action. The focus appears to be squarely set on creating robust frameworks for regulation and oversight, potentially redefining the global crypto landscape.</p><p>Starting in the UK, the Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG) has urged the government to expeditiously introduce crypto financial services regulations.</p><p>As cryptocurrencies continue gaining momentum, the government’s previous suggestion to include crypto within existing financial service regulations is being championed by the APPG. They aim to see the UK equipped with specific crypto regulations within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Aiming to leverage the UK’s potential leadership in the sector, lawmakers are also debating bills to grant law enforcement agencies more authority over crypto activities, alongside the current requirement for crypto companies to register with the Financial Conduct Authority.</p><p>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Brazil, President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva has solidified his country’s position within the crypto world by signing comprehensive regulations into law. This decree, which defines the roles of the Central Bank and the country’s securities regulator, is set to take effect on June 20, positioning Brazil as a stable, innovative hub for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">Image Source</a><p>A central aspect of the law is the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism within the crypto industry, further solidifying Brazil’s commitment to a secure and transparent environment for digital currency transactions. This regulatory measure harmoniously aligns with Brazil’s ongoing exploration of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the Digital Brazilian Real.</p><p>The urgency of these international regulatory shifts is further underscored by the United States’ current predicament.</p><p>The lack of federal oversight in the US digital commodity market has created uncertainty, sparking conversations about the approach of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>The Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, advocates for Congressional intervention to protect customers, ensure market stability, and safeguard the traditional financial system from potential contagion. He suggests implementing well-established regulations focusing on asset protection, trading activity surveillance, conflict of interest prevention, and cybersecurity standards.</p><p>Further echoing these concerns, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has expressed her support for regulatory oversight of cryptocurrency to protect consumers and investors.</p><p>As cryptocurrencies continue to disrupt traditional financial structures, the collective call for swift, comprehensive regulation has now clearly become a global phenomenon. The challenge, as always, lies in striking the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring stability and protection for all participants.</p><p>Now, we’ll analyze two of the biggest developments from the fortnight and look into their possible impacts on the crypto ecosystem.</p> Cross-Party UK Group Pushes for Swift Crypto Regulation <p>The Crypto and Digital Assets All Parliamentary Group (APPG), a cross-party body in the UK, has urged the government to expedite regulating cryptocurrency financial services.</p><p>The APPG recently published a report outlining 53 recommendations for cryptocurrency regulation, aiming to position the UK as a leader in the global crypto market. It advocates for expanded powers for lawmakers over the crypto sector to boost financial security and consumer protection.</p><p>The group’s report, launched in response to a vision of making the UK a crypto hub, also highlights the need for dedicated units within regulatory bodies to handle digital assets. Additional recommendations include backing stablecoins with high-quality fiat currency assets and considering the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This proposal by the APPG diverges from a recent suggestion by the House of Commons Treasury Committee to regulate crypto-like gambling.</p><p>Instead, the APPG’s report focuses on establishing a comprehensive tax framework for crypto, mitigating financial stability risks, and curbing economic crimes linked to crypto. The group is also examining the potential for a Central Bank Digital Currency.</p> The Impact <p>The ripple effects of these proposed regulations could be far-reaching. From the perspective of crypto users, increased regulatory oversight might bring more security to digital asset transactions. It could help safeguard investors from potential fraud and insulate them from high-risk exposure.</p><p>Clear-cut regulations might also foster transparency in the crypto market, thereby boosting investor confidence and attracting more participants to the ecosystem. However, regulatory decisions could also potentially hinder the freedom and privacy that is intrinsic to the world of digital currencies. It’s a delicate balance between regulation for protection and stifling innovation.</p><p>For the ecosystem at large, establishing a stable regulatory framework can help enhance the legitimacy of crypto transactions and integrate them more seamlessly into traditional financial systems.</p><p>The attention given to the environmental impact of crypto is critical, given the ongoing debate about the carbon footprint of blockchain-based transactions.</p><p>Overall, the move towards regulation signifies the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a significant part of the financial sector. It’s a crucial step towards shaping a more secure and transparent future for digital assets in the global&nbsp;market.</p> CFTC Chairman Advocates Congressional Action for Robust Crypto Regulation <p>CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam is pressing for a shift in the United States’ regulatory response to cryptocurrencies.</p><p>In a recent address to the House Committee on Agriculture, he underlined the need for a more proactive stance instead of the SEC’s current “Regulation by Enforcement” method, citing it as unfit for the fast-evolving crypto industry.</p><p>He highlighted major issues, such as the collapse of large digital asset platforms and market manipulation, as examples of why a change in strategy is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>Behnam’s suggested solution? Adopting regulations familiar to traditional finance, covering customer asset protection, trading surveillance, conflict of interest, and strict cybersecurity measures.</p><p>Such a move could have major ramifications for the crypto ecosystem. On the one hand, it may protect users from mishaps like platform bankruptcies and unscrupulous trading, potentially even easing the market’s infamous volatility. Stricter cybersecurity standards would also fortify the defense against persistent cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Yet, an uptick in regulation could restrict the independence characteristic of digital currencies. It’s, therefore, vital to find a balance that protects users while not hampering innovation in the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>On a broader scale, clearly defined regulatory frameworks could enhance the industry’s credibility, potentially attracting more institutional players and fostering mainstream cryptocurrency acceptance. However, overregulation risks dampening the sector’s innovative flair.</p><p>The proposal to transition from a reactive to a proactive approach in regulating cryptocurrencies signifies a potential watershed moment in the United States’ regulatory stance on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The impact of this change will undoubtedly shape the role of cryptocurrencies within the broader financial system, setting the tone for their&nbsp;future.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">What is Shyft Veriscope?</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669428636691185664?s=20">Travel Rule Compliance Challenges</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669668973800038401?s=20">Secured User Data&nbsp;Exchange</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

				  Creating an Ecosystem Governance Framework to Jump-Start a Minimum <br>Viable Ecosystem  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  In the world of ecosystem design, building a thriving and sustainable ecosystem requires careful planning and effective governance. In this video, Darrell discusses the role of an Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) in driving the activities of a Minimum Viable Ecosystem (MVE).

				  Attracting and Aligning Partners in Ecosystems 
<p>When it comes to creating an ecosystem, one of the main challenges lies in attracting and aligning the right partners who can contribute to its growth and success. However, partners may hesitate to join if they are unsure of how they fit into the ecosystem or what their role would be. This is where an EGF comes into play.</p>
 Addressing the “Cold Start” Problem with an EGF 
<p>An EGF serves as a powerful tool to address the “cold start” problem. By providing structure and guidance, it becomes easier for partners to understand how they can actively contribute and extract value from the ecosystem. Additionally, the framework jumpstarts the ecosystem’s growth by aligning partners’ interests and facilitating collaboration.</p>
 Going Beyond Platforms: The Role of Ecosystem Governance 
<p>While platforms primarily handle technical interactions and data movement, ecosystems encompass much more. They revolve around various roles and activities, determining what is encouraged, what is forbidden, and how interactions occur. Furthermore, ecosystems require effective governance, including addressing liability and indemnity concerns.</p>
  Tailoring an EGF for Maximum Value Creation 
<p>When an EGF is specifically tailored for a MVE, it plays a crucial role in delivering a compelling value proposition. It becomes instrumental in attracting partners and establishing a solid foundation for the ecosystem’s growth. By identifying areas where to build and where to rely on partners, organizations can strategically leverage the strengths of different participants to maximize value creation.</p>
 Simplifying Governance for Efficiency and Trust 
<p>While governance frameworks can often be complex, Continuum Loop advocates for simplicity and efficiency. The key is to focus on the core components that require governance, minimizing roles and processes to maintain manageability. Additionally, implementing governance artifacts such as glossaries and assurance levels becomes critical in ensuring shared understanding and maintaining trust among ecosystem participants.</p>
 Empowering Organizations with Continuum Loop 
<p>At Continuum Loop, we are deeply committed to empowering organizations in designing and implementing effective ecosystem governance frameworks. Our expertise lies in aligning governance, business, and technology to help companies build vibrant ecosystems that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and shared success.</p>
 Leveraging Ecosystem Governance Frameworks for Success 
<p>By leveraging the power of ecosystem governance frameworks, organizations can create an environment where partners can contribute their unique expertise, drive value creation, and collectively shape the future of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>The word "wallet" gets used a lot, but is rarely defined. Whether you're fresh to web3 or a seasoned veteran, you've likely felt this confusion. Even worse: maybe you don't know you're confused? Let me explain.</p> What Is a Wallet?   "Which wallet should I use?"  "What wallet should I send this to?"  "Can I import my wallet?"  <p>In each of these questions, "wallet" refers to a completely different part of the Wallet Stack: a <code>Wallet Client</code>, an <code>Account &amp; Account Address</code>, and a <code>Recovery Method</code>—which itself infers the existence of a <code>Wallet Structure</code>.</p>The Wallet Stack consists of: a Wallet Client, a Recovery Method &amp; Wallet Structure, and and Account &amp; Address.<p>Colloquially, calling every part of the stack a "wallet" isn't an issue. For many people right now, they all indeed feel like the same thing. Where the problem becomes real is in the UI copy itself.</p><p>Across and within various <code>Wallet Clients</code>, the word wallet leaks inconsistently into the user experience. It's no wonder people get confused. For new users this can be misleading. For experienced users it may never be clear what's actually going on underneath.</p><p>Let me pick on Coinbase Wallet for a moment to ground this in an example. Not only are they the most successful brand in blockchain, they are also one of the worst abusers of the word wallet.</p>Coinbase Wallet: A tragedy in 3 parts<p>To enter Coinbase Wallet's world, one must:</p>  Install Coinbase Wallet (a <code>Wallet Client</code>), which will prompt you to  Create a new Wallet (aka set up a new <code>Recovery Method</code> that will generate a password protected <code>Wallet Structure</code>), at which point  The app will provision you with 10 Wallets (which are actually 10 <code>Accounts</code> identified by their unique <code>Account Addresses</code>).  <p>Because many people only go through this flow once, and never bother going into settings, their confusion may be fleeting. But can you imagine what internal Coinbase Wallet sprint planning looks like? "Alex, can you fix the bug with wallets being derived non-deterministically from the wallet a user imports into the latest version of our wallet?"</p><p>Poor Alex. Poor us.</p><p>Those of us designing and building need to be more precise. So: let's get precise.</p><p>A couple of notes: This post uses Ethereum examples, but the ideas hold true for smart contract enabled chains in general, and will be identical in practice for all EVM compatible chains. You’ll also notice I’m explicitly not using the word dapp. If a dapp is software whose backend is strictly hosted on a blockchain, that is a subset of all apps. I believe all apps will have wallet interactions in the near future.</p> Wallet Clients <p>When someone asks "Which wallet should I use?" what they're really asking is "Which wallet client should I use?"—examples being Metamask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, a Ledger Nano, or a Gnosis Safe. The <code>Wallet Client</code> is the interface they'll use to connect to an app, sign messages and transactions, and manage their on-chain assets.</p> Varieties Of Wallet Client <p>A wide variety of <code>Wallet Clients</code> exist, and the list grows daily. To thoughtfully recommend one, it's important to know a bit more about a person's intentions. What's their threat model? Which chain(s) are they going to be using? What do they want to do in web3?</p><p>Even with clear answers to those questions, making the right recommendation can be complicated. <a href="https://mirror.xyz/depatchedmode.eth/uxsq5GRcelYkwPB-BicnfjTPisxiNVJCQQ3bIGPPmmQ">There are just so many options out there</a>. It’s helpful to think about the ways you can categorize <code>Wallet Clients</code>:</p>  Software vs Hardware: Most folks will start out by using a software wallet on their laptop, tablet or phone—either in the form of a native app, web app, or a browser extension. Eventually, they're going to want more security and are likely to move to something like a Ledger Nano—a dedicated piece of hardware with embedded firmware. Software and hardware clients mostly map to the concept of hot wallets and cold wallets respectively. TLDR: putting valuable assets into cold storage on a hardware wallet client is a good move.  Finance vs Identity-focused: Historically, folks have turned to their <code>Wallet Client</code> to manage the financial activity they’re engaged in on-chain: monitoring their portfolio value, or swapping and staking assets. But, over the past year we've seen <code>Wallet Clients</code> such as Autonomy and Rainbow begin to support viewing and interacting with an NFT collection, and even constructing public profiles. These features address the emerging desire to garden on-chain identities—or rather, <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/inventories-not-identities-7da9a4ec5a3e">inventories</a>.  Single vs Multi-chain: Most <code>Wallet Clients</code> focus on support for a single blockchain ecosystem: Metamask on Ethereum, Phantom on Solana, Kepler on Cosmos, or Kukai on Tezos. But there are options that support multiple chains from a single interface. Trust Wallet may have the broadest blockchain support out of the box, while Metamask has begun supporting additional blockchain networks via its 3rd party Snaps add-ons. Single chain <code>Wallet Clients</code> tend to be more mature and have better UX, but multi-chain clients are the final destination.  EOA vs Contract-based: Signing transactions and messages (for better and for worse) is the backbone of web3 experiences. Most <code>Wallet Clients</code> rely on Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) under the hood and require a single signature to "okay" a transaction—we'll explain this in more depth shortly. When you want to up your security, diversify your recovery paths, bundle transactions, set spending limits, or support other sophisticated organizational workflows, there are also contract-based clients. Gnosis Safe and Argent are examples of contract-based clients that enable features such as multiple signatures (multi-sigs) to process a transaction. Beware: not all apps support multi-sigs directly.   Challenges Wallet Clients Face   Overloaded Scope: At this moment in time, <code>Wallet Clients</code> pull triple duty in the web3 space, handling: private key management, application UI, and transaction/asset management. Billy Rennekamp explains how this could be restructured with his proposed <a href="https://billyrennekamp.medium.com/account-coordinator-a-proposal-for-the-future-of-wallets-9fc54032a202">Account Coordinator</a> pattern.  Not Being Metamask: If you're using anything other than Metamask, chances are high you're connecting your <code>Wallet Client</code> to an app using a wallet transport layer like <a href="https://walletconnect.com/">Wallet Connect</a>. Or you’re hoping your <code>Wallet Client</code> has decided to emulate Metamask.  Poor Mobile Support: On mobile, most apps expect you to copy the URL to your clipboard, open your <code>Wallet Client</code>, launch its in-app web browser, and then paste the URL. Once again, implementing <code>Wallet Connect</code> in your app helps alleviate this and allows your users to use their mobile browser of choice. As a sidenote, most web3-enabled apps are neither responsive nor mobile-friendly; it is imperative that developers and designers adopt a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-to-develop-and-test-a-mobile-first-design-in-2021/">mobile first approach to user experience</a>.  Inconsistent Terminology: Accounts? Wallets? Import? Add? Connect? Link? Different combinations of these words appear all over the place referring to different things. Hopefully this post will help to chip away at some of that confusion, but there is still a lot of ground to cover. It is critical the teams behind <code>Wallet Clients</code> continue to engage in user research to identify the right mental models and terminology to support them—with a mind towards localization as well!  No Settings Portability: If you've ever tried migrating to a different instance of Metamask, or from Metamask to Rainbow Wallet—not picking on either of them specifically—you've learned with some frustration that you have to setup everything from scratch again: account names, block and allow lists, token lists, network settings, etc. That process is both tedious and error prone to do even once, let alone maintain on an ongoing basis.  Centralization Under the Hood: Many of the user experience improvements wallets have achieved in terms of displaying assets and transaction history have been gained through leveraging highly centralized 3rd party APIs. Moxie Marlinspike published an excellent tear down of <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">where this centralization has introduced fragility</a> into the ecosystem. There are better ways.   Accounts &amp; Account Addresses <p>When someone asks "Which wallet should I send this to?" what they're really asking is "What's the account address I should send this to?"—the long base-58 string that identifies your account on the chain.</p><p>So, what exactly is the account that address identifies? Well, there are two distinct types.</p>The triangle is, in fact, the strongest shape. Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):   live off-chain—ie. they are "external" to the blockchain  are controlled by a private key, from which a public key and address are derived  are responsible for initiating all transactions   Contract Accounts:   live on-chain as code  are controlled by the functions defined in that on-chain code  can only act in response to transactions issued by EOAs  <p>Though Contract Accounts are becoming more common, most people still have EOAs. This is because, even if you use a Contract Account, an EOA must still be present somewhere in the chain to trigger the action you want to take—though there are <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">plans in motion</a> to address this with Account Abstraction.</p><p>With both types of accounts, the Account Address is the way that you refer to it in a transaction.</p>Differences between EOAs and Contract Accounts Human-Readable Aliases <p>Most folks can’t just remember and rattle off the 20 byte long base-58 string that is their <code>Account Address</code>. So, protocols such as ENS allow a human-readable alias to be mapped to any address. The result is that I can invite you to send tips to <code>depatchedmode.eth</code> (🤑) instead of forcing you to test the limits of human memory (and typing skills). Many apps and <code>Wallet Clients</code> support these aliases in both directions: raw addresses will show up as ENS domains when they exist, and pasting ENS domains in various places will resolve to their underlying addresses.</p><p>It is worth underscoring that you can change the address your ENS domain points to, in case you migrate to a new primary account in the future. Because of this, an ENS domain can be a more stable way to identify yourself to other people in much the same way that your phone number remains stable as you move from one home to the next.</p>ENS domains can be pointed at an EOA or Contract Account. What's In Your Account? <p>Nothing. Surprised? This is one of the reasons that many people say a <a href="https://gaby.mirror.xyz/0Wq9zk0pZu_s3W1S4BiNcYXw9uSfSVbyGjNPgLHcs18">"wallet" is a broken metaphor.</a> When you think of a wallet, you imagine a thing that:</p>  Contains Stuff: It’s full of coins, bills and cards that you fold up and slide into your front pocket.  Is Default Private: Nobody can see any of that stuff unless you decide to show them.  <p>The blockchain account you’re managing in your wallet shares neither of those characteristics. A blockchain account:</p>  Contains Nothing: When I say that nothing is in your account, I mean it. No matter what asset you are referring to, whether it be ETH, an ERC-20, or an NFT, the balance that is attributed to your account is stored elsewhere and points to your account. In the case of an EOA this shouldn't be surprising, because the assets are on chain and—as we just illustrated—your account is not. The same is true for contract accounts.  Is Default Public: Anyone can look up your ENS domain or public address to see the entire list of current and past assets associated with that account, as well as all its transactions.  Realize the truth: there is no wallet. Challenges That Accounts Face <blockquote><p>You need each of the following for Safe NFTing:<br>✅A multi-sig archival wallet for things you don't plan to trade. Don't connect this to any service at all.<br>✅Transaction wallet(s) for selling/buying main marketplaces only<br>✅Aping addresses for connecting to random new stuff</p>— 6529 (@punk6529) <a href="https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1495450982079254541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2022</a></blockquote>

  Account Composition: Beyond the wallet being a broken metaphor, Dan Finlay has gone so far as to say recently that even "account" is a <a href="https://twitter.com/danfinlay/status/1526937584781230081?s=20&amp;t=W4eBXr4S6yUNZ-iSyKZAIg">skeuomorphic dead end</a>. And many folks are weighing in on how you might want to compose your set of accounts in order to best protect yourself against loss and theft.  Consent Layer: Because blockchains are permission-less and the assets are pointed at your address from elsewhere, anybody can put anything "in" your account at any time. This leaves the door open for a great deal of harassment, fraud, and general mischief. We need to carefully consider appropriate counter measures. Where and how does a consent layer (aka requesting permission) best fit into a permission-less system?  Multi-chain Address Space: In many instances, the same addresses can exist on multiple chains and networks. In other instances, it’s impossible for an address on one chain to exist on another. This all comes down to the compatibility of encryption methods used. When someone provides just an <code>Account Address</code> how do you know which chain or network they are targeting? This hasn’t been a problem in single chain <code>Wallet Clients</code>, but in a multi-chain world this problem becomes very real. There are technical standards to address this, but still not many user experience best practices.  Nascent Contract Account Support: As I already mentioned, there are a lot of benefits that Contract Accounts can bring, but they are still not widely supported for interacting with apps.   The Recovery Method &amp; Wallet Structure <p>When someone asks "Can I import my wallet?" what they're really asking is "Can I use my recovery method in this wallet client to rebuild the wallet structure that contains all of my accounts?" Bit of a mouthful, I know. Let’s break it down.</p><p>Let’s start with the <code>Recovery Methods</code>. These do exactly what you’d expect: help to recover your accounts or set them up for the first time on a new device. There are a lot of potential ways to design recovery methods, but let’s focus on the two standards-based approaches most commonly supported by <code>Wallet Clients</code> today:</p>  Private Keys: As we saw above, every account has both a private key and a public key. If you have an account's private key, you can always use it to recover the public key and account address. It’s created from a combination of randomness and cryptographic math. Strong arguments can be made that private keys should never be user facing.  Recovery Phrases (aka Seed Phrases/Mnemonic Phrases): These are the 12 or 24 word phrases (defined by <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP-39</a>) that you are encouraged to back up safely &amp; securely. Their original intention was to be a human readable way to produce the randomness required to generate a private key. They are less prone to transcription errors than a base-58 string, easier to speak aloud (see: accessibility), and possibly (though it’s a stretch for most) even memorized.  <p>These recovery methods are incredibly powerful! They help your <code>Wallet Client</code> consistently derive what we’ll call the <code>Wallet Structure</code>: the list of all your accounts and the private keys that control them.</p><p>"Wait—what do you mean ‘derive’? Why don't you just say ‘create’?"</p><p>Because—brace yourself—every possible account in any blockchain address space already exists 🤯. Check out Dmitri Cherniak's <a href="https://deadringers.dmitricherniak.com/">Dead Ringers</a> for a visually sumptuous example of this in action. So, we say derived because your <code>Recovery Phrase</code> is used to discover a specific public/private keypair that controls an account.</p><p>"But wait… how do you avoid two people getting access to the same account?"</p><p>Incomprehensibly large numbers of things. There are so many possible accounts that, even though we’re deriving keypairs for them randomly, the odds of generating the same one twice are infinitesimally small. You have a better chance of hitting the moon by throwing a rock. But a well designed <code>Recovery Method</code> lets you derive the account deterministically.</p><p>"Wait—can you clarify what you mean by ‘deterministically’? Just so I’m sure."</p><p>We say it is deterministic because the same <code>Recovery Method</code> will derive the same keypairs 100% of the time. Almost all <code>Wallet Clients</code> achieve this through the magic of Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (HD wallet)—the most common <code>Wallet Structure</code>.</p><p>"OMG, yet another thing called a wallet!?" Yes.</p>Please, keep saying wallet. All words should be wallet. What Is An HD Wallet? <p>It's a tree of accounts derived from a single root keypair, and originated in the Bitcoin world as <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP-32</a>.</p><p>An HD Wallet is a pretty interesting construct because, using <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">BIP-44</a>, a <code>Wallet Client</code> can walk what's called a derivation path and "discover" all the accounts that have associated on-chain activity—magic! This aspect of an HD wallet's tree of accounts is pretty under-explored. Most wallet clients support just a single account, or a single layer of accounts. But technically you can have children accounts, and grand children accounts, and so on. There’s no limit to the number of levels!</p><p>Now, I’m but a simple designer. There are many reasons to be cautious about how HD Wallets are used, and how many accounts and child accounts you tie to a single recovery method; as they say, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. But, it seems worth investigating them more deeply as a means of addressing at least part of the account composition problem. Not everybody has the same threat model.</p>Child accounts, literally! Challenges That Current Recovery Methods Face   Diverse Threat Models: Even software professionals are not security experts. It’s hard for most people to know exactly how much time and energy they should put into securing their assets—a problem that is not unique to blockchains—and what sort of practices they should routinely engage in to monitor and respond to changing circumstances. This practice is called threat modelling. There’s a lot of room for building tools and practices that help increase awareness and default people into the practices that best fit their current threat model.  Accessibility: Though recovery phrases push accessibility forward a bit, the BIP-39 spec explicitly states "it is strongly discouraged to use non-English wordlists." The vast majority of people on Earth speak no English. So many things in this space carry with them the baggage of the programming languages that support them being English and ASCII prime.  Fragility: You only have to make a mistake with your recovery mechanism once, and then it is compromised—or lost! You may not even realize you’ve compromised or lost your recovery method until it’s too late. It’s hard to strike the right balance between ensuring a Recovery Method is at hand when you need it, but that also secured against theft. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">Vitalik has written a great introduction to the importance of Social Recovery</a> as an alternative approach moving forward.   Wallet Out <p>So, I hope you've got a clearer model of how the pieces of the Wallet Stack weave together. And the next 10 times you feel the world "wallet" on the tip of your tongue, I hope you momentarily pause to check that your using the most precise term you can.</p><p>I hope that, in the next Coinbase Wallet sprint, someone asks "Alex, can you fix the bug with <code>accounts</code> being derived non-deterministically in the <code>wallet structure</code> when users input their <code>recovery method</code> in the latest version of our <code>wallet client</code>?" It’ll take some practice, but over time it’ll pay dividends for us, our collaborators, and the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>Is there any single piece of the Wallet Stack that we can simply call a "wallet", though? In Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Vitalik Buterin’s latest white paper "<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s Soul</a>", they opt to use wallet as a synonym for account (emphasis mine).</p><blockquote>We begin by explaining the primitives of DeSoc, centered around accounts (or wallets) holding non-transferable (initially public) "soulbound" tokens (SBTs) representing commitments, credentials, and affiliations. Such tokens would be like an extended resume, issued by other wallets that attest to these social relations.</blockquote><p>I’ll save my quibbles with the word "soul" for a separate post, but as goes Vitalik’s steady thought leadership, so goes much of the community. I suspect the wallet/account terminological collapse is where we’re headed. And that is fine, as long as we aim for consistency and clarity—both in our discussions about what to build, and the UI copy our wallet clients expose.</p>The revised Wallet Stack diagram.<p>Great challenges and opportunities lay ahead for the Wallet Stack in a multi-chain world! My only wish is that we pursue them with common terms.</p>I welcome feedback. <p>Ryan Betts is Head of Design here at Fission. He's working on UX patterns for the local-first edge apps we power.

SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe the structure and semantics of the defined schema comprehensibly. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We've added support for more XSD datatypes (all numeric datatypes and binary strings) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/139?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#139</a>).  We've added support for AT Protocol’s <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Lexicon schema definition format</a> (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/140?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#140</a>) and added a “map” layout used to represent Lexicon records (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/142?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#142</a>).  We've redesigned the Rust code generator to simplify maintenance and future extensions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#143</a>), and added an update to generate code for restricted data types with runtime validation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/145?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#145</a>). Lastly, we've added a default value property for primitive layouts.

<p>There are many benefits to both users and developers regarding local-first web applications. Here we dive into how local-first apps provide a better user experience while increasing resiliency and responsiveness and improving security.</p> Uninterrupted Productivity and Enhanced Reliability <p>One of the key reasons folks choose to build and use local-first applications is their ability to work offline. Users can access and interact with the app with limited or no Internet connectivity. This is great for users in rural areas with poor networks or when there is spotty coverage.</p><p>Offline functionality is made possible through data synchronization and conflict resolution. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> (Webnative File System) uses a cryptographic tree structure (cryptree) that gives every file and folder a unique key. This enables offline access control while keeping the data encrypted and portable. </p> Instant Responsiveness and Faster Performance <p>Local-first apps store and process data locally! That means less waiting around for a server to respond to the user's request. Fetching data locally leads to quicker load times and a more responsive application. It also helps users with limited bandwidth or costly Internet connections by reducing network costs.</p> Enhanced Data Privacy <p>Since the data remains on the user's device, nothing gets transferred to a server. This minimizes the risk of data breaches and opportunities for bad actors to access personal information. Users are happy because it keeps their information private, and developers enjoy not having to become security experts on top of everything else they are already doing. Another bonus - there is no risk of violating GDPR because the developer cannot access the user's info.</p><p>Fission's WNFS offers users public and private file systems. In fact, we were the first to introduce private end-to-end encrypted data to IPFS! Using <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCANs</a> to manage authorization, users have granular access control of all their files. </p> Seamless Collaboration and Data Portability <p>Users want to be able to work together on files. Concurrent editing allows multiple users to access and edit a file at once. A distributed file system like WNFS uses CRDTs to guarantee eventual consistency.</p><p>While centralized collaboration tools lock users into their platform, local-first applications empower users to switch to different devices, platforms, and services as their needs change since they're not tied to a specific infrastructure.</p> <p>Are you building a local-first application? Tell us about it in the comments! </p>

				  The Complexity of Creating Value-Driven Ecosystems 
<p>Creating an ecosystem that delivers value and attracts the right partners in the decentralized landscape is complex. MVEs provide a solution by offering a framework that demonstrates the minimum set of activities and partnerships needed to showcase the potential value creation of an ecosystem.</p>
 Collaborative Nature of Ecosystems 
<p>Unlike apps or platforms, ecosystems are not about having complete control. They thrive on collaboration, defining roles, and establishing a structure where participants can create and share value. MVEs enable organizations to start small, gradually grow, and attract partners who align with their vision.</p>
  The Crucial Role of Ecosystem Governance Frameworks 
<p>Establishing an Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) is crucial to attract and align partners. The EGF defines the ecosystem’s rules, roles, and processes, providing clarity and structure for all participants. Continuum Loop specializes in developing robust EGFs that align governance, business, and technology for seamless ecosystem operations.</p>
 Driving Innovation and Growth Through MVEs and EGFs 
<p>By embracing the MVE concept and implementing an EGF, organizations can create an environment where partners collaborate, contribute their expertise, and share the value generated. This drives innovation, fosters growth, and contributes to the overall success of the ecosystem.</p>
 Join Us on the Journey of Building Vibrant Ecosystems 
<p>At Continuum Loop, we’re committed to helping businesses navigate the complexities of ecosystem development. Our expertise and practical approach empower organizations to harness the power of MVEs and build ecosystems that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and mutual success.</p>

  <p>This episode, sees The Week in Identity have another specialist guest: Bojan Simic, Co founder and CEO of passwordless specialists <a href="https://www.hypr.com/">HYPR</a>. Simon and Bojan delve into Bojan's story from being a computer science graduate to entering the security world pen-testing in New York and working with some of the world's largest financial services institutions. From there the inspiration to rid the world of passwords started to take hold...and ten years later, seeing HYPR as a leading passwordless authentication provider. The topic covers a range of fascinating subjects, from the perfect storm of FIDO, mobile biometrics and secure hardware storage, through to how to create strategies for mass passwordless adoption based on nudge-theory, gamification and stakeholder buy-in.  They also cover success criteria, AI and what the future may hold for IAM...</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>The level of activity around verifiable credentials has been nothing short of impressive, and as Kai pointed out, it’s noticeably bustling across the globe. The question is no longer if verifiable credentials will become mainstream, but rather when and how.</p>
<p>Particularly in Europe, where Kai and Anti are based, there’s been significant movement sparked by the initiatives of the European Union. Each European nation-state is making significant strides by investing in various projects. The landscape is punctuated by Large Scale Pilots, creating a wave of excitement.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: for those interested, the Large Scale Pilots were discussed in more detail during my <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">recent conversation with Viky Manaila</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As we recognize the value of high-integrity government credentials for commercial use cases, we mustn’t overlook a pivotal interaction: that between public and private sectors. High-value credentials from the public sector become invaluable inputs for the private sector, ripe for integration within their data ecosystems.</p>
<p>But what exactly does a commercial data ecosystem look like? What infrastructure is necessary for these commercial data ecosystems to truly flourish? The concept of a digital ecosystem is intriguing and formed part of the inspiration for this conversation (Note: I suggest reading “<a href="https://identifinity.net/wallet-wars-its-the-war-of-ecosystems-1dc9261afaa9">Wallet wars? It’s the war of ecosystems!</a>“, a blog post co-authored by Antti and Kai). In this piece, they nicely outline the dynamics between different players – the public sector, big tech mobile platform giants, and other technology providers – and various scenarios that could emerge in the battle for ecosystem dominance.</p>
<p>So this podcast discussion is centered on what makes commercial data ecosystems viable. Both guests are well-qualified to delve into these topics. I was particularly keen to hear from Kai about how advancements in his work on data spaces at <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData</a> could offer valuable tools for commercial ecosystem participants to manage governance, liability, and more.</p>
<p>I was also eager to explore how we can learn from existing standard organizations serving the private sector, like <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a>, and how their approaches could be adapted for a digital-first, more decentralized world. Our conversation was certainly stimulating and I believe there’s a need for more discussions like this. I hope you find it as engaging as I did.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick soundbite from the conversation:</p>
 
<a href="https://northernblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sneak-peek-1_E55.mp4">https://northernblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sneak-peek-1_E55.mp4</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Antti, Kai and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
 
 How do concepts of digital trust apply or differ in organizations versus individuals? 
 How is trust achieved differently by organizations in organization-to-organization relationships versus organization-to-people relationships? 
 Are data spaces a new type of role within this digital ecosystem? Can risk or liabilities be shared within these areas? 
 Are there historical examples of organizations serving similar purposes for different ecosystems? 
 Why is liability more important in this digital space, when the issuing authority or the party attesting to the authenticity of a document don’t necessarily take liability if something goes wrong? 
 How is liability managed in this open ecosystem space, particularly when interactions don’t necessitate a legal relationship between parties? 
 How can risk be managed to ensure enough rewards and shared risk that organizations will want to switch over and engage in the new model? 
 Could consumers manage their possible vendors through a similar scenario by owning their own data, as suggested by Doc Searls‘s writings on vendor relationship management (VRM)? (Recommended book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527">https://www.amazon.com/Intention-Economy-When-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527</a>) 
 Can the introduction of these digital ecosystems allow for earlier development of relationships in the customer acquisition cycle? 
 How can these ecosystems enable trust-based marketing? 
 How can new data ecosystems for commercial use cases be incubated and developed based on government digital identity or credentialing programs? 
 What would be some recommendations for forming governance bodies for data ecosystems and the incentives for organizations to form and deploy services within these ecosystems?

 Launching currencies on Verus, and any other PBaaS-chain (Public Blockchains as a Service), is better, faster, cheaper and more secure than any EVM-like protocol out there. This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.  What are Currencies? <p>Let’s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.</p><p>A real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.</p><p>And what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do&nbsp;it.</p> Better, Faster, Cheaper and More&nbsp;Secure <p>Why is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol? The answer is simple, because all launched currencies are part of the consensus mechanism. On EVM-like and account-based protocols (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche) currencies are not part of consensus and thus easily exploitable by smart contract bugs and malicious developers. With Verus, a UTXO model, all currencies are accounted for, and verified by the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, making it as secure as sending BTC on Bitcoin. To make it simple — all features on the Verus Protocol are on the first layer, the consensus layer.</p><blockquote>Verus fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape</blockquote><p>Also, where other protocols need L2 solutions which are mostly centralized, Verus includes self-sovereign identities, namespaces, privacy, DeFi, bridges, and currency and blockchain launches on the first layer. An innovation that fundamentally revolutionizes the preexisting cryptocurrency landscape.</p><p>Launching currencies with Verus is also much faster and cheaper than with the alternatives. The magic here is that there is no coding involved. Anyone can launch a currency by just choosing the options and parameters they would like. It is as easy as typing in a command and the currency is ready to be used by the world within minutes. This process does not involve expensive Solidity developers or security audits, saving a lot of development costs.</p><p>Another big advantage is being able to export launched currencies to Ethereum as ERC-20. These currencies can then partake in the Ethereum ecosystem, yet have better security and cheaper DeFi transactions than when they are created on Ethereum itself. Each ERC-20 token can also be bridged to Verus. It’s all super easy thanks to the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge.</p><p>This is not all some fantasy, this is all functional (the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is in testing), right now, on mainnet, on the Verus Protocol. As you now know, Verus is built fundamentally differently than any other protocol out there, and ushers in a new era for brands, communities, businesses, entrepreneurs and organizations to create value in a better and more secure way than ever&nbsp;before.</p><p>The next chapter explains the options to choose from when launching currencies.</p> Options to Launch Currencies <p>For ease of explaining, all PBaaS-chain launch options are omitted. Good to know — with Verus anyone can also launch fully interoperable, independent and customizable blockchains with all the same L1 features as the Verus blockchain. The focus of this article is on launching currencies only, on Verus or any other PBaaS-chain.</p><p>To launch a currency on Verus (and any other PBaaS-chain) a namespace is needed. That namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). That namespace can also have subIDs (e.g. product.MyBrand@, user.MyBrand@, more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>On Verus a VerusID registration costs between 20 and 100 VRSC, and the launch of a currency costs 200 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain’s native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). On other PBaaS-chains these costs can differ since the chain launcher can define its own costs for VerusID registrations and currency launches.</p><p>To define a currency, choose options. Then combine these options to whatever the currency needs to be. Just add the numbers together in the currency definition. The currency options are listed&nbsp;below.</p>  options:1 — The currency has reserves, and can be converted to and from the reserves (option 32 needs to be added). Can have one currency as its reserves, or multiple with up to 10 currencies. Let’s call it a “Basket currency” — a currency with a basket of reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized.  options:2 — Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create&nbsp;subIDs.  options:8 — Referrals and discounts are enabled for subID creation.  options:16 — Referrals are required for subID creation.  options:32 — The currency is a simple token currency without any reserves. Such a currency can be launched centralized or decentralized. This option is also used for <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Ethereum ERC-20 mapped&nbsp;tokens</a>.  options:2048 — A single satoshi (0.00000001) NFT token is created &amp; has tokenized control of the root VerusID. Which means you can send the single satoshi token to other addresses and then they have control of the root&nbsp;VerusID.  <p>Let’s give some examples of combined&nbsp;options:</p>  "options":33 — this launches a basket currency. It is options 1 + 32 combined.  "options":2080 — this launches a single satoshi token that has control of the root VerusID. It is options 32 + 2048 combined.  "options":35 — this launches a basket currency, and only the rootID can create subIDs. It is options 1 + 2 + 32 combined.  <p>And so on. More information on basket currencies, simple token currencies and subIDs in the next&nbsp;chapter.</p> Two Types of Currencies <p>There are two types of currencies that can be launched with the Verus Protocol. Basket currencies and simple token currencies. Both can be issued decentralized, or centralized (has minting and burning capabilities.)</p> Basket Currencies A simple example of a basket currency containing two reserve currencies.<p>Basket currencies are magical currencies that have reserves. Have a look at the simplified image. If anyone has currency X or Y, they can convert to the basket currency, or convert from reserve to reserve. If anyone has the basket currency, they can go to currency X or Y. A basket currency can have 1 and up to 10 reserve currencies.</p><p>The basket currency supply is dynamic, depending on how much is converted to the basket currency (supply minted), or back to its reserve(s) (supply&nbsp;burned).</p><p>A basket currency can be 100% backed by its reserves, 5%, or anything in between. This is called the reserve ratio, or the weight. The lower the reserve ratio, the more volatile the currency is when people are converting into or out of the basket currency. The value of the basket currency is directly linked to what is in the reserves and what the reserve ratio&nbsp;is.</p><p>When a centralized version of this currency is created, the owner of the rootID can mint currencies into existence, while automatically lowering the reserve ratio. Or they can burn currencies and automatically raise the reserve ratio. Anyone can also just burn the currency at will without raising the reserve&nbsp;ratio.</p><p>The conversion fees are incredibly low, 0.025% when converting to and from a basket currency, and 0.05% when converting from reserve to reserve currency. These fees go directly to the worldwide miners and stakers of the protocol, and/or they are accrued into the reserves making the basket currency worth&nbsp;more.</p><p>Because all currency conversions are solved simultaneously inside a block, giving all participants the same price, the protocol is MEV-free. The protocol doesn’t have any of the problems EVM-like account-based systems have. Verus DeFi is fair, cheap and has no rent-seekers.</p><p>Every(!) currency on the Verus network (also mapped ERC-20s!), can be used as reserves for basket currencies. As you might start to understand now — basket currencies are unique currencies that can not be found anywhere else and offer an enormous amount of opportunities for value creation. And anyone can launch them without needing any programming knowledge!</p> Simple Token Currencies <p>Simple token currencies are just currencies without any reserves. They are not as exciting as the basket currencies, yet still offer much value. With all the parameters that can be added, subIDs created and decentralized crowdfund mechanism, these currencies can support a lot of use cases that are difficult to do with alternative protocols. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">A small example of a centralized currency&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>The supply of this type of currency is static when it’s a decentralized version. When it’s a centralized version, the owner of the rootID can mint tokens into existence, and anyone can burn&nbsp;them.</p><p>This option is also used to create currencies that are mapped to Ethereum ERC-20s. Which means you can send those ERC-20s over to Verus, or from Verus to the ERC-20. This is made possible with the non-custodial Verus-Ethereum Bridge. <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">You can read more about it&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>And of course, a simple token currency can be one of the reserves in a basket currency.</p> What are&nbsp;SubIDs <p>SubIDs are powerful objects on the blockchain. They can be registered in an unlimited amount under any created currency (basket and simple token currency). A few examples are product.MyBrand@ or user.MyBrand@. The name MyBrand@ is a VerusID (a namespace) that is converted into a currency. The subIDs are ‘product’ and&nbsp;‘user’.</p><p>SubIDs can be bound digitally to many things. They can be bound to people and products. They can be bound to an unlimited amount of content, data, and provable information, both public and private. Including provable contracts and rights that can be bound to ownership of the subID&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Another powerful feature is that it has read, write and delete functions in what is called the “content multimap”. All kinds of information can be read and processed in the mempool of the blockchain.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there, it’s also a friendly name blockchain address that can receive, send, hold and stake funds, and can be used to login to services, password-free. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Read more about VerusID&nbsp;here.</a></p> Parameters to Launch Currencies This is all anyone needs to do to launch powerful currencies. Zero&nbsp;coding!<p>Next up are the parameters. Choose the parameters wisely to launch a currency that suits any need. Not all parameters are needed or combinable. There are many to go through, so let’s&nbsp;start.</p> “proofprotocol” <p>This parameter defines, among others, if the currency is centralized or decentralized. You can choose 1,2 or&nbsp;3.</p><p>1 is default, which launches a decentralized currency (no need to include this parameter when defining such a currency). When subIDs are created with this option, the registration fees are&nbsp;burned.</p><p>2 is for a centralized currency. If it’s a basket currency the rootID can mint and burn supply while automatically lowering and raising the reserve ratio (also anyone can burn supply without lowering the reserve ratio). Or when it’s a simple token currency they can just mint and burn supply. The subID registration fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>3 is for Ethereum ERC-20 mapped tokens. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>🔍 A simple token currency called MyBrand, centralized (the controller of the rootID can mint and burn), and has a preallocation of 100 tokens to&nbsp;Klaus@.</p> “currencies” <p>Here you put the names of the currencies (or just one — it must have VRSC when launched on Verus) that will be in the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33).</p><p>Or when it’s a simple token currency (options:32), what people convert during the preconversion timeframe will go to the rootID of the currency, as a funding mechanism. In the case of a simple token currency, combine it with "conversions" to determine the preconversion price.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityX", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","MyBrand"], <br>  "minpreconversion":[10,50],<br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 A basket currency called CommunityX. It needs to get a minimum of 10 VRSCTEST and 50 MyBrand into its reserves within the preconversion time frame to be launched. The initial supply of 100 CommunityX will be distributed among the preconverters.</p> “conversions” <p>Use this parameter when launching a simple token currency. Together with "currencies", it can be used as a funding mechanism for the rootID. It’s for the preconversion price. So when doing "conversions":[0.1], it means that for every VRSC the preconverter receives 10 CURRENCY after launch. The converted VRSC goes into the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>People can preconvert to this currency within the preconversion time frame. Define a "startblock", or let the default and minimum time frame play out, which is 20&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoolBrand",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[0.1],<br>  "minpreconversion":[1000]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CoolBrand. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 1000 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 10.000 CoolBrand. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “minpreconversion” <p>Use this parameter to set a minimum amount of preconversions. The minimum amount of preconversions needs to be met or the currency will not launch and everyone gets their conversions returned, minus the transaction and conversion fees. It works both with basket currencies and simple token currencies.</p><p>There is a 0.025% fee taken when preconverting. Take this into consideration when trying to meet the minimum amount of preconversions.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CompanyX",<br>  "options":32,<br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"],<br>  "conversions":[2],<br>  "minpreconversion":[500]<br>}' <p>🔍 This simple token currency is called CompanyX. During the preconversion time frame people need to convert 500 VRSCTEST to the rootID. In exchange for that they receive 250 CompanyX. If this minimum amount is not met, the currency will not launch, and everyone who did a preconvert will get their funds&nbsp;back.</p> “maxpreconversions” <p>Use this parameter to set a maximum amount of preconversions. During the preconversion time frame the amount set can not be exceeded. Everything above this amount will be automatically refunded after the currency is launched.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CoinCommunity", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "maxpreconversion":[100], <br>  "initialsupply":100<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CoinCommunity. During the preconversion time frame people can convert VRSCTEST into its reserves for 100 CoinCommunity in return. During the preconversion time frame there can not be more than 100 VRSCTEST converted into its reserves. Whatever is preconverted more will be returned.</p> “initialcontributions” <p>The rootID can contribute some or all of the minimum preconversions directly as part of the currency definition. Use this parameter to make an initial contribution to either the reserves when it’s a basket currency (options:33), or to the rootID when it’s a simple token currency (options:32).</p><p>The funds to initially contribute need to be in the rootID when defining the currency. After the preconversion time frame is over and the currency launched, the rootID has received an amount of the launched currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"CommunityBasket", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","CoinCommunity"], <br>  "initialcontributions":[10,200], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Jane@":100},{"John@":50}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called CommunityBasket. The launcher of the currency wanted to make initial contributions to its reserves. At the moment of broadcasting the currency to the network, there needed to be 210 VRSCTEST and 200 CoinCommunity in the rootID. The initial supply of 100 went to the rootID (if there weren’t any more preconverters). At the same time of the launch, 100 CoinCommunity was minted into Jane@ and 50 into John@, this lowered the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “initialsupply” <p>A required parameter for basket currencies (options:33). Does not work with simple token currencies. This is the initial supply during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People preconverting into the reserves receive from this initial&nbsp;supply.</p><p>Immediately after the currency is launched, the supply can be larger due to "preallocations".</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"SocialBrand", <br>  "options":33, "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":500, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Max@":1000}]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called SocialBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves and in return they get 500 SocialBrand distributed among them. Immediately after launch Max@ receives 1000 SocialBrand, lowering the reserve ratio of the currency.</p> “preallocations” <p>Use this parameter to receive a chosen amount of funds after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched. Funds can be directed to VerusIDs and R-addresses. Works with simple token currencies and basket currencies.</p><p>When using this parameter with basket currencies, after the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, the reserve ratio is lowered. This is because new currency has been minted after the initial supply ("initialsupply") is distributed.</p> “prelaunchcarveout” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to redirect a percentage of preconverted reserves to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>After the preconversion time frame has passed and the currency is launched, a percentage of the reserves is taken and redirected to the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio, making the currency more volatile.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"BusinessBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchcarveout":0.1<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called BusinessBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 BusinessBrand distributed among them. When the currency is launched, 10% VRSCTEST is taken out of the reserves, into the rootID. This lowers the reserve ratio by&nbsp;10%.</p> “prelaunchdiscount” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to give people a discount during the preconversion time frame. After the preconversion time frame and the currency is launched, the conversion price will be higher, depending on what percentage the discount&nbsp;was.</p><p>When using this parameter, after the currency is launched, the reserve ratio will be lowered by the discounted percentage.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"DiscountBrand", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "prelaunchdiscount":0.5<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called DiscountBrand. People can preconvert VRSCTEST into its reserves in return for 100 DiscountBrand distributed among them. Immediately after the launch of the currency, when people want to convert, the price is 50% higher. Also, the reserve ratio is 50% lower because of the prelaunchdiscount.</p> “weights” <p>Only works with basket currencies (options:33). Use this to change the respective weights of the reserves in a basket currency. The total of all weights must equal 1. With a minimum of 0.1, since there can’t be more than 10 reserve currencies in a basket currency.</p><p>Example currency:</p> definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBusiness", <br>  "options":33, <br>  "currencies":["vrsctest","BusinessBrand","DiscountBrand"], <br>  "initialsupply":100, <br>  "weights":[0.5,0.25,0.25]<br>}' <p>🔍 This is a basket currency called MyBusiness. During the preconversion time frame there are various currencies that can be converted into its reserves. They have different weights to them. 0.5 for VRSCTEST, 0.25 for both BusinessBrand and DiscountBrand.</p> “startblock” <p>Use this parameter to define the block height when the currency is launched. There is a preconversion time frame before the currency is launched. When omitting this parameter it uses a 20 block preconversion time frame before the currency is launched.</p><p>The preconversion time frame is always 20 blocks, this can not be&nbsp;less.</p> “endblock” <p>Endblock can not be defined on basket currencies. It does nothing. It could be set as a signal to software that might use the basket currency.</p><p>It can be set on centralized (proofprotcol:2) simple token currencies. When the endblock is reached, it turns the centralized currency into a decentralized one.</p> “idregistrationfees” <p>Use this parameter to change the costs of registering subIDs under the rootID. The default registration fee is&nbsp;100.</p><p>When it’s a decentralized currency the fees are burned, when it’s centralized the fees go to the&nbsp;rootID.</p><p>To enable discounts when using referrals, add "options":8 to the currency definition.</p> “idreferrallevels” <p>Use this parameter to change the levels of referrals used when registering subIDs. The default is 3&nbsp;levels.</p> “nativecurrencyid” <p>Use this parameter for mapped ERC-20 tokens. The parameter includes the Ethereum contract address for the ERC-20. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Read here for more information</a>.</p><p>These were all the parameters to use when defining currencies. There are many, and combining them in the right ways make powerful currencies and tokens.

Launch with the command-line interface, or Verus Desktop for Windows, Linux or macOS. <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>In the chapter before many examples of currency definitions are given. Let’s use one and see how it is launched.</p><p>First of all let’s see the difference between launching with Verus Desktop and the command-line interface. Verus testnet is used for testing purposes.</p><p>⚠️ It is highly recommended to launch currencies on testnet first before going to mainnet!&nbsp;⚠️</p><p>Verus Desktop: go to “Settings” (cogwheel top-right) -&gt; “Coin Settings”. There you see an input&nbsp;field.</p>Here you can run commands in Verus&nbsp;Desktop<p>To use the input field and launch a currency on Verus Desktop (see run before the command):</p> run definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}’ <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency ‘{<br>  "name":"MyBrand",<br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2, <br>  "preallocations":[{"Klaus@":100}]<br>}' <p>Now, after doing these commands in either Verus Desktop or the command-line interface you get a HEX returned. It’s a very large array of letters and numbers. We need to use this HEX to broadcast the currency to the blockchain. Only then will the currency really start and the funds taken (distributed to the miners and stakers) for the&nbsp;launch.</p> Using the&nbsp;HEX <p>To start the currency use these commands:</p><p>Verus Desktop:</p> run sendrawtransaction "HEX" <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "HEX" <p>After doing these commands the currency has started, the funds from the rootID are taken, and it takes a minimum of 20 blocks to actually launch it (and if all preconversion goals are&nbsp;met).</p> Currency information <p>During the preconversion time frame and after the launch you can lookup all kinds of information on the currency.</p><p>Verus Desktop:</p> run getcurrency "MyBrand" <p>Command-line interface: (this is for testnet, when on mainnet omit -chain=VRSCTEST or for any other PBaaS-chain, just edit VRSCTEST)</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency "MyBrand" <p>Now you know everything to launch currencies! 👉 <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The worldwide community is happy to help on&nbsp;Discord</a>!</p> Start to&nbsp;Build <p>For all the builders out there, you can start to use the Verus Protocol right now for your Dapps or businesses.

							<p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was the most widely deployed cryptographic protocol to provide security over internet communications before it was succeeded by TLS (Transport Layer Security) in 1999. Despite the deprecation of the SSL protocol and the adoption of TLS in its place, most people still refer to this type of technology as ‘SSL’.</p><p>SSL provides a secure channel between two machines or devices operating over the internet or an internal network. One common example is when SSL is used to secure communication between a web browser and a web server. This turns a website’s address from HTTP to HTTPS, the ‘S’ standing for ‘secure’.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 <br>What is an SSL Certificate? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization’s details. When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the https protocol and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser. Typically, SSL is used to secure credit card transactions, data transfer and logins, and more recently is becoming the norm when securing browsing of social media sites.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 <br>How Does an SSL Certificate Work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>SSL Certificates use something called public key cryptography.</p><p>This particular kind of cryptography harnesses the power of two keys which are long strings of randomly generated numbers. One is called a private key and one is called a public key. A public key is known to your server and available in the public domain. It can be used to encrypt any message.</p><p>If we look at this in terms of a website, the communication is happening between a website and a server.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 <br>Why Do I Need an SSL Certificate? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>&nbsp;SSL Certificates protect your sensitive information such as credit card information, usernames, passwords etc. They also:</p><p>· Keep data secure between servers</p><p>· Increase your Google Rankings</p><p>· Build/Enhance customer trust</p><p>· Improve conversion rates</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://promo-stg.infocert.it/shop/ssl/">Secure now your transactions!&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>By using the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts, SelfKey iD may provide a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. It may have the potential to eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods, possibly making the process more user-friendly and safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, but with SelfKey iD, users may have complete control over their digital identities and they might exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> rights more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
 
  Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.&nbsp; 
  The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
 
  Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved. 
  The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It might serve as proof of identity and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>

 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Staking 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>
 Highlights 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
 The Benefits of SelfKey ENS Subdomains 
 Conclusions 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>
 SelfKey ENS subdomain: Definition and Benefits 
<p>When developing new technologies, SelfKey prioritizes the concept of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity (SSID)</a>, and the SelfKey ENS subdomain is a prime example of this approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the creation of a subdomain, SelfKey is aiming to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. This technology is centered on empowering users and it may provide them with greater control over their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey’s goal is to bring a positive change to the way people operate in the digital world. To make it more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>
 What is SelfKey ENS subdomain 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is an innovative subdomain that aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly domain name resolution system. Given this, users might not have to pay recurring fees for their subdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is likely to be a subdomain of key.eth. This means that users may register their preferred subdomain by adding their name or any other word of their choosing, such as yourname.key.eth. This naming convention is similar to email addresses. And, by providing an easier way to identify and interact with Ethereum addresses, it may bring self-sovereign identity closer to mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as DNS made the internet more accessible to the masses by providing a simpler way to access websites than using IP addresses, key.eth may do the same for Ethereum addresses. It replaces long, complex addresses with a human-readable format that is easy to remember and share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may improve the ease of use of the blockchain and help resolve one of the challenges to widespread adoption. Because of this, key.eth may be a step towards a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain ecosystem.</p>
 What are the benefits of SelfKey ENS 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is designed to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. By putting user accesibility first, SelfKey is aiming to create a more inclusive domain name resolution system that builds on the strengths of ENS while adding to its advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach might make SelfKey ENS subdomain a compelling choice for anyone who values privacy and security, and wants a more user-friendly way to manage their digital identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain provides several benefits to its users:</p>
 
 One of the primary advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that every verified SelfKey iD holder may receive a free key.eth subdomain on the Ethereum Mainnet that is longer than seven characters. This free subdomain may allow users to experiment with SelfKey ENS subdomain and explore its features without having to make extra financial commitment. 
 Once users have their free subdomain, they may buy more subdomains using any of the supported tokens. Users may utilize these subdomains for various purposes, such as getting payments or creating aliases for use in games. Users may buy as many subdomains as they like and use them to streamline their online activities. 
 Another significant benefit of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that users may sell their subdomains.&nbsp; Any marketplace that supports ENS trading, such as OpenSea, is a good place to start. This feature may offer users the freedom to experiment with different subdomains. And, if they decide to change their online identity or activities, they may sell them. 
 
<p>Overall, SelfKey ENS subdomain may provide great benefits to its users. It may enable individuals to not only manage and own their domains, but also boost their visibility online. These features might make SelfKey ENS an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their online identity and activities.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and ownership of personal data. However, the traditional centralized systems we rely on for managing our digital assets and domains may compromise these rights. This is where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in as part of an ideal decentralized future.</p>
<p>ENS allows individuals to own and manage their own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and secure. This means that no central authority has control over the domain name. A feature which gives individuals complete ownership and control over their online identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS may be one such solution that offers individuals the opportunity to manage and own their own domain names without the limitations of traditional domain names. This may not only give users more control over their online presence but also provide greater privacy and security.</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI staking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI staking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Staking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI staking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be staked on with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By staking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI staking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By staking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have staked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, staking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens, as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI staking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By staking on their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Staking 
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI staking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information. To ensure the privacy and security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI staking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By staking on their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities. This branding can help individuals stand out, establish credibility, and create a positive perception among peers, potential clients, or collaborators.</p>
 Access to Resources and Information 
<p>Having an online identity grants individuals access to a vast array of resources, information, and opportunities available on the internet. It allows them to tap into online communities, educational platforms, industry-specific websites, and research databases. This empowers them to stay informed, learn, and grow in their personal and professional pursuits.</p>
 Online Identity Risks and Challenges 
<p>As with any innovation, having an online identity does not come without risks. It’s important for people to be aware of these negative aspects and to take precautions to avoid becoming victims. Even more, it’s equally important to spread awareness and educate as many people as possible about these matters.</p>
<p>If proper security measures would be in place, the following situations could be prevented:</p>
 
 Identity Theft 
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
 Online Reputation Damage 
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
 
 Identity Theft 
<p>Online <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to personal information and uses it for fraudulent purposes. For example, a hacker might gain access to an individual's online banking account and use their identity to make unauthorized transactions or steal funds.</p>
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
<p>Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. For example, a person may receive an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to click on a link and provide login credentials. Hackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.</p>
 Online Reputation Damage 
<p>In the digital age, a person's online reputation can have significant consequences. Negative or inappropriate content shared online, whether by oneself or others, can harm one's personal or professional reputation. For instance, a controversial tweet or a compromising photo shared online without consent can damage an individual's reputation and have long-lasting consequences.</p>
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> occur when sensitive information is accessed, stolen, or exposed due to security vulnerabilities in online systems. This can lead to the compromise of personal information, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or financial data. An example is when a major retail company experiences a breach, resulting in the theft of customer credit card information from their database.</p>
<p>These risks and challenges highlight the importance of maintaining strong online security practices, being cautious with personal information sharing, and being vigilant about potential threats to online identity.</p>

 An introduction to Metaverse 
 Metaverse and humanity 
<p>In order to operate in the digital space, individuals have to exist in. Therefore, the introduction of digital identities was something which came naturally with people’s need to belong on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost every person has had an online account, somewhere, or has been listed in some digital system. This was done either by the user themselves, or by other individuals in order to keep track of records more easily. The digital realm, therefore, has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is something which almost every person seeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, advancements in modern technology have unveiled the exciting possibility of interacting with virtual objects and spaces. Venturing into the metaverse has the potential to unlock doors to new realms of knowledge. It may ignite the imagination and provide opportunities to explore aspects of the world that may otherwise be physically out of reach.</p>
<p>All in all, the metaverse may change the way we, as society, interact and educate ourselves. With all of this in mind, SelfKey strives to develop digital identity solutions that may enhance security and privacy as individuals begin to explore cyberspace.</p>
 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention. Although it is currently limited in scope, it has the potential to encompass endless possibilities in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, cyberspace can serve as a parallel existence alongside the physical world, or it can strive to provide a fully immersive virtual environment. This leaves room for many opportunities for individuals to explore and share knowledge in the metaverse.</p>
 The Benefits of Metaverse 
<p>At its core, the metaverse has tremendous potential to revolutionize various aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its capacity to serve as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, it may completely revolutionize the way we work, study, and socialize. It could facilitate many activities, such as virtual reality gaming, education, business meetings, social networking, and even virtual tourism.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the metaverse is the possibility for users to create and design avatars. This aligns with SelfKey’s idea of <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">customizable avatars</a>, which may enable individuals to design avatars in any ways they please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These avatars may enable interaction with other individuals or virtual objects in the metaverse. Furthermore, they may facilitate the creation of digital spaces that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual stores, events, and even entire cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and adoption of the metaverse may offer many potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Improved Connectivity&nbsp; 
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
 Increased Accessibility 
 Virtual Education 
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
 Streamlined Efficiency 
 
<p>Below, we will further elaborate on these advantages.</p>
 Improved Connectivity 
<p>Cyberspace allows for real-time communication and collaboration between individuals from anywhere around the world. Because physical distance is no longer an issue, individuals are able to build connections and easily collaborate on projects.&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
<p>The metaverse may offer amazing opportunities for people to engage in virtual tourism. This means that individuals may delve into virtual recreations of amazing locations from the real, physical world. Additionally, they may be able to experience completely new, fascinating fictional realms which they’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p>

It could potentially reshape the way we interact, learn, and engage with the world around us, and beyond. In spite of all these wonderful benefits, though, there are downsides to the metaverse which are worth mentioning.</p>
 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>

 Web3 and SelfKey 
 Conclusions 
 
 An Introduction to Web3&nbsp; 
<p>Evolution is natural in many aspects of life. With modern technology, however, it’s especially beneficial when networking and artificial intelligence can considerably enhance the way society functions. Let us discover the concept of Web3, what it is, and how it can affect our daily lives.</p>
 What is Web3? 
<p>Web3, or Web 3.0, represents a new vision for the next phase of the World Wide Web. It aims to integrate principles like decentralization, blockchain advancements, and token-driven economies.</p>
<p>The range of emerging technologies and projects it encompasses include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 decentralized finance (DeFi) 
 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) 
 decentralized applications (dApps) 
 
<p>At its core, Web3 envisions a future where individuals have greater sovereignty over their digital lives. Where trust and transparency are built into the very fabric of the internet.</p>
 Web2 to Web3: How different are they? 
<p>Web2 is the current version of the internet, encompassing all the technologies and projects people are accustomed to nowadays. While Web2 has proven to be an inclusive and dynamic form of the web, it has its limitations due to its centralized nature. In this context, Web3 aims to enhance user freedom, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>There are many differences between Web2 and Web3. For now, let us explore two of the most prominent aspects which set them apart:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 
 Centralization vs. Decentralization 
<p>Web2 platforms and services are predominantly centralized, meaning they rely on centralized servers and intermediaries to operate. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control and manage user data and have the authority to set rules and policies. Because of this, users have limited control over their data and are dependent on these centralized entities.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, emphasizes decentralization. It operates on peer-to-peer networks and blockchain technology, where data is distributed across multiple nodes. Users have greater control over their data and can interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) without the need for intermediaries. Smart contracts and consensus mechanisms enable decentralized governance models where the community collectively makes decisions, instead of relying on a single authority.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>In Web2, user data is often collected, stored, and controlled by centralized platforms. Users typically agree to terms and conditions that grant these platforms the right to use and monetize their data. Privacy concerns arise due to the potential for data breaches, surveillance, and unauthorized access to personal information.</p>
<p>Web3, on the other hand, prioritizes user ownership and control over data. With decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blockchain technology provides transparency and auditability, which may reduce the risk of unauthorized manipulation or access. Users have the ability to grant and revoke access to their data on a case-by-case basis, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.</p>
<p>All in all, these differences highlight the shift from a centralized and controlled web to a more decentralized, user-centric, and economically empowering Web3 ecosystem.</p>
 Web3 Benefits and Opportunities 
<p>Due to its decentralized nature, and not only, Web3 can offer a multitude of benefits and opportunities. Let’s examine a few:</p>
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
 Economic Empowerment 
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
 
 Decentralization and Trust 
<p>Web3 aims to decentralize power and eliminate the need for intermediaries by leveraging blockchain technology. This can result in a more trustless and transparent online environment. Users may interact directly with each other and verify transactions without relying on centralized authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to be a decentralized and trustless digital environment, due to its emphasis on limited data sharing.</p>
 Data Ownership and Privacy 
<p>One thing that Web3 prioritizes is user ownership and control over personal data. This is also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereignty</a>, and it aims to reduce the risk of data breaches by enabling individuals to be the sole owners of their data.</p>
<p>Through decentralized storage systems and encryption mechanisms, users may securely store and manage their own data. They can selectively grant access to their data and have more control over how it is used and shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This shift towards user-centric data ownership may enhance privacy and empower individuals to protect their personal information.</p>
 Economic Empowerment 
<p>Another advantage of Web3 is that it introduces new economic models enabled by cryptocurrencies and tokens. This may allow individuals to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, where they can lend, borrow, and invest without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization and the concept of ownership over digital assets may open new opportunities for creators, artists, and content providers to monetize their work directly. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, Web3 could potentially create more equitable economic systems.</p>
 Interoperability and Seamless Experiences 
<p>Web3 aims to promote interoperability between different blockchain networks and protocols. This means that users may seamlessly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and move assets across different platforms without facing barriers or restrictions.&nbsp;It allows for a more connected and cohesive ecosystem where users may access a wide range of services and functionalities.</p>
<p>To aid this, SelfKey proposes <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> as a decentralized solution which may enhance digital privacy and security as individuals operate in these platforms.&nbsp;</p>
 Community Governance and Collaboration 
<p>Finally, Web3 enables decentralized governance models through mechanisms like smart contracts and decentralized <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">autonomous organizations (DAOs)</a>. This allows users to have a say in the decision-making processes of the platforms they engage with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can participate in voting, propose changes, and contribute to the development and evolution of the platforms they use. And this fosters a sense of community ownership and collaboration, empowering users to shape the direction of the platforms and protocols they rely on.</p>
<p>All in all, these benefits highlight Web3’s potential to transform the internet into a more user-centric, transparent, and inclusive ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that Web3 is still an emerging concept. Therefore, its actual realization and impact will depend on the development and adoption of relevant technologies and applications.</p>
 The Dark Side of Web3 
<p>While Web3 brings potential benefits, it also presents certain risks and challenges that need to be considered. It’s important to be aware of these challenges in order to take preventive measures and remain vigilant.</p>
<p>Here are five potential risks that may occur with Web3:</p>
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
 User Responsibility and Risks 
 
 Security and Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Web3 relies heavily on blockchain technology and decentralized systems, it introduces unique security and privacy considerations. Although blockchain is renowned for its robust security, vulnerabilities and exploits can still occur.</p>
<p>Additionally, decentralized storage and peer-to-peer networks may face privacy challenges. Therefore, they require careful attention to encryption, data protection, and identity management to ensure user privacy.</p>
 Bots and Maliciously-used AI 
<p>In Web3, identity and reputation systems can be compromised by bots through <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/sybil-attack/#:~:text=A%20Sybil%20attack%20uses%20a,of%20influence%20in%20the%20network.">sybil attacks</a>. Bots can create multiple fake identities to gain influence, voting power, or access to certain resources within decentralized networks. This can undermine the trust and fairness of the system.</p>
<p>Bad players can also program AI to distribute spam messages or engage in phishing attacks within decentralized communication platforms. These attacks aim to deceive users into sharing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links, compromising their security and privacy.</p>
 User Responsibility and Risks 
<p>Web3 shifts more responsibility onto users, as they have greater control over their digital assets and interactions. With increased control comes increased risk, as users are solely responsible for managing their private keys. This includes securing their wallets, and avoiding scams or fraudulent activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>User error or negligence can result in irreversible loss of funds or unauthorized access to personal data, necessitating heightened user awareness and education.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize these risks and address them proactively. One can do this through responsible development, regulatory frameworks, user education, and sustainable practices. The purpose is to maximize the promising benefits of Web3 while mitigating potential downsides.</p>
 Web3 and SelfKey 
<p>Web3 could considerably enhance the internet as we know it. Through decentralization and user-centricity, it could become a digital space in which users may engage with one another without limitations to their privacy and individuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This aligns with SelfKey's focus on privacy and individuality, as well as its aim to develop decentralized solutions that may increase privacy and security. The goal is for individuals to enjoy the benefits Web3 may offer, without having to constantly worry about the safety of their private data.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few of SelfKey’s proposed decentralized solutions which may enable individuals to operate in Web3 more securely.</p>
 Self Sovereign Identity (SSID) 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> is an innovative method of managing online identities, which aims to put the user in control of their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey aims to incorporate SSID into its decentralized solutions, which may ensure that users have complete autonomy over their personal data at all times. Enabling individuals to fully own and manage their private information may significantly diminish the risks associated with data breaches and identity theft.</p>
<p>The absence of third-party involvement allows users to have complete visibility and control over the storage and accessibility of their data. And this may enable them to make informed decisions regarding its usage and sharing.</p>

 What is Tokenization? 
 The Benefits of Tokenization 
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
 Conclusions 
 
 What is Tokenization? 
 A brief definition&nbsp; 
<p>Tokenization, in the context of data security, involves the substitution of sensitive data with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token. The purpose of tokenization is to render the original data meaningless and devoid of exploitable value. Instead, a token is generated, which serves as a reference point linking back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.</p>
<p>The tokenization process is designed with the aim to enhance data protection by reducing the risk associated with storing or transmitting sensitive information. By replacing sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal identification details, with tokens, the likelihood of unauthorized access or misuse of the original data may be significantly minimized.</p>
<p>The tokenization system manages the mapping between the tokens and their corresponding sensitive data, ensuring that the original information can be retrieved when needed by authorized entities. This system may provide a secure and efficient way to handle sensitive data, reducing the exposure to potential breaches or theft.</p>
<p>Overall, tokenization plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, preserving data privacy, and maintaining the integrity of systems that handle sensitive data elements.</p>
 Tokens Explained 
<p>Tokens may function as digital assets or representations of value that are built on top of existing blockchain networks. They can serve various purposes and operate within specific ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technically, tokens are programmable digital objects that are created and managed through smart contracts. These contracts dictate the rules and behaviors of the tokens, such as their supply, transferability, and functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuals can create tokens on different blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, using their respective token standards like ERC-20, BEP-20, or SPL. And, depending on their design, they can have different functionalities.</p>
<p>For instance, tokens can:</p>
 
 Be used as a medium of exchange and stores of value. 
 Represent ownership rights in a particular asset or project.&nbsp; 
 Have utility functions within decentralized applications (DApps), enabling access to specific features or services. 
 
<p>Overall, tokens operate within the framework of blockchain technology. They offer a flexible and programmable way to represent and exchange data or value within digital ecosystems.</p>
 Types of Tokens 
<p>In addition to the general definitions mentioned earlier, there are specific categories of cryptoassets that include the word "token" in their name. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 DeFi tokens refer to crypto tokens issued by decentralized finance protocols, which aim to replicate traditional financial functions. These tokens serve multiple purposes within their respective protocols and can be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency. For instance, individuals may use them for lending, saving, insurance, and trading.&nbsp; 
 Governance tokens are specialized tokens which grant holders the ability to participate in decision-making processes for a protocol or application. As decentralized platforms lack central authorities or boards of directors, governance tokens provide voting rights.&nbsp; 
 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent ownership rights to unique digital or real-world assets. They have been utilized to combat unauthorized copying and sharing of digital creations. Additionally, NFTs have gained popularity in the art world for issuing limited editions of digital artwork or selling exclusive virtual assets like rare items in video games. 
 Finally, security tokens are cryptoassets which are designed to function as the cryptocurrency equivalent of traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Security tokens enable the sale of shares in companies or other ventures, including real estate, without the involvement of brokers. Major companies and startups are exploring security tokens as an alternative fundraising method. 
 
<p>By familiarizing oneself with these different categories of tokens, one can gain a better understanding of the diverse applications and functionalities within the crypto space.</p>
 The difference between Crypto and Tokenization 
<p>The difference between cryptocurrency and tokenization lies in their underlying concepts and functionalities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies typically operate as independent entities with their own blockchain networks. They can function as a medium of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account.</p>
<p>On the other hand, tokenization is the process of converting data, real-world assets, rights, or functionalities into digital tokens that exist and operate on a blockchain. Tokens can represent various forms of value, such as ownership rights, access to services, or participation in a project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, cryptocurrency refers to digital currencies that operate independently on their respective blockchain networks, while tokenization involves the creation and representation of data, assets or functionalities as digital tokens within a specific platform or ecosystem.</p>
 The Benefits of Tokenization 
<p>Tokenization offers several benefits for data security and efficiency. Here are a few key advantages of tokenization, which we will discuss more thoroughly below:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
 
 Enhanced Data Security 
<p>Tokenization helps protect sensitive information by replacing it with randomly generated tokens that have no intrinsic value or meaning. Unlike encryption, tokenization removes the need to store sensitive data, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches. Even if a hacker gains access to the tokenized data, it is almost impossible to&nbsp; reverse-engineer the original information.</p>
 Improved Data Processing Efficiency 
<p>Tokenization accelerates data processing and retrieval by replacing long and complex data strings with shorter tokens. These tokens are easier and faster to search, index, and analyze. And this leads to improved performance and efficiency in data-intensive applications such as databases, data warehousing, and big data analytics.</p>
 Simplified Data Management and Migration 
<p>Lastly, tokenization facilitates data management and migration processes, particularly when transitioning between different systems or databases. When migrating data, tokens can be used to maintain data integrity and relationships while ensuring sensitive information remains secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, tokenization simplifies data integration, as systems can exchange tokens instead of transferring actual data. This may reduce the complexity and overhead of data sharing.</p>
<p>All in all, tokenization may offer notable security advantages. However, it is crucial to prioritize the management and protection of the tokenization system itself. This will ensure comprehensive security throughout the process.</p>
 Tokenization: Challenges and Risks 
<p>While tokenization offers numerous benefits, there are also potential risks associated with its implementation, for instance:</p>
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
 Token Reversal Attacks 
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
 Single Point of Failure 
 
 Dependency on Tokenization System 
<p>Organizations adopting tokenization may become reliant on the tokenization system and infrastructure. If the system experiences a breach, suffers from downtime, or becomes unavailable, it can disrupt operations and impact business continuity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial to implement robust security measures and backup systems to mitigate such risks.</p>
 Token Reversal Attacks 
<p>Although tokenized data is not directly reversible, attackers may attempt token reversal attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the tokenization system or its implementation. If successful, these attacks could potentially derive sensitive information from the tokens. And, in turn, it may&nbsp; undermine the security benefits of tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vigilance in system design and implementation, as well as regular security audits, can help mitigate this risk.</p>
 Token Mapping Vulnerabilities 
<p>Tokenization relies on a mapping or lookup table that connects tokens to their original data. If malicious individuals compromise this mapping table, they may gain access to the original sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robust security measures are therefore essential to protect against this risk, such as:</p>
 
 strong access controls. 
 encryption of the mapping table 
 secure key management. 
 
 Single Point of Failure 
<p>Centralizing tokenization processes introduces a single point of failure. If the tokenization system or central repository is compromised, it can have widespread implications across the organization, potentially exposing sensitive data or disrupting operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing redundancy, disaster recovery mechanisms, and distributed tokenization systems can help mitigate this risk.</p>
<p>All in all, it's important to note that while these risks exist, there are methods which may mitigate them and maximize the benefits of tokenization. These methods include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 implementing proper security measures. 
 conducting regular assessments. 
 adhering to best practices. 
 
 A Glimpse into SelfKey’s Protocol 
<p>When developing decentralized solutions, SelfKey places great emphasis on digital identity privacy and security. The vision is to create a decentralized network which may be more secure, in which members may be able to exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may be such a platform by treating its members with transparency, equality, and fairness. Within the SelfKey Protocol, there are currently two tokens which serve as pivotal elements: KEY and SELF.</p>
 KEY: A Brief Introduction 
<p>Utility tokens derive their value from their utility or functionality within the ecosystem they are associated with. One may use them within the platform to exchange for goods or services, participate in voting or governance processes, access premium features, or facilitate interactions.</p>
<p>The KEY token may find utility in various ways, including:</p>
 
 Serving as a method of exchange for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Enabling users to stake their credentials more securely. 
 Empowering members to govern the SelfKey DAO. 
 Equipping users with essential tools which may allow them to take charge of their digital identity and increase privacy protection. 
 
 The Purpose of SELF 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to stake on credentials, SelfKey introduces the SELF tokens to facilitate tracking of an individual's staked credentials and their duration.</p>
<p>Having access to the SelfKey DAO may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. Individuals may use these tokens for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some notable attributes of SELF tokens:</p>
 
 Individuals who successfully stake a real identity may mint SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens may serve as a metric for reputation measurement. 
 As a reputation signal, they may strengthen legitimate credentials and help identify illegitimate ones. 
 Users themselves may mint SELF tokens, and they hold no inherent value. 
 SELF tokens may also serve as a governance mechanism, granting influence to those who use the platform, accumulate reputation, or engage in "identity mining" to enhance platform security. 
 As users stake valid credentials, they accumulate reputation in the form of SELF tokens. 
 
<p>By introducing SELF tokens, SelfKey may enhance the ecosystem by providing individuals with a way to monitor their staked credentials and reputation. At the same time, it may promote the integrity and security of the platform.</p>
 Staking for Digital Safety 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of Staking, therefore, is to enhance digital security and privacy. This may prevent data breaches, identity theft, and unlawful attempts by malicious bots to infiltrate your private online accounts and systems.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rapid progress of modern technology constantly astonishes us, bringing forth opportunities for knowledge, efficiency, communication, and speed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization, a relatively new concept, has the potential to simplify private data management and enhance online security through encryption methods, offering benefits in terms of privacy, security, speed, and efficiency.</p>
<p>Understanding this evolving concept becomes crucial in order to stay informed about its advancements and leverage its advantages without compromising our digital identities and online security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For these purposes, SelfKey aims to educate people about digital safety and introduce them to innovative concepts and technologies that can enhance online privacy and security. Knowledge is vital in order to prevent online attacks aimed at our digital identities, therefore staying up to date with relevant news on this topic and spreading awareness is important.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>There has been much excitement and buzz around generative AI in recent months. New tools pop up every hour that will undoubtedly make us humans far more efficient. At the same time, hackers have the same tools available to them and they are some of the most innovative people on the planet. They spend whole days thinking about how to use the latest and most advanced tools at their disposal to bypass security controls of nation states, corporations and individuals.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this post we look at how hackers are using generative AI technologies to modify their attack vectors and amplify their success rates. We also discuss the importance of identity security controls in preventing these attacks, and the increasing urgency around adopting them. We primarily focus on how deterministic methods of verifying humans are critical in this new age when artificial intelligence can mimic a human interaction with extreme accuracy.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Generative AI Makes Hackers Better  
<p>Generative AI is brilliant at making repeatable tasks extremely fast and effortless. Let’s put ourselves into the shoes of a hacker and consider the “Before AI” and “After AI” scenarios of the typical attack vectors that one would consider.</p> 
 1. Phishing  
 The practice of sending people fraudulent messages in order to trick them into providing credentials or sensitive information.&nbsp;  
<p>Before generative AI, hackers created generic emails with very minimal context and used mass mailing systems to deliver email, SMS or app-based messages to individuals. These emails often contain a malicious link that would prompt the victim to provide their password as well as a 2nd factor such as an OTP code or approving a push notification. The attacker would then get access to their account and wreak havoc.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This method is a “spray and pray” approach that yields limited results but is still highly profitable. Many hackers have moved to “spear phishing” attacks where the message is more tailored to the individual. This yields a much higher likelihood of success but is far more tedious and time consuming to execute. For example, spear phishing attacks may reference a friend or family member or recent event that a victim may have posted about on social media to increase the likelihood of them clicking the malicious link that the message contains.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With generative AI, hackers can make every single phishing message a highly tailored spear phishing message. The AI can search millions of potential victims' social media profiles, their company’s recent news and updates, and then craft a message that is uniquely tailored to that individual that they are very likely to engage with. The AI can even mask themselves to first have a “real” conversation with a victim that builds trust and then execute the malicious payload after a baseline of trust is established.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This approach is already making <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing attacks</a> far more sophisticated and successful. We have seen ample evidence that successful phishing attacks can have a major negative business impact and the AI-strengthened attacks are a major concern for company CEOs and boards of directors everywhere.</p> 
 2. Social Engineering  
 The practice of manipulating humans in order to gain access to systems or resources for gain.&nbsp;  
<p>Hackers who excel at social engineering tend to make the big bucks. Social engineering can be done via many mediums such as email, in-person, over the phone or via video. During the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses had to fundamentally change their working practices and remote work became the norm. As a result, the number of social engineering attacks skyrocketed because a much higher percentage of our interactions (particularly ones that needed elevated assurance) became fully digital.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hackers took advantage of overloaded IT service desk employees and convinced them (over the phone) to reset passwords or get access to accounts. They would search the Internet to find out basic information about an employee and use that to social engineer their way into countless organizations. We also saw many examples of consumers defrauded by scammers through fraud schemes that cost the public millions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With generative AI, a hacker can use an existing model to execute attacks using deep fakes through chat, video or phone calls. These deep fakes will have full context and knowledge about their victim and be able to convince them to provide credentials, send money or divulge sensitive information that can be used for profit or political gain. For example, an AI can fully recreate a company CFO’s voice and use it to call into an IT service desk to reset their credentials. Once they have access to the account, they can send fictitious emails to affect the stock price of the business. Scary!</p> 
 3. Password Cracking  
 The practice of guessing or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/brute-force-attacks-what-to-know">brute forcing</a> a person's password.  
<p>Password cracking is a go-to for hackers. Most people have terribly insecure passwords and almost everyone has had some form of their password leaked in one of the high-profile breaches, such as LinkedIn, that everyone has read about. Hackers who are good at cracking passwords understand that most people use simple variations of the same password and can generally crack it with a little research. Unfortunately, this is a tedious process. At the same time, hackers are often limited in their password cracking due to cultural differences. If a hacker in Russia wants to hack into the account of a victim in Saudi Arabia, they would have to do significant research on this person’s hobbies, history, etc. to reliably be able to guess their passwords. As a result, hackers focus their time on higher value targets because time is money!</p> 
<p>With generative AI, hackers can use a simple prompt to have the artificial intelligence learn everything about a person on the Internet and then use the contextual information about their culture, language and background to quickly crack passwords. Furthermore, AI can be trained to mimic a human and input these credentials into websites that will soon be able to bypass the most sophisticated bot detection mechanisms.</p> 
 4. Malware (and Ransomware) Generation&nbsp;  
<p>Hackers play a never ending game of whack-a-mole against the endpoint detection and response companies such as CrowdsStrike. A hacker creates a new piece of malware, they deploy it using a 0-day, unpatched system vulnerability, or similar attack vector and do the damage they can (such as encrypting the system or stealing credentials). The security community detects this malware, tags it, and blocks this malware’s signature moving forward (they whack the mole).</p> 
<p>Hackers spend significant time modifying their malware code to avoid signature detection. This is tedious and time consuming and the perfect place for AI to be helpful. Using&nbsp; generative AI, hackers can create infinite versions of the same piece of malware and avoid detection. The malware now becomes completely malleable and the game of whack-a-mole starts to become impossible to deal with. A hacker can now make every single payload installed look completely unique. By the time that this malware is caught in the wild, triaged and tagged, the hacker has made a million more variations of it as they sleep using artificial intelligence. To make things worse, when a new 0-day is discovered by a hacker, they will be able to use AI to generate exploit chains in record time. Instead of spending days or weeks building a piece of malware, the AI will be able to use previous knowledge of other exploit kits and modify them in real time to create entirely new and unique viruses or ransomware within seconds of an initial vulnerability being discovered.</p> 
<p>With this new tool, hackers will be able to deploy malware and persist on systems much longer. They will use that time to intercept credentials by using keyloggers, extracting cached credentials, and then use these stolen credentials to spread to other systems in the organization to cause major problems for businesses.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is (and Is not) Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
<p>Phishing-resistant authentication is whenever a human is removed from the equation. A false perception is that passwordless authentication is always phishing resistant. Just like anything else, the details of implementation are critical to understand.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Let’s look at what isn’t phishing resistant:</p> 
  
  Passwords — Humans can be tricked into providing their passwords via phishing attacks or social engineering.&nbsp;  
  SMS <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTP codes</a> — Humans can be tricked into providing these codes using social engineering or man-in-the-middle (MitM) proxies.&nbsp;  
  App-based OTP codes — Same as SMS OTP codes but not vulnerable to phone number or SIM card hijacking.&nbsp;  
  Push notifications — Humans can be annoyed or socially engineered to accept push notifications. These are known as push attacks or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">prompt bombing</a>.&nbsp;  
  Number matching — This is typically added as a layer after a push notification is accepted. Malicious MitM proxies can be modified to bypass this control or a social engineering attack can convince a human to provide the number matching digit.&nbsp;  
  
<p>The above methods are now considered “<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">legacy MFA</a>.” They were originally developed to create an additional barrier for hackers and to prevent password spraying attacks that were causing major issues for a number of companies. These legacy methods cannot be relied upon given that fully automated bypass methods are widely available and utilized by hackers.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing-resistant methods</a> largely take the human out of the equation when they are accessing systems. The legacy methods discussed above always involve a human reacting to an authentication event by typing something in or accepting a notification. This approach is fundamentally flawed because humans are busy and ultimately just want to move on with their day. Phishing-resistant authentication always puts intent behind any authentication request.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To use an example, imagine every time any person walked past your car in the parking lot while you’re inside grocery shopping, you received a push notification to unlock your vehicle. How many people do you think would accidentally unlock their car? This is basically how legacy 2FA methods work. Phishing-resistant methods require a human to have possession of a device (such as your car key FOB or phone) and the system is only accessed when they intentionally push the unlock button.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Phishing-Resistant Methods of Authentication Prevent AI-Strengthened Attacks  
<p>Based on the strengthened attack vectors above, let’s look at how phishing-resistant authentication controls can help us against these sophisticated attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Phishing — By eliminating the need for humans to react to authentication events, credential-based phishing attacks are eliminated. When a person clicks on a link that takes them to a malicious website, hackers will have no credential to steal because there is no password and there is no OTP code or push notification that can be intercepted.&nbsp;  
  Social Engineering — The vast majority of social engineering attacks will be eliminated due to the fact that authentication now requires physical presence at the point of access. Hackers who are executing social engineering attacks remotely will be stuck and forced to focus on in-person attacks, which are incredibly risky and cost prohibitive.&nbsp;  
  Password Cracking — If there’s no password, there’s nothing to crack!&nbsp;  
  Malware Generation and Deployment — The vast majority of malware uses a phished credential to land inside a business environment. The prevention of phishing and social engineering attacks will relegate malware attacks to relying on 0-day vulnerabilities in order to compromise a system. Even when they are successful in doing so, the inability to compromise credentials via keyloggers and cache busting will make it extremely difficult for the malware to spread beyond a single endpoint in the network.&nbsp;  
  
 How to Transition to Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
<p>The exciting news is that moving from legacy methods of authentication to a phishing-resistant method is entirely possible for any size business today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here are some guidelines on how to move forward with a phishing-resistant method of authentication.</p> 
  
  Embrace the change management. Understand that you will need to roll out a new capability to all of your users as well as train your team to support the new technology.&nbsp;  
  Provide users with choice. Most people are happy to use their personal mobile device for authentication purposes but some are not. Be ready to provide those users with a dedicated roaming authenticator such as a phishing-resistant hardware token (e.g. Yubikey with passkey/FIDO support).  
  Focus on coverage. Partner with technology providers that focus on broad coverage of use cases. This is one of those instances where you may very well have to work with a “best-in-breed” solution provider instead of the giant platforms who only focus on improving the security for their specific products. For example, Microsoft cares a lot about providing phishing-resistant access into Microsoft products, but your technical ecosystem is much more than just Microsoft (even though it’s probably a pretty big chunk).&nbsp;  
  Get top down support. Your CIO/CEO and other members of leadership should be supportive of this change. Even though a phishing-resistant method of authentication is faster and more secure, some people still resist change. Employees of a company follow and emulate the leadership so their vocal support will make your transition easier.&nbsp;  
  Put your marketing hat on. Driving user adoption of a new authentication system is much easier if you gamify it. Make it fun with prizes, positive reinforcement and acknowledgement of forward progress. Once you get to a tipping point of adoption, it takes on a mind of its own and it’s beautiful to watch.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Don’t let perfect be the enemy of great. You will have a few use cases where people may still use a password and that’s OK! These are typically very legacy apps that don’t support any federation or authentication standard such as Mainframe, or thick client apps that were written 20 years ago. In all likelihood, the number of users on these apps are minimal and you can use other controls (such as a PAM system) to better secure the access to these.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Verizon released its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/?cmp=knc:ggl:ac:ent:ea:na:8888855284">Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a>. In this 16th year of the report, Verizon highlighted their analysis of more than 953,894 incidents, of which 254,968 are a breach. The report shows three primary ways in which attackers access an organization:</p>
 
 Stolen credentials 
 Phishing 
 Exploitation of vulnerabilities. 
 
<p>A continuation of the findings in last year’s report, the 2023 report states that hackers continue to exploit the human element (including errors, misuse, and social engineering). Combining this element and the entry points above, hackers gain access to organizations to launch their attacks. In fact, 74% of all breaches include the human element, with people being involved either via error, privilege misuse, use of stolen credentials or social engineering. A slight decrease over last year! But we have a long way to go.</p>
<p>The use of stolen credentials remains the top way for criminals to gain access to organizations. This supports the basic premise that hackers just log in above all else. Stolen credentials continue to be the top access method for bad actors as they account for 44.7% of breaches. Additionally, stolen credentials play a bigger role in web application attacks accounting for 86% of breaches here. To put that in perspective, web applications make up 25% of all breaches,</p>
<p>The takeaway here is the fact that humans and their credentials are still the weak link in the security chain. Why? Because a credential is something that can be shared or stolen. It feels like a difficult problem to solve, but in reality, the market is shifting to meet the obvious demand here. If we can eliminate credentials – user name and password – then the problem can be solved. Passwordless is the answer, right? Well, not so fast.</p>
<p>While these reports can be all doom and gloom, fear not, it’s not all bad, because there are ways to fix the problem.</p>
<p>As I discussed in <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/data-breach-investigations-report/">last year’s blog</a> about the 2022 DBIR report, Verizon recommends the usual approach to solve some of these problems like deploying two-factor authentication and/or implementing password managers for users, all in an effort to avoid the impact credentials introduce. This approach can reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to exploit poor passwords to gain access to applications, systems, and data. These capabilities have been available and in production for years BUT we are still seeing similar numbers year over year from reports like this year’s DBIR.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe we need to focus on credentials. Why? As I stated earlier, bad actors log in. If we can remove their capacity to login we stop a staggering number of breaches. So if we can improve upon authenticating users without the use of credentials then organizations will be better for it.</p>
<p>Let’s examine how a 1Kosmos customer can log in. Our customers systematically replace credentials with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">real biometrics</a> that are matched to a verified digital identity and it works across all operating systems including Microsoft, Mac, Unix, and Linux. The authentication is IAL2 and AAL2 certified and ensures the user is who they claim to be. Because we do an ID+Selfie at enrollment and compare the selfie at each and every access request we ensure that the user requesting access is that user.</p>
<p>So, how do we, 1Kosmos, replace credentials? With <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bringing-verified-identity-and-passwordless-to-the-masses/">verified identity</a>. By combining identity verification with access management organizations can eliminate credentials, especially passwords and therefore, prevent most of the 74% of intrusions caused by humans. You may be thinking, this sounds like what my current vendor is claiming by taking you passwordless. There is an important differentiation to what I am suggesting here. Passwordless authentication is a little better than current MFA methods. Multiple biometrics can be stored on a device, more than one face and touch ID, implementing them as a main authentication method means it’s still unknown if the user is who they claim to be. The access request has proven possession, that is all.</p>
<p>The move to an ID+Selfie journey, and using that selfie as a reference during authentication, combines <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/identity-based-authentication/">identity verification and authentication</a>, now siloed activities in most organizations. This approach weaves authentication into the identity fabric.</p>
<p>Hopefully, more organizations will take this approach and next year we’ll have another decline!</p>

  <p>Set aside your preconceptions about the people who are at this moment driving the U.S. information technology (IT) industry's <a href="https://www.trade.gov/selectusa-software-and-information-technology-industry">$1.9 trillion market value</a>. They are neither John Hodgman nor Elizabeth Holmes. They are engineers and artists, marketers and analysts. They are imaginative and they are strategic. They include people who are good with numbers and people who are good with people.</p>

<p>As a career choice, the tech sector has come a long way since it first became a commercial entity in the 1960s. It had to. As technology evolved from its beginnings in government labs to scientific and industrial applications and on to personal computers, the people building and using the technology evolved, too. Now that it is integral to every aspect of our everyday lives — our work, health, education, transportation, commerce, entertainment — technology must reflect the people who use it. In other words, all of us.</p>

<p>But our LGBTQ+ community is underrepresented in tech and that's unfortunate for everyone.</p>

<p>Technology is all about solving complex problems, but if technology is developed predominantly by people from the same background and culture, it may fail to address the needs, values, or perspectives of other people. This is known as technology bias. One example of technology bias can be found in facial recognition algorithms, which are trained to learn patterns and features for identification. If the dataset primarily includes cisgender faces or lacks diversity in gender identity, the algorithm may not effectively recognize transgender individuals.</p>

<p>On the other hand, diverse teams can approach challenges from multiple angles and identify novel solutions to complex problems — and eliminate the risk of technology bias. Technology leaders recognize that diverse perspectives are more likely to generate a wide range of innovative ideas, leading to better decision-making, problem-solving, and success in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world.</p>

 Why Consider a Career in Technology? 

<p>Technology careers are growing far faster than occupations in general. According to the Bureau for Labor Statistics, the field of computer and information technology is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm">projected to grow by 15% from 2021 to 2031</a>, adding nearly 700,000 jobs over the decade. The median annual salary for employees in computer and information technology was $97,430 as of May 2021, which is significantly higher than the annual median for occupations at large ($45,760).</p>

<p>Best of all, technology permeates every industry, so you can put your skills to work in just about any area that interests you. Whether you join a company on the cutting edge of cybersecurity or a developer of business software, gaming apps, or cloud infrastructure, technology careers offer a number of benefits.</p>

  Opportunities for growth and advancement: The technology industry is constantly evolving, creating opportunities to develop new skills and explore new areas of interest. In technology, you can advance your career as you take on new challenges and gain experience and expertise.

	 Flexible work arrangements: Many technology companies offer their employees a variety of options, including flexible schedules and remote work. This is especially beneficial for people with families and other personal priorities.

  How To Get a Job in Technology 

<p>There are several steps you can take to increase your chances of landing the right position in the right company. Here are some tips:</p>

Examples can include software engineering, data science, cybersecurity, and user experience design. In addition, there are scores of roles in the tech sector that are not, in themselves, technical, but offer the benefits of being part of an innovative, fast-paced industry. 
	 Develop your skills: Once you've identified your area of interest, start building your skills. Take online courses, attend workshops and trade shows, read books, and participate in group activities, such as hackathons or coding challenges.

  The Single-Player Ready (SPR) app architecture allows users to maintain control over their data while also participating in a larger network of related content. It has applications including even sensitive information that should first and foremost be under the user's control.

<p>When you reflect on your most used apps, platforms, and services, you’ll notice how often you're the creator.</p><p>You create your profile on LinkedIn, recommend restaurants on Yelp, post thoughts on Reddit, share your life on Twitter or Instagram, and design your latest app in Figma, to name a few. You typically upload your data to the platform, which provides distribution across its vast network along with free hosting and slick user interfaces. In return, it expects to make money from your content and attention.</p><p>At SpruceID, we think that the content you make should, in fact, belong to you. A platform with its own (sometimes competing) interests shouldn't be able to lock your content to its databases or disable your entire account on a whim. Some platforms provide data exports, but almost always as archive files lacking in data portability. This form of lock-in reduces your autonomy and stifles innovation. You should be able to do what you want with your data.</p><p>We could start with portable data formats that declare you as the owner when you create original content. This content can be stored in your own private instances of these apps that you control, and you can give out additional access how you see fit. For example, you could maintain private lists of book reviews, and choose which lists you'd like to share to a friend, without an intermediary that could remove your (or your friend's) access to those lists. They are useful in their own right, without a platform. As a result, instead of you signing in to the platforms with fiefdoms over your data, the platforms could sign in to your data vault that you control entirely.</p><p>We also recognize that digital platforms are incredibly powerful distribution networks serving content creators for cheap or free, and this is especially important for small creators and new brands. However, it is you who owns the content and it should be your explicit choice on which platform to post, and on what terms.</p><p>The Single-Player Ready (SPR) app architecture allows users to maintain control over their data while also participating in a larger network of related content. It has applications beyond just book or restaurant reviews – medical histories, financial records, or any other sensitive information that should first and foremost be under the user's control.</p><p>This next generation of consumer apps is enabled by the proliferation of user-generated content, widespread user adoption of smart devices with digital signing capabilities, and the increasing affordability of cloud computing for individuals. These technology shifts have made it feasible for users to directly manage (or delegate management of) their data instead of relying on de facto management by a few large platforms, separating the custodianship of the data versus use across networks. Digital signing further allows users to originate content with authenticity that can be verified, and create data licenses or digital permission slips that automate compliance with data privacy rules.</p><p>The architecture of users bringing their own data has been pioneered by protocols such as <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Sign-In with Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ActivityPub</a>, <a href="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>, and <a href="https://solidproject.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Solid</a>. To date, these have faced adoption hurdles due to user experience difficulties caused by the usage of digital keys, the need to perform server setup, and complex interfaces for user-granted permissions. With Single-Player Ready apps, these hurdles can be overcome because applications can now offer unparalleled user experiences while maintaining user control and privacy.</p> The Building Blocks of Single-Player Apps:   Key Management: Users can create digital signatures and use encryption over their data. This allows users to originate authentic content, authenticate themselves, grant access to their data vaults, or delegate power to other keys controlled by them or someone else. Users should have many keys, and not concentrate all their control into one that can be lost or stolen. Instead, this should match expectations in the physical world using advances in public key infrastructure (PKI).  Content Authenticity: Users can create digital signatures over metadata that corresponds to original content, such as tweets, posts, follows, messages, videos, images, reviews, and more. This allows users to establish provenance for their content, especially when attested with other signatures from witnesses such as other users, platforms, or blockchains. This creates content authenticity certificates that can be verified.  Data Licenses: Users can issue and revoke data licenses that describe the policies for how their data must be accessed and handled, providing more control over how their information is shared and used, and by whom.  Personal Data Vaults: Users can securely store and manage their digital information, including content. Access to the content within these vaults is granted via digitally signed permission slips (known as capabilities), which can be revoked later.   <p>These core building blocks introduce authenticity and integrity into digital interactions with Single-Player Ready apps. Today, the root of data provenance is typically in a cluster of platform-hosted SQL databases, but there's no reason why data provenance can't be rooted in digitally signed content that users independently hold. The transition away from centralized data silos will allow users to have fuller control over their digital interactions.</p> The Building Blocks: Keys are Digital Empowerment  <p><br>One of the critical components in this new paradigm is the concept that "keys equal digital empowerment." Traditionally, users have relied on either frequently-lost passwords or "Big Login" providers, such as Facebook, Google, or other similar services, to manage their online identities and data. However, with the advent of key-based authentication standards like <a href="https://login.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Sign-in with Ethereum</a> or <a href="https://passkeys.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">passkeys</a>, users can sign messages digitally to directly authenticate themselves and may be able to further authorize access to their data.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">  Why Sign-In with Ethereum is a Game-Changer - Part 1  Sign-In with Ethereum is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. Instead of submitting to “Big Login,” users can now login using the same keys controlling their blockchain accounts--without an intermediary.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>However, today's UX for signing different types of transactions or performing encryption does not always reflect the smooth, frictionless interactions we are used to in most consumer applications. If every time a user wanted to “like” a tweet or “follow” someone on Single-Player Ready Twitter, they were faced with a cumbersome digital signing dialog and more confirmations to persist their content, they probably wouldn't be users for long.</p><p>This can be solved by allowing users to use different keys for different purposes. For example, some keys might be generated on the spot (session keys) to perform certain pre-authorized actions without a slew of confirmation dialogs. Other keys might be long-lived, able to grant permissions to the session key after a confirmation dialog. We can innovate on signing standards and better key management to reduce friction for users while also maintaining integrity.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a><p>Keys with existing privileges can manage access to resources by delegating some (or all) of those privileges to another key. For example, you may want to give your new physician's office access to your medical history since 2015. In this scenario, you, the owner of your medical data, create a data license that entitles the physician's office to retain your general medical history since 2015 for 5 years, or until you revoke the license.</p><p>To retrieve the actual data and associated data license, you grant a permission slip to the physician's office so they can access your data vault over the next hour for those specific files, and nothing more. On future visits, you may decide to adjust the data license so the physician's office can further share your data with certain medical specialists, but no further. This kind of system operates on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Definition(s)%3A,needs%20to%20perform%20its%20function.">principle of least privilege</a>, where an entity is granted the minimum resources and authorizations to perform a specific function and nothing else. </p><p>You can use these permission slips (often known as "capabilities") to grant others access to your digital resources, and you can also revoke that access at a later time. Enter user-controlled data vaults (or "personal clouds"), which respect the rules set in these permission slips. At SpruceID, we believe that a user should also be able to define where their data live by authorizing who can host the infrastructure for their data. As standards for these permission slips (e.g., <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JWTs</a>, <a href="https://ucan.xyz/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">UCANs</a>, and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-spec/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ZCAPs</a>) gain adoption, they will be accepted in more and more places.</p> From Single Player to Multiplayer <p>While "Single-Player Ready" applications can be useful (and fun) without anyone else, they are much more powerful when upgraded to "multiplayer" applications, where interaction with others and network effects become very important. </p><p>We can think about how a Single-Player Ready Yelp evolves to be multiplayer. You would begin with your own personal version of Yelp. You can write the most scathing reviews about your experience at your most recent dinner if you want. Your reviews are stored in your personal data vault–your personal space to store all your honest thoughts, where you control access to the information rather than a centralized application. </p><p>From there, you can grant permission slips via digital signing to share select reviews with other "Personal Yelp" instances based on their digital accounts, such as Ethereum addresses, decentralized identifiers, or even email addresses. You can also grant data licenses that allow further sharing to your friends’ friends, which can be used to crowdsource reviews from a trusted circle. If one of those friends or friends’ friends leaves a review you vehemently disagree with or find offensive, you can eject them from your own review system. Because their content is rooted in their digital keys, you can filter out all of their reviews with a single setting - across all other places where they use those keys. You could message them using end-to-end encrypted messaging to deliver the sad news they have been removed from your reviews circle of trust, assuming they haven't blocked you first.</p><p>Single-Player Ready apps have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with online applications and services. They empower users with data portability, freedom from digital lock-in, and minimized control from intermediaries. They also enable impressive user experiences that can delight while maintaining security. The future of digital identity and data ownership is in our hands, and it’s time to take control.</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Entrust keeps the world moving safely by enabling secure identities, payments, and data. In the heart of Pride month, I can’t help but home in on that first piece – enabling strong identities.</p>
<p>Protecting and enabling identities makes every life possible. When you cross a border, make a purchase with your credit card, or access trusted accounts in your personal or work life, you’re likely using or being protected by Entrust solutions that enable trusted, authentic identities.</p>
<p>If you were to tell my younger self that I’d be out and proud working for a technology company that builds the world’s most critical identity solutions and emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion within my workplace: I would’ve told you to keep dreaming.</p>
<p>You see, it’s hard to describe the profound impact such a simple word like “identity” has on the LGBTQ+ community. Many of us spend years feeling forced to translate our authentic identities into something “acceptable” for the workplace. There is comfort in knowing my workplace values my authentic identity.</p>
<p>This month, and every month, our LGBTQ+ Alliance at Entrust proudly emphasizes the importance of providing a space for our community members and allies to openly express their identity in the workplace, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Since forming the Entrust LGBTQ+ Alliance in June of 2020, we’ve been raising awareness and visibility for our LGBTQ+ colleagues aligned with our commitment to be inclusive of all forms of diversity by:</p>
 
 Offering a monthly meeting for our Alliance members to share stories, discuss important topics within our community, and come together to celebrate our identities. 
 Hosting internal events with authors and subject matter experts on books and topics that exemplify what it means to lead with inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community. 
 Fundraising efforts for nonprofit organizations like <a href="https://outintech.com/">Out in Tech</a> and <a href="https://outrightinternational.org/">Outright International</a> to show our support and raise our voices globally. 
 Partnering with our talent acquisition team to attend events that focus on recruiting LGBTQ+ people to join our organization. 
 Creating trainings like “Becoming a Better Ally” and “Demystifying Gender Identity” more than 68% of our global colleagues taking such courses to date. 
 Working with our global benefits team to ensure colleague offerings include LGBTQ+ inclusive terminology. 
 
<p>Protecting identities will always be a core principle of what we do at Entrust, and I’m proud to be part of an organization that exemplifies how your authentic identity can be safe and secure through impactful engagement efforts. Happy Pride Month!</p>

<p>As one of the longest established blockchain companies in the UK, <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> feels very positive about <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1668174629695832064">Rishi Sunak’s announcement</a> of the imminent opening of <a href="https://a16z.com/">A16Z</a>’s first international office here in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>In the six years of our existence, Mattereum has seen crypto booms and crypto winters (<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">2022</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">2018</a>) and we entirely agree with Prime Minister Sunak’s belief that the UK’s future success as a Web3 superpower is founded on creating an environment where the right regulations and guardrails are in place to protect consumers and foster innovation.</p><blockquote>As we cement the UK’s place as a science and tech superpower, we must embrace new innovations like Web3, powered by blockchain technology, which will enable start-ups to flourish here and grow the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>“That success is founded on having the right regulation and guardrails in place to protect consumers and foster innovation. While there’s still work to do, I’m determined to unlock opportunities for this technology and turn the UK into the world’s Web3&nbsp;centre.</blockquote><p>UK Prime Minister, Rt Honorable Rishi&nbsp;Sunak</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/expanding-uk-andreessen-horowitz/">Expanding to the UK - a16z crypto</a></p><p>Mattereum has long realised that the “wild west” atmosphere that formerly characterised the Web3 space does not create a sustainable long-term business environment, and that the future of the blockchain lies in it becoming a sober, regulated, practical space that provides real opportunities for business growth. For this to happen, investment is needed, and A16Z’s vote of confidence in the UK’s approach to Web3 shows that important investors agree and want to support innovators in what is fast becoming the world’s most effective location to do Web3 business.</p><p>As part of our commitment to creating the environment where this is possible, Mattereum has worked closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT) to develop the <a href="https://lawtechuk.io/insights/ukjt-digital-disputes-rules">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) that allow rapid resolution of blockchain and crypto legal disputes within the UK jurisdiction.</p><blockquote>The theory is to dispel the myth that blockchain is a fringe technology used only by those wanting to risk their livelihoods or possibly make their fortunes on volatile cryptoassets like&nbsp;Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>The blockchain is now at a stage in its development equivalent to where the internet was in or around 1995. The internet was unstoppable in 1995 and blockchain technology is unstoppable now. It will become ubiquitous in all major industrial and financial sectors, simply because it allows for the immutable recording of data, thereby reducing friction in commercial and consumer transactions and obliterating the scope for dispute as to what has occurred.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">The Right Hon. Sir Geoffrey Vos (Head of Civil Justice for the UK) at the Lawtech UK Launch Of Smarter Contracts Report</a></p><p>Mattereum has also gone on to be the first company to fully incorporate the DDRR into our business model. Indeed, Mattereum’s whole business model is based on the provision of appropriate guardrails; our Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) are a unique innovation that provides a legally binding connection between a physical object and the blockchain, enforceable in 172 jurisdictions worldwide.</p><p>This facilitates safe high-value e-commerce on the blockchain and allows AIs to interface with physical objects by providing means to determine that they are not digital fakes. It is clear that putting physical assets on chain is the next growth area for the blockchain and MAPs are already established and working as a technology to keep assets safe and to protect both businesses and consumers from fraud and manipulation. This helps lay the foundations for a future where the blockchain is a trusted technology operating within established regulations and guardrails.</p><p>The decision by A16Z to locate their first international office here is clear evidence that the UK’s approach to innovation and legislation is working. We welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment to making the UK a responsible Web3-friendly business environment and look forward to seeing a further flowering of innovation enabled by investment from Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>If you are working on a project that you think could enhance or be enhanced by the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> system get in touch with us via contact@mattereum.com</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-welcomes-the-arrival-of-a16z-in-the-uk-f82fe8432f5e">Mattereum Welcomes the Arrival of A16Z in the UK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We built an EVM-based game that tests the limits of blockchain development and user experience.</p> Why Build a Blockchain Game? <p>You may wonder why Fission, a protocol engineering company building a decentralized edge app stack, would set out to make a blockchain game. Fission's developer-friendly SDK works for web apps built on the distributed or decentralized web. We want to bring our tools to blockchain dapps, but first, we need to better understand the current limitations for both users and developers.</p><p>Games require a sustained state of flow, so they tend to be very good at highlighting the constraints of a medium — and directing innovation. We feel so strongly about this we believe Block, Paper, Scissors will only be the first of many game-shaped experiments in what we're calling the SLW RK'D. </p><p>The insights we've garnered from building Block, Paper, Scissors have already helped focus our work on some exciting WNFS updates, as well as Filecoin-based endeavours to be announced soon.</p> So, what is Block, Paper, Scissors? <p>Block, Paper, Scissors is an updated take on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. In our version, Block replaces Rock. So Block &gt; Scissors, Scissors &gt; Paper, and Paper &gt; Block. </p><p>But, there are two critical differences.<br><br>You don't play as an individual. You play as a team. The network you choose to play on is the team you've chosen to join. Right now there are three: Filecoin (calibration testnet), Polygon (Mumbai testnet), and Ethereum (goerli testnet).</p><p>The play is asynchronous rather than synchronous. You're always playing against your own team's previous move. To make a move, each player casts their vote on the network. The move with the most votes is the one that is played. Sounds easy, right? Well, the strategy comes in when a player or group decides to break a streak and sabotage the other players' selections — perhaps you hop onto the Filecoin network to sabotage their vote and end their streak so that Team Polygon can take the lead. These networks are permissionless, after all.</p><p>Take a look at this quick demo video.</p> Bringing the Blockchain to the Fore <p>Because we are on the blockchain, and each frame is equivalent to one block, you might say Block, Paper, Scissors runs very slowly. Part of the challenge was not just accepting speed as a constraint but embracing it! It makes the game more reflective of the medium, and it helps to reveal some key points of friction and confusion.</p><p>Block production speed becomes painful as we attempt to use the blockchain for cases requiring a faster turnaround. And because the objective is to get the longest streak, the chain that is the fastest may have an advantage.</p><p>Finality isn't so cut and dry. A move won't be final until it's a few blocks deeper in the chain state. And if something changes, that has rippling effects on the moves that came after it. If there are a lot of outstanding votes, It's hard to be 100% sure what move you are presently playing against!</p><p>The Mempool is another potential source of information — a place where you might be able to detect an influx of saboteurs, for example. But accurately and reliably presenting its state is not a simple task.</p><p>We've constantly been wrestling with how much of the block-building process to reveal and incorporate and how much to abstract away. And in many cases, addressing the challenges above is most easily achieved by introducing centralization, neutralizing a key advantage of using blockchain technology in the first place.</p><p>Ultimately we've opted to abstract many things away and rely on centralized service providers to address many of these concerns. It's the pragmatic move right now. But we believe we can provide truly decentralized alternatives as our own protocols and platforms mature.</p> Key Learnings <p>The blockchain is still quite volatile. The network goes down, and transactions can fail. <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/foundry-forge">Forge</a>, the command line tool we use to test and deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts, has been breaking down as we deploy contracts to Filecoin. Speaking of Filecoin, not many wallet clients support it yet, making game adoption more challenging.</p><p>We hope the game helps to shed more light on the character of block production and how it differs across various blockchain networks. And that it helps identify targets for further decentralization without sacrificing similar improvements to UX.</p> What's Next <p>Help us test! We invite you to play Block, Paper, Scissors while we're in Play Test mode on the three testnets. Once we've seen how it holds up, we'll deploy to mainnets, and the real game will be afoot!</p><p>New features! We were delighted to discover as we built the game that there are other ways to play. Since each move displays a color that corresponds to the selection (Block, Paper, or Scissors), and each color square is placed on a grid, it creates a visual canvas where users can coordinate to draw pixelated frames. We have a feature planned to recognize those who draft a plan for a future game state and successfully convince people to help them execute it. There will be a leaderboard for these A-Team players (because we love it when a plan comes together😉), and the tracker will be available soon.</p><p>Expansion of the SLW RK'D. We hope you enjoy playing our game so much that it inspires you to fork and build your own. If you do, we'll add it to our library of games. This library will be known as the SLW RK'D (Slow Arcade), and we hope it is both educational and fun for everyone involved. We'd love for you to join the effort and build out more games for people to play — on blockchains or any other type of distributed system! There's no wrong way to do it.</p> The Principles of SLW RK'D   Feel the Network: Game mechanics reveal the capabilities and limitations of the networks the game operates on — typically blockchains.  Embrace the Pace: Each game move corresponds to the speed of consensus on that network. For blockchains, each move is at least one block, tying game speed to block production rate.  Casual Participation: Players might track their personal records &amp; scores, but involvement in every block/move isn’t required. Come and go as you please!  Collaborative Spirit: All players and each network jointly determine each move, encouraging teamwork — mostly.  Cross-Network Competition: The leader is decided across all deployed networks.  One World, One Game: Despite the number of networks the game is deployed to or how many participants are active, there’s a singular game state at any time. The game starts once, and…  It’s Endless: With current technology and physics laws, the game’s end is out of sight—unless all deployed networks cease to exist.   Play Block, Paper, Scissors <p><a href="https://blockpaperscissors.fission.app/">Block, Paper, Scissors</a> was created by Andy, an Engineer, and Ryan, Head of Design, and is available now. <a href="https://blockpaperscissors.fission.app/">Give it a spin</a>, and let us know your thoughts on our <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord</a>!</p><p></p>

 With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in Germany, what regulations and safeguards are in place to protect consumers and operators? 



 



<p>Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have become very popular in recent years, as increasing numbers of German people invest in digital assets. The rapid expansion of the crypto industry has created an urgent need for regulation to protect the stability of the German financial system and its consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore the growth of cryptocurrencies in Germany, and the need for a regulatory landscape to govern the use of digital assets. We will examine what the current state of regulation in Germany is, and what challenges regulators, consumers and cryptocurrency exchanges are facing.</p>



 Is crypto regulated in Germany? 



<p>In April 2023, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">was passed by European Parliament lawmakers.</a> It aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. It is expected to come into force by the summer of 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a national level, although cryptocurrencies are legal in Germany, they are not considered legal tender or currency. Instead, <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/534/understanding-the-regulatory-landscape-for-crypto-assets-in-germany-and-the-eu">regulators classify cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument or asset</a>, which makes them subject to regulations and laws related to securities and investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared with other European countries, Germany has taken a decidedly proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, passing a law in 2020 that requires all cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Germany to obtain a license from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)</a>. This law also established rules for crypto custodians, including the requirement to hold a minimum amount of capital and ensure compliance with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Germany, BaFin is the primary regulator for digital assets and is responsible for the regulation of financial markets and institutions. This includes cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto wallets, and custodians.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to the taxation of cryptocurrencies, things get complicated, as they usually do with German tax laws. Cryptocurrency is subject to capital gains tax if it is held for less than a year before being sold or traded. However, if the digital asset is held for longer, it is exempt. Profits from cryptocurrency mining are subject to income tax. If the cryptocurrency is used to purchase services or goods, it may be subject to VAT. Profits from cryptocurrencies of less than €600 per year are tax-free. There is also an exemption limit of €256 per year for income from staking or lending.&nbsp;</p>



 Cryptocurrencies and AML regulations.&nbsp; 



<p>It should come as no surprise that there are strict and rigorous AML regulations that apply to cryptocurrency exchanges and other service providers in Germany. Providers must therefore implement measures including KYC procedures and transaction monitoring to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. An additional measure is to ensure they report suspicious transactions and activities to the relevant authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Providers must also comply with the European Union’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD),</a> which sets specific rules for virtual currency exchanges and custodian wallet providers. It requires providers and exchanges to register and conduct due diligence on their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>German tax residents are required to report their cryptocurrency transactions, including purchases, sales and exchanges, for tax purposes. Failure to do so may result in fines. Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers must also report any suspicious activity to the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/Geldwaeschepraevention/Verdachtsmeldewesen/Verdachtsmeldewesen_node_en.html">Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).</a></p>



 Regulation of cryptocurrency trading in Germany. 



<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges in Germany offer a range of trading options, including spot trading, futures trading, and options trading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in Germany are eToro, Bitpanda, Kraken, Binance, Justtrade and Coinbase (Read more about what Coinbase’s recent expansion efforts mean for the industry at large, in our blog: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/coinbase-crypto-winter/">Coinbase commits to European expansion amid brutal crypto winter.</a>) These exchanges offer a variety of trading pairs, low fees, and user-friendly interfaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To buy and sell cryptocurrency in Germany, consumers can use a cryptocurrency exchange or a peer-to-peer trading platform. Cryptocurrency exchanges allow the purchase or sale of the cryptocurrency of choice, which is then stored in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency trading and exchanges are regulated by BaFin, which requires all <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/blog-de/krypto-lizenz-bafin-erhalten/">cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Germany to be licensed</a> to comply with KYC and AML regulations. Cryptocurrency traders are subject to capital gains tax and must report their transactions in their annual tax returns.</p>



 



 

 



 With great opportunity comes great risk. 



<p>Success stories of Bitcoin millionaires, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/crypto-rues-bitcoin-s-btc-decoupling-from-ai-fueled-tech-stock-gains#xj4y7vzkghttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/crypto-rues-bitcoin-s-btc-decoupling-from-ai-fueled-tech-stock-gains#xj4y7vzkg">decoupling of Bitcoin from the stock markets,</a> and the unstable traditional economy have also contributed to considerable crypto hype in Germany in recent years. Unfortunately, this has also resulted in incidents of fraud rising sharply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem is compounded when first-time investors encounter suspicious crypto firms, that, to the uninitiated, look legitimate. It is only months or years later, after profits have been made in the deposit phase, that the investor realizes he has been taken in by a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bafin.de/DE/Verbraucher/Aktuelles/verbraucher_node.html">The BaFin publishes weekly warnings</a> on its website about crypto companies that must cease operations due to legal violations.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the security concerns associated with cryptocurrencies? 



<p>While the underlying technology behind cryptocurrency offers many benefits, including decentralization and transparency, it is also vulnerable to security threats, especially in the German market, where lawmakers and law enforcement agencies are still trying to address the variety of nefarious activities surrounding crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the security concerns associated with cryptocurrency in Germany include:&nbsp;</p>



  Hacking of cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets<br>  Identity fraud<br>  Phishing scams or other types of scams, e.g. financial scammers create genuine-looking documents via email featuring a fake balance on the blockchain<br>  Computer infection<br>  Fake deposits of ICOs, tokens or coins on fraudulent crypto or wallet exchanges<br>  Ponzi schemes that use fraudulent technology and deception.&nbsp;  



 Popular cryptocurrency scams. 



<p>Currently, one of the most common cryptocurrency scams is the “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scam</a>“, which uses social media or dating apps to gain the trust of victims, to steal their funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other notable cryptocurrency scams include the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/27/business/bitconnect-ponzi-scheme-satish-kumbhani/index.html">BitConnect Ponzi scheme</a>, whose founder was indicted in February 2022, and the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/co-founder-multi-billion-dollar-cryptocurrency-pyramid-scheme-onecoin-pleads-guilty">$4 billion OneCoin scam</a>, which came to light in December 2016.&nbsp;</p>

 How to keep cryptocurrency safe in Germany. 



<p>One of the most effective ways to ensure that crypto platforms are protected from fraudulent activities is by implementing a robust KYC process to verify customer identity and prevent customers from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">bypassing KYC requirements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 What is the future of cryptocurrencies in Germany? 



<p>The German government has been working on regulating cryptocurrencies for some time, and in 2019 passed a law allowing banks to hold and sell cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have also been discussions about new regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs), to protect investors and ensure the stability of the financial system. However, the regulatory landscape is still evolving. As the cryptocurrency market changes, regulation may change as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More and more companies and individuals in Germany are holding digital assets such as cryptocurrencies. According to <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-germany-2022/">a survey conducted by Triple A in 2022</a>, around 4.9 million residents currently own cryptocurrencies.&nbsp; Individuals with an income of €300,000 or more per year hold about two-thirds of all cryptocurrencies. In the coming years, the number of individuals holding cryptocurrencies is expected to increase as Germany as continues to become a more crypto-friendly country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future of cryptocurrency in Germany looks promising, thanks to increasing adoption and potential regulatory changes that could further boost the industry. The German regulatory framework for cryptocurrency is evolving, with key regulators such as BaFin and the Federal Ministry of Finance overseeing compliance and reporting requirements. Strict <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> regulations are in place to reduce fraud on cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Germany is sometimes known for unnecessary red tape, the country is trying to provide a regulatory framework that creates a supportive environment for the cryptocurrency market while protecting consumers. Nevertheless, individuals and businesses should always remain vigilant and aware of the risks and challenges associated with cryptocurrency and its regulatory requirements in Germany.&nbsp;</p>

 What Is Windows Credential Manager &amp; How Does It Work? 
<p>Windows Credential Manager is Windows software that stores authentication credentials that are used to log in to websites or other computers on a network. </p>
 How Does Windows Credential Manager Work? 
<p>A credential manager stores login credentials securely so that users don’t have to memorize or manage those credentials themselves. More often than not, this means storing usernames and passwords or PINs much like third-party password managers. </p>
<p>The best of these systems operate behind the scenes, creating a seamless user experience while managing a growing list of credentials. Windows Credential Manager does this for Windows users. This tool therefore simplifies the login process while streamlining the user experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0#:~:text=Credential%20Manager%20lets%20you%20view,select%20Credential%20Manager%20Control%20panel.">Windows Credential Manager</a> stores two types of data:</p>
 
 Web Credentials: This software will store login credentials associated with websites and online accounts, working in tandem with a web browser.  
 Device Credentials: The software will also store credentials related to local network resources, including services and shared files and directories. 
 
<p>The Credential Manager encrypts and stores this data securely, and only allows access to users who have the necessary permissions. </p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Credential Storage: Windows will prompt the user to store credentials when they are entered, creating a link to that resource and the credentials provided.  
 Credential Autofill: Windows will automatically fill in credentials for devices or websites with linked credentials without manual intervention from the user.  
 Credential Management: The manager will allow the user to manually enter, delete, and change existing credentials. While changed passwords will typically be replaced automatically, this gives the user more control over their credentials. 
 
<p>The credential manager uses the Data Protection API (DPAPI), a cryptography system, to secure your credentials. This ensures that only you, as the user, have access to your stored credentials, thereby enhancing security.</p>
 Is Windows Credential Manager Secure? 
<p>Security, in the case of credential management, is a complicated topic. While a system may be secure under ideal conditions, it may not hold up under specific attacks or user behaviors. under others.</p>
<p>Windows Credential Manager has a few components that promote secure credential management:</p>
 
 Encryption: DPAPI is considered relatively secure, using a strong encryption algorithm, typically AES, to protect data. 
 Linked Accounts: The encryption key used by the program is tied to the user’s specific Windows user account. This means that even if someone else has access to that computer, they can’t (technically) decrypt those credentials unless they know the account password. 
 System Password: Access to the Credential Manager itself is protected by the Windows account password. Without this password, no one can access those stored credentials, so if this password (and additional <a>MFA authentication</a>) are secure, then so is the account. 
 
<p>However, like any security tool, it’s only truly secure as the system it is in. That is, if the operating system or applications compromise security, or have been hacked, then Windows Credential Manager is actually not very secure. </p>
<p>For example, the <a>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> database lists several procedures and attacks that can compromise Windows Credential Manager. Some of these include:</p>
 
 LaZagne, an open source tool used to recover passwords on systems. 
 PowerSploit, a set of PowerShell attack modules that allows users to attack and compromise Windows systems. 
 RainyDay, a malicious backdoor exploit tool. 
 Turla, a Russian <a>Advanced Persistent Threat</a> (APT). 
 
<p>That being said, even if systems remain safe from these exploits, it doesn’t excuse users from failing to follow best <a>identity management</a> practices. These include:</p>
 
 Strong Account Password: The security of stored credentials is only as strong as the Windows account password. If your account password is weak or easily guessable, then an attacker could potentially gain access to those stored credentials. 
 Physical Security: with physical access to a computer, a hacker is more likely than not to find a way to break encryption or hack an account password, meaning that they can bypass security.  
 Malware Protection: Malware can essentially work around credential protective measures through techniques like Man-in-the-Middle attacks or keystroke logging.  
 Data Breaches: If user credentials are compromised in a data breach at the site or service for which they were created, having them stored in Credential Manager won’t protect the user. 
 
<p>So while the Credential Manager provides a secure method of storing credentials, it should be used as part of a larger, comprehensive approach to security that mitigates both local and remote hacks.</p>
 What Are Some Drawbacks of Windows Credential Manager? 
<p>Security is a critical issue for Windows Credential Manager, but not simply related to encryption or hackers. This software carries some of the limitations that many system-specific managers have. </p>
<p>Some of these downsides include: </p>
 
 Single Point of Failure: An attacker with <a>credential access</a> to your user account can view or even export all saved credentials. This can be a major problem in cases where an attacker gains access to data that can lead to <a>credential dumping</a>. In this case, they are either all safe or none of them are safe.  
 False Sense of Security: It’s always important to use strong, unique passwords for every account regardless of whether you’re using a password manager or not. This software isn’t a shield against poor authentication practices, nor will it protect you from <a>credential stuffing</a> if users have reused credentials across several platforms.  
 Limited Cross-Platform Integration: This software is only on Windows. If you’re using multiple devices with different operating systems, a third-party password manager might serve your needs better.

				  Why was the internet built without an emphasis on identity or security? Why are we still trying to figure these out 50 years later? What role will AI play in the future of digital trust? Let’s take a brief look at the history of the internet and see what we can learn.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>The first network of networks — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> — was declared operational in 1971; it was the first thing built that resembles the internet as we know it today. Developed by the Department of Defense, ARPANET was capable of file transferring, remote login, email, and that was about it. Because computers were, at this time, both large and expensive, they were relatively uncommon, and you would likely know everyone who had access to your network. So, no real need for formal trust just yet.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the early 1980s, several national and international networks have been created, one of the biggest launching in 1986 when the National Science Foundation Network <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation_Network">(NSFNET)</a> funded supercomputers at several universities and connected them to the network, enabling access for research and academic organizations in the United States.</p>
<p>It was on the NSFNET that interest in international connections grew, leading to several breakthroughs, including the adoption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">TCP/IP</a> internationally and the creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a> (before this everyone had to know the Internet Protocol (IP) address of where they were trying to go). In 1989, the first commercial internet service providers hit the scene, and by 1991 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a> was available to the public.</p>
<p>Now we have billions of people using the internet, and it would really benefit us to know who is who and how to manage access to private data. But how do we accomplish this given the current scale of digital interaction?</p>
<p>Enter Cryptography</p>
<p>Originally a late addition to email, encryption was developed as the need arose to keep certain sensitive information private. There are two main ways to create encryption: symmetric key cryptography and public key cryptography.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">Symmetric key cryptography</a> is fairly straightforward. Both parties have a key, or a shared-secret; this key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data and must be known to both parties. An example you likely use every day is a login and password. Both parties know the password and, therefore, can be reasonably certain of the identity using the password and that they can be trusted. Unfortunately, if someone else finds the key, symmetric encryption becomes useless, as now there is no way for the system to tell who the true user is.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key cryptography</a> is both more complex and more useful for sharing data with a large audience. Through mathematical functions that use large prime numbers, a pair of keys is created. One of these keys is private and is used to “sign” data or prove its origin, the other key is public and is used to verify the source and read the data. One shortcoming of this system is that if people don’t have your public key it doesn’t work, so you need a good way to distribute the key. A few examples of public key cryptography include <a href="https://www.digicert.com/what-is-ssl-tls-and-https">TLS/ SSL</a> (web browser security) systems like Bitcoin, and password managers like <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO</a>/<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Passkey-vs-password-What-is-the-difference">passkey</a>.</p>
<p>Cryptography enables us to do two very useful things: encryption and signatures. While sometimes used together, there is a clear and important distinction. Encryption allows the user to scramble a message so that only a party holding the relevant key can decrypt it; however, there is no level of certainty for the key reader about where the message originated. Signatures, on the other hand, allow you to cryptographically prove the source of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> are a good example of a signature in action. When a credential is issued, the person issuing the credential signs the data, and every verifier can check that the data has not been changed since it was issued. This enables the verifying party to trust whoever holds the data the same as if it was coming from the source. These systems are effective at communicating trust however, they are not yet in widespread use.</p>
<p>Signature systems, specifically these decentralized verifiable credentials, are the best solution we have come up with so far for addressing the chronic problem of not knowing who anybody is or where data is coming from on the internet. By ensuring that data is signed by an authority, such as a government, university, or trusted expert in the field, we know that we can trust this data in proportion to our trust in the authority.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the data is signed by a known acquaintance or friend you can be sure it came from that party, as opposed to a bad actor pretending to be them. The internet is ever expanding, with an estimated <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day">328.77 million terabytes of data being created daily</a> (that’s 328.77 billion gigabytes). Being able to rely on the information we find will be critical as our society continues to grow and move toward the digital future.</p>
<p>Living in an AI world</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that is capable of doing some really neat things. Because it is trained to mimic the decision-making process of a human brain, it is very good at certain kinds of tasks: recognizing patterns, such as <a href="https://recfaces.com/articles/ai-facial-recognition">identifying faces</a>, creating <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">strings of words or sentences</a> that make sense, or even mimicking <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/microsofts-new-ai-can-simulate-anyones-voice-with-3-seconds-of-audio/">voices</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them">faces or videos</a>. AI has one weakness in that it typically cannot explain why it does what it does, often <a href="https://thenewstack.io/ai-surprises-researchers-by-inventing-new-hide-and-seek-strategies/">surprising even its programmers</a> with the decisions it makes in pursuit of accomplishing a task. But when AI can make almost anything look “real” and can’t really “show its work” for how it got there, how will we be able to trust anything we see online?</p>
<p>The answer will be to implement robust signature systems such as those offered by verifiable credentials. Here are just a few examples of how verifiable credentials could bring trust to AI systems.</p>
<p>For chatbots, the system is typically trained on databases or through scraping websites. If the system was, instead, trained on sets of verifiable credentials, each containing specific data that is signed by the originating authority, then the answers provided by the AI can reference the specific information it came from. Evaluation of those sources can be used to determine what trust to place in the AI-provided answer.</p>
<p>A similar system could be used for voices and videos. The next generation of cameras, microphones, and phones could use software to create a signature at the moment of media capture to provide evidence that the recording has not been altered since the taping. Software that performs light editing, such as boosting audio levels or brightening an image, could also provide a signature across the modifications, ensuring that no significant manipulation of the media occurred.</p>
<p>In short, verifiable credentials could save AI from becoming an engine of mistrust — and provide not only the internet’s missing verification layer but a verification layer able to handle the rapid pace of digital transformation.</p>

<p>The digital age has prompted the emergence of a diverse array of industries, with one of the most prolific being the financial technology <a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/fintech/">(FinTech)</a> sector. A notable component of this sector is the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP), which has seen rapid growth and widespread distribution.</p>

<p>An analysis of over 1,600 entities that provided terms and conditions on their respective websites revealed a global presence spanning 103 countries. The top ten countries with the most entities account for 55.78% of all countries. The following table demonstrates the percentages associated with each of these countries:</p>

North America and Asia follow, with 12.52% and 21.31% respectively. Other regions such as Oceania and offshore centers account for 3.06% and 13.38% respectively, while Central &amp; South America and Africa are the least represented with 4.71% and 2.26%.</p>



<p>Here’s the representation of regions in a tabular format:</p>

The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulatory framework proposed by the European Commission is set to establish clear rules for crypto-assets and related service providers, ensuring consumer protection, market integrity and financial stability.</p>



<p>More broadly, the data underscores the vitality of the European VASP environment. The region leads globally, with Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) making a particularly strong showing, contributing to 40.7% of Europe’s total VASP representation. </p>

The regulation covers a broad range of activities and services, such as the custody of crypto-assets, operation of<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/trading-platforms/"> trading platforms,</a> and exchange services between crypto-assets and fiat currencies. The regulation applies to both public offers of crypto-assets and crypto-asset service providers operating within the European Union.</p>



<p>Given that Europe holds the highest share of VASPs with terms and conditions referring to European countries, the MiCA regulation will undoubtedly have a major impact on these entities. The introduction of MiCA promises a unified regulatory approach, reducing market fragmentation and improving legal certainty within the continent.</p>



<p>Moreover, as MiCA is set to become a gold standard for crypto regulation, it could serve as an influential model for other regions with a significant VASP presence. The adoption of similar regulatory frameworks worldwide would foster increased trust, protection, and stability in the global crypto market, supporting its sustainable growth.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the global landscape of Virtual Asset Service Providers is highly diverse, with a significant concentration in Europe. The advent of regulatory frameworks like MiCA presents a crucial step in recognizing and formalizing the sector’s role in the financial ecosystem. This development not only stimulates further growth and innovation within the industry but also serves as a guiding light for regulatory efforts in other regions across the globe.</p>

 Offering a sign-up bonus is a popular technique by many iGaming operators to attract new players. But is it worth the risk? 



 



<p>In the online gambling world, you would be hard pushed to find a mainstream online casino that doesn’t attempt to entice new customers through bonuses. Offering bonuses to attract and retain bettors has become a staple for new and old brands in the industry, and there is no reason to believe this will not be the case for the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attracting bettors and players is the main reason why sportsbooks and other operators provide bonuses. Players appreciate the chance to play with bonus funds, so seeing appealing offers from sportsbooks makes them more inclined to register.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, while iGaming businesses work toward developing strategies to attract and retain bettors’ interest, gambling fraud proves to be a particularly tricky and dangerous obstacle to overcome. Bonuses themselves are often abused, in fact, it’s quite common.</p>



 Understanding bonuses in gambling. 



<p>Bonuses offered by gambling operators can vary, but typical promotions grant players bonus funds or free spins to encourage them to use their platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonuses are also designed to encourage players to continue betting using their own money when the bonus funds run out. Both parties should gain from a good betting bonus. For example, customers may receive bonus funds to bet with, while operators get to acquire paying customers. Challenges emerge when certain users start using bonuses for malicious activities like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though conversion rates differ depending on the operator, the most popular types of bonuses include the following:</p>



  Sign-up bonus (often with free spins)<br>  Deposit match bonus<br>  No deposit bonus<br>  Reload bonus<br>  Cashback<br>  Free bets<br>  Reward program<br>  Refer-a-friend bonus  



 What is bonus abuse in gambling? 



<p>Bonus abuse involves players signing up to a gambling platform to manipulate the promotion to their favor, unfairly manipulating the promotion incentives aimed at casino players who have yet to sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are betting communities that look to exploit such bonuses. This activity goes by numerous names, including bonus hunting and promo abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering most bonuses can only be used once, this often leads to fraudsters setting up multiple accounts to take advantage of repeated bonuses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fraud terminology, this process is known as multi-accounting. Bettors typically target free bet promotions and bonuses with no deposit requirements, i.e., no deposit bonuses, such as free cash or spins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that only some people who partake in bonus cheating are seasoned fraudsters. Most bonus abusers are regular gamblers who believe they are only ‘cheating the system’, and not venturing into illegal territory. However, there is a sizeable community of tech-savvy criminals who have the resources to utilize <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/betting-bots-casino-bots/">betting bots</a>, virtual machines, emulators, and (simulated) residential IPs, such as mobile networks or Socks5 proxies, to leverage new IP addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the different types of bonus abuse fraud include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 
  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">Chip dumping&nbsp;</a><br>&nbsp;  Collecting sign-up bonuses&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/arbing-in-betting/#:~:text=How%20to%20define%20arbitrage%20in,which%20way%20the%20game%20goes.">Arbitrage betting</a>, a.k.a., arbing&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">Identity theft</a>  
 



 
  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">Money laundering&nbsp;</a><br>&nbsp;  Account takeover&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-to-avoid-world-cup-betting-fraud/">Chargeback fraud</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/collusion-in-betting/">Collusive play&nbsp;</a>  
 
 



<p>Whatever the type, the process of bonus abuse invariably starts at sign-up. One fraudster (or a group of them) will create as many accounts as possible, a process called ‘gnoming’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They use disposable emails, fake aliases, and fake or stolen credit card information to bypass <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> checks. Once they have created multiple accounts, they then take advantage of the promotion in question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engaging in casino bonus is not illegal per se, but breaking terms and conditions is. For example, all bonuses will typically include terms detailing that they have the right to confiscate any winnings if they suspect the account player to be involved in some form of bonus abuse. These terms can be murky but are typically referring to players who manipulate bonuses to their advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same would apply for any suspicions that the account is being used in a fraudulent manner, such as the account being used by someone else other than the official holder. Fraudsters would be breaking many of these terms if they were to create multiple accounts under other people’s names.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If caught, the user’s bonus money and winnings will be confiscated, and the user’s deposit may also be frozen in their account.</p>

 Recognizing the warning signs. 



<p>To prevent bonus abuse in online gaming, operators must first be able to spot them. There are numerous signs and behavioral patterns to watch out for:&nbsp;</p>



  When the account is fake, there is typically a much shorter period between sign-up and withdrawal or chip dumping. For example, if a newly assigned bonus is instantly lost to a third person at a poker table.&nbsp;  



  Certain games usually attract more fraudsters than others. Games like poker, where players can play against each other and more easily manipulate the outcome, are most at risk of bonus abuse.<br>  Fraudsters use VPNs, TOR browsers, or blacklisted residential-like proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Understandably, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">KYC and ID verification platforms</a> have become crucial in helping gambling operators identify potentially nefarious or fraudulent practices.</p>



 Techniques used in bonus abuse. 



 Exploiting loopholes in terms and conditions. 



<p>One of the most common restrictions in T&amp;Cs involves preventing players from playing specific games with bonus funds. Blackjack and poker games are usually excluded from bonuses due to their lower house edge. This is because <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/matched-betting/">matched bettors</a> could complete their wagering requirements on an outcome close to 50/50, meaning they were almost guaranteed to make money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While most gambling sites use technology to detect and prevent players from claiming bonus funds on forbidden games, bonus abuse invariably involves avoiding promotional restrictions to play games with bonus money.</p>



 Multiple account creation. 



<p>Most casino platforms allow users to create one account per user, a restriction monitored by the IP address of the device or household used to register and redeem the bonus. Fraudsters trick casinos by signing up for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gnoming-multi-accounting/">multiple accounts</a> via IP addresses, VPNs, TOR browsers, etc. &nbsp;</p>



 Identity theft and manipulation.&nbsp; 



<p>Sophisticated criminals often buy real ID documents on the dark web for use in defrauding gambling platforms. As these documents are not falsified, systems may fail to detect the abuse. Indeed, <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/synthetic-identity-fraud">synthetic identity fraud,</a> which uses a combination of real-person and fake data to form a new identity can bypass some weak KYC checks.</p>



 The impact of bonus abuse on sports betting sites.&nbsp; 



<p>Bonus abuse is becoming increasingly widespread and costs the iGaming sector approximately <a href="https://www.intergameonline.com/views/a-tale-of-woe-betting-gaming-and-bonus-abuse">15% of its</a> annual gross revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jon Howard, an Essex-based <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2023/04/24/bet365-236k-fraud-plot/">fraudster</a>, was recently imprisoned for five years for his part in various frauds, which resulted in the bookmaker losing over £236,000.&nbsp;This was the first bonus abuse fraud penalty ever seen in the UK.</p>



<p>Howard played a leading part in a syndicate that created over 1,000 bet365 accounts using different aliases to use welcome bonuses and evade deposit limits.</p>



 Responsible gambling measures. 



<p>To mitigate fraudulent gaming activity, operators must deter online bonus abuse. Some operators opt for the removal of deposit bonuses altogether, which is far from ideal, considering gambling bonuses are a sure-fire way of bringing people to a gambling platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other cases, some operators provide loyalty bonuses, rather than sign-up bonuses to discourage bonus abuse. This approach risks alienating the casual, everyday gambler, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators also use profiling tools to detect and restrict accounts that are engaging in unwitting cheating or fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also work toward spreading awareness about the consequences of online gaming bonus abuse. This involves starting initiatives and collaborations among other operators and sharing best practices and helpful information to safeguard the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recently published <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK Gambling White Paper</a>, which details the new approach to the UK’s iGaming regulation, also sets out new proposals to tackle bonus abuse fraud and other fraudulent activities by curbing “bonus” and “free spins” offers.&nbsp;Read more about the steps that the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">United Kingdom Gambling Commission</a> is taking to bring the UK gambling industry into the 21st century in our<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/"> blog, ‘From paper to policy: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector?’</a>.</p>



<p>Bonus abuse has also been a recurring problem in Europe, with most countries taking strict measures to put an end to such activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in 2019, Malta-based companies <a href="https://www.egr.global/intel/news/genesis-global-and-ag-communications-fined-for-bonus-abuse-in-sweden/#:~:text=Genesis%20Global%20and%20AG%20Communications%20fined%20for%20bonus%20abuse%20in%20Sweden,-Malta%2Dheadquartered%20pair&amp;text=Malta%2Dbased%20duo%20Genesis%20Global,recurring%20bonuses%20to%20online%20players.">Genesis Global and AG Communications were fined</a> by gambling regulator Spelinspektionen for allegedly offering recurring bonuses to their Swedish player base. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators in other regions of the world have also adopted ways to reduce gambling fraud. With the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gambling-latam/">Brazilian gambling market on the verge of widespread regulation</a>, operators should be concerned about fraudsters looking to take advantage of an immature market.</p>



 Battling bonus abuse fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>As the iGaming industry flourishes, so does the number of fraudsters looking to exploit the system for their illicit interests. As bonus abuse is among the industry’s most significant challenges, operators must seek proactive measures to tackle cybercriminals and their methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides stricter protocols and spreading awareness, KYC and AML checks can reduce bonus abuse in iGaming, combat money laundering, and minimize financial losses.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>IDnow’s user-friendly, efficient, and secure <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">AML and KYC</a> solutions can help with player onboarding, financial risk checks, age verification checks, and more. With IDnow, operators can guarantee compliance with international regulatory standards and curb fraud, such as bonus abuse fraud, without compromising the player experience.</p>


 
 
 
 What is bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>Bonus abuse occurs when people sign up for multiple accounts to abuse promotions offered by online gambling operators.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 Are there any legal consequences for engaging in bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>If caught partaking in bonus abuse, the user’s bonus funds and winnings are confiscated. They might also have their deposited funds frozen. For punishments more severe, it depends on the technique of bonus abuse. For example, receiving permission from a friend to use their details will be viewed very differently than stealing personal information.</p>

 
 
 
 What steps can online casinos take to prevent bonus abuse?&nbsp; 
 

<p>The steps to prevent bonus abuse include setting more complex bonus terms, lowering bonus payouts, and ensuring the site’s KYC process is as rigorous as possible.&nbsp;</p>

 Bluesky: A Short Overview 
<p>Our digital lives are fragmented — we all maintain profiles across multiple social sites. If you move from one site to another, you have to start over with no history of the friends or content you created there. This is because the original web protocol made it easy to link websites, but had no built-in way to link people and their content, making it hard for people to maintain control over their online identities.</p>
<p>When a centralized platform owns your online identity and is the only host of your content, you’re vulnerable to getting cut off without warning. It’d be like if the city you lived in one day decided to kick you out, and there was no way to move your stuff to a new city and keep in touch with your friends. An analogy for what Bluesky is building is an identity and transport system between cities, so you can move from one place to another and keep your friends.</p>
<p>Bluesky’s goal is to rebuild social so that:</p>
 
 Users own their data and can take it anywhere they want to go. 
 Developers will never get locked out of the ecosystems they help build. 
 Creators will always own their relationships with their audience. 
 
<p>To achieve these goals, Bluesky has developed a social protocol — in other words, we designed a new approach to storing and retrieving information about people in a social network. This is where the “decentralization” part of Bluesky comes in. A protocol is a set of instructions for computers to talk to each other. It creates a set of rules for how your data can move across different services, even ones not run by us. This open protocol is why most data – your posts, follows, likes, and blocks  – is public on Bluesky right now. Making a post on Bluesky is like making a blog post you publish to the web. The underlying protocol for Bluesky is ATP, much like the underlying protocol for the web is HTTP. Our goal was to make social media work more like the open systems that defined the early web, like blogs and email.</p>
 A Network of Cities 
<p>ATP, or the Authenticated Transfer Protocol, is a federated social protocol. Here’s an analogy using cities in the real world to describe federation online: Centralized social platforms are like one big city that everyone lives in, and federated protocols are like a network of cities, of all different sizes. In the federated network, people can move between cities depending on what kind of community they’d like to be in. The Bluesky social app we’re running right now is just one city in a network that will grow over time. The AT Protocol gives you a passport (identity) to travel with, and lets you take all of your belongings (data) with you, enabling an eventual network of cities to interoperate. When we launch federation, more cities (servers) will pop up.</p>
<p>Just as different cities can have different laws and cultures, different parts of a federated network can be governed differently. Systems like<a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation"> composable community moderation</a> can help create a system for governing the different “cities” in the network. In the future, we hope to see many new and different kinds of cities (i.e. other social apps like dating apps or video feeds) get built by users and developers, as well as the bridges and tunnels that connect these cities. With your Bluesky passport, you can travel freely between digital spaces, with the tools to create your own or to curate your experience at home. We believe that the future of social media is co-created and open. Join us!</p>

<p></p> 
 Introduction   
<p>Nearly every aspect of conducting business today begins with an act of authentication. Communicating, using tools, interacting with data, processing transactions – all depend on the ability to verify our identity to gain access. Much attention is paid to the consequences of poor authentication security — just check the headlines for the latest breach — but the user’s experience (UX) of authentication also has a profound impact on an organization.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=b7a7dd2c-7826-451f-b282-f8fd5cc8923f&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
<p>HYPR and Vanson Bourne recently published our 2023 State of Passwordless Security Report, which surveyed 1,000 IT and security experts to better understand current perceptions, challenges and trends when it comes to authentication and IAM. In this State of Passwordless Spotlight report, we dig deeper into the findings, focusing on how the authentication user experience affects organizations and their employees and customers.</p> 
<p>This Spotlight report also specifically looks at the impact of UX on financial services organizations. Finance is the top sector for attacks and is subject to rigorous regulations around security and authentication. As such, it frequently serves as a bellwether in the IAM sphere, providing an early look at important developments and trends.</p> 
<p>Key Takeaways</p> 
  
  
   
    
      64%  <p>of organizations say a poor user experience is a major authentication pain point</p>  
      Four  <p>different systems for authentication are being used by employees daily</p>  
      $375/ employee  <p>spent on password-related help desk issues annually</p>  
      39%  <p>of financial services firms plan to adopt or use passwordless (or passkeys) authentication in the next 1-3 years&nbsp;</p>  
    
   
  
  
 Authentication UX Challenges  
<p>Our research shows that organizations face significant challenges when it comes to authentication and user experience. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed companies (64%) cite challenges with user experience as a major pain point in their authentication processes.</p> 
<p>Poor UX not only leads to user frustration and dissatisfaction, it obstructs work, increases costs and actually decreases security because users can bypass certain security features meant to protect the user, systems and data.</p> 
 Productivity Lost to Time Consuming Logins and Lockouts  
<p>There’s no getting around it, login methods that rely on passwords create friction, which only gets worse as security stipulations like long, complex strings, frequent rotation and additional authenticating factors are imposed. In 2024 this will be compounded with PCI 2024 requiring longer passwords.</p> 
<p>There’s also significant time wasted when employees forget their passwords and require resets. Nearly 3 in 10 (29%) of IT and security professionals cite password/ credential resets as an ongoing pain point for their organization . Moreover, around eight in ten (81%) report they’ve been unable to access critical information due to forgetting their password.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Password-Based Authentication Increases Help desk Spend&nbsp;  
<p>Poor UX not only harms employee productivity, it places a significant strain on the help desk support system. Over the last 12 months, 76% of organizations had an increase in help desk requests relating to password resets or other authentication issues. In terms of actual costs, organizations spend 32% of their IT help desk budget on password resets and password-based authentication issues. This breaks down to $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
 Array of Authentication Systems and Requirements  
<p>Organizations also face challenges from the sheer variety of authentication systems used on a daily basis — four on average. This means multiple, varying sign-on requirements that employees must remember and use, adding friction and frustration in their day-to-day work.</p> 
<p><br></p> 
 A Good UX Is Critical to Security  
<p>Any security control is bound to fail if people don’t use them willingly. Nearly a third (31%) report resistance from employees in using their organization’s authentication technology.</p> 
<p>Resistance frequently expresses itself in workarounds that create security risks for organizations. Employees may share passwords, store password lists on their computers or leave their systems signed in while they are away, some even use tools like a mouse jiggler to avoid having to re-authenticate.</p> 
 Don’t forget IT  
<p>We don’t usually put the IT experience in the UX category but we should. The IT user experience also impacts adoption, costs and security. The survey found that&nbsp;</p> 
<p>56% of organizations face IT-related obstacles in their current authentication approaches, including management complexity (34%) and integration difficulties (31%).</p> 
 Outsized Impact on the Finance Sector  
<p>We already know that the finance sector experiences the most attacks on its authentication processes — 81% for those in financial services vs. a global average of 74%. They also face tremendous pressure from regulations and security frameworks to implement stronger authentication processes to combat these greater risks.</p> 
<p>Most of the regulations currently on the books require multi-factor authentication, which traditionally incorporates a password as one of the factors. This is creating demonstrable friction in financial services organizations. For nearly every UX issue discussed above, the finance sector has been hit even harder.</p> 
  
  85% of respondents in the finance industry report they’ve been unable to access work-critical information due to forgetting a password; 5% higher than the global average  
  The help desk spend on password-related authentication issues is $389/employee vs. a $375 average across industries  
  Nearly half (48%) face challenges in implementing traditional 2FA/MFA due to time consuming login  
  
 Passwordless Authentication Improves UX&nbsp;  
<p>Authentication plays a central role in enterprise digital transformation and almost every other strategic initiative or service. A poor authentication experience can slow or even derail projects so it’s critical to get it right.</p> 
<p>Nearly half of the IT and security (45%) experts name improved user experience as the reason to move to passwordless authentication. A full 86% believe passwordless authentication helps ensure user satisfaction. Benefits of passwordless authentication, specifically FIDO-based (passkeys) authentication include:</p> 
  
  No password resets  
  Faster login speeds: FIDO-based passwordless MFA uses a single, secure gesture for login that is up to 3 times faster than traditional MFA  
  Reducing account lockout  
  Consolidating multiple authentication systems into one  
  Increased employee and customer satisfaction  
  
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>These findings reveal the toll that the authentication user experience can take on all aspects of a business. Many organizations are contending with significant hits to productivity and their bottomline due as a result of their current authentication practices.</p> 
 Passwordless MFA That Is Built for Users  
<p>HYPR’s passkey-based solutions are designed from the ground-up for the way people work and live. We apply UX best practices and principles in tandem with strong security for phishing-resistant authentication that people want to use. Designed to deploy rapidly into existing infrastructure, it turns an ordinary smartphone into a FIDO Certified passkey for frictionless authentication everywhere.

  Data is the lifeblood of any modern business organization. It is therefore critical to maintain data security and integrity by protecting it appropriately depending on what the data is, what it is used for, who is accessing it, and how it is used. But implementing consistent and comprehensive data protection across an enterprise, on premises and in the cloud, can be challenging.

 As the rise of crypto continues, so does the risk of criminal activity. What can crypto firms do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



 



<p>Could Satoshi Nakamoto have predicted how profoundly Bitcoin would change the landscape of the traditional financial system when he released his Bitcoin White Paper on October 31, 2008?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that whitepaper, Nakamoto wrote of virtual currencies that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions. He explained that bitcoin miners (or nodes) support the network and provide a way to initially distribute coins into circulation. Since there is no central authority to issue coins the nature of the Bitcoin blockchain lends itself to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within just a few years of the white paper, so-called cryptocurrencies had blossomed all over the internet. However, because there is no central authority, cryptocurrencies are operated independently and exchanged with a much more limited supervision, mostly through crypto exchange platforms. Since cryptocurrencies provide a high degree of anonymity that is often unattainable in the traditional financial system, it has attracted criminals looking to launder money from their illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the 2010s to modern day, the steady increase in use of cryptocurrencies forced the hand of European lawmakers to devise a European legal framework. With the creation of countless crypto-related businesses and exchange companies, European institutions had to implement proper legislations for crypto activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two legislations were specifically created for that purpose: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto-Assets</a> (MICA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti Money-Laundering Directive 5</a> (AMLD 5). Note: As the UK is no longer part of the European Union, UK lawmakers have started work on their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">own proposed crypto regime.</a> In addition to defining clear rules for designated actors conducting crypto transactions, the EU and the UK has also established a set of rules and principles to safeguard against the misuse of crypto assets.&nbsp;Each country will however be required to enforce said requirements on a national level. Read more about one country’s journey toward compliance in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/cryptocurrency-germany-regulations/#:~:text=Compared%20with%20other%20European%20countries,Financial%20Supervisory%20Authority%20(BaFin).">‘Cryptocurrency in Germany: Is it regulated and safe?’ blog</a>.</p>



<p>Newly adopted regulations now require crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers to implement <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC/AML regulations</a> to better deter money laundering. However, non-compliant crypto platforms are still out there, posing numerous risks to their businesses, and their customers.&nbsp;</p>



 The long and bumpy road toward compliance.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that in the early days of crypto, crypto firms were perhaps not as ‘keen’ on transparency as they are now. These days, KYC and compliance measures are top of mind for crypto firms, as operations are now under heavy scrutiny by national and international authorities. Crypto firms must therefore enforce strict screening processes, by ensuring there is a robust KYC process in place to verify customers’ identities, addresses, and source of funds. Monitoring transactions and assessing risks are also part of their requirements. Implementing such measures means processes invariably need to be revamped, or new programs developed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the arduous road to becoming regulation-ready, many exchanges decide to forgo improvements, and are still operating non-compliantly and without KYC measures in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criminal actors, whether traditional finance or crypto, are always on the look-out for platforms without proper KYC mechanisms, to gain access and engage in fraudulent activity. Even when crypto platforms comply to the highest KYC standards, some users are still able to circumvent those controls (see our previous article: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk">‘Buying crypto without a KYC check? Here’s why it’s risky for both users and platform operators.’</a>). Using non-compliant crypto exchanges can be risky for customers, as they may lose their funds following a mandatory shutdown. On top of that, non-compliant exchanges may not have adequate security measures to protect user funds and personal information. This makes them vulnerable to a whole host of different attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>History has shown that authorities have little patience with non-compliant crypto platforms. In 2017, BTC-e was <a href="https://www.ccn.com/btc-e-users-funds-stuck-in-limbo-as-companies-blame-each-other/">shut down by law enforcement in the United States</a> after it was accused of facilitating money laundering and other illegal activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alexander Vinnik, one of BTC-e’s founders, was alleged to have stolen identities, facilitated drug trafficking, and helped to launder criminal proceeds from syndicates around the world. He <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/btc-e-founder-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison-for-laundering-ransomware-funds/">was later sentenced in France</a> to a five-year jail sentence, after a long and complex legal battle with U.S. and Russian authorities amid an intelligence imbroglio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020, crypto exchange platform BitMEX was charged with violating AML/KYC regulations by the U.S.&nbsp; In October 2021, the Seychelles-based company agreed to <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/bitmex-agrees-to-settlement-up-to-100m-with-us-cftc-and-fincen">pay as much as $100 million</a> to resolve charges with CFTC and the Financial Crimes and Enforcement Network.&nbsp;</p>



 Laundering crypto money 101.&nbsp; 



<p>Thanks to weak AML and KYC policies, non-compliant crypto exchanges provide an accessible avenue to launder money, particularly when they offer on- and off-ramp facilities, which facilitate cryptocurrency being exchanged for <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp">fiat</a> (government-issued currency).&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2022">Chainalysis</a>, illicit addresses sent nearly $23.8 billion’s worth of cryptocurrency in 2022, which was an increase of 68% compared to 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dark net marketplaces offer money laundering services, but they are not the only means used by bad actors for laundering crypto. On-chain money laundering mixers help criminals convert crypto from illicit origins, by obfuscating blockchain transactions with a view to masking the proceeds of crime. More traditional intermediaries can also be used to hide the origin of funds for crypto trading, such as offshore accounts and shell companies.&nbsp;</p>



 Most popular money laundering crypto scams. 



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/smurfing/">Smurfing</a>: Large sums of money are split into smaller amounts that are sent through via multiple transactions. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-darkwebs-largest-cryptocurrency-laundromats-washed-out">Mixing</a>: These services are used to obscure the transaction history of a cryptocurrency by blending cryptos of multiple users.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  Offshore Transactions: Offshore accounts are used by criminals to obscure the origin of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Exchange Hopping: Criminals also use multiple crypto exchanges to transfer funds across different platforms, thereby making it difficult to trace the money trail.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  Privacy-Oriented Cryptocurrencies: Some blockchains employ advanced cryptographic techniques to hide transaction amounts, addresses, and other information.&nbsp;  



 Preventing money laundering through dedicated regulations and mechanisms.&nbsp; 



<p>In recent years, regulators have stepped up to enforce sanctions toward non-compliant operators in the crypto industry. Between criminal charges and sanctions lists, crypto entities operating either knowingly or unknowingly for illegal actors are now facing increased regulatory pressure and scrutiny. In fact, in 2023 and beyond, taking steps to become compliant with AML regulations should be the top priority for all crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto operators must implement strong KYC/AML mechanisms to ensure they are in full compliance with local legislation. This can also help regulators by identifying any red flags associated with certain transactions. For example, by adopting a layered approach through geofencing, account profiling and identity screening, crypto exchanges can drastically improve their AML/KYC programs. Recent developments in artificial intelligence mean the implementation of such detection tools can help to significantly deter criminals looking to launder money, whilst improving compliance levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The implementation of these robust controls will enable exchanges to participate in the fight against money laundering and contribute to the democratization of crypto currencies, which will ultimately lead to further mass adoption.</p>



<p>Read our latest blog to discover <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/red-flags-money-laundering/">money laundering red flag indicators</a>.</p>



 KYC to power crypto adoption.&nbsp; 



<p>Although enforcing KYC measures was a controversial decision for some crypto purists as it appears to go against many of the principles outlined by Nakamoto, they are an important tool for cryptocurrency platforms to prevent money laundering. As cryptocurrency adoption continues to increase, KYC processes have become an essential step in safeguarding the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Non-compliant exchanges will remain a target for money laundering specialists as they offer an opportunity to exploit gaps in controls. Non-compliant exchanges are also at risk from the authorities, which could not only impose major financial sanctions and business closures, but also criminal charges for mismanagement. In short, the existence of non-compliant exchanges poses a threat to crypto firms, crypto customers and the crypto industry itself.&nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an evolving <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Institute of Human Rights &amp; Business x Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs  Introduction <p>This blog series aims to present the results of the common investigation project of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="http://ihrb.org">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) which seeks to explore further the opportunities and barriers to just transition in the built environment in Europe (and beyond). This time, we will look at the urban land ownership patterns; their dynamics, transparency as well as some of the societal, economic and environmental implications.</p><p>At <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, we see this work as a part of <a href="https://medium.com/tag/built-envrionment">our built environment mission</a>. In this area we have been working together with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a> on <a href="https://medium.com/search?q=BendNotBreak">New Economic Thinking</a> where we analyzed the deep trends in the built environments in Europe, as well as mapping multiple actors and organizations seen as seeds of hope and opportunity in this space (see: Blog <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">1</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-4f9b26985ada?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">3</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-part-4-89c7683bd2c7?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------">4</a>). Furthermore, in the <a href="http://radiclecivics.cc">Beyond Property</a> project, where we are collaborating with a diverse group of organisations including the <a href="http://rockefellerfoundation.org">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.berggruen.org/">Berggruen Institute</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/">Open Society</a>, as well as in the <a href="https://www.radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics: Freehouse</a> demonstrator, we are working on the question of what a world beyond prevailing understandings of property would look like. Last but not least, in the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons</a> we have been demonstrating how public goods create private wealth, and presented ideas about how one could re-balance this equation.</p><p>For <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB</a>, this piece of work will contribute towards the project “<a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and For the Future</a>”. The project is developing a collaborative and field-defining agenda for a <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/explainers/just-transition-in-the-built-environment">just transition</a> in the built environment, through deep-dive action research in eight cities, visioning sessions, and regional and international policy advocacy. The work will also open up broader conversations on beneficial ownership as it relates to urban areas, and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. The work is in the context of IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment">Built Environment Programme</a>: bringing a human rights approach to built environment decision-making.</p><p>In follow-up blogs through 2024 we will share insights on the largest public and private owners of land in four European&nbsp;cities:</p>  Copenhagen  Lisbon  Prague  Athens  <p>We hope that this work can not only give insights into the dynamics of different contexts in terms of urban land ownership but also help to support and expand the ever growing community of changemakers who are working to achieve outcomes leading to the just transition. It draws inspiration from ownership mapping initiatives in other cities such as <a href="https://itsmaterial.substack.com/p/who-owns-cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="https://therealdeal.com/magazine/new-york-september-2018/who-owns-all-of-new-york/">New York</a>. And we will be sharing interviews and insights from urban land-mapping in additional contexts, including <a href="https://cmmm.eu/">”Critical Mapping for Municipalist Mobilisation</a>” which looks at Belgrade, Berlin and Barcelona; and the work of <a href="https://geodevops.org/">GeoDevOps</a> in&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>We hope that the blog series thoughts will prompt fruitful discussions and questions. We would welcome all readers’ views and critiques.</p><p>Please do get in touch if you would like to contribute: Aleksander Nowak <a href="mailto:aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a> / Annabel Short <a href="mailto:annabel.short@ihrb.org">annabel.short@ihrb.org</a></p>Fig 1. Initial mapping of urban land ownership in the Copenhagen municipality Land ownership and city-making: what are the connections? <p>IHRB’s <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/framework-for-dignity-built-environment">Framework for Dignity in the Built Environment</a> begins with the lifecycle stages of Land, Planning and Finance, recognizing that these are fundamental underpinnings for all that follows. Urban land ownership patterns significantly influence the possibility of just transition in the built environment.</p><p>1) Firstly, the ownership patterns of urban land can determine access and affordability of housing, infrastructure, and amenities. Concentrated ownership by a few powerful entities and consequent potential single-minded model for development can lead to exclusionary practices, gentrification, and displacement of marginalized communities. In multiple contexts, it has become evident that the shortage of housing is not the only driving factor behind the affordable housing crisis. Even in urban areas where, for example, high density zoning has been systematically applied, the rise of land values relative to building values, is vastly disproportionate. (see i.a. <a href="https://apsc.ubc.ca/news/2022/how-controlling-land-prices-could-help-solve-housing-crisis">Patrick&nbsp;Candon</a>).</p><p>2) Secondly, Land ownership influences the ability to implement sustainable development practices. Owners with a long-term perspective and commitment to place and sustainability may be more inclined to invest in energy-efficient buildings, renewable energy installations, green spaces, or public transportation infrastructure. Short-term, profit-focused ownership may hinder incentives to invest in sustainability, leading to environmentally harmful urban development.</p><p>3) Furthermore, concentrated land ownership can concentrate power and decision-making in the hands of a few stakeholders (public or private) limiting community input and participation in shaping the built environment. Inclusive land ownership models that involve local communities in land co-ownership can empower them to actively participate in decision-making processes, ensuring that the transition is just, equitable, and responsive to community needs.</p><p>4) Moreover, Land ownership patterns can influence economic disparities within urban areas, exacerbate income inequality and limit economic opportunities for marginalized communities.</p><p>5) Consequently, the way land is owned and managed can impact social cohesion and community well-being. Concentrated ownership that prioritizes profit maximization or highly debt driven urban developments without considering social needs can lead to the fragmentation of communities and the erosion of social&nbsp;bonds.</p><p>The project will also provide insights into land ownership mapping methodologies, contributing to a community of practice. The process will contribute to understanding of data transparency and accessibility in different cities. The context in each of them will likely pose different challenges, therefore, a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods will result in new strategies to get the most accurate picture of each of the contexts.</p><p>Contact:</p><p>Aleksander Nowak <a href="mailto:aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a> / Annabel Short <a href="mailto:annabel.short@ihrb.org">annabel.short@ihrb.org</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff">Urban Land Ownership Mapping— Towards a just transition of Europe’s built environment #1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Open-World Compute? <p>Serverless computing has been promised as the next big thing™ in computing. There are many advantages: not needing to build and manage complex backend code, and granular billing per invocation means that you only pay for what you use. Many of these systems have adopted workflow systems (e.g., AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions) on top of batch requests. Unfortunately, the systems to date have serious limitations: they’re locked into cumbersome proprietary APIs, have a finite number of integrations, and often don’t handle partial failure elegantly (e.g., can leave a database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong in another step). Furthermore, many of the compute offerings today lock developers into an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to other solutions in the future.</p><p>A more principled generation of workflow systems has developed to address some of these problems. They typically depend on the developer writing their code “correctly” and not doing things that make their code repeat work on multiple calls. This doesn’t play well with many common functionalities: what about when developers want to access time or random numbers? They also often don’t handle rollback out of the box. In short: they’re closed systems that depend on the programmer working hard to ensure that abstract properties are respected. This is a real problem: networks can (and do!) fail. Developers write buggy code (we all do it). It’s an extremely high bar.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. </p><p>IPVM (and Homestar) takes a different approach. Instead of depending on the developer to be careful, it restricts their programming environment. For example, WebAssembly (Wasm) can be limited to deterministic computation: any code that you compile to Wasm has to have these properties that we want by definition. IPVM also acknowledges that failure happens and pulls from recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-m-b-r-o-s-i-a-providing-performant-virtual-resiliency-for-distributed-applications/">research</a> about hiding that as much as possible by leveraging content addressing and Wasm.</p><p>Fission's vision for open-world compute is highly usable and collaborative. We want an open, multitier system that runs everywhere, connects all the world's users and services, and is substantially better than Web 2.0. Anyone will be able to broadcast a task type on the network, and it will be automatically usable without having to fork the project or ask permission.</p> Key Characteristics <p>There are several key characteristics we're considering as we build IPVM. As mentioned earlier, idempotence and determinism are key to reliable computing, but they can be challenging to understand and implement. </p><p>Wasm allows developers to bring their own language, run computations on a server, in their browser, or even on their phone, and run them in a deterministic environment so that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. </p><p>Furthermore, when we run computations with CIDs, the results output more CIDs. The CIDs do not get recomputed and reproduced each time we run them - they are essentially cached in IPFS. When someone applies that same input, it simply calls back that cached result. No new records are being created, making it idempotent. This comes for free on Merklized data, but we can also Merklize data that's read from anywhere and cache it for later use. </p><p>While pure computation is useful for many applications, you still need mutability in many cases. There are queries (reads) and pure computations, and these can go back and forth as long as we end with mutation. Because we are not giving users the ability to define the order of execution, we can reorder computation so that the mutations happen at the end.</p><p>If we bring these three properties together - determinism, idempotency, and purity, we can achieve virtual resiliency. This gives the developer peace of mind, knowing that, eventually, the computations will work no matter what crashes or curveballs are thrown at the system.</p><p>We also want replayability. The cached computations, or receipts, never have to be re-run. And when we need to make non-deterministic requests or work with time of day or random, instead of losing out on the guarantees of deterministic compute and having to use client libraries, the node can call itself, store the information, and run the RPC call. Then if we run it again, we can have replayability because those previous computations were already saved. This creates a "run once, never run again" system, making it more efficient and scalable. Using capabilities based on UCAN, we can determine who can run different computations. Perhaps one job is better for Bacalhau, another for Fastly, etc. Maybe you only want computation to happen on a cluster of machines that you and your friends run and no others. We let IPVM handle the matchmaking and authorization checking so that different systems can work together to complete the job.</p><p>And the best part is this is all happening behind the scenes! The developer doesn't need to set any of this up. 👍</p> Compute over Data Summit 2023 Presentation <p>Fission Staff Research Engineer <a href="https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> gave a presentation on IPVM and his work on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> implementation at the Compute Over Data Summit, which can be viewed below.</p><p>Learn more or get involved by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM working group</a>.</p>

 What Are Login Credentials? 
<p>Login credentials are unique pieces of information that verify the identity of a user accessing a digital system. </p>
 How Do Login Credentials Work? 
<p>The functionality of login credentials changes based on the type of system and its security demands. The type, complexity, and number of required credentials will change in different contexts. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, credentials come in two different forms:</p>
 
 Static: Static login credentials are fixed and don’t change over time unless manually updated by the user or the system administrator. These are easier to implement but are more vulnerable to various threats like phishing or brute-force attacks. 
 Transient: Transient login credentials change over time. Transient credentials are often used alongside static credentials to provide an additional layer of security. Transient login credentials include one-time passwords, session tokens, and the codes generated by hardware or software tokens in <a>multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) systems. 
 
<p>Transient credentials offer enhanced security because even if an attacker manages to intercept or otherwise acquire a temporary credential, it will soon expire and become useless. However, implementing transient credentials can be more complex and require additional resources, such as an OTP generation and delivery system or hardware tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are several different “factors,” or types, of login credentials that play a role in multi-factor authentication:</p>
 
 Something You Know (Knowledge): This factor represents knowledge-based information that the user needs to provide to authenticate their identity. It typically includes passwords, PINs, or answers to secret questions. 
 Something You Have (Ownership): This factor involves a physical device that the user possesses, which generates or receives information for authentication. Examples include a mobile phone receiving an SMS-based code, a hardware or software token generating a one-time password, a smart card, or a security key. 
 Something You Are (Inherence): This factor pertains to the biometric characteristics of the user. It can include <a>fingerprint recognition</a>, facial recognition, <a>voice recognition</a>, or retinal or <a>iris scans</a>. 
 
<p>There are several types of login credentials, each providing different levels of security:</p>
 
 Username/Password: The most common form of login credentials. The username typically serves as a public identifier for the user, while the password is a secret word or phrase (ideally) only known only to the user.  
 <a>Biometrics</a>: Biometrics are the use of unique physical or behavioral characteristics of the user for authentication. These can include fingerprints, facial scans, or voice recognition. 
 Token-Based Authentication: Here, the user is provided a token, or time- or context-specific string of alphanumeric characters, after successful login with a username and password. This token is then used for authentication in subsequent interactions. This form is often used for federated or Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication approaches. 
 Certificate-Based Authentication: This approach involves using digital certificates issued by trusted authorities that verify an organization is who they say they are. The certificates contain cryptographic keys and the owner’s identity, providing trust and security. This is often used in online encryption, such as with the <a href="https://https.cio.gov/faq/">Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS)</a>. 
<p>Each type of login credential comes with its strengths and vulnerabilities that apply to the specific requirements of your business. </p>
 What Are Some of the Threats to Login Credentials? 
<p>While some login credentials are more secure than others, they all face some sort of potential threat. There is no truly fool-proof approach to authentication.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common threats:</p>
 
 Social Engineering: The most widespread form of login threat is social engineering, or approaching users fraudulently to gain access to their information. For example, <a>phishing</a> attacks involve users revealing their login credentials to attackers posing as trustworthy entities. This is often done through deceptive emails or websites that mimic legitimate services. 
 Data Theft: hackers directly attack an authentication database, including hashed or plaintext login credentials. Following this, the hacker has immediate access to the credentials or, if they are encrypted, access to the database to attempt to crack that encryption at their leisure. 
 Brute-Force Attacks: The attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of passwords until they find the correct one. This type of attack is typically only effective on short or common passwords.  
 Dictionary Attacks: In a dictionary attack, the attacker tries a predetermined list of words and phrases as possible passwords. This can be effective against accounts with weak passwords that use common words or phrases. 
 Keylogging: These malicious programs record keystrokes on a user’s device, often without the user knowing. While insidious, these often require either direct access to the system or a larger-scale hack of that system. 
 <a>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</a>: The attacker can intercept data moving between the user and the service they’re trying to access, capturing it and reading it. 
 
<p>These threats underscore the importance of solid login credentials, careful handling of sensitive information, and ongoing vigilance about potential threats. It’s essential to keep systems updated, use secure and unique passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and educate users about potential threats and how to avoid them.</p>
 What Are Some Best Practices for Using Strong Login Credentials? 
<p>Creating and maintaining strong login credentials is essential to personal and organizational cybersecurity. Note that most of these requirements refer to passwords or other changeable authentication methods where the user has direct control over the credentials.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices to follow:</p>
 
 Require Complex Passwords: A strong password should be at least 12 characters long, with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. 
 Update Passwords: Require that users update passwords on a regular schedule, and disallow them from using repeat passwords. 
 Enable Multi-factor Authentication: MFA requires two or more authentication credentials to verify a user. This will typically be two or more forms of credentials across different categories of factors.  
 Beware of Phishing Attacks: Be vigilant about where you enter your credentials. Phishing attacks often trick people into entering their login credentials into fake websites. Always double-check the website’s URL before entering your information. 
 Implement Strong Security Questions: If your service uses security questions for account recovery, these should also be hard to guess. Treat them like additional passwords. 
 Use <a>Passwordless Authentication</a>: Some security platforms will provide ways to bypass the need to re-enter credentials constantly. These passwordless solutions eliminate some of the most common forms of authentication fraud around passwords.  
 
<p>Follow these best practices and you can significantly boost your authentication security.</p>
 Strengthen Your Authentication with 1Kosmos BlockID 
<p>Authentication login credentials are only getting stronger and more resilient to attack. As is the case for many things, the weakest link is the user. </p>
<p>1Kosmos eliminates this attack surface by using the most effective login credentials, including passwordless authentication and advanced biometrics. Other features include:</p>
 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

 DPI is neither good, nor bad but never neutral — governance is the key to achieving the goals of DPI and Digital Transformation <p>The digital technologies that serve as the ‘infrastructure’ of widespread digital transformation are increasingly recognised as key drivers of development. In recognition of the importance of these technologies in enabling development, the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">United Nations</a>, <a href="https://t20ind.org/taskforce/our-common-digital-future-affordable-accessible-and-inclusive-digital-public-infrastructure/">G20</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/08/digital-public-infrastructure/">WEF</a> and others increasingly highlight the importance of thinking about these technologies as ‘digital public infrastructure’ (DPI), flagging technologies such as the infrastructure and standards of digital identity, payments and data sharing as core ‘rails’ of digital transformation.</p> A technology-only approach to DPI will fail — getting governance right is&nbsp;critical <p>We know from the history of technology and development that technology alone is never a solution — from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3560107.3560193">e-government</a> initiatives to <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/selling-charisma-circa-2010-the-mit-media-lab-and-its-one-laptop-per-child-program/">laptops</a> the lesson is that technology alone is no silver bullet. If anything, without care it <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1940761.1940772">‘amplifies’ existing patterns of power and inequality</a>. We need to establish governance of digital technologies as a critical enabling layer to ensure all DPIs deliver on their promise, and to ensure a digital transformation that is rights based, protective and inclusive. A framework for the governance of digital technologies can set the rules of the road for all digital technologies — including DPI but also private sector&nbsp;too.</p> Three thoughts on why governance is key to making DPI a&nbsp;success <p>At Caribou Digital we’ve been working on technology in development for a while — from increasing access to digital technologies, supporting dialogue around what ‘good’ digital technologies look like to enabling entrepreneurs to better use technology. Underpinning this work is a commitment to listen and learn from the way technologies are increasingly part of everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>1. Making technology deliver for development requires institutional capacity and expertise: one form of digital public infrastructure is ‘digital public goods’ (understood as open source software, data, AI models, standards and content). There has been big progress in developing DPGs — there are <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">150 DPGs in the DPG registry</a>, and <a href="https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/2023-04/Digital%20Public%20Goods%20for%20the%20SDGs%20-%20Emerging%20Insights%20on%20Sutainability%2C%20Replicability%20%26%20Partnerships.pdf">DPGs have helped solve real problems</a>. But we know that open source alone is never a solution, and that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401205000393#aep-section-id27">it also requires institutional competency</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.12141">champions</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918301277">sustainable business models</a>. Without these, <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09593841211232677/full/html">open source software deployments commonly fail</a>. Open source systems also introduce new dependencies — for example on <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/automation/beware-systems-integrator-lock-in-open-source-dependency/d/d-id/754863">companies who integrate new open source technologies into existing systems</a>. In the Philippines, the government has advanced one of the most significant deployments of the open source digital identity platform MOSIP, one of the most developed DPIs — yet the contract for the integrator alone was just under $40m and is <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1514108/psa-eyes-national-id-listup-for-filipinos-abroad-after-may-2022-polls">a ‘crucial’ component</a> of the project. The contract is&nbsp;ongoing.</p><p>Design is key to inclusion: ensuring that DPI meet standards that reflect core values is key — especially around issues such as individual agency, inclusion and protection. We’re currently researching the implications of the design of the EU’s wallet initiatives for migrants, looking at where identity wallets have been implemented — such as <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/estonia-to-trial-mobile-id-app-based-on-ukraines-diia-409191/">Ukraine’s Diia,</a> <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1672385">Pakistan’s Pak Identity</a> or the <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">IFRC’s DIGID</a>. From the humanitarian context we know that many vulnerable populations such as migrants <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/document/digital-identity-analysis-humanitarian-sector">see little value in digital wallets</a>. But while design matters, we shouldn’t expect governments to become technology companies, developing all their own inhouse development capacity. Instead, governments need to be smart customers, with informed procurement practices.</p><p>2. Impact and risk assessment is key: in our research on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-identity-and-management-information-systems-for-humanitarian-and-social-protection-response-b1b25e5623a2">registration and identity systems and management and information systems in refugee and social protection</a>, it’s clear that many deployments lack assessment of impact. For example, while there are broad policy goals of linking humanitarian systems with social protection systems, there are <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal">widespread concerns about the transfer of vulnerable peoples’ personal data from humanitarian agencies to host governments</a>. While the humanitarian sector has established principles and approaches such as ‘do no harm’ to assess potential danger, there is a <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CWC-Managing-Digital-Risks-To-Refugee-Connectivity-Report.pdf">growing attention to the issue of ‘digital&nbsp;risk’</a>.</p><p>Due diligence and impact assessment tools are key. The UN has established <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/Blog_post_GNI_Blog.pdf">due diligence assessment tools</a> for assessing technology use across the organization. In our work on HR due diligence for tech investors, we developed an assessment tool to support technology investors consideration of rights in their decision making. Impact assessment is key to assessing the design and deployment of a specific system. To address other technologies, systems or wider path of digital transformation, a broader framework is required. A broader framework is also needed to ensure a sustainable, long term solution for countries who wish to manage the range of digital technologies in use within a sovereign jurisdiction.</p><p>3. Governance is the key to safeguarding, protection — and defining the values of digital transformation. A national set of rules of the road for digital technology under a sovereign jurisdiction can set the direction of digital transformation. This can include determining things like procurement rules to establish interoperable, transferable data formats, as well as wider principles such as civic participation, oversight and recourse. With the right rules in place a nation can benchmark systems against agreed standards and rules — and determine whether a particular system meets what we have decided are ‘good’ standards. What should a governance framework look like? Each country’s governance framework will be unique — though it’s important to recognise that its not about new laws/elements but ensuring existing laws are fit for the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>We’re currently working with UNDP to develop a model framework, and in our work so far key elements for this framework include: Legal framework; Capable institutions; Data Protection and Privacy; Policy and system design principles; Facilitating access to services; Procurement &amp; anti-corruption; Transparency and access to information; “Rights, Risk &amp; Inclusion” and Accountability.</p><p>The governance layer enables national sovereignty and interoperability: the governance layer sets out the rules of the digital railroad — ensuring that any digital transformation and technology can meet the goals of DPI. But like a railroad, standards determine whether trains can safely move from one country to another — or not. The governance layer can determine a country’s ability to interact with international partners — such as the digital governance heavyweights of the US, EU and&nbsp;China.</p><p>Governance is key to defining the private sector’s&nbsp;role:</p>  DPI is not just public or government owned tech — financial sector, data brokers and managers.  A sustainable national digital public infrastructure ecosystem requires private sector technology vendors, investors and innovators.  Getting the governance layer right — from data protection laws, procurement regulations and financial reporting — is key to ensuring that private actors and capital can be confident their role and interests will be protected.  <p>These governance frameworks have deeply value laden dimensions — consider the emphasis on individual rights in the EU’s suite of digital regulation (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">DMA</a>, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">DSA</a>, <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>) and on national socialism in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/13/china-spearheads-ai-regulation-after-playing-catchup-to-chatgdp">China’s AI Act</a>. All <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/117307/">technology systems, regulations and principles</a> reflect values and ideas about the goals that governance is intended to&nbsp;support.</p><p>DPI are technologies — and as such are neither good, nor bad — but never neutral. Governance is the key to determining the impact of digital public infrastructure, and the destination of the resulting digital transformation. Getting governance right will get the right digital transformation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/governing-digital-public-infrastructure-5cd1c985ed22">Governing Digital Public Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

           <p>Did you know that public blockchain technology will revolutionize supply chain management? From reducing costs to enhancing efficiency and boosting sustainability, the potential benefits are immense.</p>
<p>At UNISOT, we’re at the forefront of this transformation.</p>
<p>These are just 3 keyways the public blockchain can transform your supply chain. Let’s shape the future of Supply Chains together!</p>
<p><a href="https://unisot.com/request-a-demo/">Contact us</a> today to schedule a personalized demo and embark on a journey towards increased transparency, efficiency, and competitiveness.</p>
       Customers and End Users 
<p>With the public blockchain, customers and end users can be sure about the quality and authenticity of the products they want to buy. It keeps a record of all the important information about the products, such as quality control tests, certifications, and where they come from.</p>
<p>This means customers can easily track and verify the origin and journey of the products, ensuring they are genuine and not fake. Customers can now shop with confidence, knowing that they’re getting the real deal and not counterfeit products.</p>
       Suppliers and Producers 
<p>With public blockchain, suppliers and producers can easily track and trace their goods, raw materials, and components as they move through the supply chain. This gives them a clear view of where everything is at any given time. It helps them stay accountable and ensures that everything is running smoothly. Plus, blockchain’s <a href="https://unisot.com/global-inventory-management/">real-time inventory tracking feature</a> helps them manage their inventory more efficiently. They can now avoid running out of stock by knowing exactly when to restock and can reduce unnecessary costs and waste by keeping just the right amount of inventory on hand. In short, public blockchain helps suppliers and producers streamline their operations, save money, and improve overall sustainability and efficiency.</p>
       Logistics Providers 
<p>With public blockchain, logistic providers can have real-time tracking of their shipments, which means they always know where they are and when they’ll arrive. This helps avoid delays and plan routes more effectively. It makes logistics operations smoother and more efficient. Additionally, the public blockchain allows providers to securely share logistics data with others involved in the supply chain, like suppliers and customers. This means they can collaborate easily and directly, without relying on intermediaries. It simplifies communication and reduces costs. In a nutshell, the public blockchain helps improve logistics operations, save time, and work more seamlessly with other parties in the supply chain.</p>

<p>We’ve all had terrible login experiences. You sign into an app, only to realise you have to log in again to access another system on the same journey, and often supply personal data that you’ve already supplied. It’s frustrating, and doesn’t exactly create a positive impression of the brand – especially as sign up/login is right at the start of the user journey, setting the tone for the continued experience.</p>
<p>Clunky customer experiences lead to abandoned service sign ups, fewer returning users, fewer word of mouth recommendations, and – perhaps worst of all – security risks. When access to a service is complex, users tend to cut corners when it comes to credential management. For example, they may reuse a common password out of “credential fatigue” – a practice that risks data breaches when hackers try credential stuffing. Not to mention the security risks that come from internal workforce inefficiencies when managing several accounts/data silos per user.</p>
<p>It is a far more user friendly and secure experience for users when you offer one simple login to your organisation’s apps and services. The options within this area are varied, and will be tailored to your systems and requirements, but a great place to start is single sign-on (SSO).</p>
 One login with single sign-on (SSO) 
<p>Users want simplicity when it comes to access to your services. Single sign-on is key to achieving it. SSO lets your users log in once to authenticate to all permitted services and apps. This means that moving between different services is transparent, without the need to have multiple accounts and credentials, or input the same data multiple times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Single sign-on also means single sign-out. Once the user has logged out, or had their account revoked, you don’t need to worry about forgotten access/logged in sessions presenting a security risk.</p>
 Customising SSO 
<p>You might be thinking that SSO sounds simple enough, but what about your unique (sometimes complex) business requirements. Can SSO still simplify your user journey?</p>
<p>Perhaps you have some of your services based on external systems. In these cases, Federation allows single sign-on between two security domains, so you can still reap the benefits of SSO.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of your systems contain more sensitive data than others. You might want to have more assurance over the identity of the user for these areas – likely requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) – but without requiring this step for more basic services. A great solution to these cases is <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/what-is-step-up-authentication/" title="Step-up Authentication">Step-up Authentication</a> – still using SSO with your usual level of authentication, then asking for further verification only when the user is accessing the more sensitive system(s) or completing a higher risk transaction.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the same users accessing your systems in different contexts – e.g. as a private individual, but also in their work role. With the right identity solution, you can choose to authorise one account to have different permissions depending on the context in which they are accessing the account. For example, where a user may have permission to purchase something on their own behalf, they may not on behalf of their company. So, again, you can still take advantage of SSO and only requiring one account per user.</p>
 How to implement SSO 
<p>SSO is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) staple capability, and can usually be implemented quickly and easily – particularly when installed as part of a SaaS or hybrid cloud/on-premises IAM solution.</p>
<p>Many organisations who are looking to simplify their user journey get started with SSO from an IAM solution stack, which gives them the option to add on further functionality when required. For example, if the user base grows or needs become more complex later on, additional capabilities from the IAM solution stack may be added on. The key here is to choose a flexible solution that will evolve with your business.</p>

<p>In her CoD Summit 2023 presentation, Fission co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka discusses the need for location-independent compute, and how content addressing and open protocols are making it possible.</p> We're Living in a Server-Centric World <p>Since the invention of the LAMP stack in the '90s, we've been working with a server-centric model. It has led to developers specializing in front-end, back-end, DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and more. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become more difficult to train and maintain this complex system.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control the majority of data centers, which has led to further centralization. In places like South America, Central America, and Africa, the lack of compute infrastructure means that users in these areas have less access to resources.</p><p>IoT, compute over data, and LLMs cannot work long-term if we keep sending data to a small number of data centers. It's an overwhelming, massive amount of data. &nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring compute to where the data is produced, closer to the user.</p> Building a New Compute Stack <p>We know we need location-independent compute and data, but to do this in production, you first need location-independent auth.</p><p>A capability-based model like <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-ucan-decentralize-auth/">UCAN</a> removes the authorization server, simplifying permissions handling. We no longer need pristine APIs for everything and can pass around auth as necessary.</p><p>The direction and the layout of the requests become the flow of authority.</p><p>Not only is it more efficient and energy-saving, but it's also more resilient because there is no central server that can bring the rest of the network down if it goes offline.</p><p>Now that auth is handled, we can solve for location-independent compute.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> because you can write in any language you want, and it runs anywhere and deterministically. </p><p>When running a computation, we take arguments and apply them to a Wasm function.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The words “blockchain” and “energy” usually make uncomfortable reading as people think of the <a href="https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/05/04/cryptocurrency-energy/">outsized</a> energy and environmental costs that come with using cryptocurrencies; recently, however, blockchain technology is being seen — and being adopted — to do the opposite and drive sustainability in the energy industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a recent article in Finance Magnates <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/education-centre/the-use-of-blockchain-technology-in-the-energy-industry-to-promote-sustainability/">reports</a>, blockchain is driving sustainability initiatives “by improving energy traceability, facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading, streamlining supply chain management, and decentralizing energy infrastructure.”</p>
<p>It all makes for fascinating reading; but, we draw attention to it mostly because it’s a timely reminder that not all blockchain is crypto, and that distributed ledger technology can be used to do lots of beneficial things without using much energy at all, let alone draining the grid.</p>
<p>Simply put, the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x">energy intensive computation</a> required to validate bitcoin transactions — known as “proof of work”— is unique to that activity; other uses of a blockchain, such as to support verifiable credentials for decentralized identity, do not.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
 
 A distributed ledger for identity uses signatures rather than mathematical computation to generate proof. No complex mathematical processes are needed. You either accept the signature or you don’t. 
 A write to the ledger (and one write can be the basis for millions of identity credentials) or a look up on the ledger uses no more energy, and possibly less, than browsing a web page. 
 A decentralized network using a blockchain-based distributed ledger means you can use <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">Peer DIDs</a> to move most “transactions” and their cryptographic proofing off the ledger. As no personally identifying information is written to the public ledger identity blockchains don’t need to do any ledger transactions at all. 
 
<p>Although harder to quantify, the energy saved from using a technology that enables you to trust information is also something that should be taken into account. You can build seamless, frictionless processes to take advantage of data that can immediately be verified and acted upon. This is what is happening in the energy industry use cases described in the Finance Magnates article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this saves time and money and mitigates error and fraud. So remember, when you hear the word “blockchain,” it’s not just about bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give consumers a priceless asset: more time. Endless errands, work tasks and countless obligations big and small chip away at their free time and fill their schedules. Applying for a loan shouldn’t add to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To power a faster, better mortgage experience for consumers,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/tools-learning/loan-advisor/our-solutions/aim-asset-income-modeler">Freddie Mac’s Loan Product Advisor&nbsp;asset and income modeler (AIM)</a>&nbsp;continues to evolve, now including paystub data in addition to direct deposit data for income assessment. These cost-saving efficiencies provide increased rep and warrant coverage while continuing to meet Freddie Mac’s strong credit underwriting standards.</p>



 Open banking drives new mortgage capabilities 



<p>Using consumer-permissioned data from trusted third-party providers like Mastercard (with some services delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company), direct deposit plus paystub increases the confidence in income calculations by matching digitized paystub data to borrower direct deposit history sourced from trusted providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Service</a> (MVS)&nbsp;supports this new AIM capability by providing direct deposit transaction data paired with digitized paystub&nbsp;data to fuel this innovative, data-driven approach. It identifies&nbsp;the income stream that matches the paystub, delivering accurate risk assessment results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assets, income and employment verifications are vital to mortgage lenders looking to verify borrowers’ finances. However, between unreliable results, miscommunications and paperchases, verifying assets, employment and income can be cumbersome. MVS helps borrowers get faster approvals with fewer conditions up front, allowing them to close and move into their homes faster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer. This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”</p>Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships</blockquote>



<p>MVS can help lenders:&nbsp;</p>



 
 More easily assess borrower capacity/automate income calculations.&nbsp; 



 Reduce frustrations caused by paper submissions and re-asking for documentation to verify assets, income and employment.&nbsp; 



 Remove subjectivity and manual&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">errors in processing and underwriting</a>.&nbsp; 



 Lower risk and probability of fraudulent activity.&nbsp; 



 Increase referrals by providing a better borrower experience.&nbsp; 
 



 Efficient assessment&nbsp; 



<p>AIM leverages consumer-permissioned data from open banking providers like Mastercard to better identify pay deposits using accurate and verifiable data that meets Freddie Mac’s underwriting standards. Lenders can automate the manual processes of assessing borrower assets, income and employment. This can improve the success rates for identifying income and employment by reading information provided on a paystub and verifying income transactions within a borrower’s bank account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Partnering with Mastercard ensures we can deliver the best tools and insights the industry has to offer,” said Daniel Miller, Freddie Mac Single-Family Director of Strategic Technology Partnerships. “This collaboration will assist lenders with quickly and easily obtaining income verification.”&nbsp;</p>



 How it works&nbsp; 



<p>Previously, direct deposits to a consumer’s bank account would qualify for rep and warrant assessment. With enhanced direct deposit and paystub capabilities, a borrower or a loan officer can upload a paystub and the technology will match the data on that paystub with the deposits from the borrower’s asset report, boosting the rep and warranty success rates and income gross-up.</p>



<p>The asset report can include 24 months of direct deposit transactional history and also includes income streams identified by the open banking platform. Now, with the added paystub capability, Mastercard can add a paystub report that can provide greater success assessing income through direct deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paystub report generated through MVS has two sections; the top section includes digitized paystub information. The bottom section is up to 24 months of income stream credit transactions only. These income streams are reconciled with the deposits shown on the asset report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an added bonus, the reduced cost of implementing MVS is reflected directly in the balance sheet. On average,&nbsp;<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/docs/pdf/digital-innovation-drives-loan-quality.pdf">up to 7&nbsp;days</a>&nbsp;can be cut off the processing time for each loan. The hours formerly spent by loan officers chasing down borrower documents are invested in higher-return work activities such as marketing and sales to drive additional loans.&nbsp;The new AIM capability will be available to Freddie&nbsp;Mac-approved Sellers using Loan Product Advisor beginning June 7, 2023.&nbsp;MVS is available via direct integration and ecosystem integrations including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.simplenexus.com/">SimpleNexus</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com">ICE Technology</a>&nbsp;and Order Reports Service in the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/client-hub/">Client Hub</a>&nbsp;today. </p>

  <p>Over the last two years we’ve been sharing the progress on <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advances-in-azure-ad-resilience/ba-p/2147048">Azure AD’s resilience investments</a>, such as our 99.99% Service Level Agreement (SLA), our core resilience principles and architecture, and our differentiated resilience features like our automatic backup authentication service, regionally isolated authentication, and continuous access evaluation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your confidence in&nbsp; Azure AD as a mission-critical dependency for your applications and service. We also have heard how important transparency is to you in understanding how the service is built for resilience, as well as deeply understanding the actual realized resilience state of your own applications and services.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce two new ways that we’re enhancing our transparency into these resilience capabilities and furthering our resilience journey:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now see the actual SLA performance for your own tenant, in addition to the global SLA attainment for all tenants.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We’ve already been publishing the global SLA for Azure AD and details of how this is computed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-azure-ad-sla-performance">here</a>. This data set goes back to February 2021 and shows we’ve exceeded 4-nines' SLA for over 16 months running (as of June 2023).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, we’re pleased to extend this with a per-tenant SLA report that gives insight into the actual availability attained by your tenant. This is available as a public preview in both the Entra and Azure portals to all tenants with at least 5,000 monthly active users signing in, allowing administrators to see how their tenant is performing against the Azure AD SLA promise of 99.99% availability in authenticating users and issuing tokens. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We’ll continue to extend this transparency and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability as well as what would be most useful to you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here’s a screenshot of the per-tenant SLA view you can see in the Azure portal:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improvements to the backup auth system<br>We first introduced the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/advancing-service-resilience-in-azure-active-directory-with-its-backup-authentication-service/">Backup Auth System</a> in 2021.This system is designed to provide automatic and seamless protection for authentications to applications that integrate with Azure AD. These protections are part of a multi-layered resilience strategy and designed to kick in if all the other layers of resilience built into Azure AD fail. This is similar to how a UPS or generator may be connected to a critical facility to provide a backup to the power grid. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transparency into supported applications and authentication patterns&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup coverage is provided seamlessly to tens of thousands of applications based on protocol and scenario patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond Microsoft applications, many applications in the Azure AD app gallery, as well as the largest iOS and Android email clients, and ~30 thousand business applications receive incremental resilience from the backup authentication system.&nbsp;The availability of support is determined by the authentication protocols and patterns used by these applications. Some of the largest applications include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 ADP 
 Atlassian Cloud 
 AWS Single-Sign-on 
 GoToMeeting 
 Kronos 
 Marketo 
 Palo Alto Networks 
 SAP Cloud Identity 
 Trello 
 WorkdayZscaler, when configured using supported protocol patterns such as “SAML-IdP initiated.”&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re pleased to announce that today we’re launching a detailed documentation page we will regularly update that outlines the specific level of coverage the backup auth system provides with your applications. For more information about our specific levels of coverage, see “A<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/backup-authentication-system">zure AD’s Backup authenticaton system”</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to update this as we regularly raise coverage levels and would love your feedback on places you’d like to see us prioritize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supported user scenarios&nbsp;</p>
<p>During an outage, users will remain productive on their supported applications when: the user has authenticated with the same app and device within the last three days; the user is authenticating as a member of their home tenant and not a B2B user; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/resilience-defaults">resilience defaults</a> for that user authentication are enabled; and the user’s authentication has not been recently revoked or restricted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our experience to date with the Backup Auth System&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system has successfully mitigated instances where the primary service performance degraded and is continually serving authentication requests. A steady, randomly selected, small slice of requests from all organizations is redirected to the Backup Authentication System, resulting in millions of authentications successfully completed without impact to production services.&nbsp;Administrators can see examples of this by analyzing their Azure AD sign-in logs looking for records where the token issuer type is set to “Azure AD Backup Auth.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s next&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continually raise the bar on resilience, with enhancements across the authentication stack, and continue this series with regular updates and more information to help our customers better understand and take advantage of our investments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on the Backup Authentication System, we are targeting the following improvements for the next 12 to 18 months:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Coverage improvement for certain Microsoft applications using the Android OS. 
 Protection for web applications that use the SAML protocol configured as SP Initiated SSO – which will protect many more app galleries and line of business applications. 
 Backup system protection for non-Microsoft applications requesting OpenID Connect access tokens.&nbsp;

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us on new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity and I’m super happy to bring a former guest back, she is joining for the second time. One reason is that there has been released, super interesting results on her research. Especially in a vast country like Canada.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Joni Brennan. She is the president of the Digital I.D. and Authentication Council of Canada, DIACC. Building on more than 15 years of experience in identity and access management, innovation adoption and industry standards development. Joni helps the DIACC to fulfil its vision by delivering the resources needed to establish a digital identity ecosystem that accelerates the digital economy, grows Canada’s GDP and benefits all Canadians.</p>
<p>Joni builds diplomatic and impactful relationship and formalises strategic partnerships. She has participated in influential committees from organisations including SCC Data Governance Initiative, OECD, IEEE, OASIS, the ISO, among others.</p>
<p>Hello, Joni.</p>
<p>Joni Brennan: Hello, Oscar. Great to be back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, welcome back. Super nice having you. So again, we are here to talk about digital identity. Even though some of our listeners might have heard you before, I think four years back. Please tell us about yourself and this journey that you have to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Joni: Well, thank you so much for the invitation. In terms of my personal journey in the world of digital identity, I think it’s been just a bit over 20 years now, working in this space. And really starting in the, and all of this career, in the non-profit sector. Working with private sector and public sector, helping to develop standards and frameworks. Particularly focusing on risk management frameworks now, that help to contextualise the way that standards and open source have been implemented. To help to manage risks and help decision makers and adopters to make better decisions about which kinds of solutions they would like to adopt.</p>
<p>So, it certainly has been a journey moving from classic identity federation and single sign on now to web3 and distributed ecosystems. So, there are some things that have changed, but then there are also some core foundational concepts and thematics that have stayed the same. It’s great to be here to discuss the topics with you today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. As I said, one of the main reasons to discuss is that there is a very interesting report. Actually, I have it here in front of me, it’s the – title; Canadian Digital Identity Research 2022. Of course, I am sure it has taken a few years to gather and process all this information. It is a very nicely designed document and also many of those findings were like, ‘Wow’. Super interesting how things are going in Canada and I’m sure some of these findings will be similar in some other countries as well.</p>
<p>So, we’d like to hear more deeply a few of these findings and what we can learn. If we start telling us some of these key findings from this report.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, thanks so much. I find the research to be interesting as well. The research – we’ve developed four consecutive years now of research, and so the latest report is the data from 2022. So, some things that are interesting about that, as well, is that we began to perform this research; before COVID happened, during COVID, and now arguably, I would say post-COVID or the next phase. So, it’s been interesting to see both kind of how the space is developed and how people’s perceptions have developed over that period of time. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that we’ve done this research is that we found that in the Canadian ecosystem there wasn’t this kind of ‘perspectives research’. We spend a lot of time working together as practitioners, whether we’re working with policy, technology or business processes. We’re often speaking with practitioners that are in the space. So, to have the opportunity to better understand and quantify the perspectives of people, who may not be practitioners. Maybe they do understand the space, maybe a little bit, maybe not so much. So, to have the ability to have a better perspective on what people are thinking, about the work that we’re doing, this is very valuable. And of course, putting people at the centre of the work that we do is a priority. So having these perspectives is quite important.</p>
<p>Because we’ve done this research annually over the course of four years. What we have done as well as we’ve asked some questions each year to have baseline, to have trend lines. To know, how has the perception changed, year over year, over the course of four years? Or maybe that perception has not changed, maybe it’s stayed the same over the course of four years. So, we’ve seen that timeline. That’s been an interesting feature. And then each year we have also customised some of the questions. So that, we could ask the questions of the participants that were, maybe, more specific to what was happening in the world at that time. So, I think it’s a great opportunity to see what people are thinking, both at a point in time and in over time.</p>
<p>Now, how did we perform the research? Well, the research has been developed through a third-party research firm, so they manage the sample, the participation sample. To make sure that it has diversity and that it’s really asking questions to Canadians across our country, from one side to the other. As well as, we have two official languages in Canada, French and English, so as well as making sure both official languages have been consulted. So, we’ve had some regional findings as well, as we’ve gone forward.</p>
<p>With that, maybe I’ll share some of the key findings from the survey.</p>
<p>So, what I would say is that when we started this survey four years ago, this research. We asked people, first of all, do they understand the words ‘digital identity’? And I can say that for the first three years, people did not. Less than half felt that they had somewhat understanding of the words ‘digital identity’. So, without assistance, they could produce a kind of, a definition of digital identity. Now, last year, the fourth year of our research, for the first time, we’ve seen more than 50% feel that they have some understanding of digital identity without being assisted.</p>
<p>So, while the findings, I would say, are arguably low. Meaning less than 50% had some understanding for years, one, two and three. There is a sign that education, and knowledge, and awareness has been growing over each year. Now with just over half understanding. So, it’s a good trend line, meaning that education and awareness has grown. So, I think that’s interesting. It also helps us to know what kind of language we should be using when we’re speaking with people, what they might understand or where more education.</p>
<p>Now, this year we also saw in 2022, we also asked people what was their perception of the impact that digital identity could have on their lives. And I think positive news, the impact more than 55% of respondents felt that digital identity had a positive impact on their lives. And really, this was to manage records, to be able to have electronic boarding passes, things that were really around convenience and doing business anywhere and everywhere. So, this is great news. So, people feel that there is a positive impact, more than half.</p>
<p>Now, that said, 23% do remain unsure about the type of impact that digital identity has on their life. And so now we see that the 23% this is a group that we need to focus on. So, they don’t know if digital identity will help them or if it will harm them. So, there we see – okay, this is a place where we can educate that 23% on; What are the privacy impacts? What are the security impacts regarding digital identity? And how can that improve their lives for the better? So that’s a place to spend some time for education.</p>
<p>Now, the remainder felt that digital identity had a negative impact on their lives. And we do know, of course, people are free to have perceptions, positive, unsure, negative, as they so choose. But we do know as well in the Canadian ecosystem, there has been quite a bit of misinformation and disinformation, mal information. And primarily that type of information is moving in what I would call unauthenticated spaces. So, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, places where information can become viral and sometimes that information isn’t verified. Sometimes it’s being spread by mistake and sometimes it’s being spread with bad intent. So, we know that that’s been a challenge in the Canadian ecosystem and that maybe part of the group that feels a negative impact in their lives.</p>
<p>So, our focus will be on the 23%. To help them to better understand the space so that they can make better decisions about their perception of the type of impact that digital identity can have on their life.</p>
<p>Now, we have also seen, year over year, for four years, we’ve collected some demographic information about the types of people who are responding, and the types of people who are most interested, and feeling the benefits most, and most interested to use digital identity or most interested to also learn more about digital identity. And year over year, the people who are most interested and most looking forward to the benefits that digital identity brings are what we call the caretakers. So, the caretakers tend to be parents who are taking care of children alone or dependents in their home. So, this could also be senior caretakers. Whether they’re in the home or outside of the home. So, these are people who are taking care, really caregiving in all aspects of their life as well as taking care of themselves.</p>
<p>So, these people have the most interest to use digital identity to help to manage their care, so primarily tracking health care records and school and government registrations, for example. These are seen as the primary benefits. And these are the people who are most feeling pressure to manage data, to manage access to data, and really need that extra help, that these types of technologies can provide people. The conveniences and the security that can provide people in their life. These are the people that I think is a great area of focus for the work that we do. Caregivers are also workers. Caregivers are also students. And so, in all aspects of their life, they feel that this is something that can help.</p>
<p>In the Canadian ecosystem as well, we do have some, what I would call paradoxes. Meaning we do also each year, year over year, ask people their willingness to share personal information online if it makes their life more convenient. And what we’ve seen over time is there has been a slight rise in people’s willingness to share their personal information. And so, for example, in 2021, 75% were willing to share information, personal information for convenience. That went up to 78% in 2020 to be willing to share personal information if it meant that they would have more convenience in their lives.</p>
<p>Now, that said, again paradoxically. The same amount of people just around 75% between 73 and 75%, also having the highest concerns about personal information being compromised. So, yes, while people are willing to share information for their convenience. They’re equally concerned about their information being compromised through identity theft or through hacking and through other means. So, we need to be aware that people are both feeling the desire for convenience, but they’re also very concerned along the way.</p>
<p>So, when we think about that 23%, again, who are unsure about digital identity. We can help them to better understand where digital identity can help people to manage their information and get convenience while protecting themselves online. I would say that this is a paradox, but also something that we can help. And we can support by working together with more education.</p>
<p>Now, year over year, for four years, we have also asked people about their preferences regarding the way forward on digital identity. So, what we’ve asked them is basically three options. Would people prefer public sector and private sector to work together on a framework? On an approach, a collaborative approach of public sector and private sector. We’ve also asked them would they prefer government to move alone and take the lead? Or would they prefer private sector to move alone and take the lead?</p>
<p>And I can say that year over year and in fact, we’ve seen growth to 71% of respondents. They believe that collaboration is the best way forward of the public and private sector. And their thoughts on that for why is because they felt that public sector and private sector, by working together, would have more checks and balances on each other. To make sure that each was behaving with the best interests of the client, the customer, the citizen. They really like that collaborative approach, and that’s grown over time up to 71% in the last year.</p>
<p>Now, typically year over year, the people who prefer only government to take the lead or only private sector to take the lead has been a bit of a split. Tends to be around 17% wanting one or the other to go the pathway alone. And in this year, this last year we actually saw a little bit of a change in that research where, for the first time, the preference for public sector was private sector.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of a lower preference this last year for public sector to go alone. So, the finding was 12% prefer the government only to take the lead, with 17% preferring that private sector only take the lead. And I think this is actually – if people have reviewed the Edelman’s Trust Barometer and trust overall as a trend globally in the public. There does seem to be an erosion of trust in large institutions and in new technologies as well, we should say. So, seeing the trust in government a bit lower this last year, I think maps as well with the global trending lines that we’ve seen in the Edelman Trust Barometer research as well. So not entirely surprising and common with what we’ve seen around the world.</p>
<p>Now, unsurprisingly, we’ve also since as we started, we’ve done this research before COVID, during COVID and now post-COVID ecosystem. And while we were in the middle of the pandemic challenges, we asked people if the requirements of the pandemic made people feel that it was more important for them to have access to digital identity that was secure and trusted and privacy enhancing. And people felt absolutely, 66%/67%, over the two years that we asked that question. People thought; Yes, COVID was driving a need for that secure and privacy enhancing digital identity capabilities. So, of course, we think about working from home and social distancing, so people absolutely connected the benefits of digital identity with the things that we were going through at the time.</p>
<p>We also have asked some questions, and I’ll share actually what I think is one of my favourite findings right now. And then we’ll talk a little bit more about some specific capabilities. But I think for me my favourite finding over the last two years has been we asked people ‘do they want to have access to personal information that’s issued and collected about them by public sector and private sector, and do they want the ability to use that information?’ So, we’ve asked that question for two years now, and actually we’ve seen the highest numbers we’ve ever seen on our research over four years regarding this question.</p>
<p>And so, people responded overwhelmingly, 92%, that they want to know and have access to data that’s issued and collected by our federal government and by our provincial or jurisdictional governments in Canada. And so, what this says to me is that – while the words ‘digital identity’ are challenging for people to understand. What exactly does this mean? When we asked people, do they want personal data control and transparency right away without a lot of education, very high number, 92% want to have access control to personal data.</p>
<p>That was followed very closely by 87%. So, they want that same access and control, 87% of data that’s collected by the private sector. So, I think, again, right away, emotionally, people understand personal data control. It’s something they demand no matter what their background, their culture, their politics, their region. Everyone wants to have transparency and control to data about themselves. So, I think that’s just a fantastic finding. And rarely have we ever seen in fact, never have we seen numbers that high in our research.</p>
<p>Now, I share this finding because I think it very much sets up some specific capability finding around digital wallets, something that’s an emerging space. So, whether we’re thinking about the concept of the digital wallet or a trusted container of some sort. Over the last two years, we’ve asked questions specifically about digital wallets, concepts around digital wallet to work. There’s a degree of personal information sharing and personal information control that has to happen. So that’s why I wanted to set that up with that primary finding.</p>
<p>So, over the course of the last two years, we have seen the familiarity of the concept; What is a digital wallet? We’ve seen that rise. And so, the first year that we asked it was 54%. And it’s actually gone up to 59% in the last year of the research. So, people are understanding the concept of the digital wallet. What it is, what it means and why it’s important to them. When we’ve asked people about their use of digital wallets in 2021, we saw around 38% of people reported that they were using some kind of digital wallet and that rose to 41% in 2022, of respondents saying that they were actually using digital wallets.</p>
<p>And so, of those digital wallets, the highest usage recorded was of the Apple wallet. And so, in 2022, roughly a quarter, 24% were using the Apple wallet, with the remainder of the usages on wallets being spread, Samsung Pay was the next highest and then third-party wallet providers after that.</p>
<p>Why are people using digital wallets? They really like contactless payment, less clutter and less concerned about losing their cards, their plastic or physical cards. They feel that these are the benefits of using a digital wallet. So again, the setting up this ecosystem for personal data control. So, whether it’s the type of wallet that we might be familiar with, on the phone or some kind of trusted container or network. This all requires the ability to share information and to have data control. This is something that people are demanding without a lot of education.</p>
<p>So, all in all for the audience, I would say is – be aware that your customers and your clients, they may be challenged to understand, what those words ‘digital identity’ means. They may have different ideas. Among them, what the words ‘digital identity’ means. And so, there’s some education that can be done likely with your audience, and particularly for us, for our ecosystem. Again, we’re focusing on that 23% and really educating them about the privacy and the security protection that can be found, that can be achieved by using digital identity capabilities. And so that’s the place that will focus as we continue to move forward in our ecosystem in Canada.</p>
<p>And I think it’s reasonable to say that it’s probably a similar finding around the world. We might see some differences for countries that are a bit more advanced. But I do think we’re going to find some commonality, in each region around the world. And even within our customers, whether we’re thinking about their personal lives and their personal transactions. Or the way that they manage their data at work or at school. I think these findings are very valuable no matter what the lens or the ecosystem that we’re looking at.</p>
<p>So hopefully the audience will find that information helpful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, quite revealing many of the very useful facts that you have. Just share with us. Actually, one of the first one, the understanding or awareness of the concept itself of digital identity. Is quite revealing that you have evidence that it has grown. So people are understanding more. The concept is getting more familiar.</p>
<p>So, I don’t know how you ask them, but I guess you ask them to elaborate, right? So, you understand – ‘What is digital identity – and people have to elaborate in their own words.</p>
<p>Joni: We just ask them; What do you think digital identity is? So, we ask them to try to produce a definition that the research asked them. And then we measure, were they very confident, were they are able, with their definition, accurate. Or were they not confident and did they need some help? And so, at that point in the research, depending on their ability to answer the question about what they believe digital identity is. There would then be a degree of assistance. If they weren’t sure they’d be provided with a definition, so that they could then move forward in the rest of the research with a common understanding as they answered more questions going forward.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very well done. And the other thing you mentioned one paradox, so people are more willing to use the digital identity solutions, but at the same time, I’m more concerned about the privacy issues or protecting their data. So that’s also very interesting is good in old census because people are using more tools, but at the same time consciousness is increasing.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, I think for me at least, I think that this finding really is part of a call to action to say identity management practitioners who are working together to identify the risks, to mitigate the risks, to provide better solutions for citizens, clients, customers and residents. We really are responsible to move forward together in this space in a way that’s designed around people where benefits, managing their risks and their needs.</p>
<p>Because without the work that we’re doing, they’re going to take part anyway. Maybe they’re going to take pictures of their driver’s license or send me an email. And I know I have you’re not supposed to do this. But sometimes when you need to get what you need to get to on the other side of the transaction, you do what you have to do, right? So, I think we’ve all been there. So, I think this is a call to action for us to continue to work together to provide people with the option so that they can do what they need to do in a safe and secure way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. In Canada, there is a major public sector within Canada, actually there are two tiers of public sector, right? Provincial and the federal government. So, I understand that each of them makes their own solutions, and there is a private sector. So, there are like, let’s say three main developers, the creators of details in these solutions. Have you found solutions that were not properly designed and what was the effect of those?</p>
<p>Joni: In the Canadian ecosystem we do have jurisdictional governments. We have our federal government, which is a collaborative, all of us working together. And then we have provincial governments and territorial governments as well. Then of course as municipalities. So, we have the different layers of the governments and then we have the different private sector industries. And some of those industries are federally regulated like finance, and some are not.</p>
<p>So, what makes that space interesting as well is that when it comes to your legal instantiation for who you are, this is really spread out in Canada. And so, if you’re born in Canada, your legal instantiation for who you are is with your jurisdiction where you were born. If you immigrated to Canada, your legal route of your identity sits with the federal government.</p>
<p>So really the federal government is in fact a very large customer of digital credentials or digital verification. Unless you’ve immigrated. But if you’ve not emigrated like the majority of Canadians, then the federal government is a customer there to know who you are. So there does need to be a collaborative. And I would say that both in the public sector and in the private sector. It’s very important to focus on all of the element’s – trust and risk management, convenience of use. And if solutions are poorly designed, then it leaves people not happy with the experience and not trusting the experience.</p>
<p>So, whether we’re using a solution from public sector or private sector, it’s also very important to do the user testing and the alpha testing and the launch to see how were people experiencing the service? Were they able to produce the information that they needed to produce to take part in this service?</p>
<p>Because that user experience, we only have a small opportunity to create a delightful, secure experience with the people that are using the services. So poor design or in fact, it may be great design from a technical perspective. But without doing that user experience testing and finding that people’s – their emotion and how they felt while they were using the service wasn’t there. That can lead to a low adoption, low trust, and people will feel that and they will sense that and maybe they don’t come back to the solution again. Or maybe they feel, ‘oh, this was terrible’ and they tell other people.</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it can’t be stressed enough that as you’re designing, public and private sector, to really work with your small set of users to see; how are they experiencing the solution? In addition to, of course, the priorities. Making sure that it’s safe and secure and using data minimisation. And all of those techniques that we would want to use for privacy and have in service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes and related to that, and checking now the picture. We can see that they said the majority of Canadians believe that both government and private companies should work together to create a digital I.T framework. And I can see in the three years where this survey has been executed, it keeps growing. That’s the feeling of the public. That the collaboration needs to be strong. So how is that resonating with the ones who create the data services?</p>
<p>Joni: It is an interesting finding, right? And I do think it’s interesting to how people seem to hold the governments a little bit more accountable. The higher percent. So, 91-92%, they want that access to that data. I was in fact surprised that it’s a little bit lower expectation for the private sector. Around 87%, still close but a little bit lower.</p>
<p>And I think what that means is something that we all experience ourselves as well, where one person, no matter what, you know, in our lives, we Oscar is Oscar and Johnny as Johnny. Sometimes our person is work business, school, sometimes we’re a patient with our doctor. So, we have these different experiences within our lives. We are the centre of all of them. Us being at the centre is a priority to making sure that as we move through these different solutions and services, we are the constant. And we can then use data and present data as we’re moving through those contacts of the type of transaction that we’re trying to provide. And so, while let’s say for example, quite often we’re asked to show government issued ID.</p>
<p>Now, we know that we need to be able to authenticate, we need to have a verified identity and we need to be able to authenticate in a verified way to government to say, okay, this is data about us, and we want to use that data. Yes, but quite often we don’t log into government necessarily, maybe every day. Maybe if we’re at a certain phase in our life or a certain time of the year, yes, we do authenticate the government, but more often than not, we’re using that government issued data, that government issued credential to open a bank account or to go onto an aeroplane or check into a hotel.</p>
<p>So, the areas where the data about us that has different levels of verification, whether that’s our driver’s license, which for us is a provincial or territorial credential. Or a passport, which is a federal credential. Or maybe something like a verified address for the bank that we’ve been banking with over the last five or ten years.</p>
<p>Where becomes very interesting is, again, the constant in all of those equations is that there’s one person at the centre of them. And so having that collaborative, it’s very important to bridge the gap to not only are you, as a government, solving the primary use case, that is your most priority. Maybe it’s how do I authenticate the government or you as a bank are solving your use case. How do I authenticate you to access your financial information? Really, people need to traverse across both of those contexts and across many different contexts.</p>
<p>So, collaboration is the way forward and people do get that sense. And as you said that desire for collaboration has really grown over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay, excellent. So, you are having, say, perceiving that – I’m sure you talk very often with people from all the governments. Plus, people from the private sector then, in the country. So that’s something you are already perceiving.</p>
<p>Joni: Yeah, absolutely. And of course, each group of stakeholders. If it’s a good government or like finance or credit networks or other. Each group has their priority use cases. And one of the things that we look at in our ecosystem in the DIACC is what are those common use cases we’re most concerned with. Really, where those ecosystems work together. Where we’re using government issued credentials to open a bank account, for example. That’s a great use case because the financial institutions want to lower their Know Your Customer anti-money laundering costs. We bring these types of government credentials into a physical bank all the time. So how can people use those credentials digitally? And how can each party be sure that the right level of risk is managed? And that’s where we focus on DIACC.</p>
<p>So, for us, use cases that centre around Know Your Customer anti-money laundering, they’re very powerful use cases. There is a global framework on Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering, and this is a place where we always see collaboration between public and private sector is an important feature. That’s one of the areas where we see a lot of commonalities, for example. Not the only area, but definitely one of the areas where that commonality exists.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, this research is super fascinating indeed. I will ask you a final question, for all the business leaders that are listening to us now. What is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Joni: I would say that this research should be used as an additive tool. It’s all available. And so, if you’re an English speaker or a French speaker, it’s available in our website, DIACC.ca. I would also say that one of the things that we focus on within the DIACC. Because we are not developing the technical standards or the technical open-source code for the methodology for how to move forward. What we’ve developed is a very high level and prescriptive risk management framework. And so, one of the things that we see in our ecosystem is that; a single solution that is one size fits all doesn’t map to the ecosystem, really. Ecosystems are living things and sometimes there’s more security needed, sometimes less. There are different conditions. </p>
<p>So, I would say for one activity for people, business leaders who are listening today is to; try to evaluate your risk. Maybe you already have. Evaluate the types of risk that you have within your ecosystem. And then look at something like our Pan-Canadian Trust Framework or risk management framework to determine, be sure that you are managing the risks that need to be managed to ensure that there is a duty of care that is set out. How do your customers expect to be cared for? How do your partners expect to be cared for? When they’re interacting with a solution or service. And then make sure you’re mitigating those risks.</p>
<p>We provide one tool, The Pan-Canadian Trust Framework. As a tool to help people measure and make sure that they’re mitigating risks in a verifiable way. And this helps decision makers to then adopt solutions today, while looking forward to knowing where and how these solutions might interact. Should I interact with another ecosystem? Are they managing risk in the same way that I am?</p>
<p>Whereas the technical solution for; Do I need to transform this data model? The software engineers I have all the confidence and the software engineers to solve. How do we transform from one data model to another? And using tools like risk management frameworks, like the pan-Canadian trust framework. Can help you to know, should you be looking at how you interact with different sets of credentials or different solutions or different ecosystems?</p>
<p>So, know your risk, manage your risk. Do your duty to care for your customers, clients, citizens and residents. And the rest of the ecosystem will evolve as it does. And we’ll continue to work together to make sure that people are at the centre. Privacy is enhanced and that people have transparency and control in this evolving and emerging digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent and for our listeners, we’re going to put in the show notes, the links to this research. So you can find it from there, from the show notes. Thanks a lot, Joni, it was a really interesting conversation. So let us know how people can follow this conversation with you or find more information all the work you’re doing.</p>
<p>Joni: Thanks so much, Oscar. Yeah, it’s been a real pleasure. I’m so glad to be back. I really appreciate the work that you’re doing with this podcast, having very interesting and insightful conversations. For people who would like to continue the conversation with us.
