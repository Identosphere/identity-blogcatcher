<p>Businesses rely every day on various systems and pieces of equipment to keep their operations running smoothly. But all systems inevitably require upkeep. It could be intangible software, like an IT service network that has accumulated enough bugs to break an important feature, sending developers scrambling for a fix. Or it could be a piece of physical equipment, like an ice cream machine in a fast food restaurant with a broken o-ring.</p>



<p>Eventually, everything breaks down, from multi-site IT systems down to individual light bulbs. Unplanned downtime can have catastrophic consequences, and it’s up to facility maintenance engineers and technicians to plan ahead so that swift measures are taken to rectify a failure. The goal is to minimize downtime, reducing the costs associated with lost productivity, revenue or customer dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>Downtime can be minimized in many ways. For example, businesses can aim to reduce the amount of time it takes to repair a piece of equipment by having sufficient replacement parts accessible to technicians on-site. Or, they can observe repair processes to find faster ways to perform repairs or quicker ways to notify technicians. Even further, they can make investments in better-performing tools with longer lifespans to reduce the number of repairs needed.</p>



<p>But in order to understand how to improve the reliability of systems and components, we first must be able to measure their reliability. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mttr">Mean time to repair (MTTR)</a>—also known as mean time to recovery—and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mtbf">mean time between failures (MTBF)</a> are two failure metrics commonly used to measure the reliability of systems or products within the field of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/facilities-maintenance">facilities maintenance</a>. While these acronyms are related, they have different meanings and are used to answer different questions.</p>



<p>First, let’s review MTBF.&nbsp;</p>



 What is mean time between failures (MTBF)? 



<p>MTBF is a key performance indicator (KPI) that represents the average time between two consecutive failures of a system or product. MTBF is a measure of reliability, and it is commonly used in the context of warranties, maintenance planning and product development. Note that MTBF, which refers to repairable items, is not to be confused with the closely related term, mean time to failure, (MTTF), which refers to assets that are non-repairable and need to be replaced rather than repaired.</p>



<p>The MTBF calculation uses the following formula:</p>



<p>MTBF = Total operating time / Number of failures over a given period</p>



<p>So, for example, if a product is used for 1,000 hours and it fails 3 times during that period, the MTBF would be: 1000 hours / 3 failures = 333.3 hours</p>



<p>This means that on average, the product can be expected to fail after 333.3 hours of use.</p>



<p>MTBF is useful in determining the expected lifetime of a product and can help manufacturers plan for maintenance or replacement. However, it does not take into account how much time it takes to repair a product after it fails, which can be an important consideration in some applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s where MTTR comes in.&nbsp;</p>



 What is mean time to repair (MTTR)?&nbsp; 



<p>MTTR is the average time it takes to repair a system or product after it has failed. MTTR is used to measure the reliability of a system or product from a repair standpoint. MTTR typically includes the time it takes to notify maintenance teams, allow equipment to cool down for repair, fix the issue, reassemble any relevant equipment or systems and test before restarting production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of MTTR is to minimize the downtime caused by failures and reduce the costs associated with repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to calculate MTBF:</p>



<p>MTTR = Total downtime / Total number of failures over a specific time</p>



<p>For example, if over the last year, a system failed 5 times, resulting in 10 total hours of downtime (including repair time), the MTTR would be: 10 hours / 5 repairs = 2 hours</p>



<p>This means that on average, it takes two hours to repair the system after a failure occurs.</p>



<p>MTTR is useful in determining the efficiency of maintenance operations and can help identify areas where improvements can be made.&nbsp;</p>



 Differences between MTBF and MTTR 



<p>Mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) answer different questions and have different applications. MTBF and MTTR exist in a family of KPIs that include mean time to respond, mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to acknowledge (MTTA), among others.</p>



<p>MTBF is a measure of how long a system or product is expected to operate before it fails, and it is used to plan for maintenance or replacement. MTTR is a measure of how long it takes to repair a system or product after it fails, and it is used to minimize downtime and reduce repair costs.</p>



<p>MTBF does not take into account the period of time it takes to repair a product after it fails, while MTTR does not take into account the total time between failures.&nbsp;</p>



 How MTBF and MTTR work together 



<p>Across many use cases, both metrics may be used in tandem to get a more complete picture of the overall maintainability of a system or product. For example, in a manufacturing plant, MTBF might be used to determine the expected lifetime of a machine and plan for replacement, while MTTR might be used to optimize maintenance schedules for that machine and maximize total uptime. In the context of software development, MTBF might be used to measure the stability of a system and plan for updates or bug fixes, while MTTR might be used to optimize the development process and reduce the time it takes to fix issues.</p>



 Manage assets to improve MTBF and MTTR 



<p>Improving MTBF and MTTR to reduce downtime can be a complex process that involves identifying and addressing the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root causes</a> of system failures, optimizing maintenance operations and implementing improvements in design and manufacturing processes.</p>



<p>Today, large organizations use Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) to help them manage their maintenance processes. A CMMS typically offers features like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/work-order">work order</a> management, preventative maintenance scheduling, inventory management, asset management and reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Maximo is enterprise asset management software that includes comprehensive CMMS capabilities. Maximo is a single, integrated cloud-based platform that uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, IoT and analytics to optimize performance, extend the lifecycle of assets and reduce the costs of outages. A related tool, IBM Instana Observability, offers full-stack observability, with the goal of helping users optimize and democratize incident prevention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these products will give you the visibility into your assets and operations that you’ll need to make smarter, data-driven decisions, ultimately resulting in fewer breakdowns and less downtime.</p>

<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that provides organizations with scalability, security, availability and performance while keeping their IT infrastructure management needs at bay. It was launched in 2006 as the first AWS service and manages data as objects instead of a file hierarchy or blocks within sectors and tracks.</p>



<p>Amazon S3 provides management features to configure access controls that meet specific business, organizational and compliance requirements, making it customizable. However, AWS S3 does come with its own set of challenges, particularly when it comes to S3 pricing. As AWS S3 usage grows, so does the cost; managing AWS S3 pricing can be complex and frustrating, especially when you’re trying to optimize your business.</p>



 AWS S3 storage classes 



<p>There are a number of S3 storage classes available in AWS S3, including the following:</p>



 
 S3 Standard 



 S3 Intelligent-Tiering 



 S3 Standard-IA 



 S3 One Zone-IA 



 S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval 



 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval 



 3 Glacier Deep Archive 
 



<p>S3 storage classes are designed to cater to different storage use cases depending on how often the storage needs to be accessed and the level of redundancy required. These storage classes are not static and can be updated either manually or via a lifecycle policy. The S3 lifecycle policy allows data to automatically transfer to a different storage class without any changes to the application. However, with so many storage classes available (and each designed for a specific storage use case), it can become challenging to choose the right one and manage them cost-effectively.</p>



 
 S3 Standard: The S3 Standard is the AWS default and the most commonly used storage class, so it is designed for frequently accessed data. It has low latency, high throughput and is highly versatile, making it suitable for many applications. However, it is also the most expensive storage class per GB stored. 



 S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves data between frequent-access (FA) and infrequent-access (IA) tiers for cost optimization, making it ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It can seamlessly transfer data to the most cost-effective access tier on a per-object basis, without performance degradation, retrieval fees or operational complexity. 



 S3 Standard-I-A: Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access is a storage class suitable for long-term storage or backups of data that is accessed less frequently than data stored in S3 Standard (but still requires rapid access when needed). It is best for storing data that needs to be available quickly in case of disaster recovery. 



 S3 One Zone-I-A: Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access stores data in a single AWS Availability Zone, making it 20% cheaper than S3 Standard-IA. It’s ideal for users who don’t require the additional protection provided by geographic redundancy. However, it is important to note that it’s not designed to be resilient to the physical loss of an AZ due to a catastrophic event. 



 S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval: Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is the most cost-effective archive storage class for long-term data that is rarely accessed but requires quick retrieval. With cost savings of up to 68% compared to S3 Standard-IA when accessed once per quarter, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval offers the same high throughput and quick access as the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval is ideal for users seeking to save on storage costs without compromising fast retrieval times. 



 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval is a low-cost storage option for archive data that is accessed one to two times per year and is retrieved independently. It is similar in capabilities to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval but is up to 10% cheaper. This storage class is ideal for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as in backup or disaster recovery use cases. 



 S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive was designed for long-term retention and preservation of data that is infrequently accessed. It is commonly used for backup, disaster recovery, and regulatory compliance in highly regulated industries. This storage class is ideal for organizations that need to retain data sets for long periods of time without the need for regular access.

 IBM Turbonomic and AWS S3 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> can help organizations navigate the complexity of AWS storage options by providing guidance on how to select the right storage class. Our software can recommend which storage class is best for you based on the expected usage pattern and provide insights into the pricing structure of each class. By doing so, Turbonomic helps organizations avoid overprovisioning resources and overpaying on AWS S3 services, which ultimately leads to cost savings and improved efficiency.</p>



 Optimizing AWS S3 Pricing with Turbonomic 



<p>While AWS S3 storage seems to be remarkably inexpensive at the unit rate level, it’s not—like all cloud solutions it operates in a pay-as-you-go model. If you fail to consider the fully burdened cost of AWS S3 pricing, you could be left with a substantial bill. It’s crucial to understand how each AWS S3 storage class operates before committing to it.</p>



<p>The AWS S3 pricing structure is one of its biggest challenges because it’s complex and difficult to manage. The cost of storing data on Amazon S3 can vary and depends on factors like the amount of data stored, the number of requests made and the geographic region where the data is stored. It’s challenging for many organizations to accurately estimate AWS S3 costs and optimize their spending.</p>



<p>IBM Turbonomic can help manage AWS S3 pricing efficiently and effectively, allowing organizations to focus on innovation and growth. With IBM Turbonomic, organizations gain real-time insights into their AWS S3 usage and spending, allowing them to identify inefficiencies and make data-driven decisions to optimize their usage and costs.</p>

Through intelligent cost optimization, IBM Turbonomic analyzes your current usage patterns, performance requirements and cost data to determine the most cost-effective storage class for each workload.</p>



<p>Additionally, our software generates automatable actions that allow organizations to optimize resource allocation and utilization. IBM Turbonomic identifies any idle or underutilized storage and reclaims it for other workloads, ensuring you only pay for what you need. This allows you to avoid unnecessary spending.</p>



<p>While Amazon S3 is a powerful cloud storage service, its pricing can be complex and challenging to manage. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of Turbonomic, organizations can gain better visibility into their Amazon S3 usage and spending and optimize resource allocation and utilization to reduce costs and improve efficiency.</p>

 Recap of IDnow’s recent ‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar. 



 



<p>To coincide with crypto’s busy few days in April, when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> was finally <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">given the green light</a> by the European Parliament, we hosted a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/identity-verification-kyc-aml-requirements/">‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar</a>, exploring the likely ramifications of the regulatory framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by Jennifer Hanley Giersch at ALL AML GmbH, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank, and Peter Müller, Financial Crime Officer at UBS, along with our very own Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs and Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Watch highlights below:</p>



 



 

 



 MiCA: KYC and AML’s most important development for 2023? 



<p>The session strarted with predictions from the group as to what is likely to be the main driving force for developments in the KYC and AML space. Unsurprisingly, considering it was finally ratified by the EU in April, Rayissa touched upon the potential of MiCA.</p>



<p>“To harmonize regulations across an ecosystem is an ambitious project. The unification and transparency that is supposed to come out of MiCA is really important. One of those crucial steps is to enable KYC to do its job and foster trust in this ecosystem,” said Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>Jason agreed, explaining how MiCA would provide important guidelines that crypto exchanges and crypto entities would need to follow to ensure they do not run afoul of money laundering risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great development for the industry because with clarity brings the ability for obliged entities to do the right thing, and implement the right technologies, controls, and internal processes to meet MiCA’s requirements,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed during the session, including the larger upcoming European Commission’s legislative proposal known as the AML/CFT package.</p>



 When together is not always better.  



<p>While there was a general consensus that the combined EU approach to regulatory requirements and policy was a positive thing, Nico did warn that this is not always the case.&nbsp;He said that while a common financial market policy in the banking sector exists in the European Union, there is no common policy that translates into a common implementation of AML/ CFT rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This means that practices are divergent across countries, and this is to the benefit of those that don’t want to comply with the legislation, because the system from a European perspective is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank</blockquote>



<p>Nico went on to use the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20is%20a%20process%20that,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">Know Your Customer (KYC) process</a> as an example, and said that although there are common rules for the onboarding of clients, when it comes to effective controls, each member state does it differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed in the lively session, from the impact of regulations on unhosted wallets and decentralized ecosystems, to ways of changing the perception of crypto as an increasing risk for sources of wealth, the topic of KYC and MiCA was never far away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we are going to have a successful crypto hub – wherever that is, then we need to instil certain rules and regulations that enable a functioning and healthy ecosystem, and KYC will be integral part in facilitating this,” added Rayissa.</p>

<p>A global fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) enterprise needed to modernize its product portfolio, focusing on high-growth categories like pet care, coffee and consumer health. Its aggressive sustainability goals included achieving net zero emissions by 2050, making all packaging reusable or recyclable by 2025 and investing more than USD 3 billion globally over several years to drive momentum. Along the way, it needed to transform its organizational footprint, technology architecture and workplace culture—all sustainably.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting™ helped the customer modernize its architecture for a heavily used business-to-business conversational AI app. IBM’s recommendations included API-specific improvements, bot UX optimization, workflow optimization, DevOps microservices and design consideration, and best practices for Azure manage services. After getting familiar with the app architecture, priorities and requirements, IBM provided a detailed trade-offs analysis, including improvement options and security and cost implications.</p>



<p>The need to digitally transform touches every organization, in every industry. As a result, increasing numbers of organizations are migrating their information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures to the public cloud, shifting workloads from on-premises to remote data centers and modernizing their application estates. While this trend is driving growth in the global cloud market, it’s also drawing increased scrutiny to the environmental impacts of data centers.</p>



<p>Currently, data centers are a significant source of organizations’ energy usage and carbon emissions. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/it-sustainability">According to the IT Sustainability Beyond the Data Center report from the IBM Institute for Business Value, some estimates suggest that there has been a 43% absolute increase in the power capacity demand by data center operators between 2018 and 2021, and that the global data center market will grow by more than 30% between 2021 and 2027.</a> That’s why IBM is working with Microsoft to help organizations lower their ICT footprint through sustainable cloud modernization and full-lifecycle cloud carbon accounting.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/omv-ibm-consulting-sap/">Learn how an international leading oil and gas company is driving its goal of net zero operations by 2050</a>



 A framework for success based on a shared blueprint 



<p>With IBM Consulting and Microsoft Tools and Services, customers can leverage the core strengths and latest innovations of both organizations as they move forward with cloud modernization. Along with Azure-managed services to help streamline workloads across the enterprise, customers can use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard">Emissions Impact Dashboard</a>, a Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability solution, to search for ways to reduce emissions specifically related to their usage of Microsoft cloud services.</p>



<p>The dashboard aims to provide easy-to-understand data visualizations, report preparation and baseline accounting of their cloud-usage-based greenhouse gas emissions. The tool identifies carbon-intensive usage areas (or “hotspots”) and analyzes potential changes in emissions over time as enterprises migrate workloads and rearchitect applications. It can also help organizations plan for the future by forecasting how emissions may change as Microsoft moves forward with its mission to power operations through 100% renewable energy sources.</p>



<p>Based on IBM’s extensive modernization consulting knowledge, our professionals work with organizations to determine the best opportunities and target application architectures to deliver benefits throughout the entire application lifecycle. IBM’s modernization strategy starts with a solid understanding of business needs and the existing application landscape, including the precise number and function of apps and interdependencies.</p>



<p>Using both manual and automated tools to assess the landscape and operations, IBM Consulting guides enterprises as they map their modernization journeys. This includes outlining desired business outcomes, an implementation roadmap, target architecture, sustainability targets and outcomes, and required employee skillsets and business operating models. During the assessment, IBM will position 60+ cloud modernization design principles mapped to different Azure services based on different dispositions like rehost, replatform, refactor or rearchitect. Suggested services are aligned to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/">Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework</a>, a set of Green IT recommendations for optimizing Azure workloads that was developed in partnership with the Green Software Foundation.</p>



 Refactoring monolithic apps to microservices in Azure Kubernetes Service  



<p>Organizations are moving from traditional application development to cloud-native development (microservices) to help alleviate pain points like application inefficiency, high energy consumption when running monolithic (self-contained) apps on premises and fractured application ecosystems (as opposed to integrated environments enabled by cloud-native containers). Learn more about the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/cloud-native-apps/">benefits of cloud-native development</a>.</p>



<p>Approaching these challenges and achieving goals at the unique scale required for each organization requires both a modernization roadmap and a timeframe. In our engagements, we use benchmarking, templates, virtualization and detailed analysis of technical capacities (such as network latencies) to streamline the journey.</p>



<p>Eventually we recommend replacing physical servers or storage with managed Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) solutions to help reduce energy and resource consumption through centralized cloud governance aligned to the customer’s security principles.&nbsp;</p>



 Better together: IBM sustainability design principles with Azure-managed services 



<p>The beauty of modernization that targets common infrastructure attributes like reliability, scalability, usability and security is that these all may lead to environmental benefits. <a>For this modernization, IBM’s proposed sustainability design principles (such as cluster auto-scaling , serverless architecture for data sync from SAP workload to Conversational AI platform and chatty I/O antipatterns) and corresponding Azure services (such as Azure Kubernetes Services, Azure Function, </a><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/">Azure Resource Manager</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/database">Azure SQL Database</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db">Azure Cosmos DB</a>) can potentially help customers reduce carbon footprint and advance sustainability efforts by minimizing impact in many areas. These include:</p>



 
 Server- and application-related resource and energy usage 



 Latency and network congestion (saving energy by speeding response times) 



 Physical resource requirements 



 Maintenance overhead (saving resource and energy usage) 



 Manual errors that can necessitate repetitive operational overhead 



 Network and database loads (enabling smaller databases) 



 Resource-intensive duplication (speeding communication between dependent APIs) 



 Latency (improving efficiency at massive scale) 



 Development dependencies (freeing organizations to choose sustainable technology and granular scaling)&nbsp; 
 



 What else can be gained with cloud modernization? 



<p>Organizations that move forward with implementing strategies for sustainability capitalize on the operational, cost, resource utilization and competitive benefits of solution features like load-based “just in time” scaling, offerings of managed services like Azure, cloud data center proximity and database right-sizing through caching.</p>



<p>IBM Consulting’s “Green IT” framework and Microsoft Tools and Services for Sustainability work together to assess workloads, identify optimization levers that can help lower energy consumption and create an application modernization roadmap that enables you to achieve sustainability goals.</p>

<p>At IPFS Thing 2023, Engineer Blaine Cook presented his work on the Name Name System, a tool that could improve the discoverability of IPFS-hosted content.</p> What's in a Name? <p>Let's start with the basics. First, let's define what a name is and isn't. A name is public, globally unique, and verifiable. </p>  Public - viewable by everyone  Globally unique - cannot be duplicated  Verifiable - possible to prove control of the name using a DID. Examples of verifiable names include DNS hosts and domains, email addresses, social media handles, public keys, HTTP URLs, SSNs, and more.  <blockquote>"A DID is not a name, but all NNS names have at least one valid DID."</blockquote> What is NNS? <p>It is a way to map names to data securely.</p> How Does it Work? <p>Step 1: Select a did:method</p><p>This could be did:ens, did:DNS did:twitter, etc.</p><p>Step 2: Fetch the TXT record for your did:method and find the public key</p><p>Step 3: Input the name and DID data in the NNS form</p>  Name (the name you are assigning to the content)  Issuer (the DID)  Fact Type (DNS link, Mastodon server, etc.)  Fact Value (the pointer to that fact type)  <p>Step 4: Generate a UCAN out of that data</p>  DID for Private Key  UCAN  Signature  <p>Step 5: Store in NNS DHT (shown in Blaine's demo in the recording)</p><p>Step 6: Fetch the record(s) for the name from the DHT and use the data in the UCAN</p><p>Since a name is tied to a specific DID, and the DID is self-validating, there is no way to manipulate a name you don't have control over. We enable authentication (DID) and authorization (UCAN) in a distributed P2P system and create a DHT by storing the UCAN in NNS, thus opening up many exciting possibilities. &nbsp;</p> What Problems Does NNS Help Solve? <p>Discoverability - NNS helps users find other users' public keys without knowing the DID method they used to generate them. It also allows the user to find where another user shares content tied to that DID. </p><p>Encrypted Chat - NNS can be a mechanism for enabling encrypted communication</p><p>IPFS Search - If you want to know where someone's IPFS-hosted blog exists, finding it can be very difficult if you don't know the CID. NNS helps locate specific content by its name, which is much more human-readable and easier to remember.</p><p>Package Naming - Similar to IPFS Search, NNS makes locating specific Wasm code easier through package naming.</p> What is NNS Not? <p>It's not a petname system. Petnames don't cross connectivity or trust barriers. In a local-first future, we need names to help us continue working offline and ensure we interact with the person/data we intend.</p><p>It's not a way to prove ownership of a name (that's what the DIDs are for!). It helps you discover those proofs.</p><p>It's not a new namespace. </p><p>It's not guaranteed to be globally consistent.</p><p>It's not a blockchain.</p> Possibilities <p>It can bring together all existing standards in one place instead of trying to create a new standard.</p>XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">https://xkcd.com/927/</a><p>It could replace IPNS and DNSLink by improving latency and security. Yes, a decentralized DNS!</p><p>Currently, there are several ways to link DNS names to the decentralized web, but virtually no options link email, social handles, HTTP, etc.</p><p>We could enable permissionless usage of names that we don't own using NNS by signing a proof that we own an email address (for example) even if that email is from a centralized service that hasn't enabled interactions with some new decentralized service. </p> Next Steps <p>This work is in the beginning/experimental stages, and many questions still need to be answered. We also need to solve for latency and locality and ensure a degree of consistency. </p><p>Here's the recording of Blaine's presentation at IPFS Thing 2023.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about NNS, you can review the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/nns-the-name-name-system/3684">spec</a> and join our monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan?tk=I52b5p">UCAN community calls</a>. </p><p> </p>

These stricter regulations raise concerns about privacy rights and could increase costs for crypto service providers.  <p>Cryptocurrencies have surged onto the global stage, carving out a significant niche in an increasingly digital world. However, the rapid expansion of this relatively nascent market has also been accompanied by notable challenges.</p><p>The Group of Seven (G7), recognizing these challenges, is now pushing for improved oversight of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. And although this call to action has its share of potential benefits, it also underscores the complex realities of&nbsp;change.</p> A Significant Shift <p>The G7’s call for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to intensify its scrutiny signals a significant shift in global regulatory focus.</p><p>The FATF, an intergovernmental body known for setting global standards against illicit financial activities, currently only supervises transactions that go through crypto service providers. By extending this oversight to include peer-to-peer transactions, the G7 aims to cast a broader safety net over the global crypto landscape.</p><p>This proposition comes at a pivotal moment as digital currencies continue to gain traction worldwide, with regulators insisting that a robust regulatory framework is not just essential anymore — it’s imperative.</p><p>Authorities believe enhanced oversight could curb illicit activities, strengthen overall market confidence and security, spur trust among users and potential investors, and set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>More on the topic: G7’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p> The Flip&nbsp;Side <p>This regulatory coin involves striking a delicate balance between increased oversight and the sanctity of user privacy — a valued feature that has been central to the appeal of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While necessary for mitigating risks, regulations may impinge on the freedom and privacy that crypto users have come to appreciate.</p><p>Also, the increased costs for crypto service providers to adhere to new regulations could indirectly affect the users. While some view these potential costs as necessary for the sector’s evolution, others fear it could hamper innovation and growth in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Balancing these aspects — privacy, security, and cost — will be a crucial part of the regulatory evolution.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule — Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p> Final Note <p>While the G7 calls for enhanced oversight of individual cryptocurrency transactions is a significant step towards a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem, it is essential to tread carefully.</p><p>The crypto landscape is a complex and rapidly evolving one, and ensuring its sustainable growth requires a regulatory approach that considers all sides of the equation.</p><p>The crypto world is on the brink of significant changes, but with careful consideration and balance, these changes could pave the way for a brighter crypto&nbsp;future.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>This week Simon and David review the recent RSA Conference that occurred at the end of April over in San Francisco. From the generic meta-patterns at the conference covering themes such as collaboration, standards, multi-cloud and technology integration, through to more IAM focused conversations covering MFA, passkeys and authentication attacks. Are passkeys now here to stay? What will help adoption? Will attacks on passkeys start to increase along with usage rates? Will attacks against existing MFA forms including SIM swap, MFA fatigue and social engineering be a compelling event to improve adoption?</p>

<p>Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is a critical requirement for organizations. In the past we’ve talked about the need for CLM <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/05/the-speed-of-business-is-fast-is-your-pki-keeping-up/">due to CA sprawl and concerns around legacy PKI</a>, and it being a means to rein that in and centralize certificates across environments. We also know that the number of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/12/the-trend-continues-organizations-are-managing-and-issuing-more-certificates-than-ever/">machine identities are on the rise</a> and in addition to the sheer number of machine identities that need to be managed, they also bring complexities – such as short-life certificates – that make manual processes unsustainable.</p>
<p>While those are excellent reasons to invest in a proper CLM tool, let’s talk a bit more about the role of CLM in relation to overall IT strategy – like implementing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and preparing for post-quantum.</p>
<p>Zero Trust</p>
<p>Digital certificates provide identity to people and machines, such as mobile devices, virtual machines, and IoT devices. Those certificates need to be issued by a PKI/certificate authority, which will then be able to verify that thing and give it access, whether that’s allowing someone access to your network, or servers talking to one another.</p>
<p>The part where CLM comes in as an important component of your overall Zero Trust strategy is in making sure you have strong issuance protection for your certificates. Essentially making sure no rogue certificates get issued giving too much access or privilege. This same reasoning applies to the need for control at any stage in the lifecycle of a certificate, like revocation.</p>
<p>Going one step further, here’s how CLM helps enforce the principles of Zero Trust:</p>
 
 Verify Explicitly – Making sure the right certificate is provisioned to the correct endpoint/target 
 Least Privilege – Providing the right assurance and access/privilege, by picking the correct certificate and lifecycle controls to be able to issue and manage it 
 Assume Breach – The ability to contain an attack and limit the loss and damage by revoking certificates (incident response) 
 
<p>Post-Quantum </p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum preparedness, there is a looming <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">threat to existing cryptography</a>, which means organizations need to take steps today to prepare for the migration to quantum-safe cryptography. One of the first steps in that preparation is to have visibility into your cryptographic assets – from hardware and software to keys, certificates, and secrets.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways CLM can help:</p>
 
 Inventory. With robust discovery capabilities, CLM tools can help centralize the visibility of certificates across environments, from different certification authorities, so you know what credentials you have and where. 
 Identify Weak Cryptography. Is your cryptography up to date? Do you have hard-coded algorithms?<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/"> Are you crypto-agile</a>? The right tools can identity any risks you might have with your cryptography so you can remediate in advance of preparing for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
 Consolidation. Going back to a core use of CLM – reining in the CA sprawl – it can be a tool to help migrate and consolidate your PKI footprint, making the transition to PQC much easier. 
 Automation. With the growth in the number of certificates organizations are managing, and the complexities of IT landscapes, organizations are looking for automation. There’s too much to manage and it’s too great of a risk to not have, making it a necessity. Pairing that with the migration challenge of PQC, automation will be a key ingredient to successful implementations. 
 
<p>Whether for the practical reasons of ensuring you have visibility and control over your environments, or for the more strategic reasons of implementing Zero Trust and preparing for post-quantum, make sure you’re using the right CLM tool alongside your PKI to ensure a secure future.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Hamzat and I am an Ontology harbinger.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am a quiet and simple person in general. However, I get things done quickly when something piques my interest. My strength is my ability to work really well within a team. I like to have an impact on the success of my team, therefore, I work hard and contribute many of my own&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering before starting my career. My hobbies include reading, traveling, and going on adventures. If I could have a superpower, it would be to be positioned whereby I can do things that make me happy and support humanity each and every day without having to worry about financial implications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology as a harbinger in 2017 to help others to understand and contribute to the company’s vision and mission. My role is to provide support for Ontology’s English-speaking community members. This involves providing members with information on the Ontology project or assisting them with any questions they might have. I also run a procurement company (BitKong General Merchandise) aside from volunteering with Ontology.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has been well-funded from the start and devoid of any crypto drama. As a project, it places huge value on its community and acts on any community feedback related to the Ontology product offering. Ontology is wholly dedicated to building the most impactful thing for the crypto space — a framework for Decentralized Identity Management, and this is something that sets it apart as a Web3&nbsp;project.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Although I don’t have an active part in developing the Ontology project, I enjoy supporting the success of the project through my role. I contribute to building a community with a rich knowledge of the Ontology project, disseminating any information, and offering support to&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>I am very grateful for the time spent working with Ontology. While it has been a tough journey, it has sharpened my perception as an individual. Also, being able to provide support to other people, irrespective of their background, and being recognized for my efforts frequently, is very fulfilling for&nbsp;me.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about being able to contribute to the growth of the Ontology community and provide much-needed support to the ever-growing network of Ontology members. I have seen how Ontology has succeeded in recent years as a decentralized identity provider and how the project has grown steadily, so I am very excited to see how it&nbsp;expands.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I expect Ontology to be very successful in the next five years and to become a dominant force to contend with in the industry. I think it will outpace its competitors with its data privacy protection products and decentralized identity management tools, and thus, become a widely adopted Web3 project with a high price appreciation for its native&nbsp;token.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-hamzat-5f01a23ee227">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Hamzat</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We have had an amazing week with IBM clients, partners, and stakeholders at our annual Think® Conference in Orlando, Florida. For IBM, Think is a perfect time for us to connect, collaborate and help our clients and partners continue to forge ahead with digital transformation and innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we wrap up Think 2023, we’re excited to recap a few of the exciting new capabilities we are launching in our IT Automation portfolio.</p>



 Accelerating IT operations with IBM’s AIOps platform 



<p>Managing IT environments in today’s modern business landscape is a complex and challenging task, requiring IT operations teams to move from being reactive to predictive and proactive. Traditional approaches are no longer sufficient to ensure continuous availability, functionality and performance.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, IBM offers an AIOps platform that utilizes AI to enhance decision-making across infrastructure and operations personas by contextualizing large volumes of operational data.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-watson-aiops">IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps</a> is a comprehensive, self-hosted <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/aiops">AIOps</a> platform solution that provides central IT operations teams with a single pane of glass to view their managed IT environment. This platform utilizes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to aggregate data from various sources, detect and correlate incidents, and quickly drive incidents to resolution. IBM’s AIOps platform is designed to help businesses by augmenting, accelerating and automating incident resolution, while helping to foster collaboration across teams.</p>



<p>Further contributing to the value of our existing AIOps platform—alongside the Cloud Pak for AIOps—IBM is excited to announce the addition of our cloud-native SaaS solution, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/aiops-insights">IBM AIOps Insights</a>, set for general availability at the end of June 2023. This AI-powered solution is designed to streamline <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/what-is-incident-management">incident management</a> and increase uptime to help improve operational efficiency and reduce costs. With AIOps Insights, organizations can leverage AI and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> to automate end-to-end processes, transforming reactive IT operations into proactive and predictive operations that identify issues and anomalies before they occur.</p>



<p>AIOps Insights is a SaaS deployment option for incident management and remediation that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of an organization’s IT environment. Like IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps, it consolidates multiple tools and correlates resource status across silos, streamlining incident management, reducing incident costs and increasing availability. With AIOps Insights, organizations can connect and integrate cross-domain data—including infrastructure, network and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-performance-management">APM</a>—and visualize their entire IT environment with just a few clicks.</p>



<p>The platform dynamically generates a topology of an organization’s IT environment, adding new entities as they are detected. By correlating events and grouping them into incidents, AIOps Insights addresses noise and enables quick identification of incidents that may require more investigation. The platform also automatically suggests remediation actions. The platform then provides visibility of status updates as incidents are resolved.</p>



<p>IBM’s AIOps platform, including IBM Cloud Pak for AIOps and the new IBM AIOps Insights, empowers organizations to tap into the power of intelligent automation and streamline IT operations to help them achieve better business outcomes.</p>



 Better together with IBM Instana Observability and IBM Turbonomic 



<p>In today’s complex IT environments, lack of visibility is a major challenge. IT operations teams need to gain full-stack health and performance monitoring, which traditional monitoring tools may have lacked.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana Observability</a> provides comprehensive visibility into modern applications, services and environments through a technology-agnostic approach that continuously provides high-fidelity data. It is engineered to identify issues before they impact business operations and automatically deploys monitoring in over 250 different applications, microservices and software infrastructure components across hybrid and multicloud environments. Instana is designed to deliver quick-time-to-value while keeping up with dynamic complexities.</p>



<p>In addition to comprehensive visibility, organizations need to detect performance issues and eliminate waste caused by over-provisioning. Enterprises need to shift from reactive to dynamic and continuous resource allocation for optimal, cost-effective utilization.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074478118701&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwu-KiBhCsARIsAPztUF2LocAwBI6MRcQ_rxVavdxDJuR6XdhEP94h9N5huBdDgN-nxlebf8saAqU8EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Turbonomic</a> is an AI- and automation-driven solution that dynamically allocates resources based on performance analysis and AI-driven recommendations. It supports application performance while helping clients address their compliance requirements, reduce cloud and infrastructure spending, and give more time back to engineering teams.</p>



<p>Ultimately, IBM Instana delivers <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">real-time observability</a>, while Turbonomic helps support application performance. While each of these solutions are incredibly powerful alone, they are even more valuable together.</p>



<p>That is why IBM is very excited to introduce the integration of IBM Instana Observability and IBM Turbonomic, available June 2023. Together, the integrated solutions offer comprehensive visibility and control of IT environments, enabling organizations to leverage real-time monitoring data for dynamic resource allocation decisions and AI-driven recommendations for optimal performance and cost reduction. The combination empowers organizations to optimize performance, address costs and streamline IT operations by tapping into the power of intelligent automation solutions to deliver business results.</p>



 Let’s continue the conversation 



<p>Today’s business landscape is constantly evolving, and there is a critical need to optimize IT operations. IBM is committed to working with our clients to continue to streamline IT operations by accelerating the adoption of intelligent automation solutions.</p>

				  With growing interest in decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, it’s easy to think that they are something only big business or nation states can use. But even the smallest businesses can benefit from this technology. So the question we will answer: What can verifiable credentials do for you if, say, you have a small business?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Let’s start with a few of the problems that all businesses face: employee and access management, engaging customers, and payroll. While larger organizations can have entire teams dedicated to each of these tasks, leaner businesses — such as a single location — might have a small number of people trying to manage everything; this is where verifiable credentials can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s break down exactly how for each business problem.</p>
<p>Employee and Access Management</p>
<p>Employees at any business need to be allowed access to certain things to do their job properly, such as&nbsp; interacting with the suppliers to procure ingredients, or a manager or team lead may need to set the schedule and hours for other employees. By providing everyone a credential it becomes easy to grant these permissions, and for the employees to be able to share that they are authorized by their employer to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>Creating these different levels of access is super easy to set up, it can be as simple as checkboxes — employee X can access suppliers, while employee Z is new, and can only access the time clock to clock in and out. Should an employee leave, removing their access, business-wide, is as simple as revoking their credential: no more need for changing passwords or getting their keys back.</p>
<p>All of this can be coordinated without the complexity and expense of creating direct integrations with external databases. Some of this vision is far reaching (such as lock access via credentials), but some of this (such as employee software access via credentials) is quite real today.</p>
<p>Engaging Customers</p>
<p>Customers are the lifeforce for any business; so, you need to do your best to keep them.This means building relationships, online and in person — and this is where verifiable credentials shine. They enable you to create a trusted digital relationship that enhances the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to build a trusted relationship by enabling direct, semantically described, privacy-preserving, and secure communication with your customers. This is not the same as sending your customer an email or text message and he or she sending one back. This is direct communication that is solely between you and your customer, by consent, and managed through a digital wallet.</p>
 
 Secure verification
 
 Customers can verify they are dealing with a business representative and workers can verify customers. This would be critical for any home medical provider. 
 The Agent software can detect when a customer is approaching and verify the customer and their order. 
 
 
 Secure messaging
 
 A customer can ask business or restaurant for today’s business hours, and where exactly it is, the special offers (if any), and the method of payments they accept. 
 The restaurant can alert a customer that their order is ready, the customer doesn’t need to stay within earshot or sight, and the business saves the cost of a specialized solution. This also prevents the need to share private data, such as a phone number, to receive the notification. 
 
 
 Enhanced data handling
 
 The business can save customer order history on the customer’s device with the customer’s permission, allowing the customer to share their preferences on a subsequent visit if they want to order their “usual.” 
 Data is saved on the customer side, so there is no need for the business to store customer data and manage data privacy compliance. 
 
 
 Balanced power
 
 Customers have full control over the connection with the business; they don’t need to unsubscribe or ask to be taken off a list. 
 Businesses benefit via simple customer relationships that are both powerful and regulation compliant. 
 
 
 
<p>The customer can interact with the business knowing that their personal data is not being stored or their behavior tracked, and they have consent over how they engage with the business. Loyalty programs built with this technology contain significant advantages over traditional solutions.</p>
<p>Payroll and Timekeeping</p>
<p>Tracking hours and payroll&nbsp; is a huge part of running any business. Verifiable credentials provide a secure way for everyone to clock in and out&nbsp; and automated payroll. By using an employee credential, no one else will be able to clock in for another employee if they are running late, or be able to see when anyone else clocked in unless they have access to that data, providing the business with a more accurate look at employee hours.</p>
<p>Easier than you think</p>
<p>Finally, if you take nothing else away from this article, we hope that you understand that none of this has to be complicated or particularly expensive. Whether you see your business as big or small, verifiable credentials offer a way to streamline several different aspects of your operations and make your life easier.

<p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS brought the banking industry into the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165274305/the-fed-raises-interest-rates-again-despite-the-stress-hitting-the-banking-syste">global spotlight</a>. The banking sector has been in a state of uncertainty after California regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank in the largest U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banks-face-scrutiny-fed-rate-decision-looms-2023-03-22/">bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis</a>.&nbsp;The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-03-17/tabbush-report-founder-reacts-to-recent-bank-turmoil-video">has delivered</a> a small rate hike amid global banking tension.</p>
<p>There are many factors that could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, when interest rates started sharply rising last year, and depositors demanded their deposits, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail">the bank was forced to sell</a> U.S. Treasury bonds at a loss. Amid this environment, it is more important than ever for banks to project an image of calm, stability, and transparency to their customers.</p>
<p>Since the invention of instant payment card issuance in the mid-2000s, it has quickly become a top priority for banks and credit unions as it provides convenience and a better experience for customers and members. We saw it become a top priority first through a dramatic increase in the use of instant issuance for getting chipped cards quickly into the hands of cardholders during the transition to EMV, and then through persistent availability of instantly issued cards through the COVID-19 pandemic via drive-up, drive-thru, and self-service terminals.</p>
<p>However, recent macroeconomic impacts in the retail banking sector have heightened consumers’ awareness of who they use as their primary banking institution, making it even more critical for financial institutions to differentiate themselves and prove their commitment to their clients and the broader community.</p>
<p>Instant card issuance allows cardholders to receive their debit or credit card from a local branch or interactive teller machine in minutes – the moment they open their account or are in need of a new card. These instantly issued cards are activated, personalized, and permanent. This quick and easy process can enhance the customer experience and improve customer loyalty, affinity, and likelihood to become a brand ambassador. By offering instant card issuance, banks and credit unions can demonstrate their commitment to their clients by providing a convenient and efficient service that meets their needs. This can help build trust and confidence in the institution, which is particularly important as consumers have more options for banking than ever before.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating commitment to cardholders, instant card issuance can also help banks compete with fintech startups and other financial institutions. These players are known for their agility and ability to quickly respond to customer needs, which has driven traditional banking models to leverage a unique differentiator: their physical footprint in the community. Instant card issuance allows financial institutions to offer a similar level of speed and convenience but through an in-person relationship-building event.</p>
<p>As we move through 2023, instant card issuance will become more important than ever before as banks and credit unions are looking to demonstrate their commitment to their community, differentiate themselves in a competitive market, and enhance the customer and member experience.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) recently published a working paper on May 8th, 2023, diving into the complex world of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on the economy. The paper, titled “CBDC and business cycle dynamics in a New Monetarist New Keynesian model,” provides a deep-dive into the intricacies of an economy intertwined with CBDCs.</p>



<p>To embark on this exploration, the authors of the study ingeniously integrate a New Monetarist-type decentralized market into a New Keynesian model with financial frictions. This hybrid model, featuring a centralised market (CM) and a decentralised market (DM), helps to simulate the potential impact of an interest-bearing CBDC on the economic landscape.</p>



<p>The centralised market (CM) in the model encapsulates the New Keynesian dynamics, introducing familiar frictions such as monopolistic competition among retail goods producers and Calvo-type sticky prices, which allow for real effects of monetary policy. In addition, the model includes investment adjustment costs for intermediate goods-producing firms and a unique incentive constraint for bankers, leading to frictions in the bank intermediation process.</p>



<p>In contrast, the decentralised market (DM) is a monetary search model, providing a platform for CBDCs and bank deposits to function as a medium of exchange. Here, households receive a preference shock at the beginning of the DM, determining their roles as sellers or buyers, creating a double-coincidence-of-wants problem.</p>



<p>The study shows that the introduction of an interest-bearing CBDC can help stabilize the liquidity premium. This can influence bank funding conditions and the opportunity costs of money, potentially smoothing the reaction of investment and consumption to macroeconomic shocks.</p>



<p>An increase in CBDC supply, which leads to a decrease in the liquidity premium, can boost consumption, output, and inflation. The study underlines the pivotal role of the central bank’s adjustments to the CBDC supply in response to changes in the liquidity premium in shaping the dynamic impact of the CBDC on the economy.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that the existence of a CBDC does not significantly alter the model’s responses to typical macroeconomic shocks. Instead, it tends to dampen and smooth their transmission to core variables such as output and inflation.</p>



<p>By integrating the New Monetarist decentralised transactions with the New Keynesian business cycle dynamics, this research provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate the properties and impacts of CBDCs.</p>



<p>The implications of this study are profound, casting light on how CBDCs could affect monetary policy, financial stability, and the broader role of digital currencies in our economic systems. As central banks worldwide continue to explore the potential of CBDCs, this research presents a crucial step towards understanding the multifaceted effects of these digital currencies.</p>

<p>This week, we’re thrilled to bring together thousands of IBM clients, partners, business leaders and stakeholders at our annual <a href="https://www.ibm.com/events/think/">Think® Conference</a> being held in Orlando, Florida. For IBM, Think is all about how we support organizations in their digital transformation and help them compete in their markets via the use of technological innovation. There’s a great deal of uncertainty throughout the business world, but we believe IBM Think offers a moment for our collective industries to come together and discuss solutions.</p>



<p>As you’ve heard IBM CEO Arvind Krishna share many times, IBM is a hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence company. Today, we are witness to one of those rare moments in history—the rise of an innovative technology with the potential to radically transform business and society forever. That technology, of course, is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. So, how do we at IBM continue to provide technological solutions that tap into the power of artificial intelligence and leverage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a>, all while bolstering human ambition for collaboration, creativity and innovation?</p>



<p>Ultimately, we believe the answer lies in the power of augmenting our own human intelligence. Empowering the desire for efficiency with the spirit of innovation and employing the technology to help organizations maximize their potential—all while applying <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-ethics">AI ethics</a>, which is a field of methods and practices that determines how we create and use AI and AI systems.</p>



<p>Today, you’re seeing business and IT leaders turning to automation to improve operational efficiency, employee productivity, customer satisfaction and, ultimately, business performance. But getting the most out of your automation initiatives requires the right focus, with a comprehensive vision and an experienced team to drive continuous value creation throughout your organization to help achieve your goal—more engaged, productive people focused on work that truly matters.</p>



<p>By working together to achieve new levels of performance, a client experienced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/td-ameritrade/">a 70% reduction in the time required to open a new account</a>. Another client saw a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/blueshore-financial/">250% increase in transactions</a> lending volume over three years. The potential to realize up to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/JEWOV1BM">470% ROI over three years is possible</a>.</p>



<p>As we enjoy IBM Think 2023, I’m excited to share a litany of new updates to our business, products and solutions that we believe will help organizations better identify and execute high-impact automations across business and IT to arrive at stronger business outcomes.</p>



 Putting events to work with IBM Event Automation 



<p>With today’s relentless work pace and constantly shifting customer needs and market dynamics, thousands of business events flow through your organization every day. These events can provide valuable information about what’s happening across your business; however, they may remain siloed and locked away in various data sources.</p>



<p>Imagine if your business tapped into these ongoing streams of information, connected the dots between disparate events and could detect new trends, customer issues or competitive threats. This could enable your business to offer new products or services, increase customer satisfaction or simply improve today’s operations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/accelerate-your-speed-of-business-with-ibm-event-automation">Introducing IBM Event Automation</a>, a solution designed to put events to work by enabling both business and IT users to detect situations in real time, act on them and trigger automations. With event distribution, discovery and processing in an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, IBM Event Automation provides a composable approach to accelerate your event-driven journey.</p>



<p>Whether your organization operates in retail, banking and financial services, travel and transportation, or healthcare, IBM Event Automation offers you the ability to remain aware of what’s happening across your business, so you can become more responsive to customers and resilient in the face of shifting market dynamics.</p>

 Digital labor: A new approach to work 



<p>With employees cycling through many apps multiple times per day, organizations continue to seek ways in which they can boost employee productivity while still fostering a climate of innovation and creativity. At IBM, we believe organizations can boost productivity by embracing digital labor solutions. There are three entry points for using AI and automation to help individuals free up time to focus on higher-value work:</p>



 
 Employee productivity: Automate processes and individual tasks, and create space to work on more complex problems. 



 Customer care: Empower businesses to create personalized, unified and outcome-oriented experiences for their customers. 



 Employee empowerment: Give employees the information and insights that they need to deliver fast outcomes and more informed decisions. 
 



<p>The question now becomes how do we move from how much we work to how well we work with the help of digital labor?&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-watson-orchestrate-unlocking-new-levels-productivity-for-every-employee">Introducing IBM Watson Orchestrate Enterprise Edition</a>, a cloud-based enterprise platform that helps organizations empower their workforce to streamline repetitive tasks.</p>



<p>With the goal of freeing up an employee’s time to focus on higher-value projects, Watson Orchestrate doesn’t require you to become an expert in enterprise business processes, policies and application logins to do your job. IBM Watson Orchestrate will work alongside you, understand you, guide you and learn from you as you do your work.</p>



<p>Customers can now use over 30 new pre-built/pre-trained skills for SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM and Workday. Where more are needed, foundation models within Watson Orchestrate can be used to import existing automations and turn them into skills in minutes. The software’s new digression capability gives Watson the ability to multi-task, allowing users to make multiple requests at the same time.</p>



<p>Additionally, we’ve expanded our partnership with clients to further embed AI and hybrid cloud solutions into their HR transformation services through a new set of Watson Orchestrate skills. In the future, with Watson’s generative models, our vision is for users to be able to create personalized automations using natural language.</p>



<p>I’m also excited to share that later this year we’ll be unveiling <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-code-assistant">IBM Watson Code Assistant</a>*, an innovative solution that helps developers write code with AI-generated recommendations. Powered by IBM watsonx.ai foundation models, Watson Code Assistant is designed to help developers of all experience levels scale the learning curve by providing recommended code based on natural language inputs. I’m excited about this solution because it will help address the growing IT automation skills gap by making hybrid cloud code development more accessible to IT professionals and help those experienced with automation code to be more productive.</p>

 Accelerating IT operations with AIOps 



<p>Businesses need to support continuous availability, functionality and performance across their IT environments. Traditional approaches to managing IT often can’t keep up with the demands of modern business. IT operations teams must stay one step ahead of end-user issues, moving from being reactive to predictive and proactive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why I am delighted to announce the upcoming release of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/products/aiops-insights">IBM AIOps Insights</a> this quarter—a robust, AI-powered solution that aims to streamline IT operations, increase uptime, improve efficiency and reduce costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cloud-native event and incident management solution will offer central IT operations teams a comprehensive view of their managed IT environment in a single pane of glass. AIOps Insights uses intelligent automation and AI to aggregate data from various sources, correlate related incidents and help teams to effectively detect and remediate incidents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While streamlining incident management with the aggregation and consolidation of multiple tools, AIOps Insights is also designed to foster collaboration across teams and accelerate the incident resolution process by eliminating war rooms and addressing silos across tools and processes.</p>



<p>For IBM, this represents another way that we’re empowering organizations to tap into the power of intelligent automation solutions and streamline IT operations.</p>



 Let’s continue the conversation 



<p>In today’s business landscape, we have a digital workforce that’s constantly evolving, and the need to optimize IT and business operations is imperative. IBM is committed to being the catalyst to help organizations accelerate their adoption of intelligent automation solutions.</p>



<p>We hope you enjoy the programming and continued innovation coming out of IBM Think this week and look forward to continuing the conversation.</p>

<p><br><a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a> is a no-code, self-sovereign identity platform that facilitates the orchestration of trust tasks. We’re all very familiar with digital credentialing trust tasks such as issuing a credential or verifying a presentation proof. However, Orbit Enterprise supports other trust tasks, including secure messaging and <a href="https://northernblock.io/feature-showcase-6-aries-credential-issuance-orchestration/">negotiations</a>.</p>
<p>Our recent 0.6.10 Orbit Enterprise release includes a Trust Decision Helper module which allows for an additional trust task called “ask a trust registry” to be used alongside others. Not only do we facilitate the lookup of trust registries when a party is looking to make a trust decision, but we’ve also implemented options that leverage the DNS zone of a party you may be interacting with.</p>
<p>Here is some additional details from the release notes that capture the module being applied towards a holder receiving a credential offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in better understanding why we’re leveraging DNS in this flow, we recently wrote a <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">blog post</a> which covers the use case in much more detail.</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we show how an organization being offered a credential can use the issuer’s DNS information, which has been put into their DID document, to validate that the owner of the DID also has ownership of a specific domain name. Additionally, they can use pointers in the domain name system to discover trust registries that could facilitate trust decisions to be made.</p>
  
			
		
<p>We hope you find this demonstration useful and thought-provoking. Please get in touch with us if you’re looking to do any work in the intersection of credential exchange and trust registries. As we continue to work on more trust registry enhancements and features, we would love to collaborate with different community members.</p>

<p>The future belongs to those leaders willing to make bold, informed bets today. To take action, business leaders need the foresight to peer around the corner—and take decisive action based on what they see.</p>



<p>Today, we launched a new IBM Consulting report, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets">Seven Bets</a>, that identifies major trends we expect to shape the world in the near future, and the strategic bets leaders should make to benefit from them and redefine their business.</p>



<p></p> 



 Trend: Tech-led disruptions are accelerating, driven by generative AI 



 Bet: Implement secure, AI-first intelligent workflows to run their enterprise 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">Generative AI</a> has captured the world’s imagination and democratized AI in every aspect of society and business, from supply chains and IT operations to customer service and HR. Cybersecurity costs continue to grow, as do regulation and governance requirements. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">Quantum computing</a> is quickly approaching the ability to break public key encryptions, but also introducing the possibility to solve complex problems that classical computers cannot. </p>



<p>In order to capitalize on these disruptions, organizations should bet on implementing secure, AI-first intelligent workflows to run their enterprise. Getting the most from these disruptions will require moving from AI as an “add-on” to embedding it at the strategic core of your enterprise and accelerating the transition to a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust security</a> strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Experience matters more than we think 



 Bet: Apply design leadership to change every aspect of the business 



<p>In today’s digital-first world, great experience is essential to cultivating passionate and loyal customers and employees. Putting the end user at the center is key to creating a positive experience. It’s important that organizations apply technology to deliver ease and value, and cultivate trust, among their customers. </p>



<p>To do that, they must <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/approach/design-thinking/">apply design leadership</a> to change every aspect of their business. This means understanding their customers’ motivations and behaviors, incorporating user-focused design early on, and ensuring it’s included in every stage of development. Digital products gain more value when they are combined with a high-quality experience. By integrating creative and technology teams, businesses can improve how products look and work, and, ultimately, boost performance.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Reglobalization, reskilling, and new partnerships are transforming value chains 



 Bet: Simplify, digitize, and partner to build resilient enterprises 



<p>Leaders are under intense pressure to drive productivity while also navigating supply chain disruption, geopolitical change, the global skills gap and more. In this time of challenge and change, leaders must simplify, digitize, and partner to build resilient enterprises. This includes applying AI and automation technologies to simplify and streamline operating models and processes, providing skills-sharing platforms that will allow talent to flow to most productive jobs, and doubling-down on ecosystem partners for resource-sharing, innovation and expertise.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Sustainability promises are showing progress 



 Bet: Avoid false choices between sustainability and profit—deliver both 



<p>While <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-is-innovating-for-a-more-sustainable-future/">sustainability</a> tops organizations’ list of priorities as their key stakeholders demand results, too many executives still see sustainability and profitability as conflicting rather than complementary. Organizations should avoid false choices between sustainability and profit—deliver both.</p>



<p>Environmental sustainability needs to be embedded in economic sustainability. Applying data and AI against sustainability goals can help drive productivity. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets">For example</a>, green IT solutions powered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud technology</a> can reduce both IT carbon footprint and 30% of computing cost. And automation can transparently track sustainability metrics, helping organizations achieve long-term sustainability objectives, optimize costs and create new sources of value.</p>

 Trend: The pragmatic metaverse will enhance the physical world, not replace it 



 Bet: Invest now in augmented reality (AR) solutions with clear benefits 



<p>While there’s been a lot of buzz about the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/5-ways-to-get-metaverse-ready/">metaverse</a>, the bigger value will be bringing technology to the physical world and navigating both physical and digital with tools like digital twins that deliver quantifiable results.&nbsp;Bridging the physical-digital divide requires organizations to invest now in augmented reality (AR) solutions with clear benefits. This includes investing in spatial design skills and applying them to product engineering, field services, manufacturing, and operations, and implementing an enterprise simulation platform to leverage secure data and create new digital twins. Metaverse skills are still scarce, so execs should be prepared to build rather than only hire them.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Every product is becoming a digital product 



 Bet: Invest in the software supply chain as much as the physical supply chain 



<p>Every product is becoming a digital product—your car, your bank account, even your air conditioning. Today, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets/software">67% of products are digital or have a digital component</a>. That means what used to be the design, manufacturing and service of physical products will have to be transformed; there’s now a parallel software supply chain that leaders need to manage, too. Every company needs to act like a software company, investing in their software supply chain as much as their physical supply chain. They must have a product engineering mindset and pair product, technology, and functional skills with a hyper focus on user experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Trend: Skills scarcity and demographic shifts are defining the new social contract 



 Bet: Embrace a new work-life continuum in a tech-enabled workplace 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets/work-life">Ninety percent of C-suite executives surveyed say their organization has been impacted by a scarcity of skills</a>. As the demand for digital skills accelerates, business leaders must embrace a new work-life continuum in a tech-enabled workplace. This means reskilling and upskilling employees, changing hiring practices to focus on skills and diversity rather than degrees and redefining roles themselves. It also means adjusting to meet new employee expectations for company values, flexibility and work-life integration, supporting workers’ holistic well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these bets are worth making. It’s less about which ones you’ll choose, and more about how you can pull them together into a systematic approach to drive true transformation at scale.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and&nbsp;thank you for joining us. As the years have been passing, I&nbsp;have noticed&nbsp;actually that, digital signatures are becoming more and more common. At a time when we need to sign some agreements, electronically or Internet services. So, let’s take some time today and&nbsp;hear what is going on, what the trends are, in the European Union, but particularly, in&nbsp;Sweden, where today’s guest is coming from.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Magnus Kardell.&nbsp;He is the product owner of SignPort, a product developed by Knowit, enabling high&nbsp;security, e-identification and e-signatures. He is a specialist in identification and signing&nbsp;services, with a focus on IAM and SSO Federations. Magnus started his career in this field in 2013&nbsp;and has since then gained extensive experience in the public sector, catering to clients&nbsp;with high security standards and needs. With a strong background in the industry, Magnus&nbsp;is dedicated to delivering innovative and secure solutions to his clients through SignPort.</p>
<p>Hello, Magnus.</p>
<p>Magnus Kardell: Yes, hello. Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you. We are going to talk about signatures. But&nbsp;let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. First of all, we want to hear about our&nbsp;guest, so we want to hear about you. Tell us a bit about your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Magnus: Thank you. Yeah, Magnus Kardell is my name, and I work at Knowit Secure&nbsp;Solutions, as Oscar mentioned, and I’m product owner for SignPort, which is an&nbsp;identification and signing service. I started roughly 10 years ago with IT security and at the&nbsp;time we were having, and working with, identity and access management. Providing single sign on&nbsp;and federations between different organisations, and soon after that, we were adding&nbsp;also signature services.</p>
<p>In Sweden, there is a technical framework provided by the&nbsp;Swedish agency, DIGG, the agency for digital government. We have always complied to that&nbsp;standard, and that’s where we built our services. It’s mainly targeting public sector, but it’s&nbsp;also good for private sector. And I think in 2016, we made the first signatures, doing it this way&nbsp;and according to this standard. So, we were first with that one. And I’ve been a project manager&nbsp;for establishing about 40 customers in Sweden, in different configurations, and they&nbsp;are mainly government agencies and large municipalities.</p>
<p>So that’s basically my&nbsp;journey and where I got my experience in this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds great. So magnus, what would you&nbsp;say are the main challenges that organisations, we talk about public and private,&nbsp;these organisations’ face, when they ask you for a digital signature solution?</p>
<p>Magnus: When it comes to public sector, you have to consider many things, maybe more than&nbsp;for a private company. For example, to start with, you need to be able to connect to different eID&nbsp;issuers. So, you can’t only have one.</p>
<p>In Sweden, BankID is the most common, but you need to be able&nbsp;to connect to different, both for identification and also signing. And also, there is a request for&nbsp;dividing into what we call private eID issuers where we use your personal number, which is more&nbsp;private. But that can also be as an employee at an organisation. So, you have that kind of&nbsp;– maybe you don’t want to mix your private entity and your employee entity, so you have&nbsp;to consider that. And also, international, so you can also identify yourself and sign with&nbsp;an eID issuer that is from another country. So that’s one of the things.</p>
<p>The most common eID&nbsp;issuer is BankID, of course, but there is also Freja e-ID, Freja org ID, which is for employees&nbsp;more, and foreign e-ID, that is international. So those are examples, but there are more. So, you&nbsp;need to cope with that, and you need to be able to connect to those.</p>
<p>They are also high security&nbsp;when it comes to signatures. It’s level three, which basically means that you need a hardware&nbsp;secure module, where you do the actual signing. So that’s also a bit higher in security than&nbsp;the general need.</p>
<p>A signed document must be self-supporting over time. So, you can’t&nbsp;rely on our service later on, it has to be self-supporting. And the supplier of the signature&nbsp;service must be replaceable. That’s not good for us, but it’s good that we are, because well, all&nbsp;companies, they are not forever. So, it’s, we should be able to replace as a supplier. So&nbsp;that would be in our system cemeteries that our customers that they, that the document itself&nbsp;is self-sustaining. And you have different things, in some cases, the documents to be signed are&nbsp;really sensitive, or the content is delicate, so you need to be able to sign the document&nbsp;without the document itself leaving the customer’s IT environment. But some requirements&nbsp;also on the signature service.</p>
<p>There are also, in some cases, you need a pure e-service, like&nbsp;signing portal. But in some other cases, the customer probably has their own platform&nbsp;that we would like to connect to our, how to say – signing engine. So, we have to provide APIs for&nbsp;our customers’ e-services– sometimes you have a simple signing portal, and in other cases,&nbsp;you let the customers e-platforms connect to our signing service. So, these are things that&nbsp;they need.</p>
<p>And then, of course, going into public sector, there can be really high volumes, when&nbsp;citizens in the country are using the service. It’s demand for high availability, and there is&nbsp;also a demand for high level automation. That means that the signatures need to be – you need to&nbsp;be able to validate the document electronically to the person who has signed it. If you look into&nbsp;the electronic signature of the PDF and read, signed by the supplier of the service, that is&nbsp;a no go, because then you can’t electronically extract what person who has actually signed&nbsp;the document.</p>
<p>So, this also put some specific requirements, and this is about the journey to&nbsp;digitalisation, and we’re not there yet. We may be in the beginning, of course, so far, when we&nbsp;sign a document on, electronically, like a PDF, that’s good. But often, it’s human reading&nbsp;it, at the end, at the other end anyway. So, we have replaced the paper, which is good.&nbsp;It’s much smoother. That’s very good. But still, it isn’t, the flow isn’t really digitalised.&nbsp;And if looking at these challenges that our customers have, they need to be able to do&nbsp;this high level of automation, at least have it further on.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are&nbsp;requests for sustainable operations. For example, excess heat in the operation centre should be fed&nbsp;back into the district heating network. So, this kind of, you don’t really think of them, but if&nbsp;looking at society, you need to think about those things to be sustainable. Those requirements I&nbsp;mentioned now, or the challenges there were, these organisations have. Of course, they’re mainly for&nbsp;government authorities or municipalities, but, I mean, it could apply also for private companies.&nbsp;It’s not bad, it’s really good things. So that’s about the challenges.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see quite many, different types. As you mentioned, some are purely&nbsp;security, some more like usability, what the user is going to face. What else? And the last one,&nbsp;you mentioned actually, the sustainability side. So yeah, different – and some are, yeah,&nbsp;legal. So yeah, different for different fronts, there are these type of requirements for signature&nbsp;services. And when it’s great that our solutions that, yeah, fix all these together and give a&nbsp;great product to, for us, for the users.</p>
<p>So, I would like to hear now, how are you solving&nbsp;some of these challenges? What are the main use cases? Just, if you can illustrate some&nbsp;of those use cases, hot use cases, let’s say?</p>
<p>Magnus: Signature service that we provide,&nbsp;SignPort is following the, I mentioned before, DIGG, the agency for digital government in&nbsp;Sweden they put up a framework for how to solve these issues. But there is also architecture or&nbsp;reference architecture for how to cope with these challenges. So, we follow that. And if looking&nbsp;at our service, it’s split up in four different components, mainly, four different components, and&nbsp;it’s a Signing Portal, Support Service, a Digital Signing Service, and Identification Service.&nbsp;So, these are the four different components.</p>
<p>And the Signing Portal is like a web page that is&nbsp;an e-service, a service provider. The only thing you can do is to just create a signing assignment.&nbsp;Just to, for example, take a PDF document, drag and drop, and then you apply the email address to the&nbsp;signers, and you send it away, and create the sign message, so that’s how it works. It’s a&nbsp;very simple, but useful tool for just keeping the, having a web interface to the users.</p>
<p>Then we have a Support Service. And the support service is basically calculating the hash of the&nbsp;document to be signed, and then the hash is sent further on to the digital signing service.</p>
<p>Digital Signing Service is a bit more – has the highest security, it contains these hardware&nbsp;secure modules, etc. That are creating those signings with the highest security.</p>
<p>And then&nbsp;we have the Identification Service, which is actually different identity providers connecting&nbsp;to each e-ID issuer. And we’re splitting this up, you can facilitate several things, because&nbsp;the signing portal and the support service is – those are the only components that are hit by&nbsp;the document to be signed, and they are done in a way that they can be installed in our customers’ operations.&nbsp;So, by doing it that way, the document to&nbsp;be signed is never leaving our customers’ IT departments. So, they stay at our customer.&nbsp;That is one thing. And by splitting up, so you have an API towards the support service, you also&nbsp;facilitate the possibility that the customer has other e-services that also would like to use an&nbsp;API for signing documents.</p>
<p>Those two parts, the signing portal and support service are rather&nbsp;easy components, that doesn’t contain any hardware or anything like that. So, it’s easy for the&nbsp;customers to install and operate themselves. Some other customers might – doesn’t have&nbsp;that requirement. They want the software as a service solution, and we can provide that&nbsp;as well. So, that’s possible to do it that way.</p>
<p>The Digital Signing Service, containing the&nbsp;hardware secure modules, and everything around that, that we always operate ourselves,&nbsp;but that part is never hit by the documents to be signed. And then we have the&nbsp;Identification Service, which is basically SAML 2.0 IDP connecting to, to different. It can be&nbsp;used as a pure identification service only for logging into it, and e-service, for example,&nbsp;but not in this case, also for signing. So that’s how our service is split up with those&nbsp;four different components, and how we can meet all these requirements that we have from the&nbsp;customer. But it is possible to do it this way.</p>
<p>And for the signing portal, we – it is a rather simple web page, and it has a basic structure, but we can customise it for our customers. So, if a municipality use that, we can customise it for that municipality; so it states the name and everything. So, the user feels that they are in the same. But when connecting to the support service then the – our customers can fully integrate and have everything that is shown to the users and the e-service that the agency provide. So that’s a little bit how it works and how it’s set up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Actually, one topic, I think you mentioned a little bit, maybe to&nbsp;understand even better is the self-supporting signed document. Right? So, you said – tell&nbsp;us a bit more about that, how it works.</p>
<p>Magnus: If taking a PDF, for example, the&nbsp;standard we use are PDF advanced electronic signatures. When I say that agency for digital&nbsp;government, the technical framework is based on eIDAS. So, it’s international standards that&nbsp;is based on. And when I say self-sustaining, then I mean that it should be able to validate the&nbsp;document to the person who has signed it, using only the document.</p>
<p>It isn’t really through, but&nbsp;you don’t need SignPort in order to validate it. You just need the public key from our signing&nbsp;service. And that’s the only thing you need, then you can validate the signature to the&nbsp;person who has signed the document. And the public key is – it can be downloaded, it can&nbsp;be stored, so that you have it. But it’s public service, so it’s, once it’s out, it is possible&nbsp;to achieve later on. But if you have that, you can validate the document to the person.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;then you can do, for example, if a government, an agency received a signed document, you&nbsp;can validate it and extract the person, electronically, that has signed a document&nbsp;provided that you rely on our public key. But then you also include the verification list in&nbsp;the document, so you can see that when it was signed, the identity wasn’t revoked. So, it’s sustainable also over time, together with a signed timestamp as well. So, basically, that makes it, self-supporting.</p>
<p>There might be other ways to&nbsp;do this onwards, the standards aren’t really set&nbsp;yet. But this is how we do it, in order to achieve this. Possibilities there are very replaceable,&nbsp;but it’s a good thing, I guess, if looking at.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. You have mentioned also that, a big part of your requirements come from the public service, and you’re following what needs to&nbsp;be comply in Sweden. So, let’s focus on that. So, what are signature service must comply in Sweden?</p>
<p>Magnus: It is for the public sector. In Sweden, the agency for digital government, they have&nbsp;set up a technical framework and a normative specification, and this setup addresses all&nbsp;the requirements that I listed above. So, it’s not a requirement on the public sector in&nbsp;Sweden, but it is the recommendation. And if following it, it will be much easier when,&nbsp;for example, different agencies collaborate and send documents between each other, if the signed&nbsp;documents follow the standard, the same standard. And there is also a requirement to&nbsp;connect to foreign eID, eIDAS.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you – it isn’t that many&nbsp;countries that is connected foreign eID yet. But, for example, if someone from Germany would like&nbsp;to use e-services in Sweden, it’s possible. Also, Denmark and several other countries, and there&nbsp;are more upcoming. So, there is a possibility to use also within Europe, both for identification&nbsp;and signing.</p>
<p>For the private sector, it isn’t – of course, there are requirements that the service&nbsp;has to be easy to use. I think that’s the main thing. But otherwise, there aren’t that,&nbsp;must have requirements as I believe on, when it comes to security or sustainability, and so on that. Maybe companies would like such things, but it isn’t a real requirement. So, you can use more or less whatever signing service you like. And there are many, and that’s OK. So, what we’ve seen in private sector is mainly, we have some customers, but they are mainly connected to either health care or law, when you’re more close to the public sector. So that’s what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Definitely a good overview&nbsp;how signatures have being applied in Sweden. I would like to ask a final question. So, for all&nbsp;business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that&nbsp;they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah. I think if you do not yet&nbsp;have a digital signature service, get one. It’s so much more efficient and sustainable than&nbsp;paper. So, if you don’t have one, get one. And when getting one, think about the future, how is&nbsp;the validity of the signed document proven over time? What happens in collaboration with other&nbsp;parties? And also, what happens when replacing the supplier, what’s next? I think those things you&nbsp;should consider when choosing a signature service.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, excellent. Excellent, Magnus,&nbsp;for this final recommendation. So please, yeah, let us know if someone would like to follow the&nbsp;conversation with you, or follow the work you’re doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Magnus: If you want to reach me, I think it’s easiest on an email address, which&nbsp;is magnus.kardell@knowit.sc, M-A-G-N-U-S dot K-A-R-D-E-L-L @knowit.sc. So, you can reach me&nbsp;there. And I believe we’ll set up a home page for SignPort, there is one, but I think we will update it soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Again, thank you, Magnus, for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah, thanks a lot.</p>

  <p>Companies today are being faced with business-critical yet seemingly conflicting topics; how to build trust, loyalty and personalized experiences that fuel growth in a world of fading cookies and GDPR. There has never been more urgency than now to focus on strategy and technology to meet the demands of the privacy-conscious consumer.&nbsp; The collection of data and its management is core to this challenge, but current identity methods are missing the opportunity to solve it with legacy approaches and risk-based thinking. At IndyKite, we believe that facing this mounting challenge requires us to make leaps in both our thinking and technology implementations. Join us as we challenge the current operating state and discuss what the world might look like when we have the tools to power a truly customer-centric ecosystem - one where consumer data ownership and personalized services that fuel growth are no longer at odds.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ahead-of-the-curve-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Authorization in modern applications is becoming increasingly complex, particularly when it comes to managing access to resources at the individual user and group levels. OAuth has become a widely-used standard for granting access to resources on behalf of a user, but it is not well-suited for these more nuanced use cases. In this talk, we will explore the confusion surrounding the use of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization in applications. We will discuss the standard meaning of authorization in OAuth, which is to grant access for an application to call APIs on behalf of the user, and how misusing OAuth for this purpose can lead to bad architecture and bloated JWT tokens. We will also introduce alternative standards like UMA (User-Managed Access) and GNAP (Group-Based Nested Access Protocol) as potential solutions for user and group-controlled resource delegation. These standards provide a more fine-grained and dynamic approach to access control and can be integrated with policies created by a PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control) server for a more comprehensive solution. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the limitations of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization, and with a clear understanding of the potential of UMA and GNAP as solutions for these use cases.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-modern-applications-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Decentralized Identity protection is important in data collaboration because it helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations involved in the supply chain. By ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information, identity protection helps to prevent data breaches and other security incidents. &nbsp;A chain of trust establishes a series of checks and verifications that ensure that the data being shared is accurate and trustworthy. This is critical in the context of supply chain regulations, where inaccurate or incomplete information can have serious consequences for compliance and risk management.</p>
<p>In the second part of the talk, we will explore the concept of adaptive protection for identities in Microsoft Purview. By using a combination of machine learning, behavioral analysis, and risk-based decision making, we can create a dynamic system that adapts to new threats in real time. This approach offers a more proactive and effective way to safeguard identities, and can be applied across a range of industries and contexts. Together, we can work to develop a more robust and resilient digital identity ecosystem that protects individuals and organizations alike.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/adaptive-protection-for-identities-eic2023"></a>

Major vendors have implemented the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol / Profile (CAEP) and analysts, practitioners and decision makers agree that it is critical to the future of zero-trust. This keynote, by the inventor of CAEP, goes into the pain points that led to the development of CAEP, the process to recast it as a part of the Shared Signals working group in the OpenID Foundation and the trends that make it an indispensable component of any zero-trust architecture. CAEP’s non-prescriptive nature makes it easy for anyone to implement their own policies and the Shared Signals Framework makes communicating changes efficient and nearly instantaneous. A future powered by Shared Signals and CAEP enables enterprises and vendors to break information silos to create a highly secure outcome.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/caep-and-shared-signals-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The Common Ground movement of the Dutch municipalities is developing innovative solutions for greater interoperability. An important part of this is the data landscape, where functionality is accessed through microservice API’s. In the analysis of this architecture, one aspect is barely touched upon: The Access Control aspect in API’s is not appropriately co-developed.</p>
<p>The Municipality of The Hague has performed a Proof Of Architecture (the POA) to demonstrate that it is possible to unlock an existing API in which access is not explicitly modeled, or that still uses traditional Role Based Access Control methods internally, restricting interoperability across contexts.</p>
<p>The POA is done in an effective and efficient way through innovative 'zero trust architecture' concepts, such as Policy Based Access Control. Security and privacy are thus demonstrably realized in accordance with legal requirements. The POA proves that it is technically feasible to add input-filtering of access requests to ignore the restricting RBAC method and thereby open doors for municipalities for interoperability in an autonomous and secure way.</p>
<p>During the presentation the working principles of API access from a perspective of Identity &amp; Access Management are explained, but also how these principles can be applied in practice in an existing application landscape.</p>
<p>The presentation will be a joint presentation between the lead architect of the City of The Hague, Jan Verbeek, and access strategist André Koot.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/access-control-microservice-architectures-for-zta-eic2023"></a>

Until recently Decentralized Identity has been stuff of dreams, but that is rapidly changing and the lines between identity and authentication blurring even more.

  <p>The shift to multi-cloud introduces a wide range of cloud security risks that remain unaddressed due to the siloed approach and limited focus of existing cloud security tools. Most cloud security tools offer highly focused solutions that are limited in scope and capabilities to address the growing spectrum of multi-cloud security risks. The convergence of IAM and multi-cloud security tools (CSPM, CWP and CIEM) offer a cloud security platform that takes an integrated approach to securely manage identities and their access entitlements to cloud resources for cloud-native application development, deployment and operations in the cloud. In this session, we will discuss:</p>
 
 What are the emerging archetypes of IAM and multi-cloud security tools convergence? 
 What are the essential building blocks to effectively address your code-to-cloud security risks in a multi-cloud environment? 
 What are the industry best practices and recommendations to deploy and operationalize multi-cloud security tools for best results?

  <p>Engineers across organizations struggle with increased anxiety and stress every time they hit the push button to make complex system changes. One mistake can hinder business as usual, introduce unnecessary risks, and cause non-compliance with policies that can cripple the whole organization.</p>
<p>Simulations could be the answer engineers are looking for. They are used in various fields to study complex systems and help engineers create hypothetical scenarios to see the impact of certain changes before implementing them.</p>
<p>In this presentation, the Evolveum Development Team Leader, Katarina Bolemant, will explain the motivation and common pain points of deploying an IGA solution. She will show you the endless possibilities of using simulations to evaluate the impact of changes and how to identify potential issues and reduce the risks of errors. Using simulations will lift the burden off engineers’ shoulders, increase confidence in their decisions, and build stronger relationships with other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Offer a peek into the future, and both technical personnel and decision makers will appreciate you for providing the possibility to review the simulated results and make necessary adjustments before implementing changes in the production environment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-iga-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>IGA activities in organizations have largely been around defining access policies manually, configuring access request workflows and scheduling periodic access reviews.&nbsp; Such activities require significant administration as well as continuous involvement by stakeholders.&nbsp; There are also delays that come with this model that could potentially cause security risk and non-compliance in the organization.&nbsp; An approach that is more intuitive is to discover policies, review them and apply access changes based on policies. This results in fewer IGA administrative and end-user activities for the organization while ensuring that both excess access and under access are addressed in a timely manner.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/policy-driven-iga-eic-2023"></a>

Companies often install different access systems for different populations, with different types of accounts and different lifecycle management.</p>
<p>This session presents an approach whereby different populations can be managed with a single system and a single user profile. Key in this approach is that the user profile indicates to which population (or more than one population) the user belongs. The approach also enables delegated administration and temporary accounts in a very intuitive way.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-cetric-personas-pbac-eic2023"></a>

This involves the use of both on-site and online identification procedures, which are often provided by external service providers as “critical outsourcing" and as data order processing. In the age of ID wallets, this KYC process needs to be redeveloped from a regulatory, data protection and technical perspective - especially because the regulatory framework currently does not (yet) explicitly provide for the case of an ID wallet.

  <p>Identity has been always an ambiguous term. Identities exist in a sociocultural and organizational context and in technical ones. We have Digital Identities and eIDs and not only do individuals have identities but so do organizations and non-humans, especially in technical contexts.</p>
<p>Identities had been always under threat, starting with theft of individuals’ identities and credentials in the physical world, such as credit cards and passports. However, these threats have not been on a large scale. We all know that this has changed dramatically with the digitization of everyone and everything. Social engineering, phishing emails, buying credentials in the dark web have become a serious threat to businesses and individuals. These threats have reached new heights with the numerous attacks on identity infrastructures, be it corporate directories or government eID infrastructure.</p>
<p>In this panel, we will explore the identity threats to individuals and organizations, how they are managed, and how identity security can be achieved from a prevention, detection, and management perspective.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/women-in-identity-panel-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The claim or desire for authorizations, permissions and the rights set in practice often have a wide divergence. Typically, more rights are assigned unconsciously than were actually required.</p>
<p>The resulting vulnerabilities can have significant consequences therefore, it is essential to be able to monitor the true permissions at any time, regardless of how the permissions have been set. It is almost impossible to manage monitoring manually, even in small environments. Therefore, independent automatisms that can automatically explore, analyze and report the real settings are becoming a requirement.</p>

Being able to look back three years later and tick of an infrastructure consolidation, the deployment of a central authorisation solution, being on the precipice of participating in a Digital ID scheme, and having the Chief Digital Officer shouting from the rooftops about a universal login is priceless. Come along to hear me talk about some critical success factors, calculated risks, fortunate circumstances, and the incredible support of some incredible people helped make this happen. I’ll also touch on my personal journey from an engineering role to a product person to illustrate the increasing maturity levels we went through.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/three-years-in-identity-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The EU funded Next Generation Internet (NGI) Atlantic project "Next Generation SSI Standards" and the Walmart funded Jobs for the Future (JFF) Plugfest, both have the same aim of fostering wide scale adoption of Verifiable Credentials. They are doing this by funding global interworking of Verifiable Credentials products from many different suppliers located in Europe, the USA and Asia. The NGI Atlantic project is committed to using the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OIDC4VCs) draft standard specifications, whilst JFF is allowing the 30+ participants to decide amongst themselves which protocols to use. Three protocol suites have been chosen: OIDC4VCs, VC-API with CHAPI, and DIDComm.<br><br>This presentation will provide an overview of the two projects, will provide an overview of the 3 protocol suites that have been chosen, and will present the results of the interworking trials.<br><br>The NGI Atlantic project will finish in December 2022, and besides interworking trials, will deliver an open source test suite that suppliers can use to test their implementations for conformance to the OIDC4VCs protocol suit for both credential issuing and verification. Some tests are being added to the W3C CCG Traceability test suite (written in POSTMAN) and some are being added to the Open ID Foundation's existing OpenID Connect conformance test suite (written in Java).</p>
<p>The JFF Plugfest will finish in 1Q2023. In November 2022 each VC Issuing software supplier must demonstrate the issuing of a verifiable credential to the wallets of at least two different wallet software providers, whilst each wallet software provider must obtain a verifiable credential from at least two other VC Issuing software providers. In February 2023 VC wallets must demonstrate the presentation of a Verifiable Presentation/Verifiable Credential to at least two different verification software suppliers, and each verifier must demonstrate that it is capable of accepting a VP/VC from at least two different wallets.<br><br>The success of these projects should catapult the acceptance of inter-workable verifiable credential products to the market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/verifiable-credential-products-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Common Web3 narratives go like this: Web1 was decentralised. Web2 is centralised and dominated by GAFAM/BigTechs. Web3 will be decentralised.<br><br>Is this real?<br><br>Let us look back. Web1 was about publishing web pages that were linked to other pages. The publishing sites were decentralised all over and were connected by links. Schematics resembled spider webs. Thus, the name “web”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web2 was the read-write web. In other words, API Economy. Was it a centralised architecture? Definitely not. What we imagined as Web 2.0 back in 2004 was that instead of monolithic systems, each site provides a function as REST API, and new services quickly emerge by combining these APIs like LEGO. APIs were decentralised and distributed all over the internet. API calling relationships connected those sites; the schematics resembled a spider web. Thus, the name Web 2.0.<br><br>Note, in 2004, none of Google, Amazon, Facebook/Meta, or Apple resembled what we have now.<br>Google just acquired Double Click, but it still had the banner word “Do not do evil.” The size of the company was 1/10 of Hitachi. Amazon still was an internet merchant. Facebook was just founded, but it still was primarily confined to Harvard and other American university students. Apple was an iPod and Mac company. Were they BigTechs? No! Big guys were IBM, Hitachi, etc., and Google, Facebook etc. were carrying the liberation torch!<br><br>Then, how come we end up here, despite the fact that the architecture was completely decentralised?<br><br>It was the combination of free market competition and technology that exhibited increasing returns. Any IT technology has decreasing cost/increasing return on investment. Under the circumstances, it will end up in Cournot equilibrium in a fashionable vocabulary - in a common word; winner takes all - monopoly/oligopoly. That’s how we ended up.<br><br>What about web3 and decentralised identity? Would the decentralisation dream finally come true?<br><br>Well, they still are IT. They still exhibit increasing return necessarily. Then, how can you believe that it will not be dominated by large players just like it happened to Web 2.0? If you let the free market play, it will certainly be. Unlike in the case of Web 2.0 where there still were 100s of thousands of IdPs, we may end up with two Wallets where the wallet provider can come in and decide to delete your verified credentials or ban your account. How decentralised!<br><br>Wait, there is more.<br><br>How can you believe that code that runs on your phone adheres to what it says?<br>The data stored on your wallet that runs on your phone may be extracting your data and sending it to criminals. We have seen many times that the initially benign code turns malicious with an update.<br><br>According to the Devil's Dictionary of Linguistic Dark Patterns compiled at IIW 2022b, “Decentralised” means “We run our code on your machine at your own risk”. Yes, at your own risk. If it is completely “decentralised” and there is no “provider”, then there is nobody to go after from the point of view of a regulator. Having a “centralised” provider is much better from a consumer protection point of view in this respect.<br><br>Is there no light? Are we going to live in the darkness of decentralisation?<br><br>Let us briefly think about what web3 was supposed to be. Forget about something that is found between A and Z. I am not talking about that. I am talking about cypher-punks' idealistic dreams.<br>Many people believe that blockchain is just an immutable ledger. No, it is not! That’s not the innovation of blockchain. Chained immutable records were there long before Satoshi’s invention. It is called Hysteresis signature and was invented in 1999.<br>Then, what was the innovation? it was the committing of the code into the it to make it immutable and executing it by multiple machines to exclude the result from changed code. In other words, it was the establishment of trust in the running code.<br>The light could be diminishingly small, but it still is light. That’s the light that I see in web3 that’s not between A and Z.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/fallacy-of-decentralisation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The existing eIDAS governance framework for digital identity is fragmented for different regulated markets in different EU countries. Today identity provider solutions for finance, healthcare and other regulated markets follow central approaches for the management of identities and consent in high secure data center environments and using legacy standards (e.g. OIDC, central public key infrastructure).</p>
<p>eIDAS 2.0 creates a EU wide identity ecosystem with adapted new standards, new stakeholders and a focus on using mobile devices. The existing roadmap allows to anticipate three to five years (or more) transition. For banking, insurance, healthcare or the public sector it is time to adopt these standards in their digital transformation strategy.</p>
<p>Based on the Gematik requirements for a federated identity provider with central OIDC compliant resource and authorization server Comuny shifted relevant identity provider functions (data storage + token generation) on the mobile device.</p>
<p>The speakers will describe challenges and solutions for this regulated market. They also discuss the chance to combine existing central OIDC flows with mobile decentral, wallet based principles as a bridge into the new eIDAS 2.0 governance framework. The audience will get a clear understanding about requirements, opportunities and practice details to create the transition into eIDAS 2.0 identity ecosystem.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eu-wallet-eidas2-european-identity-framework-eic2023"></a>

   OAuth is a widely used authorization framework that enables third-party applications to access resources on behalf of a user. However, it has been historically difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last five years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.

However, it has been historically difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last five years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.<br> <br> There are challenges when trying to achieve high security and interoperability with OAuth 2: Many potential threats need to be addressed, some not part of the original OAuth threat model. To seamless authorizations, optionality must be minimized OAuth itself and also in any extensions<br> used.<br> <br> Six years ago, the IETF OAuth working group started work on the Security Best Current Practice document and more recently on OAuth 2.1. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation has created FAPI1 and FAPI2 security profiles.<br> <br> We will introduce these specifications and help you understand the focus of each document and when to use which. We show how to achieve on-the-wire interoperability and high security through the use of techniques like asymmetric client authentication and sender-constraining via DPoP and MTLS. We highlight the benefits for implementers and the role of conformance testing tools.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/high-security-interoperable-oauth2-eic2023"></a>

  <p>OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC) is a set of protocols that enables issuance and presentation of verifiable credentials expressed in any format including but not limited to W3C vc-data-model and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mDL. The power of the protocols lies in its demonstrated simplicity, security, and the implementer's ability to make choices across the tech stack - not just for credential formats, but also entity identifiers, trust model, crypto suites, revocation mechanism, etc. However, this also means that to be interoperable and enable certain use-cases(s), implementers need to agree on the sets of choices across the tech stack, usually referred to as interoperability profiles. <br> <br> In this talk, we will share implementation experience of OID4VC specifications, and introduce existing interoperability profiles based on OID4VC. Of course we will also provide updates to OID4VC specifications, how they have evolved from the last year based on an overwhelming amount of implementation feedback.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/interopeable-decentralized-identity-openid-eic2023"></a>

  <p>OpenID Connect Federation enables trust establishment at scale and is being deployed to do so in Europe.</p>
<p>A key question when granting access to resources is “Who do you trust?”.&nbsp; It’s often important to know who the party is that you’re interacting with and whether they’ve agreed to the terms and conditions that apply when accessing a resource.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect enables identities of participants to be securely established but doesn’t answer the question of whether a participant is trusted to access a resource such as your personal data.&nbsp; A complementary mechanism is needed to do that.&nbsp; In small-scale and static deployments, it’s possible to keep a list of the trusted participants.&nbsp; However, in large-scale and dynamic deployments, that doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe how the OpenID Connect Federation protocol enables scalable trust establishment with dynamic policies.&nbsp; It does so by employing trust hierarchies of authorities, each of which are independently administered.&nbsp; Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations, departments within organizations, and individual sites.</p>
<p>Two OpenID Connect Federations are deployed in Italy, enabling secure access to digital services operated by Italian public and private services with Italian digital identities.&nbsp; This presentation will also describe why OpenID Connect Federation was selected for them and how it meets their needs.&nbsp; OpenID Connect Federation is being used by the GAIN PoC.&nbsp; A public deployment is also being planned in Sweden.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/who-to-trust-eic2023"></a>

The panel will also address the future of MFA, discussing the potential for new technologies to improve security and user experience, and the role of industry and government in shaping the future of MFA. Overall, the panel aims to provide valuable insights and perspectives on the multifactor authentication dilemma and the steps needed to move beyond mobile-based solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mfa-dilemma-beyond-mobile-eic2023"></a>

  <p>You often think service providers should build identity and API security infrastructure by themselves to have full control and flexibility so that it can fit into their business and technology stack. But it tends to be time consuming and costly due to lack of expertise to do so. Buying a heavy-weight solution is another considerable option, but it reluctantly leads dependency on the particular vendor of the solution, which may have redundant features and may not accommodate to customize in a cost-effective and timely manner. In this session, we will discuss a third option to “buy and build” that can combine the best of both worlds and give you control by building from scratch, as well as minimize the time and resource by leveraging “Identity Components as a Service.”</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/security-enterprises-gain-control-eic2023"></a>

<p>In this session, we look at the intersection of IAM and Zero Trust, and provide a mapping of IAM capabilities to Zero Trust requirements. We also look at the need for modern IAM, from adaptive, passwordless authentication to continuous authentication, ITPR (Identity Threat Detection and Response), PBAM (Policy Based Access Management), but also Data Governance and the intersection of IAM and Code Security. This will help you in aligning your IAM and ZT strategies and give you a concrete understanding of technologies you will need (or not).</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-first-zero-trust-implementation-eic2023"></a>

However with K8S, now more than ever the workload underneath matters. One privileged, neglected, container can compromise an entire setup. Rather than just talking about the risks or best practices, this talk is all about showing how easy it is to do. <br> <br> The talk will first discuss possible attack paths in the Kubernetes cluster, and what differences exist in the attack techniques compared to classic infrastructures. For this purpose, a web application in a container will be compromised, then the Kubernetes cluster and the cloud account. Subsequently, 2 open-source tools will be discussed how such vulnerabilities and misconfigurations can be detected in the different infrastructure layers.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hack-a-cloud-kubernetes-eic2023"></a>

<p>The industry needs to trust passwordless authentication (FIDO2). Adversaries and then criminals have circumvented our authentication controls for decades. From the very first theft of cleartext passwords to the very latest bypass of a second-factor, time and again improvements in defenses are met with improved attacks.</p>
<p>What holds us back from getting rid of passwords? Trust. In this session, we will propose a framework of technical controls to ensure only trusted sessions authenticate, regardless of faults or failures in any one factor, and to reassess based on shared signals (CAEP). We will share a path forward for increasing trust in passwordless authentication.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/trust-in-passwordless-authentication-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Identity and access have always been joined at the hip. In the age of LDAP, authenticated users were granted permissions based on group membership. But this mechanism hasn’t transferred into the federated identity landscape. <br><br> Instead, modern identity systems try to generalize permissions into scopes that are embedded into access tokens. But this doesn’t facilitate fine-grained authorization - a “read:document” scope doesn’t typically mean the user can access every document! <br><br> While identity has moved to the cloud, we still don’t have fine-grained, scalable mechanisms for generalizing authorization. So every application builds its own, and IT ends up administering every application differently.<br><br> Fixing this is arguably the most pressing challenge for the IAM industry. In this talk, we propose a set of principles, inspired by zero-trust and the latest work in cloud-native authorization, that should underlie the solutions we build:</p>
 
 Support for fine-grained authorization (both ABAC and ReBAC), delivering on the principle of least privilege. Google’s Zanzibar provides an important blueprint. 
 Managing authorization policy-as-code, enabling separation of duties and policy-based access management. Open Policy Agent is a good building block. 
 Performing real-time access checks for continuous verification. This function should be downstream from authentication. 
 Collecting fine-grained decision logs, providing the underpinning for comprehensive offline auditing and access analysis.

  <p>The adoption of multiple clouds is accelerating across all industries. While multi-cloud brings many benefits, it also results in new challenges. Organizations must manage platform-specific access policies in the bespoke policy syntax of each cloud. <br> Security and risk gaps arise between cloud identity systems due to the increased policy fragmentation and technical complexity that can obscure visibility and make it difficult to determine who has access to what. <br> These challenges grow exponentially when you consider the various access policies (and system languages) associated with each data, network, and platform layer (and vendor) in an organization’s tech stack.<br> This session will describe an open-source solution to multi-cloud access policy fragmentation: Identity Query Language (IDQL) and Hexa Orchestration. IDQL and Hexa are two sides of the same coin that together perform policy orchestration across incompatible cloud platforms. <br> IDQL is the universal declarative policy language that can be translated into a target system's proprietary or bespoke access policy format. Hexa is the open-source reference software that brings IDQL to life and makes it operational in the real world by connecting to target systems and performing the three main functions of discovery, translation, and orchestration.<br> Hexa Policy Orchestration was recently accepted as a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project. The session will include a technical review of Hexa plus a demonstration of current capabilities.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standadizing-access-policies-eic2023"></a>

By adopting a DevSecOps approach, organizations can integrate security into the development lifecycle and take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and automation capabilities of the cloud.</p>
<p>In this session, We will explore the benefits of leveraging the cloud for security in DevOps, and discuss the key principles of DevSecOps architecture, including collaboration, automation, and continuous integration and delivery. We will also examine the role of security tools and technologies, such as static code analysis, dynamic testing, and vulnerability management, in the DevSecOps process, and discuss how these tools can be effectively deployed in a cloud environment.</p>
<p>In addition, I will provide practical guidance and strategies&nbsp;on how organizations can implement the latest DevSecOps strategies in their cloud environments. This will include a discussion of best practices for integrating security into the development process, such as setting up security gates, implementing security testing early in the development process, and automating security checks.</p>
<p>Overall, this session will highlight the benefits of leveraging the cloud for improved security in DevOps, and provide practical guidance with the latest cloud technologies on how to implement DevSecOps effectively in a cloud environment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cloud-secured-devops-environments-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The Zero Trust paradigm, the approach of eliminating inherent trust in an IT architecture and always verifying, has been discussed for over a decade. It is well known that Zero Trust is a team sport, with Identity in the center. The many components, from IGA to Device Management, Network-segmentation to contextual awareness and beyond can be fulfilled by as many vendors, bearing the question about how to integrate these for a secure and convenient user experience. While there may be integrations available for some components, they will most likely be disjointed and/or require custom development, making it a challenge to be agile and innovative.<br> <br> An alternative to the described problem would be Orchestrating Zero Trust, applying the approach of "Detect, Decide, Direct". Through Orchestration the task of gathering all signals and relevant information (Detect) for an appropriate authorization decision (Decide), and continuing with the proper next step(s) (Direct) can be fulfilled in a flexible manner, facilitating customization in a future proof manner.<br> <br> In this session we will describe the "Detect, Decide, Direct" approach and see how Orchestration can be a key enabler of Zero Trust.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/orchestrating-zero-trust-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Serverless technology eliminates the need for development teams to provision servers, and it also results in some security threats being passed to the cloud provider. This frees up developers to concentrate on building logic and producing value quickly. But cloud functions still execute code. If the software is written poorly, it can lead to a cloud disaster.</p>
<p>How can developers ensure that their code is secure enough? They can scan for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in open-source code. They can even scan their Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool to identify insecure configurations. But what about custom code? At many organizations, the application security team struggles to keep up with the speed of development in a serverless environment. Traditional testing tools not only provide very limited coverage, but also slow development cycles unacceptably. Serverless code contains a mixture of cloud configurations and application programming interfaces (API) calls. As a result, legacy solutions lack the context that is necessary in a serverless environment, and the consequence is a lack of observability and slower response times.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it does not have to be this way. Organizations can leverage robust security during serverless development, automatically—if it is done properly. In this talk, we will discuss common risks in serverless environments. We will then cover existing testing methodologies and why they do not work well for serverless. Finally, we will present a new, completely frictionles</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/automated-serverless-security-testing-eic2023"></a>

In short, “transportation is the lifeblood of a city.” Innovation in transportation has driven the expansion of cities—from small, walkable areas to the sprawling, car-based metropolises, presenting a challenge for urban planners.</p>
<p>Identity in the modern organization faces a similar challenge: if transportation is the lifeblood of cities, then identity is the lifeblood of organizations. And our organizations are not ancient, walkable Rome, but modern, sprawling Atlanta—with identities and resources widely strewn around the globe.</p>
<p>Like urban planners, we face a nearly-intractable challenge: how can we provide access to resources and data easily while still meeting the stringent demands of security and compliance?</p>
<p>Thankfully, there appears to be a solution for both urban planning *and* identity, albeit from an unexpected source: Ordinary slime mold. Aka, “The Blob.”</p>
<p>We’ll learn from this simple organism, describe how its simple actions create complex systems that solve these sorts of “unsolvable” problems, and see how the Blob might “think” about identity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/urban-planning-identity-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>A journey of the multi-national insurance company to find and introduce a smooth corporate e-signing solution, both legally and technically well-justified. A story of considering and aligning different dimensions to find a tiny path between legal trust and protection, technical constraints, smooth user experience, global EU Regulation (eIDAS) and country-specific local habits.</p>
<p>It was a huge puzzle to identify and solve all the critical actual and future needs of the different business use cases for e-signing across the company to come up with a singe corporate solution and move gradually away from the very fragmented and mainly technically driven landscape of signing solutions.</p>
<p>Traditionally those have been introduced as the ad-hoc remedy to some local needs in isolation from other initiatives and without proper validation of both short and long term legal impact to the company.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/e-signing-insurance-eic-2023"></a>

<p>As an identity professional, you're constantly studying and reviewing new technologies, new protocols, and new products within the space but you struggle for the best way to extract the value of these new shiny, items to benefit your organization. You've been told that a well-developed identity architecture plan is the best way solve business challenges and produce concrete results but your research and fully-notated diagrams have failed to engage your peers.<br> <br> Many times this is because the architecture was designed by architects for architects without inout from those who are most impacted by the existing legacy technololgies. Architects tend to be more isolated from the actual business so focus more on things like ArchiMate notation and TOGAF frameworks.<br> <br> Steve "Hutch" Hutchinson will share his own decades of architecture experience and provide attendees with proven methods to make your architecture artifacts relatable to your front-line business workers, understandable by your technical peers from across cyber/IT, and provide demonstratable value to your organization's senior leadership. These same methods will allow you to shepherd your organization to a modern identity econsystem on a budget and timetable purpose fit for your organization's needs and culture.</p>

Following the principle of least privilege, modern cloud apps can implement just in time authorization with fine-grained controls.

  <p>IDaaS, the SaaS-delivered IAM, helps organizations &nbsp;&nbsp;releasing themselves from a considerable part of the burden that IAM brings. They don’t need to care for software installation and running servers. However, IDaaS is only part of the answer&nbsp; here. Customers still must&nbsp; &nbsp;managed and run their IAM environment.</p>
<p>This is where MSPs (Managed Service Providers) and their services come in . They help the organizations in managing major parts of IAM, from onboarding of systems to customization and configuration, but also for a good share of the business-oriented aspects.</p>
<p>MSPs also can help organizations in providing a real IDaaS in the sense of customers/tenants just ordering services, without even caring about the technology below. They buy the services delivered by an Identity Fabric that is built and run by their service provider (which then again might rely on one or more SaaS services).</p>
<p>In this panel, we will discuss how such a “managed Identity Fabric” can look like and what this means to both the MSPs and their tenants. We’ll specifically focus on what distincts such a managed Identity Fabric from just a standard IDaaS offering, and from a MSP operating the IAM the customer already has in place. We’ll discuss the main criteria and capabilities for selecting the managed Identity Fabric.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/managed-identity-fabric-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>For more than two decades, Microsoft Active Directory (AD) has been the de facto method organizations use to authenticate and authorize users for access to computers, devices, and applications within a company’s network. Most companies still rely on it and have further extended its reach into the cloud by synchronizing their on-prem AD with the Microsoft Azure AD to allow proper SSO to cloud-applications by their users. AD is celebrated for its extensive compatibility with various applications and Windows editions, but that compatibility comes with security downsides.</p>
<p>Compromises of Active Directory can occur as an entry point leading to a further attack or can arise at various other points along the kill-chain following an initial compromise via some other mechanism. Even in cases where a compromise is gained following an attack on applications or infrastructure directly, it is frequently infeasible for an attacker to progress further without elevating privileges, making Active Directory a primary target in an overall breach strategy.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that Active Directory defense tools are paired with a wider Zero Trust and XDR approach to provide full visibility over organizational infrastructure, enabling security teams to accurately identify the point of origin of an attack, and to perform the containment and remediation actions required to neutralize and prevent reoccurrence of an attack.</p>
<p>Join Principal Technologist, Guido Grillenmeier, to discuss AD access points used in recent cyberattacks, security risks to watch for in managing AD with Azure AD, how to look for warning signs that AD has been compromised and steps to take in the event of an attack.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/active-directory-as-cyber-attack-target-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The term “Identity Fabrics” stands for a paradigm and concept of a comprehensive and integrated set of Identity Services, delivering the capabilities required for providing seamless and controlled access for everyone to every service. Identity Fabrics support various types of identities such as employees, partners, consumers, or things. They deliver the full range of identity services required by an organization.</p>
<p>Identity Fabrics are not necessarily based on a technology, tool, or cloud service, but a paradigm for architecting IAM within enterprises. Commonly, the services are provided by a combination of several tools and services, with up to three solutions forming the core of the Identity Fabric. Most organizations that are using this paradigm as a foundation for the evolution of their overall IAM tend to build on a strong core platform for delivering major features and complementing this by other solutions.</p>
<p>We will look at what must be in every Identity Fabric, and how to evolve from a foundational Identity Fabrics approach towards a higher level of maturity. The session will look at concrete capabilities per maturity level and service group within Identity Fabrics.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-fabrics-maturity-levels-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>Managing access is a critical capability for the IT infrastructure of any enterprise, especially when dealing with over 6,800 integrated applications used by millions of authentication requests. Due to the increasing demand for availability, scalability, and support for market-specific customizations, as well as the migration of more products and applications to the cloud, we had to migrate our infrastructure and application stack to the AWS cloud. This stack had been introduced in an on-premises setup in 2017 and now follows modern paradigms such as GitOps, Everything as Code, and highly automated processes based on Service Layers and ForgeRock. Our main concern was ensuring that the integrated application landscape remained functional during the migration without experiencing any impact or downtime.<br><br> During this presentation, we will share our experience and discuss the key takeaways from our successful large-scale production system migration to the cloud, including:</p>
 
 Understanding the target architecture for the migration project 
 Identifying the challenges that arise during cloud migration 
 Discovering strategies for minimizing the impact on integrated applications during the migration process.

 How Self-Sovereign Identity Can Protect Us from the Threats of AI and Digital Deception 
<p><a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=Artificial%20Intelligence%20%2DAI%2D">Artificial intelligence</a> has brought remarkable advances to various fields, including healthcare, finance, and education, among others. However, it also poses significant challenges in terms of cybersecurity and privacy. With the proliferation of deepfakes, bots, and other sophisticated digital deception tools, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish what’s real from what’s not. This has led to a surge in cyber attacks and identity theft, with devastating consequences for individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>In the age of AI, we need a new framework of trust and verification to combat these threats. Enter <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=S-,Self%2Dsovereign%20identity,-(SSI)">self-sovereign identity (SSI)</a>, a decentralized technology that empowers individuals to own and control their identity data, without relying on centralized authorities. SSI is based on blockchain, a distributed ledger that records transactions securely and transparently, without the need for intermediaries. This makes it a perfect fit for protecting our identity and privacy in the digital realm.</p>
 SSI is built on a set of principles that ensure its security and reliability. These include: 
 
 User-controlled / <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=User%2Dcentric%20Identity%C2%A0%20Model">User-Centric</a>: Individuals have full control over their identity data and can choose who to share it with, when, and for what purpose. 
 <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=Decentralized%20(adjective)">Decentralized</a>: Identity information is stored on a distributed network of nodes, which makes it resilient to attacks and prevents single points of failure. 
 Interoperable: SSI systems can communicate and exchange data with other SSI systems, creating a universal standard for identity verification. 
 <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/glossary/#:~:text=interface%2C%20or%20system.-,V,-VC%20(verifiable%20credential">Verifiable</a>: Identity data is cryptographically secured and can be verified without revealing sensitive information, ensuring privacy and authenticity. 
 
<p>By leveraging these principles, SSI can provide a new level of trust and authentication, protecting us from the dangers of digital deception and identity fraud.</p>
 Here are some examples of how SSI can be applied in different fields: 
<p>Healthcare: SSI can enable patients to own and manage their health records, granting access to healthcare providers on a need-to-know basis. This can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive medical information and ensure data accuracy.</p>
<p>Finance: SSI can enable individuals to verify their identity and credentials for financial transactions, without relying on centralized intermediaries. This can reduce the risk of identity theft and improve the efficiency of financial processes.</p>
<p>Education: SSI can enable students to verify their academic credentials and qualifications, creating a secure and tamper-proof record of their achievements. This can prevent credential fraud and simplify the verification process for employers.</p>
An image generated with artificial intelligence on the web <a href="https://labs.openai.com/">DALL.E</a>
<p>In conclusion, the rise of AI has brought unprecedented challenges to our digital identity and privacy. However, with the power of SSI, we can reclaim control over our identity data. Also, we can create a new framework of trust and authentication.</p>
<p>By adopting decentralized technology, we can protect ourselves from the threats of digital deception and identity fraud. That’s helps to ensuring a safer and more secure future for all.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 24th April to 8th&nbsp;May <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap, your biweekly dose of the latest crypto regulatory news and developments from around the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>In this edition, we delve into New York’s investor protection legislation, Liechtenstein’s updated blockchain laws, Montana’s mining-friendly measures, North Carolina’s stance on CBDC payments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Let’s not wait any further and dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Crypto Crossroads: Global Regulatory Shifts and Political Engagement Reshaping the Industry Landscape <p>Over the past two weeks, the cryptocurrency industry has experienced a series of interconnected regulatory developments and political engagements across various jurisdictions, including recent news about the New York Attorney General (NYAG) proposing new crypto legislation and Liechtenstein adjusting its blockchain laws.</p><p>The Bahamas’ SCB has introduced new regulations aligning with international standards, showcasing how governments strive to balance innovation with adequate oversight.</p><p>In Europe, Liechtenstein is adapting its blockchain laws in response to the evolving crypto landscape, including the Token and Trusted Technology Service Providers Act (TVTG) and the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. These efforts aim to create a more secure and regulated environment for crypto users and the industry as a whole, fostering regulatory certainty and direct communication with the Financial Market Authority.</p><p>Similarly, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced legislation that she insists would safeguard investors, consumers, and the economy from the under-regulated cryptocurrency industry. Political figures such as Robert F.

<p>In this edition of the Projects We Love series, we feature Blockenberg, a headless CMS built on IPFS.</p> Why Build A Headless CMS? <p><a href="https://twitter.com/vorcigernix">Adam Sobotka</a> and his ETHBrno hackathon teammates were building a completely decentralized website when they stumbled across a problem. They wanted to add a blog but realized that the only options were to use a centralized service or require users to write in Markdown or JSON files. </p><p>When using a centralized service, developers spend countless hours on formatting so that the content displays correctly on the site. Users are also subject to the decisions of the centralized service provider, which ultimately controls the user data. </p><p>Using Markdown or JSON files would require content creators to learn a new skill on top of the creative work they are already doing.</p><p>After watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZDXacPphcY&amp;list=PLXzKMXK2aHh7qkiGv6yZqs8AsirOkfEAB">demo of Fission's ODD SDK</a> (formerly known as Webnative), Adam realized he could create a user-friendly UI to publish articles to decentralized storage. </p><p>Adam knew that a headless CMS would help make rendering more efficient or keep it separate from the rest of the system so that one wasn't reliant on the other. It would be completely customizable from the client side, thus allowing for more flexibility to tailor the design while offering protection from censorship.</p> Using Blockenberg <p>The user experience is very similar to what we expect of a CMS. However, one point of differentiation is the login process. Blockenberg actually doesn't use passwords. Instead, it uses cryptographic keys and stores them on the user's machine according to the <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN spec</a>. Users can also delegate access to collaborators.</p><p>Once the user drafts a blog post and publishes it, the data is stored on IPFS and persisted by Fission's pinning service (this is the default, but users can always choose how they want to pin their data). IPFS storage is made possible by Fission's WNFS, which enables both public and private file storage. While the front end renders the blog post, the back end uses Fission's client library to fetch the data. </p><p>In order to display blog posts on Blockenberg, a client web app must be configured. It is up to the user how they would like to set this up, but Blockenberg offers both a <a href="https://github.com/vorcigernix/cms-blockenberg">Next.js</a> option and an <a href="https://github.com/vorcigernix/blockenclient">Astro</a> option. </p> Next Steps <p>The plan is for Blockenberg to add more features to improve collaboration. For example, concurrent writing is an option, but there is a bit more work that needs to be completed before rolling this feature out. </p><p>Backward compatibility is another improvement Adam would like to make, as it would enable better filtering options in the future. </p><p>On a similar note, the ability to transfer data from another CMS to Blockenberg would be another handy feature to implement, as it would encourage more folks to move to a decentralized option that can grow with their needs (and not get tied down to a particular platform).</p> Getting Started <p>Blockenberg is a great tool for creating a personal website or blog, especially for those who value privacy, decentralization, and open and democratic information sharing. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about integrating Blockenberg into your own site, visit the <a href="https://blockenberg.xyz/">Blockenberg website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockenberg_dev">Twitter</a> for more information on how to get started!</p>

<p>The world is changing faster than ever, and the way we work needs to keep up with the possibilities that new technologies bring to our day-to-day work. Companies that want to stay competitive need to help their employees quickly build new skill sets and adapt to changing market conditions.</p>



<p>Workforce demographic trends compel us to reimagine how we work. A large share of the worker population—Millennials and Generation Z—grew up using technology in their day-to-day lives, and they expect the tech they use at work to function the same as it does in their personal lives.</p>



<p>Those businesses that do not adapt may be overly exposed to worker shortages and productivity. An analysis from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the U.S. labor force participation rate is projected to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecopro.nr0.htm">decline from 61.7% in 2021 to 60.1 % in 2031</a>, fueled by the <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/wpp2022_summary_of_results.pdf">aging population trend reflected across the world</a>.</p>



 Sport Clips Haircuts reimagines talent acquisition 



<p>Sport Clips Haircuts—a leading hair salon with almost 1,900 stores in the U.S.—recognizes the modern-day challenges of staffing and employee retention. CEO Edward Logan has put technology at the forefront of the company and considers AI and automation to be a great way to support franchise owners, which is a top priority for the company.</p>



<p>Customer demand is high and every chair without a stylist at Sport Clips is a lost opportunity to make a customer happy. However, recruiting for the stylist role and finding the right talent can be challenging. Sport Clips wanted to help reduce the recruiting burden on franchise owners by expanding their qualified talent pool and streamlining outreach to passive candidates, which led them to reach out to IBM and <a href="https://www.thiswayglobal.com/">ThisWay® Global</a>—a candidate sourcing and matching platform with an expansive network of over 8,500 communities.</p>



<p>Franchise owners were onboarded to the solutions in under an hour and now have the ability to manage their end-to-end recruiting process through a single user interface. Through chat-style interactions, users are able to initiate automations (known as skills), including the following:</p>



 
 Create a new job requisition from commonly posted positions. 



 Socialize the job listing on job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn (paid subscriptions may be required). 



 Identify qualified passive candidates using ThisWay Global and email up to 300 candidates within minutes to invite them to apply. 
 



<p>“Driving transformation for our franchisee owners is a top priority. Can we make a process easier, faster and with fewer errors to help them be successful? With IBM Watson Orchestrate, we streamlined passive candidate outreach. What used to take three hours can now be done in just a few minutes,” said Edward Logan, CEO &amp; President of Sport Clips Haircuts.</p>



 Introducing IBM Watson Orchestrate Enterprise Edition 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-orchestrate">IBM Watson Orchestrate</a> is a cloud-based solution that helps companies empower their people to change the nature of their day-to-day work. The new Enterprise Edition includes an expanded set of skills and a new ability to import existing automations, including those from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/robotic-process-automation">IBM Robotic Process Automation</a>. The release introduces digression—the ability for Watson to multi-task so it can handle multiple requests at the same time.</p>



 Get work done quickly with pre-built skills 



<p>Skills are foundational to the Watson Orchestrate platform—think of them as units of automation. It can be as simple as adding a row to Excel or as complex as onboarding a new employee with the many tasks involved— collecting I-9 information, ordering a new computer and even setting up a welcome meeting with the team. The new Watson Orchestrate Enterprise Edition offers over 30 new pre-built/pre-trained skills for SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle HCM and Workday.</p>



 Reuse existing automations 



<p>IBM Watson Orchestrate can help you get the most out of your prior automation investments. Easily import existing automations that use the OpenAPI specification. These automations can be from IBM or other third-party vendors. After importing, developers can train skills and define natural language utterance phrases quickly.</p>



 Support more use cases with IBM Robotic Process Automation 



<p>IBM Watson Orchestrate Enterprise Edition comes with entitlements to IBM Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to facilitate automating unique use cases across your organization. Watson can sequence your custom skills with pre-built flows or create new workflows dynamically.</p>



 How many things can you do at once? 



<p>Multi-tasking—it’s essential in today’s work environment. To truly transform work, we need tools that can keep up. Watson can now work multiple requests in parallel. For example, a recruiter can ask Watson to schedule interviews and then continue work with Watson while the task is being worked in the background.</p>



 Beyond the chatbot 



<p>IBM Watson Orchestrate isn’t a chatbot, which typically executes dialog trees that terminate when the user response cannot be found in the tree. Watson has an advanced natural language processor to understand intent, break down requests and guide you through a dynamically generated sequence of steps to complete a task. If Watson needs more information or to clarify ambiguity, it asks. When unable to find a skill, Watson guides users to find a new skill or import an existing skill to complete that task.</p>



 Let’s build the future workforce today 



<p>Technology has made large strides, and experiences that were previously impossible are now a reality. It’s time to reimagine work and leave repetitive tasks behind with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-orchestrate">IBM Watson Orchestrate</a>. Empower your team with a tool that works alongside them, understands them, guides them and learns from them as they do their work.</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, business and IT leaders are turning to automation to improve operational efficiency, increase employee productivity and, ultimately, boost business performance.</p>



<p>At IBM, we believe that organizations need AI coupled with automation to help developers reduce time to productivity. By empowering employees with automation and AI technologies like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a>, IT organizations can narrow skills gaps and enable developers to write quality code with greater efficiency.</p>



 Enhance code development with greater efficiency 



<p>At this week’s <a href="http://www.ibm.com/events/think">Think 2023 conference</a>, we are previewing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-code-assistant">IBM Watson Code Assistant</a>, an innovative solution that empowers developers across all skill levels to write syntactically correct code with AI-generated recommendations.</p>



<p>Powered by <a href="http://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">IBM watsonx.ai</a> foundation models, Watson Code Assistant will increase developer productivity by providing recommended code based on natural language inputs. We’re excited about this solution because it will make hybrid cloud code development more accessible to IT professionals and help those experienced with writing automation code to become even more efficient.</p>



<p>Intended to be generally available later this year*, Watson Code Assistant is designed to reduce the complexity of coding through AI-generated content recommendations. Additionally, organizations will be able to tune the underlying foundation model and customize it with their own standards and best practices, while data-source attribution will provide transparency into the potential origins of the generated code. These features will provide organizations the confidence and flexibility they need to scale and accelerate the impact of AI across their IT organization.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for Red Hat automation 



<p>The first available use case for Watson Code Assistant will be content generation for <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible">Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</a>. The solution will enable developers from entry-level to seasoned professionals to write Ansible Playbooks with AI-generated recommendations. This capability will make it easier for beginners to learn Ansible and faster for experts to build playbooks.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed IBM over the past few years, you know how critical the IBM Ecosystem is to our growth strategy. It’s why we <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-partner-ecosystem-growth/">gave partners access</a> to the same training and enablement as IBMers last year, launched a <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-01-04-IBM-Launches-New-Way-to-Partner-through-IBM-Partner-Plus">new partner program</a> in January, and continue <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/partner-plus-takeaways/">investing in and growing</a> the IBM Ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, it should come as no surprise that partners are front and center during our annual Think conference this week. In fact, we kicked off the event with a day dedicated to partners — aptly named Partner Plus Day. It was a phenomenal opportunity to interact with and learn from hundreds of partners, who also heard directly from IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, other senior IBM leaders, and many of their peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three observations stand out to me from Partner Plus Day and Think: First, there is no question we are on the right path, with a singular focus on supporting our partners and clients with a clear strategy and new AI and Hybrid Cloud offerings. Second, it has never been more apparent that IBM and our partners are better together. Third, our growing ecosystem of partners share an inspiring commitment to continued innovation and delivering client value.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Focus, focus, focus&nbsp; 



<p>Three years ago, our CEO declared that IBM’s strategy is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Since then, we have concentrated R&amp;D in those areas, acquired companies with the right mix of capabilities and divested those that don’t align with our focus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM’s announcement today of the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-09-IBM-Unveils-the-Watsonx-Platform-to-Power-Next-Generation-Foundation-Models-for-Business">Watsonx platform to power next generation foundation models for business</a> is a prime example of how we are doubling down on the technology that will transform the enterprise. For example, our focus on enterprise AI will create significant opportunity for partners to increase their capabilities and the value they can bring to clients in this white-hot space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s news follows last week’s announcement that <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-02-SAP-to-Embed-IBM-Watson-Artificial-Intelligence-into-SAP-R-Solutions?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_content=SAPWW&amp;utm_id=IBMData-Khoros-IBMSAPAnnoucement-2023-05-02&amp;sf177457082=1">SAP will embed IBM Watson AI</a> into SAP solutions to deliver a better user experience, faster decision-making, and greater insights to boost productivity. Partnerships like this are increasingly important as we continue scaling hybrid cloud and AI adoption worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 We’re better together&nbsp; 



<p>We’re operating in a market where no one company can succeed alone. But together, we have a massive opportunity to bring solutions to market faster and help achieve more collective success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my on-stage conversation with Ruba Borno, VP of Worldwide Channels &amp; Alliances for AWS, we talked about how work with one partner – in this case, AWS – can translate into joint capabilities that countless other partners can tap into to help clients accelerate their digital journeys. Our partnership with AWS illustrates the value of the IBM Ecosystem – bringing the scale and expertise of many partners together so we can better accelerate client transformation journeys and drive mutual success.&nbsp;</p>



 Our partners are making a difference&nbsp; 



<p>In my <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/partner-plus-takeaways/">last blog</a>, I talked about how far we’ve come with our partner program and our efforts to meet clients where they are. Now I’d like to share a few examples of partner work doing just that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An excellent illustration of how IBM partners are helping enterprises capitalize on the transformative power of AI is Krista Software, which used IBM Watson NLP from IBM’s embeddable AI software portfolio to help its mobile security client, Zimperium, automate its entire scheduling and deployment process. It led to considerable cost savings and freed their engineers to focus on what they do best – developing secure software for clients. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Across the pond, UK-based partner MaxLogic helped their property management client, HFL Building Solutions, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/hfl-building-solutions">unlock the full potential of IBM Maximo</a> by using it to manage 4,000 monthly work orders across 400-plus sites. With a more efficient process in place, HFL was able to reduce the number of open work orders by 95% and substantially improve the quality of information available to its teams and clients. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Showcasing how IBM Ecosystem partners are meeting clients wherever they are, IBM business partner Cleanslate recently worked with a large financial services client migrating to a “cloud first” approach. Cleanslate helped their client implement IBM’s CloudPak for Security on AWS using existing spend commitments with AWS, thus meeting the client where they are while capitalizing on strategic vendor relationships. Cleanslate now provides its clients with the benefits of a reseller relationship and expertise with IBM software solutions, as well as the budget and efficiency benefits of AWS Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These successes validate IBM’s investment in our expanding ecosystem, which is gaining momentum each day. We will maintain our focused strategy, commitment to collaboration and support for our partners, and together I have no doubt we will continue to unlock even greater mutual success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 ‘Data wallets’: a trap waiting to be&nbsp;sprung? <p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Right now, there is an explosion of interest in the concept of ‘data wallets’. The EU has launched an EU Digital Identity Wallet project for example, along with growing fascination with what is being termed <a href="https://www.mydata.org/2023/04/27/wallet-wars-its-the-war-of-ecosystems/">‘wallet&nbsp;wars</a>’.</p><p>In one sense, this is a very positive development. It shows that citizens being in control of their data, and being able to use it for their own purposes, is finally being recognised as important. But it also brings new dangers with it, especially in the form of First Step&nbsp;Fallacy.</p><p>The First Step Fallacy goes like this. Say you want to achieve a goal such as reaching the moon. If you climb to the top of a skyscraper, you’ve gotten closer to your destination. Therefore, you might conclude, if you built a skyscraper ten times higher than the current one, then you’d be ten times closer to your goal. Ergo: all you have to do is build skyscrapers that get taller and taller, and you’ll get there eventually.</p><p>In fact of course, adopting this strategy is a recipe for a) 100% misallocation of resources, investing available time, energy, effort and money in something that will never get you to where you want to get, and b) 0% investment of precious resources into doing what’s needed e.g. building&nbsp;rockets.</p><p>Much of today’s fashionable talk about organisations providing their customers with ‘data wallets’ is a classic example of the First Step Fallacy at work. It’s a trap waiting to be&nbsp;sprung.</p> A word on terminology <p>Before we get into the reasons why, a quick word on terminology. In the previous sentence we put ‘data wallets’ in inverted commas to alert you to the fact that there is much confusion about the difference between data wallets and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>That’s partly because people often use the two terms interchangeably, which is confusing. But what we need to bear in mind is the assumptions and implications generated by the two terms. Most people today use their wallet to do two things. They use it to carry some cash around with them, along with other means of payments such as debit and credit cards. They may also store other information needed for specific transactions, such as membership cards or an organ donor&nbsp;card.</p><p>But there’s one thing nobody does. They never actually carry all of their money around with them in their wallet, or all of their information. It’s just too risky, difficult and unnecessary. A wallet is not the same as a bank account. The wallet might provide a useful interface between your bank account and the outside world, but it is not the bank account&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Likewise with data wallets. A data wallet may help you carry some data ‘cash’ around with you — for example, a piece of information proving that you are over 18, or have a ticket, or a driving licence. It may also provide access to your personal data store. But the data wallet is not your personal data store, just as a wallet for money is not the same as your bank account. A personal data store holds all your data, safe and secure for your whole life. A data wallet may help you draw on your personal data store to interact with the outside world, but the two are not the&nbsp;same.</p> Differences between data wallets and personal data&nbsp;stores <p>This basic terminological confusion — between a wallet that carries some of your money/data and a personal data store/bank account that carries all of it (or much more of it, at least) — is now helping to generate yet another layer of muddle: the pretence that a ‘wallet’ service that retains and extends organisations’ access to, and control over, data is the same as a personal data store which operates independently of this organisation.</p><p>In the first organisation-centric case, an organisation offers a customer a ‘wallet’ where some or all of their data is deposited. Many wonderful claims can be made about such a service. This wallet gives the customer ‘control’ over their data. They can choose who to give access. They can decide who they want to share their data with — data sharing which, it is claimed, will help drive innovation and competition.</p><p>What’s not to like? Individuals are in control. Data is being shared. Markets are working better. It all sounds like an important first step towards the long term goal of citizens being in control of all their data, and improved data sharing driving improved economic performance.</p><p>But look a little closer and things quickly start falling apart. For a start, in this world, each organisation provides their customers with its own separate data wallet. So, if you have data relationships with 50 different organisations, you now have 50 different data wallets. And every time you want to use one with them, you have to sign in separately to do something.</p><p>This is like you needing a separate, different money wallet for every organisation you deal with. One for Sainsbury and a different one for Tesco. One for Amazon, one for the Government and a different one for Marks &amp; Spencer. And so on. Simply Ludicrous.</p><p>But there is an important wrinkle here, which helps explain the attraction of data wallets to some organisations. For historical reasons, some organisations hold data about their customers in a number of different databases where, for technical and regulatory compliance and broader data protection reasons, it’s very difficult to join the dots between the data in these databases. In this case, placing data in a data wallet may help data sharing within the organisation along with the ‘customer benefit’ of only one single sign-in to access data from all of these databases. For some entities like large banks and Governments, this looks like an important benefit.</p><p>But the main benefit is for the organisation (with the customer handed the work of overseeing the data sharing within the organisation), and, crucially, it keeps the data concerned firmly inside the organisation’s data walled garden. In other words, it’s a slightly extended MyAccount service tarted up by fancy new terminology. It’s not really about empowering citizens with their data or unleashing the broader benefits of data sharing beyond the organisation’s boundaries at&nbsp;all.</p> The problems&nbsp;deepen <p>The drawbacks of this approach are profound. Under this system of organisation-provided data wallets the data still sits on databases provided by the organisation, using processes for access and control provided by the organisation. This means the organisation can explicitly forbid or quietly hinder the individual’s ability to share and use their data as they&nbsp;wish.</p><p>At the same time, individuals’ data remains dispersed across dozens (more like hundreds) of different organisations. The individual never becomes the point of integration of their own data. They never build their own personal data asset. And the rich personal, social and economic potential of creating a single place where all of the individual’s data can be aggregated under their control never&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Indeed, if some data sharing happens, where some data is transferred from one organisation to another (as in Open Banking), the individual’s data gets even more dispersed. As a result they face even further loss of control over their data. This is because control can only be exercised by logging in to each separate data wallet, and the more wallets you have the higher the obstacles to exercising real control become. A bigger, taller skyscraper is not the same as a rocket. It’s the opposite.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is only the beginning. The organisation-provided data wallet means the data continues to be held by the organisation, not the individual. This means that across such a system, any data that is shared goes from one organisation’s database to another organisation’s database — never to the individual. In this way, the organisation-centric nature of our data system is not changed but perpetuated, extended and deepened.</p><p>It’s a bit like creating a new market for an exciting new means of transport called the motor car&nbsp;… but only allowing people to ride in taxis. They can order the taxi to go wherever they want (in theory). They are in control. But the one thing they cannot do is own their own car and use it independently. The resulting market would be distorted, truncated and in many cases aborted. Which is precisely what would happen with personal data if the First Step Fallacy of the organistion-centric data wallet was adopted at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>This deepening of the organisation-centric nature of the system brings its own problems with it. For a start, it replicates the incentives of the existing system. Under today’s system, no data controller collecting and holding data about individuals wants to share it with another organisation. Why would they? Doing so is all cost for them with all benefit going to the other organisation. If data is shared under compulsion (as is happening today with Open Banking) the new organisations holding the shared data have exactly the same incentives. They don’t want to share the data they’ve acquired&nbsp;either.</p><p>(Whereas, as we show in our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, if individuals become the independent point at which data about themselves is aggregated, organisations have a very good reason to create a data sharing relationship with these individuals. These individuals now hold a lot of valuable, useful data that they could share if they wanted&nbsp;to.)</p> A complexity catastrophe <p>The problems pile up even higher if attempts are made to operate this organisation-centric approach to data sharing at scale. If the organisation continues to hold the data, it also continues to bear the responsibilities of doing so. It needs to ensure the safety and security of the data. It needs to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. It needs to manage fraud and security risks. And so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Take one example of data sharing via an organisation-held data wallet. For this to happen, the individual has to prove to the organisation that they are indeed the individual seeking the data sharing and not a fraudster. Then, when the new organisation turns up seeking access to the data that is to be shared, the original data controller has to make sure that this is indeed the right, reputable organisation that is accessing the data, and not a front for a fraudster.</p><p>It then has to manage the data sharing process itself. This may be manageable if it is a standard process for just a small handful of other organisations, but it becomes a complete nightmare if the data sharing grows to dozens, or hundreds, of other organisations. In this scenario, the organisation has to find a way of dealing with all the different software systems, formats, processes and so on used by these other organisations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the more organisations it opens its data wallet up to, the more it compromises the security of its own systems. (We explore the inevitable complexity catastrophe that arises as an organisation-to-organisation approach to data sharing begins to scale <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">in this&nbsp;blog</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, if organisations are only sharing data with individuals via personal data stores, the number of data sharing processes they have to oversee is limited to the very small number of personal data store operators, and most of the interoperability, governance and data security costs and risks are passed over to these operators.</p> Conclusion <p>In our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> we show how empowering citizens with their own data via their own personal data stores will unleash immense personal, social and economic benefits: far reaching productivity improvements as all manner of friction, effort, risk and cost in removed from the workings of the system; the integration of different service elements to create better; more personalised services; a turbocharging of data-based innovation. But all this is based on a core design principle — that the individual is able to hold and manage their data separately and independently of the organisations that collect data about them; to become a hub for the sharing of their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>As our White Paper shows, this design principle avoids all the flaws and drawbacks described above. It is rocket building.</p><p>Organisation-provided data wallets may sound good, especially if they are surrounded with rhetoric about individuals being in control, increased data sharing, and so on. But they are just an example of the First Step Fallacy at work. All they will build is a bigger skyscraper. A bigger, more expensive White Elephant.</p><p>The First Step Fallacy is beguiling but dangerous. With ‘data wallets’ it’s a trap that could take many years and huge amounts of effort, energy and money to get out of. Much better not to fall into the trap in the first&nbsp;place.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-wallets-a-trap-waiting-to-be-sprung-857427ec70a">‘Data wallets’: a trap waiting to be sprung</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Customer needs and market dynamics are constantly shifting from one moment to the next. There are thousands of business events flowing through every part of your organization every day. These events can provide a wealth of information about what’s actually happening across your business at any moment in time.</p>



<p>Organizations that can capitalize on this continual stream of business intelligence can spot trends, issues and opportunities, address threats, and act quickly.</p>



<p>But operationalizing business events is challenging. First, events can be locked away across a variety of different data sources, applications and systems. Businesses need a way to unlock the value of their events while they are still actionable.</p>



<p>Second, huge volumes of new events constantly take place across the organization. Businesses need a way to sort, filter and identify the key events that matter most while new ones continue to pour in.</p>



<p>And finally, to make effective use of the event, the context in which it occurs is important. Events need to be processed and combined to identify and act on the business situations that matter. Businesses need a way to accelerate this work without being limited by a need for deep technical skill sets that may be in short supply.</p>



 Become an event-driven business with IBM Event Automation 



<p>Today, IBM is announcing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/event-automation">IBM Event </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/event-automation">Automation</a>, a composable solution designed to help organizations put events to work by enabling business and IT users to detect situations in real-time, act on them and trigger automations to help maximize their revenue potential.</p>



<p>With this new solution, you can help your organization become more responsive to customer needs and resilient in the face of shifting market dynamics.</p>



<p>IBM Event Automation provides an intuitive and integrated experience for distributing, discovering and processing business events across the organization:</p>



 
 Event distribution: Collect raw streams of real-time business events with enterprise-grade Apache Kafka.

You'll learn how to structure your prompts to elicit specific information, as well as techniques for fine-tuning the model to suit your needs. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or just a curious individual, this workshop is designed to give you the skills you need to unlock the full potential of ChatGPT. Join us and take the first step towards creating truly intelligent conversational systems..</p>
<p>When we asked ChatGPT to create a workshop abstract for Identity Security Professionals, this was the output it provided:</p>
<p>"Prompt Engineering is a powerful tool that can enhance the abilities of identity security professionals to perform their job more effectively. The workshop will equip attendees with the skills they need to engineer AI prompts and leverage AI tools to research, communicate, understand new technologies and threats, understand malicious code, detect or scan for vulnerabilities, generate countermeasures, and summarize their findings and communicate status and results effectively.</p>
<p>Attendees will learn how to use natural language processing techniques and machine learning to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their work, and gain a deeper understanding of the most recent trends and developments in the field of identity security. Additionally, by providing an in-depth examination of the latest methodologies and tools used in prompt engineering, attendees will be well-equipped to stay ahead of emerging threats and secure their organizations' sensitive data."</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/workshop-chatgtp-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>Digital sovereignty has become an important topic for individuals as well as a strategic issue for countries and businesses, allowing them to operate in an environment that they trust and can control. This necessitates technology that is not overly reliant on third parties, where there is a risk of misuse of trust or non-compliance.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore 3 dimensions of digital sovereignty related to identity:</p>
 
 Sovereignty of the Individual: The need to protect the individual has triggered privacy laws around the world, like GDPR. Providing end users with more control is now taken one step further with the adoption of the so-called "Self-Sovereign identity (SSI)" and "identity wallets." With SSI, users are in powerful control of their personal data, resulting in a privacy-first user experience. 
 Geopolitical Sovereignty:&nbsp;According to geopolitical sovereignty, data about citizens is subject to the laws and governance of the nation or state to which they belong. As data and the behavior of people become more valuable for countries, the transfer of data is regulated by laws like the US Cloud Act and GDPR. Compliance with cross-border data transfers is becoming more important than ever.&nbsp; 
 Organisational Sovereignty:&nbsp;Organizations want to protect the interests of their employees, gig workers, customers, and business ecosystem. They also have to comply with multiple data sovereignty laws in various countries (for example, Schrems II, CCPA, LGPD, and so on). This leads to questions like, "Where is my data?" "Who has access?" and "Who holds the keys?" The more global organizations are, the more complex this process is due to the numerous local regulations they have to follow.

  <p>The cornerstone of the digital world is trust and key to that experience is a secure and verifiable digital identity. More than one billion people worldwide lack a basic verifiable identity. Without recognizable and consistent proof of identity there can be no financial, health, citizen, or digital inclusion. Women in Identity is a not-for-profit organization championing diversity and inclusion in the identity sector. &nbsp;Women in Identity enables change through awareness from our research projects (such as the code of conduct) and through our sponsors and members.&nbsp; In this keynote the chair and vice chair of the Board will share insights on the impact of identity exclusion and provide practical and pragmatic ways organizations and individuals can help drive Identity inclusion.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/carvalho-lindley-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>Today’s IT leaders are challenged to secure their complex multi-Cloud hybrid organizations while dealing with a severe cybersecurity skills gap and record levels of burnout and dissatisfaction from existing team members. The only way to overcome this challenge is more intelligent and pervasive automation to enforce policies governing access and behavior. IGA traditionally focuses on positive policies to grant access where appropriate, while Risk Management, as the other side of the coin, defines the negative; access, behaviors, and configurations to be prevented or at least identified and mitigated. In this talk, we’ll review how policies for granting and preventing access are complementary and form a balanced Yin and Yang for automation toward a Zero trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-based-automation-eic-2023"></a>

  <p>Identity governance and administration (IGA) is a mission-critical part of every business as it relates to security, compliance, and operations. For large, global enterprises like ABB, finding the right identity solution is especially important—and especially complex. With operations in over 100 countries, 180,000 employees and contractors, 13,000 servers, 6,500 applications, more than 100 HR systems, and a complex Active Directory implementation, this was a challenging undertaking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, attendees will learn how ABB leveraged its existing IT Service Management (ITSM) provider, ServiceNow, and Clear Skye, an identity governance and security solution built natively on the platform, to overcome the business complexities of implementing IGA. By aligning once locally managed systems across the business in one platform, ABB saves time, money, and frustration often associated with new tech integrations and onboarding processes. Stefan Lindner, Global Identity and Access Manager, will discuss how a strategic, platform-first approach to identity enables ABB to:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Webnative is now ODD! Learn why we're renaming our SDK and what you can expect going forward.</p> Why The ODD Name? <p>We decided to rename Webnative to <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD</a> for a couple of reasons. The first was we recognized that there was some confusion between Webnative, the platform, and the Webnative File System protocol. We wanted to distinguish the difference between the two more easily.</p><p>The second reason was that while our SDK is excellent for building web apps, you can also use it to build native apps distributed via an app store, Internet of Things devices...basically, anything communicating over a network with a user interface! ODD SDK is a "learn once, write everywhere" development platform, and potentially even one day, "write once, deploy everywhere." We felt a name change would allow us to share that story more easily.</p><p>We picked ODD for four reasons:</p>  Memorable and Unique: ODD is concise, catchy, and sticks with you, making it easy for you to share with others.   Open Distributed Data: We love backronyms at Fission. The Open Distributed Data explanation fits perfectly as our tech stack fosters openness and collaboration, enabling you to harness the power of distributed data in your applications.   Embracing the Unconventional: Local-first edge computing challenges the status quo. While everyone else focuses on the cloud as the solution for serverless applications, we take the unexpected stand that decentralized tools and systems that inherently respect user privacy, grow with the developer's needs, and offer a credible exit are the answer.  Platform Agnostic: ODD's broad vision and platform-agnostic approach ensure our stack runs everywhere, adapting to the ever-changing tech landscape.   Distinguishing the SDK from the Underlying Protocols <p>It's important to us to distinguish the ODD SDK platform from the underlying protocols. Not everyone is comfortable working (or needs to work) at the protocol level. We wanted to clarify that when bundled in the SDK, you can access those protocols with additional implementations, templates, and libraries to assist you. &nbsp; </p><p>ODD is a true local-first edge application development platform, empowering you to create innovative, resilient applications using open distributed data. Join us on this exciting journey as we embrace the ODD way and shape the future of software development together!</p>

<p>Users will be able to create dapps with wallet-based authentication and equip digital assets with&nbsp;DIDs.</p><blockquote>“We’re thrilled that Apillon is integrating KILT Protocol and decentralized authentication as an essential building block for Web3.” — Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Press Release by&nbsp;Apillon</p><p>Apillon marks a new important milestone by introducing a next-gen Web3 authentication service, powered by <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a>, to the Apillon platform. As devs will be able to seamlessly incorporate decentralized digital authentication and verification into their projects, the end-users will be in total ownership of their data without the need to deal with complex technology.</p> What is KILT Protocol? <p>KILT Protocol is a blockchain identity protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials.</p><p>Anything can have an identity — people, machines, services, and even IoT devices. As credentials are linked to a DID, a digital identity is formed that enables authentication. A DID is at the core of a digital identity and can be added to a digital wallet, meaning the owner of the wallet’s private key is in total control of the stored&nbsp;data.</p><p>Learn more about how KILT Protocol works&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/how-kilt-works">here</a>.</p> In code we&nbsp;trust! <p>Historically, centralized entities have managed authentication for online services, while storing user credentials and monetizing personal data. KILT Protocol restores control and autonomy to the individual, empowering their online interactions.</p><p>As credentials are issued, a user’s data is never stored on the KILT blockchain; only a checksum (hash) representing the information is stored. When a user wants to unlock a service, they can verify their identity or the authenticity of their assets by sharing their credential.</p><p>With verified credentials and DIDs, businesses and app creators can provide a wide range of identity solutions. KILT Protocol use cases span NFTs, gaming, media, financial services, supply chain, IoT and energy. Most recently, KILT Protocol announced exciting partnerships with accounting firm <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/press-releases/articles/deloitte-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-creating-new-markets-with-reusable-digital-credentials.html?id=ch:2sm:3tw:4DMS::6cons:20230504140000::9830713630:5&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_campaign=DMS&amp;utm_content=cons&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;linkId=212869137">Deloitte Consulting AG</a>, global publisher <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/axel-springer-and-kilt-introduce-service-for-login-based-on-web3-technology-db41c2c0ad66?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------">Axel Springer</a>, and music marketplace <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/public-pressure-integrates-kilt-identity-blockchain-to-verify-nfts-and-users-on-its-music-92d9c77515af">Public Pressure</a>.</p> Apillon’s basic Web3 building toolkit soon&nbsp;complete <p>Besides <a href="https://medium.com/apillon/official-partnership-crust-network-to-be-integrated-into-apillons-web3-development-platform-25e49c742fa8">Web3 Storage and Hosting powered by Crust Network</a> on the Apillon platform and <a href="https://medium.com/apillon/partnering-with-phala-network-the-apillon-platform-soon-with-all-essential-web3-features-at-an-cad84bcca904">Web3 Computing to be powered by Phala Network</a>, Web3 authentication is one of the vital Web3 services a developer needs to build a decentralized project from start to&nbsp;finish.</p><p>“KILT Protocol provides one of the essentials for building any kind of application — that is user identification and authorization.

 What Are Threshold Signatures? <p>Threshold signatures are a type of digital signature that requires the agreement of multiple parties, rather than just one, on the message being signed. This makes them useful in a wide range of applications, from identity management to democratic decision-making.</p><p>Threshold signatures provide a secure and decentralized way of ensuring that multiple parties need to agree on a decision before it can be considered valid. These parties are often called "signers" and they each hold a share of a private key, which is necessary to generate the threshold signature. </p> Why Are Threshold Signatures Important?<br>  Decentralization <p>Threshold signatures can be used in decentralized systems where no single party has complete control. This is important for blockchain-based applications where the goal is to create a trustless and decentralized system. In traditional single-party signature schemes (a way to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document), the private key is held by a single entity, making it a single point of failure. If the key is compromised, an attacker can perform fraudulent activities and access sensitive data.</p> Fault tolerance <p>With threshold signatures, a system can still function even if some parties are unavailable or compromised. This provides greater fault tolerance and ensures that the system can continue to operate even in the event of an attack or failure.</p><p>Without threshold signatures, it may not be possible to create certain types of decentralized systems, such as those that require multi-party approval or voting systems. This can limit the potential use cases for a given system.</p> Threshold Signatures Use Case Examples  Distributed Identity Management Systems <p>In traditional identity management systems, a single authority is responsible for issuing credentials. Threshold signatures can be used in distributed identity management systems to allow multiple issuers to jointly issue “claims” about an identity (credentials). </p> Product Approvals <p>In industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, or equipment manufacturing, product approvals by regulatory bodies are crucial. These approvals signify that the product has been tested and meets certain safety and quality standards. Threshold signatures can be used in this context to ensure that a threshold number of regulatory bodies or inspectors have approved the product before it can be released to the market. This provides greater trust to consumers who rely on these approvals to make informed decisions about the products they use.</p> Health and Safety Inspections <p>In industries such as manufacturing, construction, or transportation, health and safety inspections are critical to ensure that workplaces are safe and comply with regulations. Threshold signatures could be used to ensure that a threshold number of inspectors need to sign off on the inspection before it is considered valid. This would provide greater assurance that workplaces are safe and compliant while potentially reducing the risk of accidents or injuries.</p> Petition Systems <p>Petition systems are often used in democratic decision-making processes where a group of individuals need to collectively agree on a decision before it can be made. Threshold signatures can be used in petition systems to ensure that a threshold number of individuals need to sign off on the decision before it can be considered valid. This ensures that decisions are made with the consensus of a group, rather than the opinion of a single individual.</p> How Threshold Signatures Work <p>Threshold signatures work by dividing a private key into multiple parts, or "shares," and distributing those shares among different parties. To create a threshold signature, a threshold number of those parties must come together and combine their shares in a way that produces a valid signature. </p><p>For example, let's say a private key is divided into five shares, and the threshold is set at three. This means that any three out of the five parties can come together and combine their shares to create a valid signature. However, if only two parties try to create a signature, it would be invalid and rejected.</p> Decide Which Threshold Signature Implementation Is Best for You <p>At Dock, we have implemented two variations of threshold signatures (anonymous credentials) with each having different tradeoffs. The first one is based on a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011?ref=blog.dock.io">modified version of Coconut</a>, which uses a different signature scheme called PS. The second is a <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2023/933600c095/1Js0EDGb0n6?ref=blog.dock.io">threshold BBS+</a>, threshold variant of BBS+, our existing signature scheme. </p><p>The benefit of "modified Coconut" is that the threshold signing process is very simple and efficient and it requires no communication among signers. The signers independently generate their signature "share" and send it to the user (holder of the credential) and the user aggregates the shares and generates the final signature which can be verified. </p><p>The downside is that a lot more code has to be written and multiple layers in our system need to be modified to support creating and verifying presentations created from credentials using PS signatures. Another downside is that the size of the signing keys should be proportional to the credential size. This is unlike BBS+. </p><p>The benefit of threshold BBS+ is that only the threshold issuance process has to be built but credential presentation and verification are same as our existing credential implementation. The disadvantage is that issuance requires the signers to communicate among themselves and is much more resource consuming than Coconut. </p><p>Based on the tradeoffs above, applications can choose different implementations.</p> Code Links   <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/bbs_plus/src/threshold?ref=blog.dock.io">Rust implementation of threshold BBS+</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/coconut?ref=blog.dock.io">Rust implementation of Coconut</a>

<p>Liveness detection is a biometric authentication process that verifies whether the user is a live person or just a spoofed artifact. Liveness detection is crucial in preventing security breaches and fraud in biometric systems–an increasingly real threat.</p>
 What Is Liveness Detection and Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive: </p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking.  
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user.  
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition</a> system. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information).  
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake.  
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence.  
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface. </p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data. </p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>
 Liveness Detection with 1Kosmos LiveID 
<p>LiveID is the cornerstone for how 1Kosmos BlockID delivers advanced biometric authentication. Our strong biometric-based identity provides flexible identity assurance and a passwordless experience. With LiveID, users provide a selfie video to the program that can be used as a biometric template for BlockID to verify liveness. This system meets IAL2 verification standards. </p>
<p>Alongside these advances, 1Kosmos BlockID also provides the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.  
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.  
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.  
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>This is going to be a small Dev Pulse; I’m just going to update you on the status of three branches of Holochain. If you’re a developer, I hope you’ll find this useful for planning out your upgrade path.</p><p>Don’t miss the bit at the bottom! A scaffolding template for generating React UIs has been contributed by a thoughtful member of our community!</p> Holochain 0.1.x series: Skip 0.1.4, wait for 0.1.5 <p>In an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-matures/#holochain-011-to-014-bug-fixes-and-backports">update last week</a> to Dev Pulse 133, I reported that there were some ‘slightly breaking’ changes which resulted in some issues that broke the Holonix dev environment. The dev team has reverted part of the change, which may still require a tiny bit of code refactoring in your validation functions but will repair the dev environment.</p><p>There are also some database schema changes in 0.1.4. They don’t affect hApp code, but people using 0.1.4 won’t be able to import their hApp data from 0.1.3 and earlier.</p><p>There is an upcoming version, 0.1.5, which will include the fix for the dev environment as well as a migration path for older database versions. There’s already a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.1.5-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">release candidate for 0.1.5</a> which contains some of the fixes; the final version will contain all of them. We recommend you wait until 0.1.5 is released before upgrading your hApp code and asking your users to upgrade their Launcher.</p> Holochain 0.2.x series: Gossip fix in the works, dev tooling expected for 0.2.1 <p>So the <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1651699231583875077?ref=blog.holochain.org">big news</a> last week is that we released <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain 0.2.0</a> on schedule. This release series includes peer blocking and warrants, which form the foundation of Holochain’s immune system. It also comes with a raft of other updates, like a move to end-to-end-encrypted WebRTC for network communications.</p><p>But! While preparing the dev tooling, a gossip issue was discovered which is causing peers to become unable to communicate with each other. The core team is working on the fix for 0.2.1, after which the dev tooling (client libs, Tryorama, <code>hc</code> dev tool, Launcher, and Holonix dev environment) will be fully tested and released.</p><p>So we recommend you wait until then before updating your code for 0.2.x — and remember that you don’t have to if you don’t need the new features yet. Our six-month support promise for 0.1.x is still there.</p><p>When the dev tools are released, I’ll have a big Dev Pulse for you with all the release notes to help you update your code.</p> Holochain 0.3.x series: Moving right along <p>Although each point release comes with a feature freeze, the core dev team hasn’t stopped adding new ones. Holochain 0.3 and the accompanying dev tooling will include these new features:</p>  A conductor can make multiple WebRTC signal server connections, for increased resilience and availability on local and global networks.  DHT storage arcs can be resized, to let resource-constrained devices throttle their resource contributions or let powerful devices take a larger share.  Zero-sized storage arcs don’t participate in gossip, to allow the most resource-constrained devices to opt out completely.  The Holonix dev environment can pull binaries from a trusted cache on the localnet.  Link retrieval can be batched, and just the count of links can be retrieved.  The HoloPort Alpha network will be used to scale-test Holochain with certain hApps.  <p>Most of these features are in service of in-person hackathons, and more immediately, <a href="http://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a>’s <a href="http://dwebcamp.org/tomorrow/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tomorrow</a> event. On this last full day of the camp, the WiFi meshnet’s link to the global internet will be shut off. It’ll be an opportunity for all the participants to use the offline-friendly, local-first technology they’ve brought. Holochain’s offering (in addition to being a sponsor this year!) will be a hApp to help people organise and take notes for <a href="https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/what-is/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Open Space</a> sessions.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We started off this podcast conversation diving into topics like centralization and decentralization, which we hear so much in our world. I was inspired by a paper I had read earlier in the year called “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nottingham-avoiding-internet-centralization/">Internet Centralization: What can standards do?</a>” (I may have recommended this one a couple of times before!) This paper discusses areas of the internet that are decentralized and centralized, and states that the internet is a global public good because permission is not required to connect to it, deploy an application on it, or use it for a particular purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>“HTTP is therefore an example of platform centralization. While the protocol itself is not centralized, it facilitates the creation of consolidated services and applications like concentration. Platform centralization is difficult to prevent with protocol design.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It was interesting to have a discussion with Daniel about the trade-offs that one needs to make in protocol design and in any software application design. It’s important to consider the impact that these trade-offs will have downstream.</p>
<p>Daniel had written a very timely blog post before our conversation called “<a href="https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/big-desks-and-little-people-e1b1b9e92d79">Big Desks and Little People</a>,” which I also recommend any listener of this podcast to read. Our conversation moved into that space to discuss how certain architectural models create trade-offs. The client-server architectural model, for example, can lead to some imbalances and skew power dynamics towards the server, which in many interactions in our daily life represents an organization we are interacting with.</p>
<p>The purpose of this podcast episode isn’t to sway people against using client-server architecture for digital identity implementations. Rather, we aim to have a discussion around the trade-offs we make when making these architectural decisions. It’s not that client-server architectures don’t work for certain use cases; they do. In fact, a lot of the things we do online today are based on this model and there’s a lot of good stuff. However, it’s important to also talk about the limitations that certain architectures have.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Who defines the interface for the interaction?”</p></blockquote>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>We talked about these limitations, some great things we can do, and some great things we can’t do, with the ultimate goal to further enhance and humanize our digital interactions. We want to establish equal power dynamic opportunities and allow people to authenticate organizations and other people, moving away from just the unidirectional server-to-client or organization-to-person authentication. By humanizing our digital interactions and incorporating this in the way we design protocols, we’ll be able to develop more personalized and flexible opportunities for people to build digital trust and have similar types of opportunities that a server has towards a client.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><br>
Some of the topics discussed between Daniel and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Centralization vs. Decentralization Continuum and the role of client-server architectures – weighing different forms of centralization and their impact on other architectural goals. 
 Protocol design and its relationship to consolidation – How do we determine trade-offs between centralization and decentralization in various components within a system? 
 Balancing architectural goals – is it more of an art or a science when making these decisions – do trade-offs happen at protocol or application layers? 
 Protocol design for digital identity, digital trust, and user categorization – Achieving self-sovereignty, control, and authenticity – Confidentiality and privacy. 
 How do protocol choices affect power dynamics and trust relationships and interactions between different parties? 
 How can we drive the right standards or protocols for more flexible interactions? Incentives for organizations to support standards that facilitate interactions between individuals – Balancing short-term sacrifices for long-term gains – The role of an ecosystem in driving change. 
 Can all human-driven protocols be codified, and is ‘workflow’ flexibility more important than achieving authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy? The challenge of replicating human interactions in digital protocols – The importance of flexible workflows – Balancing security and privacy with the ability to express nuance and adaptability.

 $5000 in prizes to data scientists that predicted $ETH most accurately <p>Predict-ETH Round 5 just completed. There were 19 submissions. We’re ready to announce the winners — drumroll, please!</p>  First place ($2500 in OCEAN) goes to 0xa6fb159f491ed6f33b077ee6e1d271b53ff2cb8b  Second place ($1500 in OCEAN) goes to 0xa69c12ca709919dc291f3e67fdde42d63b7518a0  Third place ($1000 in OCEAN) goes to 0x49e8ffa2332c63c2811da7cf5ab26f223d468f6a  <p>For this round, we went “full anon” so people don’t have to submit their names. That’s why you see addresses (who sent the txs), and that’s&nbsp;all.</p><p>Winners will be airdropped OCEAN into their addresses on Eth&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Each of the winning predictions showcases how to monetize data successfully using Ocean Protocol’s open source tools for the blockchain. Congratulations to&nbsp;all!</p><p>Predict-ETH is a recurring data challenge to predict the price of ETH and win prize money, using the ocean.py library. Accurately predicting ETH can be a valuable tool in buying and selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming, or DeFi protocol development. If your predictions are consistently on point, then you can sell them as a data feed on Ocean Market, earning you even more&nbsp;income.</p><p>Of course, predicting ETH is no walk in the park. It’s a complex task that requires skill, knowledge, and a bit of luck. But that’s exactly why Ocean Protocol hosts regular Predict-ETH competitions — to help you sharpen your machine learning skills, learn from others, and potentially make some cash along the&nbsp;way.</p> Predict-ETH Round 5&nbsp;Setup <p>Predict-ETH Round 5 was <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predict-eth-round-data-challenge-5-is-live-d42ca8cf6af0">announced</a> on Apr 21, 2023. The <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/main5.md">Round 5 README</a> guided contestants how to make their submissions. We held a workshop on Apr 25, 2023 for anyone working on the Predict-ETH challenge who wanted facetime with the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The submission deadline was Wed May 3, 2023, 2023 at 23:59 UTC. Competitors had to make predictions at times: Thu May 4, 2023 at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total).</p> Predict-ETH Round 5 Evaluation <p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or NMSE). That’s all. There is no subjectivity.</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must produce the outcomes that the README guides. This includes:</p><p>✅ Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT</p><p>✅ On the data NFT, set a value correctly: correct field label, correct # predictions, prediction values following correct formatting, predictions encrypted with proper encoding on judges’ public&nbsp;key</p><p>✅ Transferred data NFT to Ocean judges before the submission deadline</p><p>✅ All on Mumbai network, not another&nbsp;network</p> Predict-ETH Round 5 Statistics <p>The following table shows the NMSEs for each competitor, with lowest-NMSE first&nbsp;[1].</p> Conclusion <p>Crypto price prediction can be an interesting and fun task — better yet, it can be monetized immediately!</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners and kudos to all participants for their&nbsp;entries.</p> Updates <p>When this post was first published, the winning addresses were shown as NFT addresses, versus senders’ addresses. That was fixed a few hours&nbsp;later.</p> Notes <p>[1] If an address submitted &gt;1 entry: the lowest was kept, and rest got nmse&nbsp;1.0.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Many of our experiences with social media today are defined by the same constraining dynamics — one private company owns all of our data, populates our feeds with an algorithm of their choice, and we’re unable to take our followers and posts with us to a new home if we ever decide to leave. The AT Protocol, a federated networking model which Bluesky is built upon, changes this.</p>
<p>Soon, we’re launching a sandbox environment to begin the testing phase of federation for the AT Protocol with allow-listed servers. In advance of this launch, we want to share some technical details about our design decisions with you.</p>
<p>At a high level, federation means that anyone can run the parts that make up the AT Protocol themselves, such as their own server. Sandbox mode means that people can start experimenting with federation without interfacing with the actual network — think of it as a test network. If you’d like to run your own server, you’ll be able to do so in the near future.</p>
 Federation Architecture 
<p>The AT Protocol is made up of a bunch of pieces that stack together. (Technically, the lower-level primitives that can get stacked together differently are the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">repositories, lexicons, and DIDs</a>.) This means that the architecture we’re proposing for launching federation is not the only network architecture that’s possible – it’s just what we expect to be the most powerful and robust way of supporting public conversations on a global social network, so we implemented it first.</p>

<p>The three main services of our first federation are personal data servers (PDS), big graph services (BGS), and App Views. Two other roles are in active development: feed generators and labelers.</p>
 
 Personal Data Server (PDS)
 
 A PDS acts as the participant’s agent in the network. This is what hosts your data (like the posts you’ve created) in your <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">repo</a>. It also handles your account &amp; login, manages your repo’s <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview#account-portability">signing key</a>, stores any of your private data (like which accounts you have muted), and handles the services you talk to for any request. 
 
 
 Big Graph Service (BGS)
 
 The BGS handles "big-world" networking.  It crawls the network, gathering as much data as it can, and outputs it in one big stream for other services to use. It’s analogous to a firehose provider or a super-powered relay node. 
 
 
 App Views
 
 An App View is the piece that actually assembles your feed and all the other data you see in the app, and is generally expected to be downstream from a BGS’s firehose of data. This is a highly semantically-aware service that produces aggregations across the network and views over some subset of the network. This is analogous to a prism that takes in the BGS’ raw firehose of data from the network, and outputs views that enable an app to show a curated feed to a user. For example, the BGS might crawl to grab data such as a certain post’s likes and reposts, and the app view will output the count of those metrics.

<p>The federation architecture allows anyone to host a BGS, though it’s a fairly resource-demanding service. In all likelihood, there may be a few large full-network providers, and then a long tail of partial-network providers. Small bespoke BGSs could also service tightly or well-defined slices of the network, like a specific new application or a small community.</p>
<p>There will also be an ecosystem of App Views for each lexicon, or “social mode,” deployed on the network. For example, Bluesky currently supports a micro-blogging mode: the <code>app.bsky</code> lexicon. Developers who create new lexicons would likely deploy a corresponding App View that understands their lexicon to service their users. Other lexicons could include video or long-form blogging, or different ways of organizing like groups and forums. By bootstrapping off of an existing BGS, data collation will already be taken care of for these new applications. They need only provide the indexing behaviors necessary for their application.</p>
 “Big World” Design 
<p>When we were architecting the topology of the AT Protocol, we looked at the web as an example. We see the web as the most successful decentralized system in existence — millions of devices globally connected on an open network — so we’re taking it as a null hypothesis of what works best.</p>
<p>As a result, we opted to architect the protocol in a “big world with small world fallbacks” way. With the web, individual computers upload content to the network, and then all of that content is then broadcasted back to other computers. Similarly, with the AT Protocol, we’re sending messages to a much smaller number of big aggregators, which then broadcast that data to personal data servers across the network. Additionally, we solve the major problems that have surfaced from the web through <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol">self-certifying data, open schematic data and APIs, and account portability</a>.</p>
<p>On a technical level, prioritizing big-world indexing over small world networking has multiple benefits.</p>
 
 It significantly reduces the load on PDSs, making it easier to self-host — you could easily run your own server. 
 It improves discoverability of content outside of your immediate neighbors — people want to use social media to see content from outside of their network. 
 It improves the quality of experience for everyone in the network — fewer dropped messages or out-of-sync metrics. 
 
<p>Given all that, our proposed methodology here of networking through BGSs instead of server-to-server isn’t prescriptive. The protocol is actually explicitly designed to work both ways.</p>
 What’s Next For Us 
<p>We strongly believe that for federation to matter, all the pieces must be easy for you to set up. When we launch our sandbox environment publicly, we’ll provide straightforward instructions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re working on two more pieces of federation: <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">feed generators</a> and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">labelers</a>. Currently, Bluesky’s App View generates some “opinionated” data (as in, it differentiates between pieces of data, unlike a giant firehose of data), like the feeds that we show users and the labels we use in content moderation. But we’re experimenting with splitting feed generators and labelers out as services of their own, and when that’s complete, anyone may host a feed generator and advertise it to users in the marketplace of algorithms.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, here’s one potential architecture: A feed generator can exist downstream of some BGS and App View, where the feed generator is constrained to offering “candidates” for the feed. Then, the App View presents the actual view of that data to the user.</p>
<p>Similarly, a labeler would also be downstream of a BGS. Its labels would then be ingested by either an App View or a semantically-aware PDS.</p>
 Sandbox Mode 
<p>We will be initially launching federation in sandbox mode with allow-listed servers. This means we’ll be running it in a staging environment that gets reset at least once a week, allowing the network to test it out before going live with all existing user data. Having a sandbox environment is very useful, as it will allow us and all developers in the ecosystem to stress-test and debug the system. The sandbox environment we’ve set up can be used to test out future major protocol changes as well. You can participate in the sandbox as a developer or a user — just be aware that things will break, and your data will get wiped!</p>
<p>The sandbox environment is also useful to us as we finish building out our moderation and curation tooling. Before we open federation entirely, we want to provide other servers with the same toolbox that we’re using to curate a safe social media experience, and developers can also build more moderation tools on top of atproto themselves.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more soon about moderation, and about how to start experimenting with the sandbox environment.</p>

 Deloitte Integrates KILT Identity Blockchain, Creating New Markets with Reusable Digital Credentials <p>ZÜRICH, SWITZERLAND and BERLIN, GERMANY, 4 May 2023 — BOTLabs GmbH, developer of KILT Protocol, and Deloitte Consulting AG today announced the integration of KILT blockchain technology for issuing reusable digital credentials to support KYC and KYB processes. These credentials have multiple use cases including regulatory compliance for banking and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins and fundraising.</p><p>The purpose of a Know Your Customer/Know Your Business check is to verify the identity of an individual or the existence of a business. The process is typically inefficient for the verifying entity and repetitive for the individual customer:</p><p>● KYC/KYB certificates are often paper-based, creating extra work to&nbsp;process.</p><p>● Identity verification processes often request multiple data points when only one is needed, such as date of birth or country of residence.</p><p>● Data collection and storage of personal information across multiple platforms and databases put consumer data privacy at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>● The verification check results in a certificate that can only be used once by the verifier and the customer.</p><p>● The customer never receives the certificate.</p><p>Reusable KYB and KYC credentials, generated on KILT’s identity infrastructure, solve many of these challenges while offering control and flexibility to the customer. Credentials are stored in the customer’s wallet on their own device, remaining under their control at all times. The customer can choose with whom they share their credential and which data points of the credential they make available.</p><p>In order for the customer to manage and share their credential, Deloitte is providing a credential wallet in the form of a browser extension. Setting up a wallet is a straightforward, seamless process that doesn’t require any blockchain knowledge by the customer.</p><p>“By offering reusable digital credentials anchored on the KILT blockchain, Deloitte is transforming verification processes for individuals and entities,” said Micha Bitterli, Head of Deloitte Managed Services. “Digital credentials that are convenient, cost-effective and secure have the potential to open new digital marketplaces, from e-commerce and DeFi to gaming. Deloitte has the technology knowledge, reach and trust to issue credentials that are globally accepted.”</p><p>Credentials are digitally signed by Deloitte. Deloitte can revoke credentials using blockchain technology if conditions of the customer have changed after the credential was&nbsp;issued.</p><p>”With streamlined identity solutions “Built on KILT”, customers can use verifiable digital credentials across multiple services, while retaining control over when and where to share their personal information. And as a Polkadot parachain, KILT offers the scale and security needed by enterprise partners”, said Ingo Rübe, CEO of BOTLabs GmbH and founder of KILT Protocol.</p> About Deloitte Managed&nbsp;Services <p>Deloitte Managed Services is a leading European RegTech Provider of end-to-end managed services for KYC and AML.

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>
 SelfKey’s visions for a safer digital future 
<p>Recent events have demonstrated the devastating impact that data breaches can have on individuals and organizations. That's why SelfKey is emphasizing the importance of security and privacy when it comes to online interactions and digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By developing decentralized solutions with <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> in mind, SelfKey is using the potential of modern technology in its aim to counteract these breaches. <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-powered proof of individuality</a> is one solution that may fight against maliciously used AI, to prevent identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to raise awareness about data breaches and their potential consequences. To teach individuals and organizations about how to prevent them or how to respond in case one occurs.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In this modern, digital world, we have normalized sharing our personal data online. However, this does not mean that our personal information is necessarily safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, data breaches are becoming more and more common, and the consequences can be severe and irreversible. That's why it's crucial for individuals and organizations to take caution when sharing and storing their personal data.</p>
<p>SelfKey is focused on developing solutions which may prevent data breaches and enable individuals to operate safely in the digital world. At the heart of their approach is a commitment to the idea that privacy is a basic human right that should not be traded for convenience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By prioritizing privacy and security in their technology solutions, SelfKey is aiming to help empower individuals to take control of their digital identities and protect their personal information.</p>

  RainbowKit provides an easy and convenient way for users of your dapp to connect any wallet they have so they can Sign-In With Ethereum and get started using it. In this example, we will show you how to quickly create a new dapp that uses RainbowKit and Sign-In with Ethereum with SSX.

<p>RainbowKit provides an easy and convenient way for users of your dapp to connect any wallet they have so they can Sign-In With Ethereum and get started using it. In this tutorial, we will show you how to quickly create a new dapp that uses RainbowKit and Sign-In with Ethereum with SSX. &nbsp;</p><p>This guide will show you how to:</p>  Create a new dapp using SSX's dapp creation tool  Add SSX, wagmi, and RainbowKit dependencies  Run the dapp  <p>Let's get started.</p> Getting Started <p>To get started, we will use SSX’s dapp creation tool. Type the following into your terminal:</p> <code>yarn create @spruceid/ssx-dapp rainbowkit-example
</code> <p>In this tutorial, we are using a project with the following configuration:</p> <code>✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Which will be your default provider? › MetaMask
✔ Which features would you like to enable? › None
✔ Provide the SSX enabled server URL (leave blank if none) … </code> <p>After you have created the project, navigate to the <code>rainbowkit-example</code> directory you just created and add dependencies with the following commands:</p> <code>yarn add @spruceid/ssx-react @rainbow-me/rainbowkit wagmi
</code>  Adding RainbowKit, Wagmi, and SSX  <p>Go to <code>src/index.tsx</code> and add the following to wrap your <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> component with <code>&lt;WagmiConfig /&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;RainbowKitProvider/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;SSXProvider/&gt;</code> components, making it look like the following:</p> <code>/** src/index.tsx **/
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { RainbowKitProvider, getDefaultWallets } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';
import { goerli, mainnet, configureChains, createClient, WagmiConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';
import { SSXProvider } from '@spruceid/ssx-react';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

const { chains, provider } = configureChains(
  [mainnet, goerli],
  [publicProvider()]
);

const { connectors } = getDefaultWallets({
  appName: 'SSX Rainbow Kit Example',
  chains,
});

const wagmiClient = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors,
  provider,
});

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);

root.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}&gt;
      &lt;RainbowKitProvider chains={chains}&gt;
        &lt;SSXProvider&gt;
          &lt;App /&gt;
        &lt;/SSXProvider&gt;
      &lt;/RainbowKitProvider&gt;
    &lt;/WagmiConfig&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
);
</code> <p>At <code>src/App.tsx</code> some changes are required to hook SSX and RainbowKit together. Add the following imports and update the App component as the code below:</p> <code>/* src/App.tsx */

import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useConnectModal, useAccountModal, ConnectButton } from '@rainbow-me/rainbowkit';

        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

							<p>For years, most internet and social media users have understood that they need to take everything they see online with a <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/the-internet-was-built-without-an-identity-layer/">grain of salt</a>. After all, there’s no requirement to publish the truth on the internet. This understanding may be hard-won, but it’s now an expected part of daily tasks ranging from checking email to exploring social media, selling used items, or online dating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we know to tamp down our excitement when we get a message from a Nigerian prince or receive an offer from someone who wants to pay double for our used merchandise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the rising trend of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90829233/deepfakes-get-ready-for-phishing-2-0">deepfakes</a> has disrupted these tasks once more. Learning how to identify and respond to these fraudulent images, video, or audio is now a required skill for anyone who uses the internet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deepfakes have become a valuable tool for scammers, who use them to deceive both individuals and organizations alike. If you’ve fallen for one of these scams before, don’t feel bad. This is a new and emerging technology, and many countries have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/business/media/deepfake-regulation-difficulty.html">struggled to respond</a> in a way that protects innocent, honest people. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we’ll explore the rising trend of deepfakes and show how Dentity can step in to help protect you from falling victim to these scams. &nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 <p>What is a Deepfake?</p> 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>First, we need to learn as much as possible about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them">deepfakes</a>, so we can figure out how to defend ourselves against them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deepfakes are AI-generated media that uses a technology called deep learning to generate an image, audio, or video file of something fake. Often, they use a person’s actual image or voice and put it in situations that have never happened in real life. However, deepfake technology can also be used to create an entirely fictional persona, including realistic moving video.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Early deepfakes were primarily used for adult content purposes, but since 2019, scammers have learned how to deepfake a voice and this trick has crept slowly into more mainstream online outlets.</p>

			 Common Deepfake Scams 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Unfortunately, there are lots of common scams that take advantage of deepfakes and deep learning technology. Here are some of the most prevalent in 2023. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A panicked loved one on the phone</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This deepfake scam that uses an AI model to simulate a person’s voice has swindled over <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/rising-scams-use-ai-to-mimic-voices-of-loved-ones-in-financial-distress/">$11 million</a> from more than 5,000 victims in 2022 alone. Using just a few sentences of audio, a scammer can use deep learning technology to create a model of a person’s voice that they can then use to say whatever they want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In most situations, this scam is conducted over the phone. The victim will receive a call from what looks like their loved one’s phone number, then hear a voice that sounds exactly like their friend or family member urgently asking for their help. Victims then send money through Bitcoin and gift cards, which is nearly impossible to get back.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Voice phishing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A similar technology can also be used to solicit sensitive information that would otherwise not be disclosed. This is known as voice phishing, or <a href="https://safecomputing.umich.edu/be-aware/phone-scams">vishing</a>. In these situations, the deepfake technology is used to simulate a trusted individual’s voice, which they use to request sensitive information that can be used for identity theft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Typically, in these situations, the scammer isn’t asking for money directly but may seek to learn your credit card number, address, or Social Security number. This information can then be used to access more funds or sold on the dark web.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>How to Ensure You’re Interacting with Real People Online</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>It’s easy to get taken in when you’re getting a call that sounds exactly like someone you know. It makes it so much easier to overlook other red flags that you may have noticed otherwise.</p><p>Don’t blame yourself! To help you stay safe, check out the following tips to ensure you’re always interacting with real people online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hang up and call back</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s now effortless to fake a caller ID number. If you get a call from someone who says they’re a friend or family member, don’t give into the panic. Hang up and call them back at their real number. If they’re really in distress, they’ll answer again, and you can continue the conversation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be skeptical of anything that seems too good to be true</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Deepfake scams often rely on fake videos or audio of individuals saying or doing things they wouldn’t normally do. If something seems out of character for the person you’re talking to, be skeptical.

<p>FINRA compliance is a series of requirements that apply to financial brokers and their representatives meant to ensure that they adhere with anti-fraud laws. FINRA guides critical anti-fraud measures and their implementation through cybersecurity and identity verification controls that governed entities must implement. FINRA compliance is, therefore, crucial for any financial institution.</p>
 What Is the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)? 
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) that oversees brokerage firms and their registered representatives in the U.S. It was established in 2007 as a result of the merger between the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the regulatory and enforcement arm of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Although it is not a government agency, FINRA operates under the supervision of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Any disputes regarding compliance with these rules will often run through both FINRA and the SEC.</p>
<p>FINRA’s primary responsibility is to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the securities markets with rules governing the conduct of brokers and dealers and by examining firms for compliance with those rules. In addition to rulemaking and enforcement, FINRA provides education and training programs for financial professionals, arbitrates disputes between investors and brokers, and offers resources to help investors make informed decisions.</p>
<p>As such, FINRA rules will touch on several different domains affecting securities-related professionals. These include:</p>
 
 Licensing: Ensuring that brokerage firms and their representatives are properly registered and licensed to operate in the securities industry. 
 Communications: Guarantee that promotional materials and communications with the public are truthful, accurate, and not misleading. 
 Recordkeeping: Requiring that brokerage firms maintain accurate records of transactions, client information, and other relevant documentation. 
 Legal Enforcement: Identifying potential market manipulation, insider trading, and other violations of securities laws and regulations. 
 
<p>Firms and individuals who fail to comply with FINRA’s rules and regulations may face disciplinary actions, fines, suspensions, or even expulsion from the securities industry.</p>
 What Are FINRA Requirements? 
<p>FINRA compliance requirements cover a broad range of areas to ensure the integrity and fairness of the financial markets and the protection of investors. While it is not possible to list every specific requirement here, some critical aspects of FINRA compliance include:</p>
 
 Registration: Brokerage firms and their representatives must be registered with FINRA and obtain appropriate licenses (such as Series 7 and Series 63) to conduct securities business. Firms must also ensure that their representatives meet continuing education requirements. 
 Supervision: Brokerage firms must establish and maintain written supervisory procedures to ensure compliance with securities laws and regulations. This includes designating responsible individuals (such as a Chief Compliance Officer). 
 Advertising: Promotional materials, including advertisements and public communications, must be accurate. Firms must have procedures to review and approve these materials before distribution. 
 AML and KYC Laws: Firms must ensure adequate information about their clients’ financial situations, background information, and risk tolerance. Additionally, brokerage firms must establish AML programs that include written policies, procedures, and controls to detect and address potential or ongoing money laundering activities. This includes identifying potential criminals before they become customers as well as addressing customer account takeover of legitimate customers. 
 Documentation and Surveillance: Firms must keep secure records of all transactions and maintain systems that monitor those systems for evidence of tampering, manipulation, or insider trading. 
 Cybersecurity: Firms must develop and maintain business continuity plans to ensure the ongoing operation of their business in the event of significant disruption. They must also implement cybersecurity measures to protect client information and the integrity of their systems. This includes standard security controls like account management, authentication services, access controls, reporting and audit tools, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication.</a> 
 
<p>It’s important to note that these are just some of the main areas of FINRA compliance. The <a href="https://www.finra.org/registration-exams-ce/qualification-exams/registration-requirements-faq">specific requirements for each firm</a> may vary based on factors such as its size, the nature of its business, and the types of products and services it offers.</p>
 FINRA and KYC Laws 
<p>FINRA’s KYC requirements are part of Article 2090 of FINRA, titled “Know Your Customer,” which mandates that all members must conduct reasonable due diligence about their customers. This due diligence includes “essential” facts about that customer, from personal identification to a financial situation.</p>
<p>Key elements of the KYC process under FINRA’s framework include:</p>
 
 Customer Verification: Brokers must verify the identity of their clients. This practice typically involves collecting personal information such as name, date of birth, address, Social Security or Tax Identification number, and other identification documents. 
 Customer Due Diligence: Brokers must gather information about the client’s financial situation, investment experience, risk tolerance, investment objectives, and time horizon. This process may involve asking detailed questions and reviewing relevant documents, but it must occur before the brokers provide consulting or strategic services. 
 Ongoing Monitoring: Brokers must continuously monitor their clients’ accounts, mainly when there are changes in the client’s financial situation, investment objectives, or risk tolerance. Additionally, this monitoring must include controls around unexpected or suspect behavior that might point to fraud or money laundering activity. 
 Recordkeeping: Firms must maintain records of the information collected during the KYC process and any client profile updates. 
 
<p>Adhering to KYC requirements not only helps brokerage firms comply with FINRA rules but also assists in meeting other regulatory requirements such as AML and combating the financing of terrorism operations.</p>
 What’s the Relationship Between FINRA Compliance and the Customer Identification Program (CIP)? 
<p>The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/kyc-cip/">Customer Identification Program</a> is a crucial component of the broader regulatory compliance framework for financial institutions in the United States, including brokerage firms overseen by FINRA. CIP requirements are mandated by the USA PATRIOT Act and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), with FINRA being responsible for examining and ensuring compliance among its member firms.</p>
<p>The CIP is designed to help financial institutions verify the identity of their customers, prevent fraud, and combat money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. FINRA member firms must establish and maintain a written CIP compliant with the USA PATRIOT Act and related regulations.</p>
<p>Key FINRA requirements for CIP include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-verification-system/">Identity Verification</a>: Firms must obtain specific information from customers when opening an account, such as name, date of birth, address, and identification number (Social Security number for U.S. persons or other government-issued identification numbers for non-U.S. persons). In some cases, firms may require additional information or documentation. 
 Customer Notices: Firms must provide customers with clear and conspicuous notice, either in writing or electronically, that they are requesting information to verify their identity as federal law requires. This notice must be given before the account is opened or at the time of account opening. 
 Government Lists: Firms must have procedures in place to determine if a customer appears on any list of terrorists or terrorist organizations provided by the federal government. 
 Risk: Firms must develop risk-based procedures, considering various factors such as the types of accounts offered, the methods used to open accounts, and the firm’s size and customer base. 
 
<p>It’s important to note that the CIP requirements are just one aspect of a firm’s broader compliance obligations under FINRA and other applicable regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) rules.</p>
 What Are Best Practices for Meeting FINRA Requirements? 
<p>Like any other framework, FINRA has a few best practices that companies can adhere to. While there aren’t specific technological requirements to meet, there are basic functionality that must be present. Thus, following these best practices will help you meet requirements:</p>
 
 Identity and Access Management: It’s critical that governed entities have systems and processes in place to verify user identity (based on KYC and AML laws) for either background or authentication management. Alongside this, authentication systems should include MFA and include additional controls to protect against unauthorized access (such as following the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">principle of least privilege</a>). 
 Liveness Proofing: For more advanced ID verification and security, organizations can, and should, use liveness proofing through biometrics to strengthen their authentication and verification approaches. 
 Record Security: A necessary aspect of FINRA is protecting user information, specifically financial records and behaviors, from outside interference. This can play a role in monitoring efforts for AML compliance. As such, encryption, perimeter security, and auditable systems are important.

This has been a valuable learning experience in terms of understanding the depth and nuances of the transition challenges, but theories can only get us so far. Critically, there is a need to test our assumptions and conclusions in the messy and unpredictable reality of life, if we are to offer anything more than our opinions.</p><p>We might advocate for a low build future in Europe, or for significantly reducing our reliance on traditional construction materials. But what would this look like for an organisation urgently trying to provide shelter to climate refugees? How do we justly share our existing material and land assets and what are the fiscal incentives that could drive this? Actively involving people in the transition decisions that affect them seems essential. However, with the cost-of-living crisis and general political apathy, what kind of citizen engagement processes are appropriate? To start answering these questions we began mapping organisations who are working on the practical aspects of Europe’s decarbonisation and inclusivity challenges. Our intention was to identify and categorise factors such as the differing theories of change, tactics, operational models and collaborative opportunities.</p><p>On the face of it, this seemed like a relatively straightforward task. As a team we are in regular communication with many innovative actors working in this space and have a wide network of contacts to draw on. Interestingly however, our lived experience was less clear-cut and at times frustratingly convoluted. Initially it seemed logical to begin by building on our existing knowledge base, but we were aware of the pitfalls of researcher bias and the comfort of our own echo chamber¹. We also wanted to reach out to unknown corners of Europe to look for sparks of creative innovation, whilst retaining a healthy respect for the infinite potential of Google’s virtual rabbit holes. These kinds of challenges and contradictions will be familiar to anyone who has ever undertaken research, so developing an analytical structure seems like an obvious response. In this case however, we were not so&nbsp;sure.</p><p>Aphanipoiesis is a concept recently defined by the systems scientist Nora Bateson, to explain the way in which ‘life coalesces toward vitality in unseen ways’². It is intuitively easier to name what we can see and then strive to innovate and change it, than to hold a position of open curiosity. In her view however, most of the problems that we can identify and ‘solve’ are in fact already old news. Whilst tantalisingly hazy, Bateson’s framing resonated strongly with our sense of unease; what if by attempting to envision the future based on our understanding of the present, we would in fact dampen the power of emergent possibility? Could structuring our research using respected conceptual tools (such as the IFF’s <a href="https://medium.com/activate-the-future/the-three-horizons-of-innovation-and-culture-change-d9681b0e0b0f">3 Horizons model</a>), in fact fundamentally restrict what we might&nbsp;find?</p><p>After reflecting on these tensions, we settled on a semi-structured approach that built on our earlier analysis (presented in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">Blogs 1</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-961744d2cb36">2</a> of this series), to create a loose guide for the types of organisations and pathways we hoped to identify. Our starting point was to look at the physical and structural constraints that we considered to be the most dominant and problematic for the built environment’s transition. From here, we were then able to start thinking about the new types of capabilities that would be vital in addressing them, thus positioning organisations as capability building pathways rather than as standalone innovators.</p> Introducing two groups of innovation actors <blockquote>During the active research phase of this work we were privileged to engage with many profoundly inspiring organisations. We cannot do justice to the depth and spread of these initiatives in a single blog, but we have created <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=share_link">this linked pdf</a> of case studies which we hope other researchers will find useful. For the purpose of this summary, we would like to propose two broad groupings of actors, who we identified as being discrete and yet of equal importance:</blockquote>  Core organisations: this group contains actors who are operating at the intersection of economic, ownership and governance issues, that specifically relate to land and buildings. We see these organisations as providing a central framework for the transition, as they vertically span multiple levels of the system and can provide cohesion and strength to more peripheral activities. Examples include community land trusts³ such as <a href="https://www.cltb.be/what-do-we-do/?lang=en">CLT Brussels</a>, cooperative housing networks such as <a href="https://moba.coop/">MOBA </a>in Eastern Europe and <a href="https://sostrecivic.coop/?lang=en">Solstre Civic</a> in Spain and cohousing facilitators such as <a href="https://www.housinglab.it/">Housing LAB,</a> Italy and <a href="https://www.syndikat.org/en/">Miethäusersyndikat</a> in&nbsp;Germany.  Adjacent, foundational support organisations: although less obviously linked to inclusive land and building innovations, we see these actors as building the critical foundations and pathways towards scaled transition models. They are generally more focused in a single domain of the system, thus fusing deep expertise with innovative scalability. A good example of this type of actor is <a href="https://www.mobius-reemploi.fr/">Mobius</a> in France, who are improving the reuse of materials in the construction industry by sourcing and supplying reusable construction materials. Another would be the <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/media/wmxlklns/about-gri-brochure-2022.pdf">GRI</a> (Global Reporting Initiative) who are looking at developing a construction industry specific sector standard, as part of their 3-year pipeline.  <p>The two organisational mapping diagrams shown below are available in an interactive format so that you can click directly through to their website. Please <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=share_link">click on this link</a> to access the interactive pdf.</p>Group 1: Core organisations mapped in relation to their scalability (system change Vs transition demonstration) and the extent of focus on decarbonisation.Group 2: Adjacent organisations Collaborative housing: beautiful exceptions or a realistic pathway to scalable housing inclusivity? <p>When you think about collaborative housing models, what comes to mind? Common responses might be that they are member owned, democratically run and designed to meet a common need. In the examples of Solstre Civic and MOBA these values are central, but there are some additional design principles that neatly transcend traditional extractive and speculative real estate models. The first is the idea of collective ownership where the cooperative remains the owner of the property indefinitely, thus making it impossible for members to profit from selling or renting their individual units. The second relates to the concept of the right to use which grants residents a lifetime right to a stable home in exchange for a moderate monthly fee. As the fee is determined by the shared costs of the cooperative rather than by market prices, they remain stable irrespective of real estate market fluctuations.</p><p>These types of organisations present strong alternative models to create affordable housing, with the potential to spread across different countries and to both urban and rural contexts. A bold illustration from Ukraine is Metalab’s <a href="https://www.metalab.space/co-haty-eng">Co-Haty</a> project, which is currently retrofitting and repurposing vacant properties for war refugees, with the longer term goal of developing a cooperative housing network. Despite this potential, our dialogues with actors spanning the European region exposed some interesting challenges to this theory of change. For example, how feasible or attractive is a collaborative living set up if you come from a minority or vulnerable group? How exactly could these types of models be financially scaled in less supportive political or banking contexts? What are the cultural norms that might encourage or impede the uptake of cooperative models in specific countries or&nbsp;regions?</p><blockquote>“In the past 20 years, the cooperatives have been reframed as a kind of tool that we call the economics of the poor………this is a niche where you can stay but if you want to get out into the real economy, people would say: what are you doing? This is not your space, get back to your safe space.” — Jan Zygmuntowski, CoopTechHub</blockquote><p>In a fascinating conversation with <a href="https://www.hub.coop/en/">CoopTechHub</a> from Poland, we began to appreciate how a lack of trust in the general model of cooperativism can be a barrier to their use as a viable economic model. In their view, one reason for this distrust in Poland is the historical context of the country’s communist past and the subsequent transformation to a capitalist market society in the 1990s. In the post war period, cooperatives operated under a central planning model which essentially stripped them of the principles of self-governance. Later, during the years of economic ‘shock therapy’ fiscal disincentives (for example new taxes prevented wage rises in the public and cooperative sectors), further eroded the legitimacy of the cooperative model⁴. In Poland today their experience is that cooperatives are widely viewed as facilitating the “economics of the poor”; social organisations for disadvantaged people rather than active market players. In their work, CoopTechHub are aiming to reframe this narrative and ignite a new model of digital cooperativism in the real economy, through a combination of digitization, research and advocacy. This work is demanding and opaque in terms of tangible outcomes, yet it seems an essential component to any wide scale uptake of cooperative housing models in the&nbsp;region.</p><p>Whilst there are no one size fits all solutions to collaborative housing, the cooperative model does in our view provide a robust, non-extractive alternative to traditional private property ownership patterns. This feels like a solid base to work from but even the strongest core models do not operate in a vacuum. If our goal is to amplify an inclusive and regenerative built environment, then we must also consider the auxiliary functions that make them operationally possible. Finance is an obvious example because it provides the lifeblood for any type of development. In countries with a strong history of collaborative housing, obtaining commercial funding is a viable pathway, but what are the options in less sympathetic environments? Philanthropy could offer a possible route, but the scale of transformation needed makes providing scaled capital support unrealistic. One organisation highlighting and working to address this issue is <a href="https://www.positivemoney.eu/about-us/">Positive Money Europe</a>, who are currently campaigning for banks to play their part in Europe’s green transition. Their core tactics are to repurpose existing institutions and processes (such as the European Central Bank’s low or negative interest refinancing options for commercial banks⁵), to enable wide scale building renovations across the EU. Although the proposed intervention is intended to act on renovation loans it could be scaled to other types of funding, thus creating critical pathways for collaborative models in less supportive political contexts⁶.</p><p>Even if the funding for sustainable renovations can be democratically unlocked, procuring the necessary materials throws up its own set of challenges. When we talk about retrofitting we are generally referring to insulating against the cold, but for many poorer countries in Europe the issue is in fact mitigating against heat. Fuel poverty is a well publicised social problem, but what about the inclusivity of heat regulation? If energy prices remain high whilst temperatures continue to rise, vulnerable communities will need urgent alternatives to air conditioning. One innovative response is being developed by <a href="https://justnatureproject.eu/">JustNature</a> (a collaboration between the University of Malta and the city of Gzira), which is experimenting with green roofs and walls to reduce the summer heat pressure and expedite carbon capture. Another issue affecting both new builds and refurbishments, is the intersection of the deepening global material crisis with the physical destruction of war. The scale of the reconstruction necessary is humbling and whilst there are extraordinary glimmers of hope (such as <a href="https://fundacjabrda.org/en/co-robimy/">Brda</a> in Poland who have been sending used windows to Ukraine and are now creating a registry of reusable materials), the need for an alternative and inclusive material infrastructure is profound.</p> Building a vision: is the current state of our collective imagination both dangerous and regressive? <p>Mark Carney has described the climate crisis as a ‘tragedy of the horizon’. A type of coordination failure on a global scale, that seems equally applicable to the current inadequate trajectory of Europe’s green transition. This is a true tragedy in the literary sense of the word; a disastrous event with mitigations and solutions that we seemingly cannot bring ourselves to enact. The classic example of such a self-induced trap is the tragedy of the commons, which whilst debunked by Elinor Omstrom at a local level, unfortunately still holds true in the global context (carbon emissions, rare mineral mining for batteries, etc.). This has serious implications for a just transition in Europe, because decarbonising individual cities or countries will be ineffectual if these trends continue to play out and we do not foster alternative cultural attractors. If we can’t solve any of the individual problems (e.g. continent-wide retrofitting or repurposing of vacant space) without solving all of the linked problems (e.g. inclusive financing mechanisms), then it is critical that we begin looking for actors who can play meaningful orchestration roles.</p><p>It seems likely that this collective action impasse is closely bound to a failure of the imagination: without a clear and widely appealing vision for a different future, the motivation to push for political change is severely dampened and business as usual prevails. This is a challenge being taken up by the team at<a href="https://www.civocracy.org/"> Civocracy</a> who are supporting cities to develop meaningful citizen engagement processes. Their work is interwoven with many of the barriers and opportunities highlighted above, because in both cases strong local civic support will be needed to shift and repattern entrenched behaviours. A brilliant illustration of this kind of repatterning pathway can be seen in Athens, where <a href="https://curingthelimbo.gr/the-idea-en">Curing the Limbo</a> are creating new models for cities and refugees to coexist and thrive, through the linked provision of language lessons, retraining and affordable housing.</p> The journey&nbsp;ahead <p>To take this work forward we now need to step back and think strategically about the pathways and tools that we have begun to map (both nascent and established), together with those that still need to be built. This will require asking some hard yet essential questions and boldly challenging the landscapes of existing innovation, to highlight the gap that is emerging between even the most inspiring initiatives and society’s future needs. What is the potential for radical collaboration and evolution? Where are the weaknesses, gaps and bottlenecks? How are these efforts being bolstered or restricted by the existing funding networks? What kind of role (if any) could Dark Matter Labs play in supporting and amplifying this emerging network? This will be the subject of our next blog and a big focus for our work in 2023 and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) An echo chamber is an environment where somebody only interacts with information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their&nbsp;own.</p><p>(2) <a href="https://norabateson.medium.com/aphanipoiesis-96d8aed927bc">https://norabateson.medium.com/aphanipoiesis-96d8aed927bc</a></p><p>(3) Community Land Trusts are not-for-profit organisations that own and develop land on behalf of the community.

 Demystifying the FATF Travel Rule: Your Most Googled Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;2   VASPs face multiple challenges in complying with the FATF Travel Rule, such as ensuring data privacy, achieving interoperability, allocating resources, and navigating jurisdictional differences.  To safeguard user privacy and enhance user experience, VASPs must adopt robust security measures, utilize a P2P Travel Rule solution, and maintain transparency with their&nbsp;users.  Managing cross-jurisdictional compliance involves understanding local requirements, establishing clear communication channels, leveraging technology solutions, and seeking professional advice.  <p>After the overwhelming success of our article titled “<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on the FATF Travel Rule Answered</a>,” we are back with Part 2 to address more questions and concerns raised by our readers and the broader crypto community. Let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> Q7: What Challenges Does the FATF Travel Rule Present for&nbsp;VASPs? <p>The FATF Travel Rule presents several challenges for VASPs as they strive to balance regulatory compliance with operational efficiency and user privacy. The most pressing challenges are ensuring data privacy, achieving interoperability, allocating adequate resources, and navigating jurisdictional differences.</p><p>Ensuring Data Privacy: The FATF Travel Rule requires VASPs to exchange sensitive user information, posing a challenge in protecting user privacy. Hence, VASPs must strike a balance between meeting regulatory requirements and safeguarding sensitive user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Achieving Interoperability: VASPs need to ensure compatibility with other platforms and service providers to facilitate seamless data exchange. Adopting standardized protocols and collaborating with industry peers can help address this challenge.</p><p>IVMS101, for instance, has become a prevalent global communication standard for exchanging the essential sender and recipient data between Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Various Travel Rule messaging systems employ IVMS 101 for their data transfer&nbsp;format.</p><p>Allocating Adequate Resources: Implementing the FATF Travel Rule can be resource-intensive. VASPs must allocate sufficient time, money, and human resources to upgrade existing systems, processes, and staff training to meet compliance requirements.</p><p>Navigating Jurisdictional Differences: Different jurisdictions enforce the FATF Travel Rule with varying requirements and thresholds. VASPs must keep abreast of these differences and adapt their compliance efforts accordingly to ensure seamless cross-border transactions.</p> Q8: How can VASPs Share Information to Comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>VASPs can choose from a variety of Travel Rule solutions to share originator and beneficiary information in compliance with the FATF Travel Rule. However, for the benefit of their users, VASPs must only choose those solutions that do not store Travel Rule data on their servers, such as the Shyft Veriscope.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope does not store the data on third-party servers or its own, enabling VASPs to exchange user data in a peer-to-peer mode and comply with the FATF Travel Rule frictionlessly. To learn more about Shyft Veriscope, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Q9: What Happens if VASPs Don’t Comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>Non-compliant VASPs may face several consequences, including:</p><p>Fines and Penalties: Regulatory authorities may impose hefty fines or penalties on non-compliant VASPs, leading to financial strain on the business.</p><p>Loss of Licenses: Non-compliant VASPs risk losing their operating licenses, which may result in a shutdown or severe restrictions on their business activities.</p><p>Reputation Damage: Failure to comply with the FATF Travel Rule can result in a loss of trust among users and potential partners, negatively impacting VASP’s reputation in the industry.</p><p>Legal Action: VASPs may face legal action from authorities or other entities for non-compliance, leading to further financial and reputational damage.</p> Q10: How Can VASPs Ensure Compliance with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>To ensure compliance with the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs can take the following steps:</p><p>Develop a Robust Compliance Framework: VASPs should establish a comprehensive compliance program incorporating FATF Travel Rule requirements. This includes setting up policies and procedures for data collection, verification, storage, and exchange and adopting suitable technology solutions for secure and efficient data exchange.</p><p>Train Staff: VASPs must provide ongoing training to staff on the FATF Travel Rule requirements, ensuring they stay informed about the latest regulatory updates and best practices. Training should cover topics such as identifying reportable transactions, handling sensitive customer data, and understanding jurisdiction-specific regulations.</p><p>Conduct Regular Audits: VASPs should perform regular internal and external audits to assess their compliance with the FATF Travel Rule and identify areas for improvement. Audits should cover data security, record-keeping, and transaction monitoring to ensure that compliance measures are effectively implemented.</p><p>Collaborate with Industry Stakeholders: VASPs should work with other industry participants to share best practices, address common challenges, and promote a secure and transparent virtual asset ecosystem. This may involve joining industry associations or working groups focused on regulatory compliance and FATF Travel Rule implementation.</p><p>Monitor Regulatory Changes: VASPs must keep abreast of regulatory changes in their jurisdictions, adapting their compliance programs as needed. This may involve staying updated on FATF recommendations, local regulatory updates, and international compliance trends. We suggest <a href="https://shyft-network.beehiiv.com/subscribe">subscribing to the Veriscope newsletter </a>for regular global crypto regulatory change&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Leverage Technology Solutions: VASPs should adopt advanced technology solutions to facilitate secure and efficient data exchange in compliance with the FATF Travel Rule, such as Shyft Veriscope.</p><p>By taking these proactive steps, VASPs can demonstrate their commitment to meeting the FATF Travel Rule requirements and contribute to fostering a more secure and transparent environment for virtual asset transactions.</p> Q11: How Can VASPs Ensure Data Privacy While Complying with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>VASPs can take the following steps to ensure <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">data privacy while complying with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>:</p><p>Use P2P Travel Rule Solutions: By opting for P2P solutions such as Shyft Veriscope, VASPs can facilitate secure and privacy-preserving data transfers in a peer-to-peer mode, avoiding the need for third-party intermediaries to store user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Implement Robust Security Measures: VASPs must employ strong encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels to protect sensitive user data during transmission and&nbsp;storage.</p><p>Establish Data Retention and Deletion Policies: VASPs should develop clear policies for data retention and deletion to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches, in line with global data protection rules such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.</p> Q12: How Can VASPs Manage Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance Challenges? <p>To effectively manage cross-jurisdictional compliance challenges, VASPs&nbsp;can:</p><p>Understand Local Requirements: VASPs should familiarize themselves with the specific requirements and thresholds of each jurisdiction they operate in, ensuring compliance with local regulations.</p><p>Establish Clear Communication Channels: VASPs must maintain open and transparent communication with regulatory authorities and industry peers across jurisdictions to foster cooperation and address potential issues.</p><p>Leverage Technology Solutions: VASPs can adopt technology solutions that support cross-jurisdictional compliance by facilitating secure and standardized data exchange between VASPs operating in different countries.</p><p>Seek Professional Advice: VASPs should consult with legal and compliance experts to navigate complex cross-jurisdictional compliance issues and develop tailored strategies to address&nbsp;them.</p> Final Note <p>As the virtual asset industry continues to evolve, protecting user privacy and ensuring a positive user experience are of utmost importance for&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>In complying with the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs face the challenge of balancing regulatory requirements with the responsibility of safeguarding sensitive user information.</p><p>To achieve this delicate balance, VASPs must adopt robust security measures, employ strong encryption, and establish clear data retention and deletion policies in line with global data protection regulations, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>VASPs should also prioritize the user experience by opting for <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">P2P Travel Rule solutions like Shyft Veriscope</a>, which facilitate secure and privacy-preserving data transfers in a peer-to-peer mode, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries to store user&nbsp;data.</p><p>By focusing on maintaining transparent communication with users and keeping them informed about their data protection measures, VASPs can build trust and foster a positive user experience.</p><p>In summary, protecting user privacy and enhancing user experience are key to the success and growth of the virtual asset industry.</p><p>By implementing strong data protection measures, leveraging advanced technology solutions, and maintaining transparency with users, VASPs can create a secure and user-centric environment that promotes trust and fosters a thriving virtual asset ecosystem.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>We're making progress on IPVM! Learn more about our project to bring open and decentralized compute to IPFS.</p> What is IPVM? <p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol and P2P file-sharing network that leverages content addressing for file identification and verification. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, is Fission's effort to bring computation to IPFS using Wasm, SPKI, and object capabilities. Furthermore, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p> How Does IPVM Work? <p>Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, gave an introductory presentation at IPFS Thing 2022. She explained how content-addressed data yields hashes, known as CIDs. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. This means we can compute over that data without needing a centralized server. And when combined with <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes//Wasm">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm), mobile compute even becomes possible. </p><p>And that's not all. The IPVM structure paves the way for several exciting features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a>, allowing us to work more efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> How Does it Differ from Other Decentralized Compute Options? <p>Unlike other VMs, consensus is not required because no two machines running IPVM have to know that the other exists, which tasks they're running, or what the results were. IPVM lets the knowledge of the result of a computation propagate just to the other machines that ask for the results directly (unlike a blockchain where everyone is entirely up to date on all of the data). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a></p>  Extends IPFS with computation  Runs anywhere, including the edge, locally, and in the browser  No consensus required  Its primary use case is running Wasm and enabling interoperable services  Asynchronous  <p><a href="https://fvm.filecoin.io/">FVM - Filecoin Virtual Machine</a></p>  Runs computations for Filecoin  It’s blockchain-based and runs to consensus  Its primary use case is smart contracts and bringing user programmability to Filecoin  Synchronous  <p><a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/learn/overview">Fluence</a></p>  Serverless platform and computing marketplace  It's blockchain-based  Runs in-browser  Off-chain compute with on-chain validation  It's not designed for large-scale data persistence  Its primary use is for data caching, indexing, processing, and querying  <p><a href="https://docs.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a></p>  Compute over Data using Docker containers and Wasm images as tasks  It's main use case is running compute over large datasets by sending most jobs to providers across the network  Can't run in-browser   What is IPVM's Current Status? <p>Since IPFS Thing 2022, Fission has been hard at work making IPVM a reality. In October of last year, we <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">updated the spec's README</a>. </p><p>In Q1, we focused on research and design and began to develop an MVP. Named <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar</a>, this open-source implementation of IPVM (and an IPVM runtime) is geared toward Wasm execution in Rust and the browser. In February, we also held a three-day in-person IPVM workshop for our working group collaborators. </p><p>Entering Q2, we're working on discovery, first-class effects, and finalizing spec-level interop with several providers. We're also spreading awareness about IPVM at conferences like IPFS Thing, Causal Islands, and CoD Summit^3.</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Speaking of conferences, Brooklyn presented IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World as part of the Decentralized Compute and AI track at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing 2023</a> and Seamless Services for an Open World at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/brooklyn-zelenka">Causal Islands</a> (Fission's first-ever conference!). </p><p>Seamless Services for an Open World (Recording coming soon!)</p><p>The advent of TCP/IP and the web produced an explosion of innovation by radically lowering the barrier to entry to connect over the network. Thanks to new technical and social innovations, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation.</p><p>‍Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed function invocations, results, and workflows. This radically lowers the complexity of historical architectures (e.g. the LAMP stack), networked, and distributed systems. Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) enables superlinear scaling: the more it gets used, the more efficient it becomes!</p><p>This talk presents UCAN Invocations and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). Code in this model can run anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly out of the box without pre-negotiation. Since computation doesn't happen in a vacuum, we will also describe how the workflow planner interacts with existing services and how to lift them into this seamless paradigm.</p><p>Zeeshan Lakhani also presented on Homestar at IPFS Thing. </p><p>Brooklyn and Zeeshan will present at <a href="https://www.codsummit.io/">CoD Summit^3</a> as well, with more details to come. </p> <p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on IPVM! Can't make it? Don't worry - the talks will be recorded and shared here on the blog. You can also participate in IPVMs development by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM working group</a>.

<p>Learn how Fission is making it possible to query decentralized data with RhizomeDB.</p> What is RhizomeDB? <p>RhizomeDB is a protocol that executes a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data. It extends our <a href="https://docs.odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> with support for concurrent access to structured and unstructured data distributed in content-addressable networks and enables the creation of decentralized, collaborative applications 🤯. </p> How Does RhizomeDB Work? <p>RhizomeDB is built from the ground up for interoperability between applications, with a focus on real-time collaboration. One way of looking at Rhizome is a framework for CRDTs powered by a database engine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a>, or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, offer eventual consistency without coordination between replicas, algorithmically resolve any inconsistencies, and guarantee that any replicas with different states will eventually converge into the same state. </p><p>RhizomeDB is also a tuple store. There are many <a href="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/list-vs-tuple/">benefits to using tuples</a>, one of which is immutability. Every entry in the system must be entered in a consistent format, thereby vastly decreasing the number of mistakes that can be made that would interfere with the schema-building and querying process. It also makes it very easy to change how you view the data at read-time and even view your data as tables, graphs, columns, time series, etc. </p><p>In addition to the typical entity-attribute-value tuple of many stores, Rhizome includes a "causal" link that points to the data that the entry depends on. Most data don't directly depend on each other, but some, like the output of an analysis that uses other data, do. This causal link has a couple of advantages, including making the structure BFT, or Byzantine Fault Tolerant. It's a way of "showing your work" so to speak, so that if some nodes go down or malicious actors attempt to input false information, the system won't collapse. </p><p>The causal link also allows RhizomeDB to express Operations-based CRDTs, or CmRDTs, which can change operations that don't affect the end result. An added benefit is it can reduce the amount of necessary compute power.</p> What Makes RhizomeDB Special? <p>As far as we're aware, RhizomeDB is the first system that will combine encryption, CRDTs, and local-first database functionality (we're still building out the encryption part). Another way to look at is that RhizomeDB is a CRDT framework built on top of well-understood database tech. This means we can apply lots of optimizations over time, such as incremental view maintenance, precomputing strategies, distributed indexing, and more.</p><p>For developers, RhizomeDB means they no longer need to worry about consistency, synchronization, and data privacy when building apps with decentralized data - a huge win! &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, developers can interpret data according to their own needs. For example, say you wanted to build your own decentralized social network. RhizomeDB, in a sense, enables a BYOA (Bring Your Own Algorithm) approach to this type of project because it is customizable and prioritizes local-first data. If you wanted your social network to be a community solely focused on 1970s disaster films, you could input the relevant data and use tailored variables to query it. Then as mentioned previously, the CRDTs will use their built-in algorithm to do the rest of the heavy lifting and guarantee consistency. You can also remix and evolve your data over time.</p> RhizomeDB To-Do List Demo <p>Here is a proof-of-concept demo that Applied Researcher Quinn Wilton created.</p><p>Other potential use cases are a CRM, a shared media library...there are so many possibilities! </p> What is RhizomeDB's Current Status? <p>RhizomeDB is still in its early days and is a work in progress. However, it can already do impressive things like query and compute over multiple sources and users in a content-addressed store. It doesn't (directly) help you find the data you're looking for, but you could build an indexer out of RhizomeDB and <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a> to accomplish that.</p> Open-Sourcing RhizomeDB  <p>At Fission, we believe working in public is the quickest way to test, iterate, and build a successful protocol. Therefore, today we are officially open-sourcing RhizomeDB under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache license</a>! If you'd like to explore the code, head to the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">GitHub repo</a> and wade in! Please be advised that there is currently no documentation, the codebase is unfinished, and it is not yet production-ready. All of this will come as soon as it's ready, but if you're intrepid and want to dive right in, have at it!</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Quinn presented RhizomeDB at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> in the Interplanetary Databases track:</p><p>She also gave a talk at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a>, which we will have for you shortly.</p> What's Next for RhizomeDB <p>Building and documentation will be our focus going into the coming months. We also have plans to make RhizomeDB real-time and encrypted!</p><p>You can follow our progress by reading <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/weekly-notes-quinn/3873/4">Quinn's weekly notes</a> and visiting the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">repo</a>.</p>

<p>Fission is roadmapping in public with Starmap, a tool for cross-team planning.</p> What is Starmap? <p><a href="https://starmap.site/">Starmap</a> is an adaptive and flexible tool developed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> that renders GitHub issues as a roadmap. It removes the need to make duplicate tasks in a Gantt chart or Excel spreadsheet to track progress.</p><p>Starmap was created with the needs of the Protocol Labs Network in mind. The PLN contains hundreds of companies of varying sizes and project types, and roadmaps can take many forms. Instead of creating a one-size-fits-all tool, the developers intentionally made it adaptable using containers.</p><p>You can create any number of containers you want to fit your specific needs. If you want to work in Epics and user stories, you can. If you’re only using Low-level GitHub issues? No problem. Milestones and low-level issues? Got you covered. All you need to do is create a GitHub issue to use as a container, name it the way you want, and add child issues and an ETA. You’re all set! </p> How to Build a Starmap <p>As shown in the following screenshots, the project architecture at Fission is the following from top to bottom:</p>  Project issue  Milestones  Low-level issues, which are the actual tasks that need to be completed  <p>If you don’t have a roadmap yet, the easiest way to start is by reviewing your spec. </p><p>Identify the features or improvements you'll need to make to ship your MVP or upgrade, and set clear milestones. Then identify the tasks that need to be checked off to hit those milestones.</p><p>During this process, it's important to consider your internal and external dependencies. Do you need to wait for a specific tech update to be released to be able to progress on your milestone? Which of your task needs to be done before the other?</p><p>Estimate your issues, prioritize them, and add the GitHub issue's URL in the body of their respective milestone issue. Add each milestone issue URL in the body of the project issue.</p><p>Finally, paste the project issue (or root node) URL into Starmap, which will render for you immediately.</p> Collaboration is Key <p>At Fission, the process of roadmapping is collaborative and user-driven. Fission's Project Manager, Bastien Dehaynin, knows he cannot build a Starmap alone - he needs to work with the project developers who completely understand the tech. </p><p>Together Bastien and the developers create user stories. &nbsp;They describe the features from the user's perspective and clearly share their needs and expectations, as well as why those features are important to them in the first place. &nbsp;</p><p>Then they break the user stories themselves down into small chunks of work that a single developer can feasibly complete (the low-level GitHub issues). The tasks are then prioritized and organized into milestones. Together they estimate how long each milestone will take to complete and distribute them over a timeline. Then Bastien translates all of this into GitHub and a Starmap.</p> To Infinity and Beyond <p>Fission currently has Starmaps for <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">WNFS</a>, <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/15?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">Go CAR Mirror</a>, and <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/8?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">IPVM</a>. We are in the process of adding the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/fission-server">Fission Server</a> Rust rewrite project and <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">RhizomeDB</a> as well.</p><p>Fission is also spearheading an effort to increase Starmap adoption across the PLN. Starmap allows all teams involved in a project to add their issues to the same roadmap. Therefore, the more teams build out Starmaps, the greater our awareness of other projects' needs and how we can work together.</p><p>For example, if one team is working on a decentralized app and needs an authorization solution, they might look at the roadmaps of other projects and see that they've used UCANs. Or if one project is working on one half of a problem and another is working on the other, they can team up and ship protocols and an MVP. </p><p>It's also easier to recognize potential bumps in the road and mitigate them. For example, if one of your roadmapped dependencies depends on another tool that is not being actively maintained, that might be something to watch.</p><p>If we all work together, we have the ability to work together to surface hidden needs and opportunities so we can all reach our goals faster. </p> <p>Here's a Starmap demo led by Bastien. </p><p>And here is the IPFS Thing 2023 Starmap demo.</p><p>Want to learn how you can get started with Starmap? Visit the <a href="https://starmap.site/">documentation site</a> or reach out to Bastien on <a href="http://fission.codes/discord">Fission's Discord</a>. He's happy to work with you! </p>

<p>Learn how we set out to build a plugin for musicians and ended up creating a progressive file system that grows with the user's needs.</p> Ditto <p>Our Fissioneers love pushing the boundaries of the <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> to unlock new features and use cases. Recently, engineers Brian and Andy did just that with Ditto. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/ditto">Ditto</a> is a VST delay plugin. Users can create their own delay presets in the app and use the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion</a> web app to share and collect Ditto presets.</p> Elementary <p>Ditto uses <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/">Elementary</a>, a JavaScript framework and high-performance audio engine that makes developing audio plugins using web technologies easier. </p><p>Ditto uses the <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/plugin-renderer"><code>@elemaudio/plugin-renderer</code></a>, which runs a web app in WebView inside of a VST binary. The WebView gives us a browser environment where we can run Webnative. This makes development much more accessible because you don't need to know C++ - only JavaScript.</p><p>Here is the Ditto plugin loaded into Bitwig Studio:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f3036f4dd375f4551bc0fad11ec0a7dc8975c66.jpeg"></a> Preset Manager <p>Audio plugins typically have a system for saving presets, which captures plugin state and metadata about the preset. We implemented presets in Ditto that store plugin state, notes, tags, and favorite status:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/750a2700e7adda90112770ccfc621218141bf319.jpeg"></a><p>The presets interface is organized by categories, including All, Favorites, and categories automatically generated from preset tags.</p> Progressive File System Enhancement <p>Plugin users expect plugins to store presets without signing into an account. To match those expectations, our first experiment with Ditto was to implement a local-only file system that does not require sign-in and an optional synced file system that requires an account. When a user decides to create an account, their presets are copied from the local-only file system to a file system associated with a username and persisted to Fission IPFS nodes.</p><p>Each file system is associated with an app namespace to keep them separate in browser storage. We determine which file system to use by checking whether the user has created an account.</p><p>In application programming, we're often trained to think about how we will serve users now and how we want to serve them down the line. We build the infrastructure to allow us to introduce new planned features without creating more work for us later on. </p><p>This is sensible, but what if, as a developer, you want to ship your minimum viable product now, gather feedback, and then add syncing and sharing later? &nbsp;</p><p>Users are also tired of signing up for endless platforms, not knowing if it will be the right tool for them. Why not give them the option to get hands-on with the tool first, and if/when they decide to access more features, you ask them to make an account (a password-less one, of course!)?</p><p>Building using a progressive file system not only reduces the scope of an MVP, it also removes a common barrier to adoption!</p> Connecting to Ditto Companion <p>When the user is ready to go beyond the local-only file system, they can create an account and connect to the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion app</a>.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/adcd97c9b813df99d7764181ee528fd76c187b82.png"></a><p>First, they create a username and select "connect." Then they are given a QR code and a connection link. </p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/e/eade68717a724783a861afe9a16929749f5d6ca1.png"></a><p>The QR Code and connection link open Ditto Companion and use the AWAKE protocol to begin device-linking.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a3593ae2830f971552ba340092d99d3ee60f0908.jpeg"></a><p>The user enters the code shown in Ditto Companion into Ditto:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4e1c83397d3afb9650b15807a2363befcbef6e71.png"></a><p>After entering the code, Ditto shows the user a message confirming they have connected with Ditto Companion:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/5/55ea0bcdd6e46b7c6917cdddf0b6e922d893cb6a.png"></a><p>The user can connect again later if they would like to connect to another browser or device.</p> Namespaces <p>The Ditto plugin and Ditto Companion use distinct app namespaces. However, by using UCAN authorization and transmitting the user's WNFS encryption key, the Ditto Companion app shares the synced file system with the Ditto plugin.</p><p>Having multiple namespaces also makes it possible for users to work on several apps locally. It used to be that you could only work on one app at a time on <code>localhost:8080</code> for example, but namespacing puts them each in their own box, so to speak, and you can switch from one app to another without thinking about it.</p> Sharing and Collecting Presets <p>As mentioned earlier, Ditto Companion is a web app for sharing and collecting presets.</p><p>We started Ditto Companion from the <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">ODD App Template</a>. Our connect flow is simplified compared to the complete feature set provided in the template - we only link from the plugin to the companion app. This simple model meant we could remove quite a bit from the template for our use case.</p><p>Our second experiment was to implement a lightweight share and collect system in the companion app. Shared presets are stored in the public WNFS tree. Presets that are not shared are in the private tree. Users share presets in the companion app:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3a03525569c3c68a608cf2fb3671291cbac2ce7.png"></a><p>They can also collect shared presets from other users. After selecting the plus button, they enter the username they want to collect from:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7886e573933b43872414af9ef280fbc27fa30653.jpeg"></a><p>Ditto Companion then checks whether a file system exists for the user. If a file system exists, we get a link for the public tree and check for a presets directory.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1488b82f4087b4e340dab4bdca22161489701740.jpeg"></a><p>If presets are found, we add them to the Collect tab:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1367134c2e5dcb7e7ab91dcedc93ba475254f38f.png"></a><p>Users collect presets by checking the Collect checkbox for the preset. Collected presets are copied into the user’s file system, and the user can load them in the plugin after a refresh.</p><p>This sharing mechanism is very exciting because it searches for and scans public IPFS data and saves it to the user's file system, adding a level of interactivity to non-blockchain-based decentralized web apps. And because users can move their data to any Webnative-enabled app, there are many opportunities for collaboration and remixing of data.</p> <p>Here is a full walkthrough of Ditto and Ditto Companion:</p><p>What do you think of Ditto? Are you building an app that would benefit from a progressive file system?

<p>Fission has grown from a scrappy startup to a fully-fledged protocol research and development company, and we have a new and improved website and refreshed brand to match. </p> Website <p><a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a> has evolved so much since 2019, and we needed an updated website to reflect our current protocol projects and grow with us as we develop our core product, <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD SDK</a> (formerly known as Webnative SDK).</p><p>We started with our mission: </p><blockquote>"Fission is building identity, data, and compute solutions for the future of the Internet."</blockquote><p>We are a company with one foot in the present and one in the future, and we realized our website should reflect that. As a result, we created options for website visitors to sort by tech that is ready now and tech that will be ready later.</p><p>This will be especially handy as Fission takes on more challenges and continues to develop protocol solutions.</p><p>Next, we took a look at our company's values: </p><blockquote>We prioritize agency.</blockquote><blockquote>We're ecosystem-obsessed.</blockquote><blockquote>We learn in public and share our knowledge freely with others.</blockquote><blockquote>We experiment relentlessly and discover for ourselves which path will lead us to success.</blockquote><p>Starting with agency - we do a lot, and we want you to be able to "choose your own adventure" and find your way quickly to the projects most aligned with your interests. This meant using simple interactions, like radio buttons for filtering by topic, to help direct people to the right places throughout the site.</p><p>Next came our ecosystem obsession. Fission builds open-source protocols, then supports them as they leave the nest. As a result, we lead several working groups and consistently work with external teams adopting these tools into their tech stacks. We are also active in the <a href="https://protocol.ai/join/">PLN</a> and in standards formation (For example, <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">CASA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/secure-design/discussions">Secure/Design</a>). </p><p>The <a href="https://fission.codes/ecosystem/">ecosystem section</a> of our site organizes all of these efforts into four categories according to how involved we are - Our Core Projects, Fission-Led Efforts, Places We Contribute, and Collaborators &amp; Adopters. </p><p>We believe it's critical to learn and work in public. We hope that presenting our relationship to the ecosystem we're engaged in helps people find the best ways to get involved - without overwhelming them.</p><p>We share our knowledge via the Fission blog with twice-weekly blog posts. </p><p>We also wanted the site's back end to be approachable enough that anyone on the Fission team could contribute to it, regardless of their level of technical aptitude. That's why our design team coded up the rebrand themselves! This empowers all of us to experiment and iterate on the site now and in the future.</p><p>Our last big change is a more humane touch - we added our wonderful Fissioneers to the website! We are lucky to have so many talented engineers, designers, creators, and operators on our team - all with their unique skill sets and areas of expertise. We thought it would be nice for our community to get to know the friendly people behind the tech, so we included a <a href="https://fission.codes/team/">team info page</a>.</p> Brand <p>Finally, you may have noticed that we updated the Fission logo and fonts a few months ago. Our designers, Ryan and Bruno, did a stellar job! </p><p>We also want to thank Kasper Nordkvist, the designer of Uncut Sans and steward of the collection of open-source fonts at <a href="https://uncut.wtf/">Uncut.wtf</a>. </p><p>We did this brand refresh in preparation for the new website, but we also took this step knowing we'd be rolling out more brands as we expanded the Fissionverse. <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a>, <a href="https://odd.dev/">ODD.DEV</a>, and (coming soon!) Private Set have all received their brand treatments, but the Fission brand must be the central node connecting all the branches. We achieve this synchronicity through consistent color variations, style, and brand voice. </p><p>We hope you are as excited about the <a href="https://fission.codes/">website update</a> and brand refresh as we are. Share your feedback on social media or the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/daDMAjE">Fission Discord</a>!</p>

				  If you are attending the upcoming European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, don’t miss your chance to hear Indicio presenters and panelists discuss governance, the metaverse, and more.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The annual European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) is taking place in Berlin from May 9 to 12. Billed as “the place where the digital identity and cyber community comes together to set the course for the future of digitization,” the focus this year is on Identity governance in our modern world, including how identity will function in a more decentralized or Web3 internet. Several Indicio team members have been selected to participate both as speakers and as panelists.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5372/1">Decentralized Identity in the real world with Decentralized Ecosystem Governance</a></p>
<p>Indicio VP of Communications and Governance, Trevor Butterworth, will explain how Decentralized Ecosystem Governance (DEGov), which was pioneered by Indicio and which is now being developed as a specification at the Decentralized Identity Foundation” manages trust and interaction in a decentralized identity ecosystem. Drawing on Indicio’s experience implementing governance solutions with enterprises and governments, Trevor will discuss the importance of portable trust, automation, updating, and offline functionality, and the importance of decentralizing governance to accountability. .&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5372/2">Digital Trust in the Metaverse &amp; Decentralized Internet of Everything</a></p>
<p>Indicio CEO Heather Dahl and Deputy CTO Sam Curren will be joining a panel to discuss the future of digital trust. Central to the discussion will be the root of many headaches and malicious behaviors online — verification. As a long-time community contributor at Hyperledger and working group leader at Decentralized Identity Foundation, Sam will dive into how digital trust and verification are critically important to the future of online interaction, including decentralized healthcare, finance, the metaverse, and to the interaction of digital objects and non-digital objects in the spatial web—aka, the “Internet of Everything.” One key takeaway from this session will be how you can use a Trusted Data Ecosystems to connect people, machines, companies or any two entities to multiple businesses and jurisdictions without sharing private information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be Indicio’s third year attending EIC and there are always great conversations, connections, and learning opportunities to be had. A highlight from last year was the SITA-Indicio-Aruba team being <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">recognized for the creation of the digital travel credential</a>. If you are attending the conference and would be interested in meeting up with our team please fill out our <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us form</a> and we will see if we can make that happen.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at the conference!</p>

<p>Editor: Michael Shea prepares the Digital Identity from Vienna guest panelists with a brief. This was used for <a href="https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/">the May 2, 2023 discussion</a> <a href="https://wider.team/2023/04/26/vienna36/">announced here last week</a>. <a href="https://widerteam.notion.site/Vienna-Digital-Identity-36-Thinking-Locally-and-Globally-for-Digital-Wallets-and-Identification-b82c3264cf8044da9aaa08ac14d6558c">More information on the event archive</a>.  </p>







<p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force) adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the public sector form of governance.  Over the past 20+ years the potential of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly but the results have been mixed with a consistent short fall in the meeting of expectations.  High assurant digital identity appears to provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of society to take place.  </p>



<p>The public sector forms outlined here are generalizations for the purpose of framing a discussion around the design, implementation and adoption of digital wallets and the digital identifiers and credentials stored there-in, and to facilitate a discussion on how interactions would/could work when populations of the different forms interact in a global ecosystem.</p>



<p>In each of the forms, a private sector also operates and attempts to influence (to a greater or lesser degree) the setting public policy.  Motivators of the private sector may be greatly different than that of public policy and as such creates a tension or a ‘force’ that may result in failure to realize expected gains from the policies.  The private sector has also a desire to bring digital identity into practice, but its motivators are highly driven by rent extraction, not public policy or (necessarily) public good.  Additionally, there are very powerful market forces for monopolization and control where those that ‘control’ the source of digital identification can gain very significant rents from society.</p>



 Central authority, strong decentralized authority with wary support of population 



 
 A central authority that constitutionally or legally has constraints on its authority.   



 The central authority typically must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (state or provincial governments) who retain rights that are not granted to the central authority.   



 The populations of this public sector form, can be said to be unruly at times and in recent history inclined to be suspicious of Public Sector forms.   



 English speaking countries are good representative examples of this Form, though even within these there is a spectrum. 
 



 Centralized authority, strong decentralized authority with support of population 



 
 A central authority that is constitutionally or legally has constraints on its authority.   



 The central authority must work with a network of strong decentralized bodies (States) who retain rights that may conflict with the Central authority.   



 The populations of this public sector form, while they may have a level of suspicion, concepts of identity cards and papers have long been used.   



 The European Commission and the Member States of the European Union are a good representative example of this Form. 
 



 Strong centralized authority with support of population 



 
 A strong central authority that has the ‘final’ say on direction and policy.   



 This authority may delegate some responsibility to an elected body, but retains the right to overrule policy positions that may be put forward by this body.   



 The population in this form is typically supportive of the form, and moves in accordance with the direction central authority.   



 Examples of this form would be countries that retain a hereditary monarchy in regions such as, the Middle East, Asia and parts of Africa. 
 



 Authoritarian 



 
 A central authority who’s right and power is absolute.   



 This authority sets direction and policy based on its reasoning alone and is not subject to the demands of sharing power with subsidiary authorities.   



 Support (or lack of support) of the population is not considered.  The authority has the coercive power and the willingness to use it to ensure its direction and policies are adhered to. 
 



<p>The desire to realize the benefits of digitalization through the adoption of forms of digital identity has been tried before today, and has seen at best marginal success and at worst total failure resulting in significant outlays of public expenditures (e.g., eIDAS v1, Gov.uk) and political embarrassment. </p>



<p>In this current cycle to realize the digital potential different ‘experiments’ are (or have been) tried.  The Government of British Columbia in Canada started its journey with its Verifiable Organization Network, working with publicly available corporate documentation.  In the European Union, under the eIDAS v2 regulation and European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) efforts are underway with use cases in Education and Travel and Tourism.  The Government of Bhutan will shortly be launching its digital wallet and identity effort having issued its first digital identifier credentials to the Crown Price of Bhutan in March.  Finally, in the US, the Department of Homeland Security is in the fourth year of a five-year process on developing a digital Green Card and Right to Work documentation.  </p>



<p>Each of these programs have necessarily focused within their own ‘borders’ of the public sector form to develop, learn, and prepare.  However, the full realization of digital potential requires interoperability between all jurisdictions.  </p>



<p>In this panel discussion, we have representation from three of the four generalized forms of the public sector.  </p>



 Questions 



<p>In preparation for the discussion please reflect on the following questions:</p>



 
 In your respective public sector forms, how is public policy approaching the motivators of its citizenry and businesses to adopt and use digital wallets and identifiers? 



 It is human nature to only want to share successes, but in reality, the learning and discovery process requires failures and ‘bumps in the road.’  What are the ‘redprints’[1] from your experiences and observations and what are the learnings gained from these? 



 To realize the full potential of digital wallets and identity requires that interoperability between legal jurisdictions of digital credentials.  How is jurisdictional interoperability being addressed within your respective regions?  What programs are in place (or being put in place) to ensure interoperability?

             April 2023   
	 
		 
			 The EU Regulation Leads the Way in Digital Securities 
<p>As the race to embrace digital securities and the tokenization of assets accelerates, the US seems to be lagging behind the European Union. Despite the appointment of Gary Gensler, a blockchain-savvy Commissioner with a background in teaching blockchain, digital currencies, and financial technology at MIT, the SEC has maintained a conservative stance and resisted change.</p>
<p>Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC has maintained that the “law is clear,” suggesting that existing securities laws are appropriate for regulating digital assets. Consequently,&nbsp;issuers are required to adhere to the same rules as traditional securities, which is not always easy due to the decentralized nature of blockchain.</p>
<p>The lack of a clear regulatory framework in the US for issuers to tokenize their assets and leverage secondary trading solutions has significantly stifled innovation and hindered the adoption of digital securities, putting the country at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>In contrast, the European Union appears to be embracing this technology more proactively by developing a&nbsp;regulatory framework that clarifies the different types of tokens&nbsp;and therefore supports innovation while maintaining strict enforcement of regulations.</p>
<p>In fact, as recently as April 20th this year, the European Parliament officially approved new cryptocurrency regulations, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). MiCA aims to address gaps in existing EU financial services legislation by introducing a unified set of rules for crypto-assets and associated activities and services.&nbsp;MiCA explicitly excludes securities (therefore security tokens are subject to the existing MiFID regulations), defines rules for stablecoins&nbsp;and for crypto asset service providers (CASPs).</p>
<p>In parallel with MiCA, the EU also established recently The Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Pilot Regime, which is a regulatory framework designed to provide a controlled environment for the testing and development of innovative distributed ledger technologies related to digital securities. The regime was introduced with the aim of fostering innovation, increasing market efficiency, and enhancing investor protection in the digital securities sector. Mostly,&nbsp;the DLT Pilot Regime enables exchanges (MTFs) and CSDs to experiment and benefit from blockchains.</p>
<p>Luxembourg stands out as a leading example in Europe, as it has implemented clear regulations for using blockchain to issue native tokenized securities. Many businesses choose to establish entities in Luxembourg to take advantage of its proactive regulatory environment.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, which is headquartered in Luxembourg, we envision a future where digital securities trade on decentralized public blockchain ledgers,&nbsp;making assets and securities globally accessible and tradable by eligible investors, anywhere, in full compliance.</p>
<p>By adopting the open-source ERC3643 standard and ONCHAINID, digital securities can integrate jurisdiction-specific securities laws. This approach ensures compliance for issuers, investors, and jurisdictions while operating in decentralized, resilient and scalable infrastructures.</p>
<p>With clearer legal guidelines in Europe and proven tech solutions, there is ample opportunity to tokenize assets&nbsp;and take advantage of the benefits that blockchain technology offers. Companies should consider these advantages and explore tokenization as a way to streamline processes, enhance transferability, and promote transparency in the market.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed the rise of several meme coins in recent years, and PEPE is one such memecoin that has experienced a remarkable 244x growth in value within just two weeks of its launch. While the growth is noteworthy, potential investors should be aware of the risks associated with meme coins and the anonymity of their creators.</p>



<p>PEPE’s founders remain anonymous, making it difficult to assess the credibility and intentions of the team behind the project. This can pose risks for investors, as the lack of transparency may lead to potential scams or pump-and-dump schemes. In addition, the rapid growth in value may not be sustainable in the long term, as the price of meme coins can be highly volatile and influenced by market sentiment and social media trends.</p>



<p>Furthermore, a recent analysis by Coinfirm has indicated that 0.2% of the addresses associated with PEPE were related to crime and fraud, while 0.03% were linked to sanctioned addresses. This poses additional risks for investors, as transactions with such addresses may result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties, or even loss of funds.</p>



<p>In conclusion, while PEPE has shown significant growth in a short period, potential investors should carefully consider the risks associated with investing in meme coins, particularly those with anonymous founders and potential connections to illicit activities. As always, thorough research and due diligence are crucial before making any investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

 Crypto asset firms, technology companies, and financial institutions were invited to provide feedback on the UK’s answer to MiCA. Here’s what we had to say. 



 



<p>In February 2023, in perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government was taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury released a new consultation paper, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for cryptoassets.’&nbsp;</a>It is being billed by many as UK’s answer to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>.</p>



<p>In the Foreword, it states:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“The government’s firm ambition is for the UK to be home to the most open, well-regulated, and technologically advanced capital markets in the world. Delivering on this ambition means taking proactive steps to harness the opportunities of new financial technologies. We believe that crypto technologies can have a profound impact across financial services.”</p>



 Crypto conundrum: To regulate or not to regulate.&nbsp; 



<p>Over recent years, the crypto industry has become increasingly complex as the constantly evolving ecosystem continues to create a myriad of opportunities and associated risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there are currently no comprehensive crypto-related regulations in the UK, the FCA and Bank of England have issued usage guidelines and warnings about the lack of regulatory and monetary protection.&nbsp;The proposed crypto regime aims to address these gaps and loopholes.</p>



<p>In a post-Brexit world, the UK’s crypto conundrum has been further compounded by the EU’s decision to create <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>, one of the world’s first crypto regulatory frameworks. Although MiCA will not apply to UK crypto service providers (or any non-European provider), if UK providers plan on targeting EU investors or offering their services in the EU, then they will need to obtain MiCA authorization and follow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR requirements</a>, to ensure they are compliant with both UK and EU regulations.</p>



<p>As part of the proposed regulatory regime, the UK intends to introduce its own territorial scope, and providers of crypto asset businesses that market UK consumers within or outside of the UK, must comply with UK rules.&nbsp;</p>



 FTX and the industry-wide wake-up call. 



<p>The collapse of FTX in late 2022 sent shockwaves through the industry, affecting global cryptoasset markets and investors, and forcing regulators to re-examine its timeline for cryptoasset regulation.&nbsp;In January 2023, the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) announced plans to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">form a brand-new division </a>specifically designed to tackle crypto crime. The NCA’s ‘Crypto Cell’ will initially contain just five officers who will be solely responsible for providing support on new and existing crypto-related investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The decision by HM Treasury to release a consultation paper covering a potential regulatory regime for cryptoassets finally addresses the elephant in the room. Timing-wise, the consultation could not have been opened at a more opportune moment. The crypto industry has endured numerous high-profile casualties recently, making the case for crypto regulation that much more palatable.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>The 77-page paper features information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the new consultation paper sets out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter. For example, it suggests that most initial coin offerings be considered securities offerings, which would mean the equivalent of client asset segregation requirements be applied to crypto firms. As such, future proposed crypto regulatory requirements would fall under the UK’s <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Up until now, the direction of travel for UK cryptoasset regulation has been anything but clear. A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub. The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction,” said Jason.</p>



 IDnow’s feedback on UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime. 



<p>The consultation paper allows people inside and outside Parliament to provide feedback on policies and legislative proposals contained therein. Our crypto regulatory experts, Rayissa Armata and Jason Tucker-Feltham poured over the consultation paper, submitting feedback, and answering  several of the 52 questions, including:</p>


 
 
 
  Do you agree with the proposed territorial scope of the regime? If not, then please explain why and what alternative you would suggest.  
 

<p>Financial activities are increasingly becoming more digital and cross border, so crypto activities are within scope. Regulators should consider both national requirements and global standards that aim for interoperable activities and minimize risk.</p>

 
 
 
  What steps can be taken to encourage the development of RegTech to prevent, detect and disrupt market abuse?  
 

<p>IDnow agrees that there is a need for further collaboration between firms, regulators, and enforcement agencies to develop RegTech solutions that can help detect, prevent and disrupt market abuse. IDnow would encourage sandbox initiatives that can explore ways to enhance remote KYC applications that can be used in both centralized (off chain) and decentralized (on chain) transactions.</p>

 
 
 
  What other best practices exist today within DeFi organisations and infrastructures that should be formalized into industry standards or regulatory obligations?  
 

<p>On-chain KYC platforms allow for a level of transparency and accountability that had not previously been possible for DeFi platforms. For platforms where there is a significant risk of money-laundering, on-chain KYC could help mitigate this risk.&nbsp;</p>

 
 
 
 


 Next steps on the UK journey toward crypto regulation.&nbsp; 



<p>Now that the consultation period is over, the next step will be to review contributions before establishing a clear regulatory framework that supports innovation and protects consumers. How closely the final version will resemble the EU’s crypto regulatory framework, MiCA, remains to be seen. What is very unlikely, though, is it coming into force before MiCA does, in 2024.</p>

 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification services for crypto </a>work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including crypto. Whether automated or expert-assisted, its online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

<p>The Holochain Foundation is sponsoring this year’s <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp.</a> </p><p>A five day woodland conference that brings together visionaries from across the distributed web, DWeb Camp is an opportunity to build the in-person networks that help our independent and collaborative efforts thrive. </p><p>Over the past few years we have limited our event sponsorship and participation in many conferences because we were focused on getting Holochain to a beta software release. Now that Beta is here and Holochain is maturing, we are committed to building alongside the broader ecosystem. Many on the team have been active at DWeb since the beginning and connected to the larger community for many years; we want to give back to our peers, and supporting DWeb Camp this year feels like a critical first step.</p> Our Why <p>Holochain has always been about more than any one single technology. We are driven by a vision of peer-to-peer coordination, accountability, and mutual sovereignty, and we believe that DWeb Camp is an embodiment of this. We are excited to spend a week connecting and collaborating with our closest friends and allies, working towards the collective goal of building a better, decentralized web.</p><p>With a live beta version of Holochain we have been committed to building actionable offerings that support our growing ecosystem. We aren’t just bringing ideas to DWeb, we are bringing tools. Both to support the conference itself, and that can be picked up by others, iterated on, and taken forwards, integrated with other protocols and dreams, building towards a better future. &nbsp;</p>Images courtesy of DWeb Camp We Would Love to See You at DWeb  <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp 2023, June 21–25th,</a> is a gathering of decentralized web enthusiasts in Navarro California, nestled in the hills and redwoods. This year’s theme is “Discovering Flows.” Like the Navarro river which winds through the retreat, flows wind through all of our lives. Making them visible so we can interact with them intentionally is a powerful act, which is why at Holochain we often talk about currencies as “current-sees,” a tool for seeing flows. DWeb camp is focused on four flows and the relationships between them: Nature. Technology. Community. You. </p><p>More than just being a monetary sponsor of the event, we want to support these flows. We are putting time and energy into this event because the people and the values are deeply aligned. Our DNA asks us to develop relationships and communities, and we encourage others to do the same — with apps, with businesses, with social ventures. <a href="https://www.tickettailor.com/events/gatheringsforgood/861532?ref=blog.holochain.org">We look forward to seeing you there.</a></p> Show Don’t Tell with DWeb <p>The biggest thing we can announce is that DWeb will be shutting off the internet on Saturday June 24th. Or, the connection to the external net at least. </p><p>Throughout the week, DWeb Camp will be running on a local P2P network and on the final full day will be shutting off the connection to the outside. Everyone at camp will be invited to use a conferencing app Holochain built specifically for the purpose of this offline environment at DWeb. With it, we can harness the power of decentralized web tech for local, offline collaboration: discovering, scheduling, connecting, and remembering.</p><p>Distributed protocols are meant to be run local first, and we see this as an opportunity to use the tools we have been building and to live a day in the <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/tomorrow/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tomorrow</a> we dream of.</p>

   For self-managed software and hybrid cloud customers, new enhancements address MFA prompt bombing, enable smooth integrations, and improve user experiences 

<p>Fully 82% of enterprises operate hybrid cloud environments<a>1</a>, meaning they run a mixture of on-premises software and cloud (public and private) services. Indications are that the hybrid cloud model will continue for many years to come. ForgeRock remains committed to helping organizations deliver advanced, unified identity and access management solutions, and to deploy and manage them within whatever environments work best. To that end, we are pleased to announce that the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> 7.3 software is now available.</p>

<p>The 7.3 release is the latest version of ForgeRock software for our self-managed customers. These include enterprises that for a variety of reasons — locus of control or regulatory reasons, for example — prefer to install and run the software themselves. The software can be installed on-premises, with a preferred cloud provider, or in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid cloud</a> mode. The software offers an abundance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment options</a> to meet the needs of customers with the most complex IT environments.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that ForgeRock also offers the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> for customers seeking a turnkey SaaS solution. ForgeRock's "cloud-first" strategy means that many of the features in the 7.3 software discussed below are already available to our cloud customers.</p>

<p>What's new in 7.3? The software covers a lot of ground, spanning four product areas:</p>

  ForgeRock Access Management 7.3, with Web Agent 2023.2 and Java Agent 2023.2 
   ForgeRock Identity Management 7.3 
   ForgeRock Directory Services 7.3 
   ForgeRock Identity Gateway 2023.2 
  New 7.3 features that enhance security and user experience 

<p>One of the most insidious authentication attacks of recent memory is known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>. This social engineering attack relies on inattentive users absentmindedly approving mobile push notifications set off by the bad guys, allowing the attackers to essentially defeat multi-factor authentication (MFA). The 7.3 release includes a push notification with number challenge in which the user validates the sign-in attempt by tapping the number on the mobile device that is shown in the browser sign-in instructions. If the user picks the correct number, the authentication succeeds. Details about where the sign-in attempt originated are provided below the number choices on the mobile authenticator app, providing an additional data point to verify to the user that the authentication attempt is legitimate.</p>

<p>To secure and deliver <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">superior end-user digital experiences</a>, server-side resources need to be aware of client-side data states and be able to take certain actions. In 7.3, a lot of work went into session enhancements that help address these needs. Logout by UserID enables an administrator to logout all users regardless of the session storage or token type. This means that if a bad actor is identified, an administrator can terminate all the compromised user's sessions so the bad guys can't simply jump to another open browser session to continue their attack.</p>

<p>Enhanced session tracking easily follows a client-side session from creation, to upgrade, to termination, giving better visibility to the server-side admins so they can detect and initiate a decision should an action need to be taken (see "Logout by UserID" above!).</p>

<p>Have you ever been engaging with a website, entered some information, and decided to register or log in only to have the information you entered disappear? This creates an intensely negative experience for users and often leads to users abandoning their interactions. Post login data preservation prevents pre-authenticated users from losing data they have already entered before they log in to an application. Data preservation helps to delight users instead of frustrating them and leading them to abandon their sessions.</p>

<p>And there is more:</p>
  Logging out users in stateless client-side sessions 
   Support for OAuth email authentication 
   Group scalability that helps supercharge performance of directory services 
   And dozens of other enhancements, features, and fixes 
 <p>ForgeRock is dedicated to supporting our customers in whatever deployment configuration they prefer: as-a-service, self-managed, or hybrid cloud. You can find out more from the <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.3/platform-guide/release-notes.html">Release Notes</a> and the full <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.3">7.3 product documentation</a>, and you can <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/downloads/browse/platform/featured">download the software</a>.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Throughout the years, technology has transformed the way we operate as humans in society. It brought great changes to the way we work, study, communicate, and interact with one another. Furthermore, it has made these things easier, faster, and more accessible than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re headed towards a digitized future, where we learn more about state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. However, the more we learn about artificial intelligence, the more it learns about us.</p>
<p>In this article, we will firstly discuss artificial intelligence, what it is and how we can use it to navigate the digital world. Secondly, we’ll explore the benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence. Lastly and most importantly, we’ll elaborate on ways to use AI-powered proof of individuality methods to keep our community’s individuality, privacy, and digital identities safe.</p>

 Artificial Intelligence and Humanity 
 Humans versus technology 
<p>The advancement in technology for the past several decades has stirred a growing debate of humans versus artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, if AI begins to take over tasks which were traditionally associated with people, what are people left with? Their sense of humanity and individual identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digitalization has impacted every aspect of our lives, making it easier for us to perform our daily tasks. Because of this, we have more or less become dependent on technology in order to operate in the online world.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Overall, the topic of AI is quite controversial. Throughout history, humans have been cautious about accepting new technologies since the dawn of the industrial age. While technology has undoubtedly brought significant improvements to our lives, an important question remains:</p>
 
<p>Will AI ultimately be beneficial or detrimental to our well-being in the long run?</p>
 
<p>We will examine the potential advantages and disadvantages of AI in the following sections.</p>
 The benefits of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>Despite the potential risks and challenges posed by AI, there is no denying that it brings many benefits and advantages for humanity.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Technology has filled our lives with entertainment, efficiency, and enhanced accessibility by eliminating frustrating and time-consuming tasks. Not only that, but it has made performing our daily tasks considerably easier and it has opened doors to an incredible library of information.</p>
 
<p>Let’s briefly explore some of AI’s key benefits:</p>
 
 
 
 Automation. Advanced technology can program AI to do tedious, repetitive mundane jobs, so that humans can focus on more complex and creative tasks. 
 
 
 
 
 Efficiency. AI has the capability to analyze a large amount of data and find patterns and trends that might be hard for humans to see. This can help individuals make better decisions. 
 
 
 Accesibility. Thanks to modern technology, individuals can benefit from applications that make working, studying, and communicating remotely much easier.&nbsp; 
 Accuracy. Under careful supervision, AI can perform tasks with high accuracy, reducing the risk of errors and improving performance tremendously. 
 
 
 The dark side of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>With AI progressing at incredible speeds, technology has raised concerns about privacy and security. One of the biggest concerns nowadays is the threat of AI stealing human identities. There has been an increase in data breaches and cyberattacks, which leads to a growing need for stronger security measures to protect our personal data.</p>
 
<p>Like any other innovation, AI undoubtedly has its drawbacks, which are often overshadowed by its benefits. Basically, AI systems are designed to learn and make decisions based on data. Therefore, if the data used to train these systems is biased or incomplete, it can lead to flawed decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>We can understand the dark side of AI once we examine some of its potential risks and negative impacts:</p>
 
 In the wrong hands, AI systems can be used for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks. 
 Because of this, privacy and security are major concerns when it comes to AI. 
 Data breaches could result in divulging sensitive data, leading to significant consequences, like loss of privacy. 
 Hackers can make use of the leaked data to steal or forge individuals’ digital identities. 
 AI can generate fake identities, which can be used to influence the decision-making or output of a system. 
 
 
<p>As AI systems continue to evolve, it becomes more and more difficult to predict their actions. Consequently, we cannot hold them accountable for their faulty behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do, then? 
<p>Artificial intelligence is currently not a sentient being, it cannot make its own decisions.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>It can either be used for good purposes or for malicious purposes, depending on the intentions of the individuals behind it. And, while humans are not equipped with the accuracy and efficiency of state-of-the-art technology, we can use AI to fight against malicious AI.</p>
 
<p>Thankfully, there is a method which can verify an individual’s identity in a secure, efficient and highly accurate manner.&nbsp;</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality 
 What is Proof of Individuality? 
<p>Proof of individuality (POI) is a protocol that supports the statement that every person is a distinct and unique individual. As a matter of fact, individuality is a core aspect of human existence. It refers to the one-of-a-kind set of characteristics, thoughts, emotions and perspectives that make each person different from one another.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>While digital identities can be stolen and sold, individuality is not something which, at the moment, can be duplicated. At this time, it represents our liveliness as real, tangible, mindful beings.</p>
 Identification in modern times 
<p>Identification is an important aspect of our lives. Above all, it is unique to each and every one of us, and it represents our liveliness. Therefore, as technology makes new, magnificent progress every day, AI-Powered proof of individuality has become an essential part of our daily existence. From accessing bank accounts to opening doors, AI-Powered proof of individuality has revolutionized the way we identify ourselves.</p>
 
<p>Some of the most common AI-Powered proof of individuality methods are:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 Facial recognition 
 Iris scans 
 
 
<p>These biometric identification methods are highly accurate and reliable, making them the go-to method for identification in many industries.</p>
 How can AI-Powered Proof of Individuality benefit us? 
<p>Overall, AI-Powered proof of individuality has many advantages. Particularly:</p>
 
 Speed 
 Accuracy 
 Remote identification 
 
 Speed 
 
 The traditional methods of identification, such as presenting a physical paper for verification can cause delays. 
 Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are much quicker. For example, using a fingerprint scanner can take only a few seconds. 
 As a result, Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are efficient in situations where time is of the essence. 
 
 Accuracy 
 
 Biometric methods such as facial recognition and iris scans are highly accurate. 
 In such a case, the chance of false positives or false negatives is minimal. 
 This level of accuracy is ideal for high-security situations, such as airport security or government buildings. 
 
 Remote identification 
 
 AI-Powered proof of individuality made it possible to identify individuals remotely. 
 With the use of online identification tools, individuals can verify the authenticity of each other’s identities. 
 There is no need to meet in person anymore. Therefore, physical distance is no longer an obstacle. 
 
 How does AI-Powered Proof of Individuality work? 
 A brief description 
<p>AI-Powered proof of individuality uses artificial intelligence to verify an individual’s identity based on their biometric features and behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>As mentioned previously, biometric features are fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Some of the behavior patterns this technology analyzes are:</p>
 
 Typing speed and style. How a person types on a keyboard, how long they pause between keystrokes, and how hard they press the keys. 
 Mouse movements. How a person moves the cursor on a screen, the direction and speed of their movements. 
 Voice patterns. The way a person talks, their pitch, tone and accent. 
 Smartphone usage. The way a person holds or uses their smartphone, the angle of how they hold their device, or how they swipe and tap on the screen. 
 
 All in the benefit of the individual 
<p>The idea that our devices check our behavior patterns might be anxiety-inducing. Without a doubt, it can be scary thinking how technology knows us better than we know ourselves. However, in this case, AI is programmed to keep our individuality safe from malicious, bad players.</p>
 
<p>This way, organizations can improve security and prevent identity fraud. Furthermore, AI-Powered proof of individuality is more convenient to access digital services without the need for passwords or tangible identification cards. Passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised.</p>
 
<p>Consequently, AI-Powered proof of individuality has the potential to positively transform how we verify our identities in the digital age.</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality and Selfkey 
<p>Our goal at SelfKey is to offer individuals a secure means of verifying their identity through AI-Powered proof of individuality methods.&nbsp;</p>
 Guidelines for users: 
 
 The user will first have to perform a KYC check.&nbsp; 
 
 
 KYC stands for Know Your Customer, and it is a mandatory process of identifying and verifying an individual’s identity. It is done to ensure that the user is genuinely who they claim to be. 
 
 
 
 The user will then obtain the SelfKey iD SBT.&nbsp; 
 
 
 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBT</a> stands for Soulbound Tokens. They are non-transferrable, verifiable, digital tokens that can show an individual’s accreditations, work experience, work history, and past records. 
 
 
 
 After this, the user onboards to SelfKey DAO. 
 
 
 DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is governed by a community of individuals on a decentralized blockchain network.&nbsp; 
 The rules of a DAO are transparent to all members in order to create equality between users. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>After the user completes all of the steps above, SelfKey will require an AI-Powered selfie check. This modern method of verifying an individual’s identity uses facial recognition technology.</p>
 
<p>For instance, here’s what happens during an AI-Powered selfie check:</p>
 
 The user will take a selfie and submit it to an AI-Powered system. 
 The AI-Powered system will check the photo against a vast collection of pre-verified images. 
 The system will use algorithms to identify unique facial features, like:&nbsp; 
 
 
 distance between the eyes 
 &nbsp;the shape of the jawline 
 &nbsp;the position of the nose 
 
 
 If the user passes the check, they will receive a POI (proof of identity) credential, which they can stake KEY on. 
 If the user does not pass the check, they will not be allowed to continue. 
 In the case of a false negative, the user will have the possibility to contact support. 
 
 
<p>These AI-Powered selfie checks will be made periodically, each time a user performs important actions within SelfKey DAO.</p>
 How does this benefit us? 
<p>This method is widely used by online platforms and organizations that require a high level of trust and security in their user authentication process. Firstly, it is a quick, convenient, and reliable method. Secondly, and most importantly, AI-powered checks will prevent identity fraud in the online world.</p>
 
<p>For instance, AI-Powered proof of individuality will efficiently and accurately check that:</p>
 
 The user’s selfie is not forged by another individual. 
 The user’s selfie is not AI-generated or fake. 
 The user is a real person. 
 The user’s selfie matches the original selfie they submitted during the KYC check. 
 
 Anti-Sybil technology 
<p>Did you know that there is a term for “identity fraud” in the digital world? In the context of online security and identity verification, “Sybil” refers to the act of creating multiple fake identities or accounts.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>A single, malicious individual or a group can do that, with the intention of manipulating or deceiving the system. Alarmingly, it can carry out spam attacks, manipulate voting in online polls for elections, even inflate the popularity of a website or social media.</p>
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks is a crucial challenge in the design of many online systems. Thankfully, SelfKey’s AI-Powered proof of individuality methods can fight against that.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Even though technology has posed challenges throughout the decades, it has an immense potential to make society better. AI-Powered Proof of Individuality has become a part of our daily lives, helping us identify ourselves in a quick and efficient manner. The advantages modern identification methods bring are undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>In spite of that, having concerns about privacy and security is normal, especially when it comes to our individuality. However, SelfKey is continuously working on developing methods to combat those who use cutting-edge technology for malicious purposes.</p>
 
<p>Finally, as technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more complex methods of identification in the future. But, it is vital to remember that we are supposed to use technology to enhance our lives, our work, rather than replace them. The solution is to find a balance between technology and humanity.</p>
<p>Together with SelfKey we can achieve that balance.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>The rise of technology has made a great impact all around the world. It changed the way we communicate, work, and study. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), most of our daily tasks are made considerably easier, and access to information has never been more effortless. However, in order to benefit from all the wonders of AI, we have to become part of its world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of our private information had to evolve from physical papers to digital identities, which are stored in centralized systems. But while traditional, centralized systems are convenient, they put our private data in danger due to their weak security measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, solutions are being developed to change the way we authenticate ourselves online and the way we perform individuality-based activities on Web3. Technology can help protect our private information, just as much as it can be used to compromise it. The key is to remember that we can use AI for our benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will thoroughly elaborate on DAOs, SelfKey’s DAO (including specific terms like KEY, SELF, and NFTs), and how user engagement in the DAO will be beneficial for individuals in the long run.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Humans and Digital Identity 
 How we operate in the online world 
<p>Nowadays, we operate in the online world in many ways. We use various tools and platforms to connect, communicate, and collaborate with one another across the globe. For instance social media, messaging apps, online forums, and video conferencing. The web has opened up endless opportunities for people to share information, ideas, and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as with any aspect of human behavior, there are also challenges and risks associated with operating in the online world. One of the biggest concerns is the safety of our personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The risks we take when performing individuality-based activities online 
<p>When we engage in individuality-based activities online that involve sharing personal information, we expose ourselves to a variety of potential risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, personal information shared online can be accessed either by AI or human identity thieves, putting our privacy and security at risk. Even seemingly small details such as our names, birthdates, or email addresses can be used to compromise our security. This can lead to AI attempting to create fake identities using our leaked personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do to avoid those risks? 
<p>Being cautious about what we share online and keeping our privacy safe is very important. However, it is equally important to make sure that the individuals we engage with are not fake, AI-generated entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols within a DAO can be the most secure means of verifying that individuals are genuine, real persons. Not only that, but within a DAO, there is no single entity to govern and control our personal data. What a DAO strives to achieve is equality and fairness among its users, as well as maintain the security of their individuality.</p>
 DAOs vs centralized systems 
 A brief description of DAO&nbsp; 
<p>A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a type of organization that usually operates using blockchain technology. This facilitates decentralized decision-making and transparent governance without the need for a centralized authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs are typically run by a group of individuals who hold tokens or cryptocurrency. Individuals can also vote on decisions related to the organization's operations. For instance: funding proposals or changes to the organization's rules.&nbsp;</p>
 How DAOs are revolutionizing individuality-based operations 
<p>DAOs&nbsp; are changing the way individuals operate by innovating the concept of decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In traditional organizations, individuals cannot materialize their ideas or concerns, due to the centralized systems based on hierarchies. DAOs, on the other hand, allow members to participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the organization's goals through decentralized governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>By using blockchain technology, DAOs enable trustless collaboration and eliminate the need for intermediaries. This method makes it easier for members to join and participate in collective decision-making. Additionally, it creates a more inclusive and democratic environment where each member can have an equal say and contribute to the organization's success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, DAOs are empowering individuals to come together, build communities, and work towards common goals, without sacrificing their individuality or autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
 DAOs and individuals 
 DAOs suffer from lack of user participation 
<p>Despite their potential benefits, DAOs can suffer from a lack of user participation. Because DAOs rely on decentralized decision-making, they require active participation from members to ensure that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner.</p>
 How will user participation help DAOs “stay alive” 
<p>User participation is critical to the success and sustainability of DAOs. Without active participation from members, DAOs may struggle to make decisions, coordinate actions, and achieve their goals. Moreover, low participation can lead to apathy or disengagement. In turn, this can weaken the community and reduce the value of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, active user participation can help DAOs stay alive by:</p>
 
 Promoting engagement. 
 Building a strong community. 
 Ensuring that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, user participation is essential for DAOs to remain viable and achieve their goals over the long term.</p>
 The benefits of participating in DAOs 
<p>Participating in DAOs offers numerous advantages for individuals looking to collaborate and contribute to a community-driven effort. It provides opportunities for innovation and community building while offering financial incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits include:</p>
 
 Democratic decision-making 
 Rewards 
 Increased security 
 Unique contributions 
 Transparency 
 
 SelfKey’s DAO 
<p>After explaining the general concept of DAOs, let's examine SelfKey’s DAO objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuality is a vital aspect that the SelfKey DAO is focused on. In SelfKey’s Protocol, every member’s uniqueness is valued in order to help protect their digital identity from theft and forgery. We aim to create a safe environment with the help of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a>, where valued members can operate using trustless and secure methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selkey’s DAO aims to provide secure and private digital identity solutions. With strong credentials in cryptography and blockchain technology, Selkey’s DAO’s goals include protecting users' privacy and giving them control over their data. Credentials are lacking in the crypto industry, and they’re a need in order to keep users’ information safe from being doxxed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, SelfKey’s goal is to develop a method for individuals to engage with one another in a decentralized, trustless environment, while their private data and individuality remain safe and secure.</p>
 Important Terminology in SelfKey’s DAO 
 What is KEY? 
<p>The KEY <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-a-utility-token/">utility token</a> is the centerpiece of the SelfKey Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has several uses, such as:</p>
 
 Being a means of payment for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Being used to stake credentials on. 
 Being utilized to govern and empower members of the SelfKey DAO. 
 Providing the necessary tools for users to take control of their digital identity and secure their privacy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more individuals join the SelfKey Protocol, the potential uses of KEY will only continue to expand, further cementing its importance as a vital component of the decentralized digital identity revolution.</p>
 What is SELF? 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to stake on credentials, SelfKey has proposed SELF tokens in order to help an individual keep track of what they have staked and for what period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of SELF’s attributes:</p>
 
 SELF tokens can be minted by individuals who properly staked on a real identity. 
 Essentially, SELF can be used as a sort of measurement of reputation. 
 SELF tokens have utility as a reputation signal - they should strengthen legitimate credentials and they may help weed out illegitimate credentials. 
 They are issued by users themselves. 
 They do not have any intrinsic value. 
 SELF tokens may also have utility as a governance mechanism. Those who use, accrue reputation, or are acting as a sort of “identity mining” to secure the platform will receive governance influence. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as the user will stake on a credential which is valid, the user will accumulate reputation to said credential in the form of tokens.</p>
 SelfKey’s NFTs 
<p>At SelfKey, active members have the opportunity to earn NFTs by participating in the community and contributing to the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the unique features of SelfKey's NFTs is that they are highly customizable. This means that individuals can tailor their NFTs to their specific needs and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey places a great emphasis on individuality, recognizing that each person has their own unique identity and set of circumstances. It is a platform that truly values individuality, and is dedicated to helping people take control of their own identity and data. This is reflected in the customizability of its tokens and the overall design of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>Participating in the SelfKey DAO and earning tokens offers many benefits, such as:</p>
 
 The ability to have a say in the project's direction. 
 Voting rights on proposals. 
 Access to exclusive community events. 
 The opportunity to earn rewards through active participation in the DAO. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO provides a platform for community members to be more engaged and invested in the success of the SelfKey Protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
 
 First, a user must perform a KYC check in order to properly authenticate themselves as a real person and the person whom they claim to be. Afterwards, they will join the DAO. 
 The user will then be able to stake KEY tokens on their KYC credentials. Afterwards, they will be able to start accumulating SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens can be used to purchase NFT packs with particular customizations. 
 Alternatively, the user can mint their SELF tokens and use them for whatever purpose they find useful and fit. 
 Finally, users can contribute to the SelfKey DAO by performing tasks based on grants issued by the ecosystem. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, active participation and engagement in the SelfKey DAO can bring significant benefits to the SelfKey Protocol and its members. By being actively involved in the decision-making process, members can help shape the direction of the project, making sure that it aligns with their interests and needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, engagement can help build a stronger sense of community among SelfKey users, fostering a supportive environment for learning and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, a thriving SelfKey DAO requires active participation from its members, and those who are willing to engage will reap the benefits of a more robust and inclusive ecosystem.</p>
 Conclusions:&nbsp; 
<p>Unfortunately, most people still rely on centralized systems. However, efforts are being made to empower them to take charge of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO aims to assist individuals in gaining full control of their private data, enabling them to safely engage in Web3 transactions based on their individuality. Despite being a small ecosystem at present, it is secure and has the potential to reach new heights with the help of user participation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the SelfKey DAO develops, users will derive more benefits from it. Ultimately, it is user contribution that will enable SelfKey to achieve its long-term goals.</p>

  Access controls all too often rely on things such as passwords, security questions, and physical tokens that can be shared or stolen, making such systems vulnerable to abuse. However, security can be improved by using biometrics that measure the physical and behavioral characteristics of the person seeking to gain access to something.

  South Korea approved the first phase of cryptocurrency regulations to provide a clearer framework for users and businesses while addressing concerns related to illicit activities.  Striking a balance between safeguarding market participants’ interests and encouraging innovation will be crucial for fostering wider adoption and long-term growth in South Korea’s crypto&nbsp;sector.  As the digital currency landscape in South Korea continues to develop, open communication and collaboration between regulators, businesses, and users will be essential for cultivating a thriving and secure crypto ecosystem.  <p>The recent passing of the cryptocurrency bill by South Korea’s National Assembly represents a significant step towards regulating the country’s largely unregulated crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now the bill will move to the Legislation and Judiciary Committee must for approval. And if the Committee endorses the bill, it will move to the final approval stage, which is expected to take place later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>South Korea first announced the new cryptocurrency legislation in June 2022, in the aftermath of the Terra ecosystem collapse, which sent shockwaves through the industry. Just this week, South Korean authorities indicted Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine others for illegal&nbsp;trading.</p><p>Now with the bill’s provisions, the authorities aim to create a safer and more secure trading environment for investors while also preventing money laundering and other illicit activities that may have been taking place in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>One notable provision in the bill is the mandate for crypto service providers to maintain user assets and deposits separately from their own assets, have insurance, hold reserves for contingencies such as system failures or hacks, and record all transactions.</p><blockquote>Any co-mingling of users’ funds with providers’ funds is discouraged by the&nbsp;bill.</blockquote><p>Businesses and individuals participating in the sector will further be required to self-report irregularities to maintain compliance.</p> Serious Consequences of Non-compliance <p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained">crypto bill</a> includes severe consequences for failing to comply with necessary disclosures, engaging in price manipulation, or promoting crypto assets falsely, which is deemed&nbsp;illegal.</p><p>If found guilty, offenders face up to a year in prison or fines up to five times the amount of illegally earned profits. The penalties escalate to five years to life imprisonment for causing losses of over 5 billion Korean won (around US$3.73 million) to consumers.</p> The Impact on Crypto Users &amp; Ecosystem <p>The impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem will be multifaceted. On the one hand, increased regulation will provide a clearer framework for users and businesses to operate within, instilling confidence and trust in the industry. On the other hand, critics argue that such regulations may stifle innovation and growth, potentially hindering the sector’s progress.</p><p>Moreover, compliance with the new regulations may prove challenging for some crypto businesses, potentially leading to market consolidation as smaller entities struggle to adapt. This, in turn, may alter the competitive landscape and affect the diversity of offerings available to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness of these regulations in preventing illicit activities and safeguarding investors’ interests remains to be seen. As South Korea’s crypto market evolves, it is essential for regulators, businesses, and users to work collaboratively in order to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring a secure, transparent, and stable digital currency ecosystem.</p> Final Note <p>As South Korea’s National Assembly approves the first phase of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">cryptocurrency regulations</a>, the country’s crypto ecosystem is entering a critical transition. These initial regulations allow for better oversight of digital asset businesses and require service providers to report suspicious activities. It’s important for crypto users and businesses to understand and follow these new rules to avoid legal&nbsp;issues.</p><p>While there are concerns about the impact of these regulations on the industry, this first phase also offers more certainty and protection for investors. Finding the right balance between protecting the interests of market participants and encouraging innovation will be crucial for broader adoption and long-term growth in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this initial phase of regulations remains to be seen, given the fast-paced and ever-changing nature of the cryptocurrency market. As South Korea’s digital currency landscape evolves and more regulatory phases are introduced, open communication between regulators, businesses, and users will be essential for a thriving and secure crypto ecosystem.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  Using a domain as your handle helps with account identity, verification, and portability. Here's how to set your domain as your handle.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<div class='wrap'>


The official account for the AT Protocol with a custom domain.
 What’s a custom domain? 
<p>A custom domain is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet. For example, Bluesky’s domain is <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code>.</p>
<p>Every device that connects to the internet has a unique IP address that identifies it. But it’s much easier to remember <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code> instead of a series of numbers. The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like a phonebook for the internet and points a domain like <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code> to its IP address, so we don’t have to remember the numbers ourselves.</p>
<p>Domains can be further divided into subdomains. For example, if your domain was <code>example.com</code> but you had a blog hosted at <code>blog.example.com</code>, then <code>blog</code> is the subdomain.</p>
 Why does Bluesky use domains as handles, and why would I want to use a domain as my handle? 
<p>Technically, it’s the AT Protocol that lets you use domains as handles. Bluesky is a client application built on top of the protocol, so it will also use domains as handles.</p>
<p>The AT Protocol was designed to use domains for multiple reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>Identity: Bluesky is just one application built on top of the AT Protocol. Let’s say you set your handle to <code>example.com</code> on Bluesky. You’ll be able to use that same handle across all applications built on the AT Protocol (and there’s a growing number!). Now, you no longer have to list five different usernames based on what was available at the time you signed up for an app — just use your domain!</p>
 
 
<p>Verification: Websites have a long history of verification already, so using domains borrows their authority. For example, a newsroom like NPR could set their handle to be <code>@npr.org</code>. Then, any journalists that NPR wants to verify could use subdomains to set their handles to be <code>@name.npr.org</code>. Brand accounts could set their handle to be their domain as well, which companies like Vercel and Tailscale have already done.</p>

 
 
<p>Portability: Maybe you want to switch to a different server. Then, there’s no need to switch your handle from something server-specific if you’re using your domain as your handle.</p>
 
 
<p>Read our previously published blog post on domain names as handles <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">here</a> for more information.</p>
 I’m convinced! How do I acquire a custom domain? 
<p>If you don’t have a custom domain already, you can purchase one from any ICANN-accredited domain registrar or reseller. Note that this isn’t required to join Bluesky; you could use our server’s off-the-shelf naming (in the format of <code>@name.bsky.social</code>) if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can use services like Namecheap or Google Domains to register your domain of choice. Domains are unique, so you must choose one that hasn’t already been registered by someone else. During registration, you’ll likely pay an annual fee and provide personal information.</p>
<p>Your personal information is used to populate the WHOIS directory, which is a searchable database that holds information on domain ownership. You might prefer to keep your information private for various reasons — in that case, most domain registrars offer WHOIS privacy protection as a service.</p>
 How do I set this custom domain as my handle? 
<p>Let’s use the Bluesky team’s <code>@atproto.com</code> account as an example. Note that the account uses the handle <code>@atproto.com</code>, which verifies its identity because it owns the website <a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto.com</a>.
</p>
<p>Note: if you change your default Bluesky username (with the <code>.bsky.social</code> suffix) to a custom domain, your old username will be available for someone else to use. However, any tags or mentions with your old handle will still point to your account.</p>
<p>The screenshots below will show you how to set your custom domain as your handle in your mobile app, but similar steps apply to the desktop version.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the left side menu by clicking your profile picture thumbnail. Click “Settings” and scroll down to the “Advanced” section. Click “Change my handle.”</p>
  
 
 
<p>On the “Change my handle” screen, click “I have my own domain.”</p>
  
 
 
<p>Now, you’ll have a screen that looks like this. This includes information that you will need to add to your domain registrar.</p>
  
 
 
<p>Navigate back to your domain registrar, which is the company you bought your domain from (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.). The specific steps here depend on which company you used, but you’ll want to navigate to DNS management for your domain. This might be under an “Advanced DNS” tab.</p>
 
 
<p>Advanced: If you're using a hosting company other than the registrar, for example Cloudflare, navigate there to add your TXT record, not your original registrar.</p>
  
 
 
<p>We want to add a TXT (text) record to your domain. Step 3 above contains all of the information you’ll need to add to your domain. The DID value is public and not sensitive information. (Read more about DIDs <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did-plc">here</a>.)</p>
 
 Set the domain: <code>_atproto</code> 
 Set the type: TXT 
 Set the value field (also sometimes called “data”), except use your own DID value: <code>did=did:plc:[your value here]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After you add the TXT record, wait a couple of minutes for the change to propagate across the internet. Then, just click “Verify DNS Record.” You’re done! Check your Bluesky profile to see if it has updated. Remember, DNS propagation might take some time.</p>
 
 
<p>Congratulations, you have a custom domain as your handle now!</p>

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, most individuals operate in a digital environment where transactions and communication are made online. As a result, digital identity verification has become a very important aspect of online security and compliance.</p>
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is one of the most widely used methods for verifying the identities of users and clients. While KYC has been effective in assuring security and regulatory compliance, it has some significant drawbacks. KYC can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult for users, potentially resulting in losing customers and missing business opportunities.</p>
<p>SelfKey addresses this issue by proposing a potential solution to these issues with SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is a revolutionary approach to identity verification that could be faster, more secure, and less costly than traditional KYC methods. It uses the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to potentially offer a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. This can possibly eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods.</p>
<p>With SelfKey iD, users can create a <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/?utm_source=SelfKey&amp;utm_medium=SelfSovereignIdentity&amp;utm_campaign=selfkey_blog&amp;utm_id=selfkey_blog">self sovereign identity</a> that they can control, giving them more privacy and full ownership over their personal data.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the drawbacks of traditional KYC methods. We will also examine the advantages of SelfKey iD, its features and benefits compared to traditional KYC. Additionally, we will explore the potential impact of SelfKey iD on the future of digital identity verification.</p>

 KYC: Potential Issues to Consider 
<p>Even though KYC has become a commonly used procedure in many industries, it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Here as some examples:</p>
 
 The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for KYC purposes comes with legal responsibilities and storage costs, which can take a toll on companies.&nbsp; 
 Users have a tendency to dislike KYC checks, finding them intrusive and time-consuming. This can lead to lower conversion rates and a negative first impression for potential customers.&nbsp; 
 Implementing KYC can be a difficult and expensive process, further adding to its disadvantages.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Perhaps the time to explore alternative ways of verifying customer identities has come. With SelfKey iD, you can explore methods that are less tedious for all parties involved.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD 
<p>As stated above, KYC processes can be inconvenient for both companies and customers alike. However, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Ai-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> method along with SelfKey iD can potentially become a better alternative to KYC.</p>
<p>Here are some of SelfKey.iD’s benefits:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The overall process is easier and less costly, making it more accessible for users.&nbsp; 
 The onboarding process is quick. 
 Ongoing monitoring makes sure that customer data remains accurate. 
 Existing KYC checks are reused, thus the need to collect and store PII repeatedly is no longer an issue. 
 Costs for companies are reduced, but also improves customer privacy and security. 
 It provides powerful compliance tools, ensuring that companies remain in compliance with regulations and laws.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can streamline their KYC processes, reducing costs, enhancing customer privacy, and improving compliance. Ultimately, this results in a better experience for customers and a more efficient and secure system for companies.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss some of SelfKey iDs benefits more in depth.</p>
 High-Level Flow 
<p>SelfKey iD enables zero-knowledge interactions between individuals, making sure that users' data is kept private and secure. With SelfKey iD, the user's data does not reach your server. This adds to user privacy and prevents potential data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the onboarding process is quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user with a SelfKey iD visits your server, they are checked to determine if they match your filter. If they do, they can be onboarded instantly, simplifying the process and reducing the time and resources required.</p>
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can provide a secure and efficient onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security. The zero-knowledge interactions and instant onboarding features make it a better alternative to traditional KYC processes.</p>
 Quick Relying Party Onboarding 
<p>To streamline the onboarding process, the following steps are required:</p>
 
 Sign up at SelfKey iD to create your user filters. 
 Add these filters to your smart contracts. 
 When a user attempts to run your smart contract function, the system will check if they have a SelfKey iD NFT. If they do not have one, they will be prompted to get one. 
 If the issuer has a SelfKey iD NFT, they will then be able to verify whether the user matches the filter that you have set for the transaction. If they do, the user will be granted access to your server. If not, the user will be denied access. 
 
<p>Following these steps, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system ensures that only authorized users are given access to the company's services. This reduces the risk of relying parties allowing access to unauthorized individuals to their services.</p>
 The Issuance: SelfKey iD NFT User Flow 
<p>The issuance process for SelfKey iD is outlined below:</p>
 
 The user visits your project and is redirected to SelfKey iD, in case they do not already have one. 
 The user pays for the verification check. 
 The user goes through the verification process, and the issuer stores their data. Ongoing monitoring of the account begins. 
 If the user passes the checks, the issuer releases a credential that verifies the user's humanity, uniqueness in the database, and verified data. 
 The user then mints their own SelfKey iD NFT. 
 
<p>By following these steps, users can obtain a SelfKey iD NFT that verifies their identity and potentially provides access to various projects that use the SelfKey iD platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification process ensures that only authorized users are granted access, providing enhanced security and privacy for both users and companies.</p>
<p>Enhanced security offers several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Anti-bot security. This measure prevents automated attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious or malicious bot traffic. 
 Fraud protection. Bots are often used for fraudulent activities like creating fake accounts or generating false clicks to generate revenue. Implementing anti-bot security measures helps to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities, keeping the business and customers safe. 
 Improved user experience. Bots can significantly hinder the user experience by slowing down websites or making it difficult for users to access information. Anti-bot security measures ensure that legitimate users can access the website or service without interruptions or delays. 
 
 The Verification: SelfKey iD User Onboarding 
<p>The onboarding process for SelfKey.iD is as follows:</p>
 
 A user with a SelfKey iD visits your project. 
 You request that the SelfKey iD issuer checks the user's information. 
 The issuer verifies whether the user's data matches your filters. 
 The issuer sends a signed message confirming the user's status.&nbsp; 
 If the user is verified, they can be onboarded, and the signed message can be used to authorize transactions. 
 The relying party (issuer) is billed for the verification check. 
 
<p>Through this process, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding method that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system makes sure that only authorized users are granted access to the company's services. The use of a signed message adds an extra layer of security, offering further assurance that the user's data has been verified by the relying party.</p>
 Reusable KYC and SelfKey iD 
<p>The benefits of using reusable KYC with SelfKey iD are as follows:</p>
 
 Your project subscribes to SelfKey iD. 
 Your project can be featured on the SelfKey iD website. 
 A user with a SelfKey iD NFT visits the SelfKey iD website. 
 The user scrolls through the list of projects that support SelfKey iD. 
 The user can potentially choose your project from the list. 
 The user quickly onboards to your project using their existing SelfKey iD NFT. 
 Your project profits from the seamless onboarding experience. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's reusable KYC system could provide companies with a more streamlined onboarding experience for users. Users can easily access multiple projects without having to go through the time-consuming and costly process of verifying their identity each time.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies benefit from increased user adoption and loyalty, as the reusable KYC system encourages users to choose projects that support SelfKey iD. Overall, this system offers a win-win situation for both companies and users alike.</p>
 SelfKey iD New Project Setup 
<p>Setting up a new project with SelfKey iD is quite easy. Below, we will detail a few steps which you need to consider.</p>
 The project onboarding process is as follows:&nbsp; 
 
 Go to the SelfKey iD website. 
 Register for a new account. 
 Add your company privacy policy to your account. 
 Choose a subscription pack that suits your needs. 
 Set up filters to verify your users' identity. 
 Your project is now ready to implement the filters into your system. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's easy-to-use platform could offer companies a quick and efficient way to set up their project's identity verification process. The platform provides a range of subscription plans to choose from, depending on your business's specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ability to customize filters for your users, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, enhancing security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, SelfKey iD's new project setup process offers a simple and effective solution for individuals looking to integrate identity verification into their systems</p>
 The Library Implementation 
<p>To implement SelfKey iD into your project's system, follow these simple steps:</p>
 
 Implement the backend library onto your server. 
 Prepare the front-end to handle calls for authorization. 
 Implement the SelfKey iD smart contract into your own smart contract. 
 Your project is now ready to onboard users. 
 
<p>By following these steps, you can integrate SelfKey iD into your project's system and take advantage of its powerful identity verification capabilities. With the backend library in place, your server will be able to communicate with SelfKey iD to authorize user access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating the smart contract into your own contract, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, boosting security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD's library implementation process offers a robust solution for businesses looking to enhance their identity verification capabilities.</p>
 How the Profile Builder Functions: 
<p>SelfKey iD's Profile Builder is a tool that allows you to create customizable filters for your project. These filters could be used to sort and manage users based on specific criteria.</p>
<p>The Profile Builder allows you to create multiple filters, which can be implemented separately on your project. This means that you can have different filters applied to different sections of your app or website, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 You could create a filter that accepts citizens of Country A for one section of your app, but another filter for the same project that excludes citizens of Country A from another section.&nbsp; 
 This level of detailed filtering allows you to match regulatory requirements while also boosting the benefits of your app. 
 
<p>To set up the Profile Builder, you would first define the standards you want to filter by, such as citizenship, age, or profession. You can then apply rules and conditions to each filter to create a customized sorting system.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Profile Builder in SelfKey iD could provide a flexible and powerful tool for managing user data and creating a tailored experience for your app's users.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey aims to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the needs of both businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of SelfKey iD could include efficient, secure, and cost-effective KYC checks, streamlined onboarding, and better conversion rates. Additionally, SelfKey iD's approach to privacy ensures legal compliance and reduces costs associated with PII storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, with a user-friendly one-time KYC process and access to multiple projects on the website, SelfKey iD offers convenience and ease of use for users. SelfKey iD's project features and powerful user filtering tools could enable businesses to match rules and increase profitability.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>

 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>
 SelfKey ENS subdomain: Definition and Benefits 
<p>When developing new technologies, SelfKey prioritizes the concept of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity (SSID)</a>, and the SelfKey ENS subdomain is a prime example of this approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the creation of a subdomain, SelfKey is aiming to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. This technology is centered on empowering users and it may provide them with greater control over their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey’s goal is to bring a positive change to the way people operate in the digital world. To make it more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>
 What is SelfKey ENS subdomain 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is an innovative subdomain that aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly domain name resolution system. Given this, users might not have to pay recurring fees for their subdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is likely to be a subdomain of key.eth. This means that users may register their preferred subdomain by adding their name or any other word of their choosing, such as yourname.key.eth. This naming convention is similar to email addresses. And, by providing an easier way to identify and interact with Ethereum addresses, it may bring self-sovereign identity closer to mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as DNS made the internet more accessible to the masses by providing a simpler way to access websites than using IP addresses, key.eth may do the same for Ethereum addresses. It replaces long, complex addresses with a human-readable format that is easy to remember and share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may improve the ease of use of the blockchain and help resolve one of the challenges to widespread adoption. Because of this, key.eth may be a step towards a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain ecosystem.</p>
 What are the benefits of SelfKey ENS 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is designed to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. By putting user accesibility first, SelfKey is aiming to create a more inclusive domain name resolution system that builds on the strengths of ENS while adding to its advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach might make SelfKey ENS subdomain a compelling choice for anyone who values privacy and security, and wants a more user-friendly way to manage their digital identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain provides several benefits to its users:</p>
 
 One of the primary advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that every verified SelfKey iD holder may receive a free key.eth subdomain on the Ethereum Mainnet that is longer than seven characters. This free subdomain may allow users to experiment with SelfKey ENS subdomain and explore its features without having to make extra financial commitment. 
 Once users have their free subdomain, they may buy more subdomains using any of the supported tokens. Users may utilize these subdomains for various purposes, such as getting payments or creating aliases for use in games. Users may buy as many subdomains as they like and use them to streamline their online activities. 
 Another significant benefit of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that users may sell their subdomains.&nbsp; Any marketplace that supports ENS trading, such as OpenSea, is a good place to start. This feature may offer users the freedom to experiment with different subdomains. And, if they decide to change their online identity or activities, they may sell them. 
 
<p>Overall, SelfKey ENS subdomain may provide great benefits to its users. It may enable individuals to not only manage and own their domains, but also boost their visibility online. These features might make SelfKey ENS an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their online identity and activities.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and ownership of personal data. However, the traditional centralized systems we rely on for managing our digital assets and domains may compromise these rights. This is where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in as part of an ideal decentralized future.</p>
<p>ENS allows individuals to own and manage their own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and secure. This means that no central authority has control over the domain name. A feature which gives individuals complete ownership and control over their online identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS may be one such solution that offers individuals the opportunity to manage and own their own domain names without the limitations of traditional domain names. This may not only give users more control over their online presence but also provide greater privacy and security.</p>

  The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
 
  Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved. 
  The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It might serve as proof of identity and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
 Attaching NFT series to SelfKey iD 
<p>SelfKey continues to prioritize user-friendliness with the introduction of a unique feature that may enable users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This feature may add a touch of personalization and uniqueness to the user's digital identity. Even more, it might reflect the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may also enhance the user's experience by providing them with more options to personalize and showcase their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform reflects the platform's continued focus on user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD may provide users with numerous benefits that enhance their experience on the platform and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits may include:</p>
 
 access to the governance of the SelfKey Protocol. 
 the ability to mint SELF tokens. 
 participating in staking. 
 exclusive access to member-only channels on Discord. 
 obtaining exclusive collectible NFT packs. 
 registering for KEY.ETH ENS domains. 
 enjoying instant login to partner apps. 
 
 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Staking 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may not only empower the governance of the SelfKey DAO but it may also provide a model for other decentralized governance systems. By offering powerful, privacy-preserving identity credentials, the SelfKey iD might enable more fair and democratic governance. This way, users may have greater control over their data and identities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to provide new forms of decentralized governance, which may allow members to experiment with different approaches and explore the full potential of the SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crypto world continues to evolve, the SelfKey iD might play an increasingly important role in enabling secure and transparent transactions across a wide range of platforms and applications.</p>

<p>The SelfKey Discord channel is a community hub where users can connect with other members of the SelfKey community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants who stay active in the channel can engage with other individuals, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Even more, active members can quickly get answers to their questions and find solutions to almost any problems they may encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ft2U7DKg4X">official discord channel</a> is often the place where SelfKey DAO announces and hosts various events and activities. Therefore, keeping up with the channel and actively participating in discussions, members can stay up-to-date with important news and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By showing drive and creativity, active members can help develop new ideas and solutions that will help the DAO grow. This can be anything from suggesting new features for the DAO's platform to proposing fresh methods for community governance.</p>
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system 
<p>By certifying that members have a deep-rooted interest in keeping their own credentials safe, the overall security of the system can be enhanced. This can also minimize the risk of credentials being lost or stolen, as well as help keep participants safe from identity theft or other security breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage of staking is that it can increase the credibility of the system by motivating participants to make sure that their credentials are valid and up-to-date. This way, errors or mistakes in the data can be prevented, reducing delays or issues when using the platform.</p>
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants 
<p>One of the key benefits of offering a grant within SelfKey DAO is that members can mint tokens for their contributions to building the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping with developer and designer tickets can improve the overall quality of the platform. By addressing technical issues and making improvements to the design, the platform can become more user-friendly, efficient, and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can aid in attracting new users and retaining existing ones, as well as drive the growth of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way that members can contribute to the DAO is by delivering on development, design, and QA bounties based on grants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bounties encourage members to tackle specific tasks that have to do with the development, design, and testing of the DAO's software. Participants can work together or individually to deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of the DAO and its community.</p>
 The Benefits and Uses of Work Tokens 
<p>As stated previously, SelfKey DAO facilitates benefits for active members, such as being able to mint tokens. We’ve elaborated on the activities active members can perform. Now, let us focus more thoroughly on how participants can make use of the work tokens they mint.</p>
 Work tokens can be exchanged for NFT packs 
<p>SelfKey’s NFTs are called Normies, and they can be customizable to fit the user’s personal preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some advantages Normies bring to members:</p>
 
 they allow users to express their unique creativity and personality by creating one-of-a-kind digital assets.&nbsp; 
 they can increase the originality of the asset, as it becomes more exclusive and personalized.&nbsp; 
 they enable members to have greater control over their digital assets. 
 they allow members to modify or add additional content to their NFT. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT packs that members can obtain by exchanging work tokens can be used in several ways.</p>
 
 To customize Normies around a specific theme or concept, such as a particular genre or event, such as: fandoms, movies, games, music, etc. 
 To customize Normies by choosing the background, outfits, hair styles, skin color and texture, or additional details. 
 To create different levels of rarity among the NFTs contained within them. For example, a pack could contain one or more ultra-rare, limited-edition wearables. 
 To build a collection of related or complementary NFTs. This can motivate members to collect multiple packs in order to complete the entire set. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey’s NFT packs can include unlockable content, such as additional media or exclusive access to events.</p>
 Work tokens can be used to participate in DAO Governance 
<p>DAO governance is ideal for members because:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Decisions are made through a decentralized voting system that takes every participant’s opinion into consideration. 
 It represents a more fair and open method of organization that aims to benefit every active member. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>Centralized systems are based on pyramid structures, where the majority have to follow the rules and authority of the few. Typically, in this kind of structure, individuals have no way of voicing their needs, let alone have them met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, on the other hand, can be shaped by the participants’ direct involvement. This is why it is important to keep DAOs active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO is working on developing the most efficient incentive system to make sure that active members are constantly involved with the development of the DAO. It’s likely to become the ideal space in which individuals can safely engage and have their needs heard and met.&nbsp;</p>

 Online Safety 
 Digital revolution: both a blessing and a curse 
<p>In the past several decades, mankind has shown magnificent progress in computer science. So much so that society quickly became accustomed to using Information and Communication Technologies on a daily basis. Whether it is for recreational purposes, communication, work or education, mundane tasks are made significantly easier with the help of cutting-edge technology and wireless systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of performing convenient assignments, such as reading, generating, integrating, and theorizing information. However, it is also heading dangerously fast towards mimicking a trait which, up until now, has been uniquely human: identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is leaked, AI can potentially make use of that information to steal or forge human identities. Thankfully, the future will also bring ways to prevent that. A Self-Sovereign Identity solution is being developed to protect our data from being stolen and sold.</p>
 How safe is it really out there? 
<p>Using technology and having a digital presence has become so common nowadays that many people don’t think twice about the security of their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they are within the safety of their homes, their data is still potentially visible to millions of users online. Among those millions, there are many individuals with bad intentions, who look for ways to use other people’s private data for their own personal benefit.</p>
<p>More often than not, however, it is entities that individuals are supposed to trust who end up selling or divulging their personal information to other parties. And those parties, whether willingly or not, will put that personal information at risk of being unlawfully used by bad players.</p>
<p>At the moment, unfortunately, people have come to depend on centralized systems in order to benefit from online services to perform their daily tasks. Without those online services, it would be impossible for individuals to function in the present day society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more of an obligation rather than a choice,and it has become so normal that we simply go with the flow. Otherwise, we will not be able to keep up with the fast-paced changes in the way we work, study, and communicate.</p>
 Our digital identities 
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) belonging to individuals, firms or organizations is being stored online in the form of digital data. This collection of digital data is then used to build our digital identity.</p>
<p>A digital identity is used to facilitate access to services that make it easy for computers to efficiently mediate transactions between two or more individuals. The web provides us with a quick way of performing these transactions. However, it is not the safest place to store our private information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> happen on a daily basis without our knowledge. Through data breaches, important and valuable information can be stolen and sold, including our very own digital identities.</p>
<p>Ideally, individuals should be able to make use of the advanced, modern day technology without the risk of their private data ending up in the wrong hands. In order for that to happen, individuals need to have more control over how their information is stored and who has access to view or share it, at all times.</p>
 The illusion of choice 
<p>Nowadays, control seems less impactful on our lives, because the deception of freedom is given to us through choices. However, when access to necessary modern applications is being restricted unless personal data is consensually shared, choice becomes an illusion.</p>
<p>With the choice to opt in being enforced, people have grown used to accepting the privacy policies of applications without a second thought. These policies, that we barely even bother to read, do mention how data is shared with third parties. However, we cannot do anything but blindly trust that service providers will not abuse or mishandle our data.</p>
<p>At the moment there is only the illusion of consent, of trust, all in the detriment of the individual. Because of this deceitful way of forcing users to consent to their data being used, trust between individuals is becoming more and more difficult to establish.</p>
<p>SSID aims to dispel these illusions and bring authentic consent and trust to the mainstream.</p>
 Seeking safety in a digital world 
<p>Sadly, Big Tech often profits off of individuals at the expense of the latter’s safety, which may lead up to identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many users are unaware of the unlawful incidents happening underneath the brightly colored backgrounds of websites and applications as they perform their daily online tasks. Living under the impression that, as long as there is no malware alert on their devices, they have nothing to be concerned about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alarming truth, however, is that security violations occur on a daily basis. These cumulative cyber attacks can potentially cause millions of dollars in damages to the individuals whose data was involved.</p>
 How will Self Sovereign Identity improve our online activities? 
<p>Fortunately, a solution to the above-mentioned risks is currently being developed by SelfKey. It will be the sword and shield for individuals to function and perform transactions in the safest way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self sovereign identity not only gives back the freedom of choice, but it also prevents this kind of disaster from happening. SSID users give access only to individuals that they wish to engage with. During this interaction, only a very limited amount of information is shared.</p>
<p>Therefore, sensitive, protected and important data is less likely to be sold to or shared with harmful individuals and organizations. Self sovereign identity was conceived to prevent data leakage in this sense. It gives users the power not only to manage and control, but also to protect what they deem valuable.&nbsp;</p>
 Self Sovereign Identity 
 A brief introduction 
<p>Self sovereign identity (SSID) is a new way of managing digital identities, which aims to put individuals in control of how their accounts and private information are managed. With SSID, individuals have full ownership over their personal data. They no longer need to rely on centralized systems that might share their data with unknown parties for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can store their private information into their devices and present it for validation when it is specifically needed. This way, the risk of having their data compromised is considerably reduced. Individuals are in complete control over how their information is used and stored, at all times.</p>
 How self sovereign identity is currently being implemented 
<p>Once Self Sovereign Identity users store their private data on their devices, they can quickly take the opportunity to interact with trusted partners. In order to benefit from the services offered by these trusted partners, users need to accept the processing of their information by the partners. This is declared by the relying party once the user attempts to onboard into their services.</p>
 Issues with the current implementation of Self Sovereign Identity 
 Adoption and Convenience 
<p>At the moment, SSID users must store their data on their private device instead of the traditional central database. This method allows the users to have full control of their personal data. On the down side, the flow by which users interact with the system is less convenient than centralized alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storing data on one private device makes it difficult for it to be accessed by the user’s other devices. Individuals have to manually introduce their information into devices they want to use, which can become time consuming and frustrating.</p>
 Scalability 
<p>Currently, users can only exercise their self sovereign rights with partners within the SSID environment. More so, individuals need to trust that the parties they choose to interact&nbsp; with will handle their personal data with respect to their privacy and store it securely.</p>
 How can the current Self Sovereign Identity implementation be improved and scaled? 
 
 Should we use Centralized Systems for convenience? 
<p>Centrally controlled systems are databases in which an individual’s digital identity is stored in one or more servers belonging to a centralized entity. Once personal data is stored in this type of server, an individual has no way of knowing who has access to it, who it is shared with, or where it ends up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is being shared with unknown, third parties, there is a high risk of unintentional information disclosure. This can lead to dire consequences like identity theft or secret information being disclosed to the public, stolen or sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While centralized systems are not necessarily malicious, their security is weak, which leads to data leakage. With AI progressing alarmingly fast, this is a particularly serious concern. As a conclusion, centralized systems can not be used to improve the adoption and scalability of SSID solutions.</p>
 Are Decentralized Systems a better option? 
<p>On the polar opposite of centralized systems are decentralized systems. This type of system stores and verifies information in multiple computers that work together as nodes in a network, popularly known as a blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By transferring the control from a centralized entity to a dispersed group, decentralized systems aim to reach a level of fairness among its users, without one individual having authority over the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way data is stored in a decentralized system makes it very difficult for malicious parties to manipulate it, because it is secured by the blockchain. A decentralized system is perfect for storing public and openly-accessible data, such as a record of transactions.</p>
<p>However, storing personally identifiable information (PII) in a decentralized system is highly unadvised, even if it is encrypted. PII can be anything from full name, phone number, full date of birth, full address, or credit card information.</p>
<p>Once data is made public, it can not be erased or changed, and it is openly accessible to anyone. Therefore, decentralized systems alone are not ideal for storing private information, due to inevitable and permanent loss of privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are part of the solution, though, and we will discuss in the following sections.</p>
 Is there a solution to this dilemma, then? 
<p>At the moment, SelfKey is actively working on and is committed to delivering an ideal solution to increase the adoption of SSID, using cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next segments we will thoroughly discuss SelfKey’s proposed solution, which pertains to:</p>
 
 The Trust Triangle 
 The Three Pillars of self sovereign identity 
 Zero Knowledge Proofs 
 
 The Trust Triangle 
<p>Presently, we are accustomed to the traditional “peer-to-peer” interactions between identity owners and verifiers. To better facilitate the goals of SSI, a three-party system is proposed. In this triangle, two individuals that want to interact securely can rely on a third party to issue and to confirm the authenticity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 For example: 
 
 We have individual A and individual B, two entities who are about to make an exchange. B has obtained their verifiable credentials (personal data that can be checked for validity) from C, a third, neutral party. C is legally permitted to vouch for B’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 B wants to make a purchase with A, but the services provided by A are age-restricted. Therefore, A must check with C if B legally qualifies to access that kind of service.&nbsp; 
 In this case, there is only one specific inquiry that must be clarified: whether B is a legal adult. That is the only information that C will validate with A. 
 A does not have access to extra information that would otherwise be physically printed on an ID or a passport. This information can be name, full address, full date of birth, social security number, photos, etc. Basically, any identifier that B does not want to share with A or to divulge to the public. 
 This also eliminates the risk of A, if potentially ill-intended, retaining private information from B. There is no visible data for A to read and memorize. There is only C’s confirmation that B qualifies (or not) to purchase a service from A, without giving out specific details. 
 
<p>This applies to any kind of identifier which is needed to validate interactions between persons or companies. The risk of personal data being visible to individuals outside of the trust triangle is eliminated this way. And even within the trust triangle, only the minimum, relevant information will be shown or confirmed.</p>
 Agents of The Trust Triangle 
<p>The issuer is the entity that releases verifiable credentials after verifying the claims given by the holder.&nbsp;</p>
 
 It is typically an institution, an organization or an individual who possesses the legal authority to verify and to vouch for the holder’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 Examples of issuers are governmental institutions; universities, departments, companies, agencies, authorities, training institutions, etc.&nbsp; 
 The issuer is a neutral party whose role is only to validate a claim in a holder-verifier transaction. 
 
<p>The holder (data owner) is the individual, a person, a company or an organization who owns unique, personal data.</p>
 
 The holder earns verifiable credentials after providing proof of authenticity to the issuer.&nbsp; 
 The data owner will use those verifiable credentials to prove authenticity before benefiting from various services, making purchases or transactions. 
 
<p>The verifier (relying party) is the entity which verifies a holder’s verifiable credentials.</p>
 
 The relying party will need to verify only a specific piece of information. Only the bare minimum which is relevant to provide a service to the holder. 
 The verifier checks if the holder’s data is issued by a competent and legally authorized issuer. 
 The verifier makes sure that the holder’s data has not been tampered with, forged, expired or revoked.&nbsp; 
 
 Trust in the digital world 
<p>What makes this triangle work is that the three parties are willing to trust one another. The element of trust is important, especially in a time where information forgery and theft happen quite frequently. But within a trust triangle, the user (or holder), has complete control over the management and visibility of their data.</p>
<p>As stated above, digital identities are the counterparts of physical identities that are verified through paper documents. The way trust works digitally is similar to the real, tangible world. However, the consequences of having personal information exposed to the public digitally are much greater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having to trust a centralized database is more or less forced upon individuals. Otherwise they couldn’t benefit from services required to perform daily transactions, either for personal or professional gain. Within a trust triangle, SSID can facilitate these daily transactions without holders having to concede to “blind trust” and risking the safety of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The Three Pillars of Self Sovereign Identity 
<p>Within the trust-triangle framework, there are three main components, or “pillars”, that enable the realization of the ideal solution SSID is aiming to achieve:</p>
 
 Blockchains 
 Decentralized Identifiers 
 Verifiable Credentials 
 
 Blockchains&nbsp; 
<p>A blockchain is a ledger which is shared across thousands of computers around the world. These computers act like nodes within a network, storing and verifying information in a way that makes it nearly impossible to modify or cheat the system.</p>
<p>Within a blockchain, data is saved like a compilation of records, linked to one another. Each user has a copy of this collection, which makes it particularly difficult for hackers to unlawfully modify the information stored within.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, data is protected using complex cryptography which, at the moment, cannot be deciphered by malignant parties. The blockchain will provide the security layer necessary for users and relying parties to interact within the SSID framework.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identifiers&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, for short, are the digital counterparts of physical documents, IDs, passports or licenses used to verify one’s identity.</p>
<p>What qualifies as an identifier is any kind of information that proves an individual’s identity and individuality. Traditionally, identifiers are issued and stored by centralized systems, such as governmental institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers no longer depend on a central system to manage, issue, and store valuable, private information. They ensure that individuals are able to generate their own identifiers with the help of systems that they trust. Individuals can then use cryptographic proof, such as digital signatures, to authenticate their new identifiers as their own.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers are unique. They cannot be forged or stolen, because identity itself is unique and pertaining to only one individual. For example, a digital wallet address can be used as a decentralized identifier.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 
<p>Verifiable credentials are digital versions of physical, paper documents used by persons, businesses, and organizations to identify themselves. Individuals can also use them to prove that they are qualified to access a service or perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are, but not limited to: digital birth certificates, digital education certificates, digital licenses, digital employee identification cards.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are issued in a tamper-evident manner that is respectful of the individual’s privacy. Bad players cannot make any unauthorized attempt to modify or forge digital documents without leaving evidence behind. This is something that a relying party will verify at each check.</p>
<p>In the physical world, a tamper-proof document would be sealed within multiple layers that are locked in a specific manner. If anyone attempts to open them, they cannot rearrange the layers in the original way. There is visible evidence that someone has unsealed and tampered with the document.</p>
<p>Using such a tamper-proof document, holders can present them to issuers and be verified immediately. This makes onboarding even more convenient than what centralized services offer nowadays.</p>
<p>But how do individuals make use of these credentials? We believe that the answer to that question lies within Zero Knowledge flows detailed below.</p>
 Zero Knowledge 
<p>In the current context, the concept of zero knowledge simply means that a relying party (verifier) does not need any additional information, other than the necessary minimum, to confirm whether a data owner (holder) qualifies for the service they provide or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the zero-knowledge proof method within a trust triangle, participants will benefit from secure interactions. This is because their full personal information does not need to be revealed in the majority of interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s revisit our previous example but with ZK in mind:</p>
 
 Holder A wishes to access Verifier B’s services, which are age-restricted. 
 B needs to verify with Issuer C whether A qualifies for said services.&nbsp; 
 C will confirm whether A is of age or not, without revealing the full date of birth, or specific age. Confirmation is expressed in the form of a ZK proof. 
 B will not have access to any kind of additional information, like location, actual date of birth, full name, full address, gender, etc. Likewise, B will not be retaining any data, because there will be no information for B to memorize or share outside of the interaction with A. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>The quick progress of technology is both thrilling and anxiety-inducing. It can be challenging to adapt to these fast-paced changes. However, there will always be ways to combat the threat of being controlled by an ill-intended higher power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Identity is keeping pace with this constant technological uprising, making sure to protect its users. It aims to maintain the ideal that there’s a choice that doesn’t trap individuals in exhausting, exploitative loops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its goal is to continuously certify its users to reach their full professional and personal potential. To restore each individual’s ability to be the sole controller of their PII in their digital lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey is restlessly working towards achieving ways for users to be able to safely engage with partners in an environment that is secure and neutral. At the moment, SSID is an ideal, a work in progress. SelfKey has the potential to become the bridge that will take its users towards a much safer and empowering future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dock CEO, Nick Lambert, and COO, Elina Cadouri, joined the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) on April 18-20, 2023 in California. IIW is a community-driven event that brings together a diverse group of individuals interested in <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.dock.io">digital identity</a>. </p><p>The event has been held since 2005 and attracts a range of participants including technologists, policy makers, and entrepreneurs. Among over 300 participants, Nick and Elina met with government, company, and research representatives from organizations of all sizes.</p><p>“We enjoy participating in IIW because it’s a great way to get a sense of the key trends happening in the industry and meeting people developing the same kind of technology. It’s been wonderful to take focused time to dive deeper into great discussions including use cases and technology standards,” said Nick. </p><p>IIW is not your typical event. It is an “unconference” where the meetings and event structure is largely driven by the participants rather than the organizers to create a collaborative atmosphere. The focus is not to promote products, but more about sharing and learning.</p>COO Elina Cadouri and CEO Nick Lambert at the Internet Identity Workshop in California. Key IIW Discussions That Emerged <p>Governments’ Digital Identity Strategies</p><p>There was a discussion on the growing number of governments that are developing and implementing digital identity strategies. The trend is particularly progressing in the EU, Estonia, parts of Asia, and British Columbia (Canada). </p><p>In the European Union for example, the European Commission has been producing regulation for European Digital Identity, which aims to provide a secure and user-friendly way for EU citizens to access public and private services online. The proposal includes the development of a digital wallet that will enable users to store and manage their identity documents, such as passports and driving licenses, in a secure and convenient way.</p><p>Estonia has been a pioneer in digital identity, having implemented a national digital identity system in 2002. The system, known as ID-card, enables Estonian citizens to access a range of public and private services online, including voting, banking, and healthcare. The ID-card is widely used in Estonia and has been recognized as a model for digital identity systems around the world.</p><p>Product Market Fit</p><p>There is a growing need and demand for <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.dock.io">decentralized identity</a> and <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential technology</a> across a variety of industries including supply chain and education. Dock is continuously getting market feedback from organizations in diverse industries including travel, healthcare, and finance to offer the best possible solutions for each use case.</p><p>We are pleased to report that we are getting early traction and seeing significant interest from organizations adopting digital identity solutions. The feedback helps drive Dock’s product and development roadmap.</p><p>Impact of AI</p><p>Given the fast pace that AI is disrupting many industries and transforming the way businesses operate, the discussion of AI inevitably came up and will likely be a regular topic of discussion at future events. </p><p>Online verification is going to be a growing need as deep fakes become more and more sophisticated to the point where people can’t tell who is real on both images and video, and what information is authentic. In addition to talks about the impacts AI will have on the industry, there were discussions on how organizations can leverage AI in their operations as well.</p>Nick showing participants how Dock's solutions work.<p>Nick and Elina did a demo of the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs Web App</a>, our no-code Verifiable Credentials platform, and it was very well received. People asked questions about the tech implementation and use cases. Some people were surprised to see a no-code solution that non-technical people can conveniently use because many of the current solutions are mainly used by developers. </p><p>IIW provided a valuable opportunity for Dock to learn and participate in engaging discussions on digital identity.

<p>Network attacks, while not as common as other typical hacks, still pose a significant threat to a world of always-online business. Specifically, a network snooping attack like Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) can leverage weaknesses in web browsers to steal network communications and spoof user credentials.</p>
 What Is a Man-in-the-Browser Attack? 
<p>A man-in-the-browser attack is a threat where an attacker inserts malware into a victim’s web browser through an infected app, plugin, or extension. The primary goal of this type of attack is to intercept and change the data exchanged between the user’s browser and the websites they visit, typically for financial gain or to steal sensitive information.</p>
<p>These attacks work through the following basic steps:</p>
 
 Infection: The attacker first infects the victim’s computer with some form of malware, typically a trojan, an infected plugin, and/or a file opened by the user via a phishing attack. See the list of prominent MitB trojans below. 
 Monitoring: Once the victim’s computer is infected, the malware is installed and may remain dormant until the user accesses a targeted website (e.g., a bank). Since the malware often integrates with the browser as a plugin or an extension to avoid detection and will not trigger traditional anti-malware software; thus, the user may never know that someone is intercepting data. When the user visits a targeted website, the MitB malware becomes active and monitors the user’s interactions with the website, such as login attempts, form submissions, or transactions. It may also inject malicious code into the web pages to modify their content or behavior. 
 Data Interception: As the user enters sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data, the malware intercepts, stores, or transmits it to the attacker. It can also manipulate the data sent to the website or modify the data received from the website with no one the wiser. 
 Man-in-the-Middle: The malware communicates with the attacker’s server to send intercepted data and receive further instructions. This enables the attacker to adapt the attack as needed, meaning straightforward data interception or, in more advanced cases, spoofing bank requests to steal money from the user’s account. 
 
 Common Trojans Used in Man-in-the-Browser Attacks 
<p>Several common Trojans have been used in man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks. These Trojans are typically designed to target browsers on specific operating systems, like Windows, leveraging common weaknesses to integrate with critical system functionality.<br>
Some of the more notable Trojans include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus_(malware)">Zeus</a>: Zeus, aka Zbot is one of the most well-known and widely distributed banking Trojans. It targets Windows-based systems, is designed to steal sensitive data, and includes tools like keystroke loggers and form grabbers. Zeus is highly customizable and has been used as a base for developing other Trojans. 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpyEye">SpyEye</a>: SpyEye is another notorious banking Trojan that targets most major browsers (Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox) on Windows systems. It emerged as a competitor to Zeus and is known for its advanced features, like auto-fill credit card tools and the ability to spoof HTTPS access and grab information across FTP and POP3 protocols. 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_(malware)">Citadel</a>: Citadel is a variant of the Zeus trojan that targets password managers. It is equipped with additional features, such as the ability to record video of the victim’s screen and an advanced keylogger. 
 <a href="https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/digital-banking-fraud-how-the-gozi-malware-work">Gozi</a>: Gozi is a banking Trojan that targets Windows systems and is known for its advanced web injection techniques that extend into multiple attack vectors, including banking fraud, eCommerce fraud, ransomware, and compromising Point of Sale (POS) devices. 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpig">Torpig</a>: Torpig is a sophisticated Trojan and botnet that targets Windows-based systems and is designed to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and email account details. 
 
 How Can I Prevent MitB Attacks? 
<p>To defend against MITB attacks, users should practice good cybersecurity habits that apply to most other security concerns.</p>
<p>Preventing man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks requires a combination of good security practices and awareness. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from MITB attacks:</p>
 
 Update Your Browser and Plugins: Regularly update your web browser and plugins whenever they ask you to. It is convenient to ignore update warnings, but these patches will often fix vulnerabilities that MitB attacks take advantage of. 
 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Out-of-Band (OOB) authentication, or using two communication channels to authenticate, can mitigate MitB attacks. Use 2FA for sensitive accounts, such as online banking and email. 
 Don’t Download Attachments or Click Links: Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links in emails from unknown or suspicious sources in cases where phishing attacks could hijack your browser. In general, you should only download files from trusted sources and never install software from the web on business machines. 
 Review Browser Extensions: Regularly review the extensions and plugins installed in your web browser and remove any that are no longer needed or come from untrusted sources. 
 Adjust Browser Settings: If not necessary, disable JavaScript, Flash, or other plugins on untrusted websites, enable automatic updates, and block pop-up windows. 
 
 What Is the Difference Between Man-in-the-Browser and Man-in-the-Middle Attacks? 
<p>Both man-in-the-browser (MITB) and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are forms of “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/aitm/">adversary-in-the-middle</a>” hacks. They involve intercepting and potentially manipulating data exchanged between two parties. However, they differ in their methods, points of attack, and scope.</p>
 
 Man-in-the-Browser Attack: An MITB attack injects malicious software (malware) into a victim’s web browser. The malware typically exploits vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins to intercept and manipulate data exchanged between the browser and the websites the user visits. MITB attacks usually focus on specific websites or applications, such as online banking or e-commerce websites. The goal is typically to steal sensitive information (e.g., login credentials and financial data) or manipulate transactions. 
 Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attack: In a MitM attack, the attacker positions themselves between the victim and the server (e.g., a website, an email server, or a Wi-Fi network). The attacker intercepts and potentially modifies the data being exchanged without the knowledge of the victim or the server. MITM attacks can target various network communications, including web browsing, email, instant messaging, and file transfers. The attacker can potentially access or modify any data transmitted between the victim and the server.

				  The biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) has a reputation for bringing the identity community together for passionate discussion. At the most recent meeting, held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, AI, Governance, and use cases in the public sector took center stage. We offer you the Cliff notes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Char Howland &amp; Mike Ebert</p>
<p>The biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) holds a unique position in the identity scene as an “unconference,” meaning anyone is able to attend and lead sessions on topics that they would like to share their findings on or wish to learn more about. With a wide range of skill levels, from beginners to technical experts, it is a place for both collaborative learning and for brainstorming solutions to move identity projects toward completion. Here are our personal highlights from the unconference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government Interests</p>
<p>The US government has been taking notice of digital identity efforts and is currently working on specifications for solutions to be put into widespread use. To do this, it needs public feedback and IIW offers a prime spot to speak with people familiar with the space.</p>
<p>One session, humorously titled “What do you want to tell the government?” led to discussion as to how it should adapt to specifications that are already in place, and how it should decide on new specifications that need to be created.</p>
<p>We had an interesting conversation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on how credentials could be a part of the government’s strategy for managing critical infrastructure, from which we offer two takeaways.</p>
<p>The government is sending people who know what they are talking about and who are extremely interested in implementing these kinds of solutions.</p>
<p>The community needs to be ready to answer these questions and be able to clearly explain both the technology and use cases.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>With artificial intelligence (AI) in the news, it wasn’t a surprise to see several sessions at IIW, including one which we attended titled “How can we have digital trust in the age of ChatGPT?” The best answer is decentralized identity, but how exactly this will look is still open for discussion. Attendees were very excited about this topic and how AI will drive an even greater need for strong identity systems.</p>
<p>Indicio recently published a position paper that highlights how these two technologies can work together, and how decentralized identity will allow for greater uses of AI. You can read a more indepth look <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">here</a> (requires registration).</p>
<p>Trust as an Alignment of Expectations</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was that people trust systems differently based on their expectations of privacy online. Privacy has different meanings for everyone, including the choice of having privacy, how much control the user has, the right to be left alone, and freedom from intrusion</p>
<p>The presenters of this session found that, very often, a “privacy violation” was actually due to a misalignment of expectations. It was interesting to learn that certain trends appeared along generational lines, with older generations tending to assume that they have privacy in their internet interactions unless otherwise specified and younger generations tending to assume that their actions are public unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The takeaway was clear: When creating a system, it is important to clearly outline what is trusted, what is private, and what is not, to avoid misunderstandings and unhappy users.</p>
<p>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nist.gov">National Institute for Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) recently put out its <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which aim to “present the process and technical requirements for meeting the digital identity management assurance levels specified in each volume.”</p>
<p>This document drove many conversations, and one in particular was the need for applicant representatives and trusted referees. What this means is that in a situation where a person needs translation, can’t access a computer, or is in some sort of crisis, there needs to be some way to digitally trust or vouch for that person. It is a requirement to consider and account for the ways in which disadvantaged populations can access the technology.</p>
<p>To learn more about the most recent IIW you can watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW-Rke9m7VI">daily wrap up series</a> on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>

 Stakers can claim DF34 rewards. DF35 runs Apr 27 — May 04,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 35 is here&nbsp;(DF35).</p><p>DF35 is the 7th week of DF Main, the final phase of DF. This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN. In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF34 counting started 12:01am Apr 20, 2023 and ended 12:01am Apr 27. You can claim them at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF35 is live and will conclude on May 04,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>DF Round 35 (DF35) is the 7th week of DF Main. Details of DF Main can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards (section 2), and DF34 overview (section&nbsp;3).</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As a participant, follow these step on how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  Passive and Active Rewards are distributed on Ethereum mainnet. Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards  <p>Rewards accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF35&nbsp;Overview <p>DF35 is part of DF Main, phase 1. This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>For further details, see the “<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#c9d1">DF Reward Function Details”</a> in DF Main Appendix.</p><p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behavior. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Conclusion <p>DF34 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF35 begins Apr 27, 2023 at 12:01am UTC. It ends May 04, 2023 at 12:01am&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>DF35 is part of DF Main. For this phase of DF Main, the rewards budget is 150K OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>AUSTIN, TX, 27 April 2023 — BOTLabs GmbH, developer of KILT Protocol, today announced the Frequency blockchain will integrate KILT’s portable, censorship-resistant identity infrastructure for users of decentralized social networks. Appearing onstage at Consensus by CoinDesk, Harry Evans, CTO of Amplica Labs (the team that was the initial technical contributor to Frequency) and Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT shared their vision of how a universal social graph and digital identity innovations will deliver Web3 utility to the everyday Internet&nbsp;user.</p><p>Frequency delivers essential tooling to enable decentralized social networking at massive scale. KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs), or digital fingerprints, a core element of digital identity. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials, like a passport or driver’s license, to the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Frequency and KILT share a common mission of restoring control of personal data to the individual. Centralized social networking platforms have evolved into identity providers by offering convenient logins across multiple online services, making it difficult for users to understand which personal data was shared between the social network and third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>The advent of Web3 technologies enables people-centric social networking apps that give consumers more control over their data. The Frequency blockchain uses a lightweight “Social Identity” to make it possible for users to be discovered, connect and interact with others on a shared public social network, and a user to leverage their own network of personal connections across&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This Social Identity will be connected to KILT’s Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP), a new Web3 authentication framework users can bring the full functionality of KILT’s solution into their decentralized social experience. Users decide which elements of their identity are exposed, to which audience. With KILT the user owns and controls their data; no company or entity can shut off their access or delete their&nbsp;data.</p><p>“For decentralized social to achieve mass adoption, we need new, interoperable social primitives. This work demonstrates how projects can come together to deliver more value to users and fuel a healthier web,” said Harry Evans, CTO of Amplica&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>“Centralized online services and data-hungry social networks have been the only identity providers available to consumers — until now”, said Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH. “The integration with Frequency will accelerate consumer demand for decentralized identity providers, making KILT’s framework more critical for new verticals within the Polkadot ecosystem and&nbsp;beyond.”</p><p>Frequency and KILT are part of the Polkadot ecosystem, a network of specialized, interoperable blockchains. In a new use case for Polkadot’s innovative Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM), authentication with KILT DIDs will be enabled on Frequency via XCM between the parachains.</p><p>This work is currently in development. Once complete, KILT and Frequency will be testing integration and features on Rococo before deployment to the production parachains.</p> About Frequency <p>Frequency is a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for high-volume use cases that makes it possible for builders to deliver decentralized social applications at massive scale. Blockchains typically have volatile, high transaction costs that become prohibitively expensive at the frequency required for social networking. Frequency solves this problem with a revolutionary pricing model in which builders reserve replenishing transaction capacity at a predictable, low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Frequency is designed to support the scaling of the Social Web, an evolution of the internet in which core social networking functionality is integrated within the web itself. The <a href="https://www.dsnp.org/">Decentralized Social Networking Protocol</a> (DSNP), released by international nonprofit <a href="https://projectliberty.io/">Project Liberty</a> in 2021, is a new open source project that is designed to be a foundational element of the Social Web. By connecting to DSNP over Frequency, applications can cost-effectively deliver Web3 features to large, established user bases while tapping into the compounding network effects of the universal, shared social graph enabled by&nbsp;DSNP.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p>KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world, while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> Press Contacts: <p>For Frequency:<br>media@frequency.xyz</p><p>For KILT Protocol:<br>Christine Mohan<br>christine@kilt.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/frequency-integrates-kilt-to-enrich-identities-for-decentralized-social-network-users-1750ab762a59">Frequency Integrates KILT to Enrich Identities for Decentralized Social Network Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>27 April, Luxembourg –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artory.com/">Artory</a>, a world leader in tokenizing fine art and collectibles, has partnered with the leading tokenization platform, <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, to compliantly unlock liquidity in the traditionally illiquid art market through the market tokenization standard ERC3643.</p>
<p>Leveraging their proven track record in art tokenization, Artory plans to tokenize art investments at scale. Artory’s technology captures trusted asset due diligence information from partner institutions to generate a verified asset token with signed certification. With Artory’s fully-auditable, certified asset token, the artworks can be wrapped in digital financial product offerings, such as funds, and participate in digital markets.</p>
<p>Artory has chosen to expand their tokens with the ERC3643 standard to avoid restriction to one local trading platform and take advantage of the standard’s on-chain compliance thanks to its built-in identity system. Financial instruments tokenized with the standard are interoperable with any other trading venue, centralized or decentralized, that uses the same blockchain network.</p>
<p>Artory and Tokeny align in their visions to create an open, compliant, and transparent ecosystem for art investors through this collaboration. Artory’s proficiency in providing auditable certifications and data-driven valuation for artworks, combined with Tokeny’s ready-to-use tokenization engine for using the ERC3643 standard, provides an all-in-one solution for tokenized art investment and liquidity opportunities.</p>
<p>For centuries, art and rare collectibles have been coveted investments, typically reserved for the affluent due to high barriers to entry. Remarkably, art has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for over 20 years, with fine art values rising more than 71% in the past decade. Furthermore, the Artprice100 index shows that blue-chip art has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 since 2000.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to art’s historically low correlation with traditional markets, investing in art can potentially serve as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. However, art is a complex asset class that requires a comprehensive inspection and appraisal performed by experts before being considered for investment. With Artory’s institutional-grade art tokenization, this asset class now has become increasingly accessible. Artory’s expert certification and data-driven valuation for the underlying artwork assets, together with Tokeny’s compliant infrastructure leveraging the ERC3643 standard , now enable art professionals to seamlessly tokenize trusted physical artworks and access liquidity through the digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established in 2016 by Nanne Dekking, who has over 25 years of global expertise and influence in the art market, Artory has focused on certifying and tokenizing art and collectibles by obtaining reliable due diligence information from partner institutions like the prestigious art appraisal and advisory firm, Winston Art Group.</p>
<p>Together, Artory and Tokeny have tackled the two biggest obstacles in this industry – inaccessibility and opaque valuation – while ensuring compliance.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    Indisputable reliability of the data recorded about any piece of artwork and the expertise of the specialists recording that information is the prerequisite for unlocking liquidity in the art market and represents the core of Artory’s mission. After 7 years of working in the art tokenization market, we want to make trusted, tokenized art investments accessible across platforms, rather than in siloed private markets. ERC3643 is a game changer in achieving this goal, providing a complete interoperable ecosystem for liquidity. Tokeny provides the best solution using the standard, and we are excited to be collaborating with them to open up art investment and liquidity opportunities. Our combined expertise will bring unprecedented accessibility to the art industry.  Nanne DekkingFounder &amp; CEO of Artory       Artory has been a trailblazer in the art tokenization market since 2016, and we are thrilled to partner with them to bring even more open, compliant and interoperable innovation to this space. We are excited to see the ERC3643 standard gaining traction and its network effect beginning to show. It is an exciting time for the art market, and we are thrilled to be a part of it.  Daniel CoheurChief Commercial Officer at Tokeny

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dilip Ishara and I am from Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am an internet marketing and communications expert. I have more than 5 years of experience working within the marketing field having started my career working in a digital marketing role in 2015. I would now consider myself one of the leading community managers and digital marketing experts in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p><p>Aside from my day-to-day job, I’m also a crypto enthusiast and a lover of all things blockchain. This is something I have gotten more involved with in recent years. I have worked with several successful initial coin offering (ICO) projects since 2015 and helped them to achieve a strong stance in the market. I also provide consultancy services to ICO projects, working specifically within the area of marketing, PR, and communications.</p><p>In June 2019, I joined Ontology as a regional community manager and since then, I have been able to build a very fast-growing community that includes some of the most talented individuals across Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>As an Ontology Harbinger, my day-to-day duties include community management, translating content and resources for the Sri Lankan community, and managing events within the community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out is its high-speed network and low-cost transaction fees. We strive to offer our customers the highest levels of convenience and the lowest transaction cost on the&nbsp;market.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I think the most exciting thing about the Ontology project is how accessible the platform is for users. Whether you are completely new to crypto trading or a crypto expert, you can stake with Ontology using its user-friendly stalking mechanism.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>Becoming an Ontology harbinger back in 2020 was one of the most important moments in my career, as I was able to join a project that I am very passionate about.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to see how the Ontology ecosystem develops over the next few years. I know that the team has been working continuously on improving and advancing the project, and establishing Ontology as the leading crypto project in the market — so I am looking forward to witnessing this.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I believe that Web3 will become mainstream within the next five years, becoming even more popular than the internet. I also expect that governments across the world will launch their own cryptocurrencies in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This is something that many governments have already placed on their roadmaps.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-dilip-ishara-8b6e906cce3f">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Dilip Ishara</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What Are the FTC MFA Requirements?&nbsp;  
 In October 2021, the FTC announced that it was updating the Safeguards Rule. The Safeguards Rule took effect in 2003 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and aims to protect U.S.-based consumers from data breaches, cyberattacks and their resultant effects, such as fraud and identity theft.

 What Are the FTC MFA Requirements?&nbsp;  
<p>In October 2021, the FTC announced that it was updating the Safeguards Rule. The Safeguards Rule took effect in 2003 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and aims to protect U.S.-based consumers from data breaches, cyberattacks and their resultant effects, such as fraud and identity theft.</p> 
<p>The update was deemed necessary due to the much-changed security and threat landscape since the start of the century. One of the most significant changes is an expanded definition of a covered financial institution. Entities such as auto dealers are included if they handle financial consumer data. The updated rule also introduces critical new technology requirements, specifically it mandates <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for all covered companies, no matter their size.</p> 
 Safeguards Rule Overview  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">updated version of the rule</a> introduces several requirements for relevant firms based around them developing, implementing and maintaining an information security program. The program must contain several administrative, technical and physical safeguards that ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information.</p> 
<p>There are nine specific elements in the updated rule that respond to the new threats facing companies and customer information, including:</p> 
  
  Implementing <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for all users that have access to customer information  
  Conducting risk assessment and data inventories  
  Training staff about threats, responses and security best practices  
  Choosing appropriately skilled service providers  
  Nominating a qualified Individual from among your staff or from a service provider to implement and supervise your company’s information security program  
  Regularly monitoring and testing the effectiveness of these safeguards, such as through performing (at least) annual penetration testing  
  
 When Do the FTC MFA Requirements Take Effect?&nbsp;  
<p>The FTC has recognized the adoption of MFA <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/02/security-principles-addressing-underlying-causes-risk-complex-systems">as a critical security practice</a> as it effectively prevents a single compromised password from opening up a whole system. Though the updated Safeguards Rule was due to come into force in December 2022, parts of the regulation were delayed by six months as the FTC recognized personnel and supply chain issues made it difficult for some firms to achieve compliance. Companies subject to the Safeguard Rule have until <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/11/compliance-deadline-certain-revised-ftc-safeguards-rule-provisions-extended-june-2023">June 9, 2023 to comply</a> with the MFA provision.</p> 
 Who Does the SafeGuards Rule Apply to?  
<p>The rules around customer information protection contained in the updated Safeguards legislation apply to non-banking financial institutions. However, the FTC warns that “financial institutions” covers a broader array of companies in their usage than the common understanding of the term. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-314/section-314.2">These include</a>:</p> 
  
  auto dealers (specifically any that extend credit or lease vehicles)  
  mortgage brokers and lenders  
  payday lenders  
  collection agencies  
  any retailer that extends credit for their products  
  personal or real estate property appraisers  
  check cashers  
  tax preparation firms  
  financial advisors  
  any company that brings together buyers and sellers as a “finder”&nbsp;  
  
<p>The updated FTC MFA requirements and consumer information protection regulations thus affect a wide range of firms, making data protection and information security a major factor in their risk assessments. This means a data breach or poor security practices can result in reputational damage and can open companies to litigation and fines of up to $46,000 per day per breach occurrence.&nbsp;</p> 
 The FTC MFA Requirements: The Details  
<p>As mentioned above, the FTC has stated that MFA is critical for system security and the protection of consumer information. The implementation of the FTC MFA requirements in line with the updated Safeguards rule requires at least two authentication factors from:</p> 
  
  Knowledge factors (i.e., something you know), such as a password or the answer to a secret question  
  Possession factors (i.e., something you have), such as a device or hardware security key.  
  Inherence factors (i.e., something you are), such as a fingerprint, face or retina scan.  
  
<p>The FTC has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/02/security-principles-addressing-underlying-causes-risk-complex-systems">expanded further on its proposals</a> for the adoption of MFA, requiring companies to use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant MFA</a> for their employees. It specifically rules out multi-factor solutions that use SMS, push notifications or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one-time passwords (OTPs)</a>, explaining that "if a user can be tricked into typing in their username and password, they can be tricked into typing a code from their phone."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They also recommend that companies refrain from offering forms of MFA based on providing telephone numbers that subsequently receive messages or phone calls. As stated explicitly in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Chegg-DecisionandOrder.pdf">their case against Chegg</a>, an educational services company that exposed millions of customer records in four separate breaches, the MFA offered to all employees, contractors and affiliates “should not include telephone or SMS-based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The FTC MFA requirements also suggest that legacy authentication, such as security questions, is inherently unsafe as it gives the attacker data, and much of the data required to get past the challenge is publicly available. Therefore, companies deploying MFA are also advised not to use the data collected for the authentication system anywhere else to increase security and improve consumer trust, knowing that the MFA is not just another data collection exercise.</p> 
 Complying With the FTC MFA Requirements  
<p>The updated FTC Safeguarding rule aims to deliver better security and confidentiality for customer information and protect against threats and unauthorized access. Implementing MFA for anyone who can access customer information is a critical part of this, and, as advised by the FTC, this MFA should be phishing-resistant. This means that any factor or method which can be "phished" or circumvented through social engineering, such as passwords, OTPs or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notifications</a>, should be deprecated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Systems such as hardware security keys or those which use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric identification</a> built on secure protocols and public key infrastructure, deliver the best security and allow companies to meet the FTC MFA requirements. In particular, FIDO-based authentication is named as the gold standard for phishing-resistant MFA by the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> and other regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p> 
 Quickly Meet Compliance Deadlines

<p>Mastercard’s Serenie Gagon, Vice President, Product, Payment Solutions spoke on the Accelerating Shift to Digital Payments panel at the <a href="https://payments.nacha.org">Smarter Faster Payments 2023</a> conference in Las Vegas. </p>



<p>Gagon said security and ease are always top of mind in any type of payment, and best practice for account-based payments involves “making sure that the person who is connecting the bank account has the authority on that account.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The trick with having security and preventing fraud is you don’t want to introduce so much friction that it’s not worth it for a consumer or user to use that payment method or to use that tool. It’s about letting the good guys through, with less friction, and minimizing the challenges that they face.”</p>Serenie Gagon, Vice President, Product, Payment Solutions</blockquote>

<p>Part of our continued work at Spruce is to make it easy for developers and the broader Ethereum community to use Sign-In With Ethereum. Sign-In with Ethereum, otherwise known as SIWE or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services by signing a standard message format. It gives users the power to authenticate with their Ethereum keys in a simple workflow: </p><p><br>You may be thinking, “It’s Sign-In with Ethereum, but can it work with Layer 2 solutions and other EVM-compatible chains?”</p><p>If you are a developer, you might want to enable users of your app to:</p>  Sign-In with Polygon  Sign-In with Avalanche  Sign-In with Optimism  Sign-In with Binance Smart Chain  <p>Fortunately, Sign-In with Ethereum isn’t just for Ethereum. It does, in fact, work with L2s and other EVM-compatible chains, and it’s quite easy to set up with the existing SIWE libraries.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Layer 2</a> (L2s) scaling solutions are off-chain scaling networks built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to improve scalability and efficiency and reduce the cost of performing transactions on Ethereum. These networks leverage <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/?ref=blog.spruceid.com#mainnet">Ethereum Mainnet</a>’s security guarantee and technical advancements while affording higher transactional throughput. The L2s are built using various scaling solutions, such as rollups (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ZK-rollups</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">optimistic rollups</a>) and state channels. Some examples of L2s are Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. </p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) is the computational layer that sits on top of the hardware and node network layer for Ethereum. It executes smart contracts and computes the current state of the network, allowing developers to create a wide range of secure and programmable applications. An EVM-compatible chain is a blockchain or a network that has the ability to run and deploy the smart contract code that can be recognized by Ethereum nodes. Some examples of EVM-compatible chains are Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. EVM networks do also include the previously outlined L2s, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. </p><p>How can you use SIWE to enable users to sign in with L2s or other EVM-compatible chains?</p><p>SIWE messages have a set of required fields, one of which is “chainID.” chainID is a unique identifier assigned to each blockchain network. This identifier protects from transactions in one chain being accidentally included in another chain. </p><p>This concept was first introduced in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-155</a> as a means to prevent replay attacks. Replay attacks are exploits in which an attacker intercepts a legitimate transaction and replays it on another network, potentially exploiting a vulnerability or causing damage. There are several ways to prevent replay attacks, such as using a nonce to ensure each transaction is unique or implementing validation checks to verify the legitimacy of the signature and sender’s address. </p><p>A unique chainID assigned to each EVM-compatible chain ensures that transactions created for one chain aren’t replayed on another. </p>A dapp using the Ethereum blockchain, which has a Chain ID of 1.&nbsp;<p>The easiest way to install SIWE (for Ethereum or, as we’ll show here, for L2s or other EVM-compatible chains) into your dapp is with our SSX library. If you’re new to SSX, check out <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">our documentation</a> or our guide on setting up SSX with Next.js: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/tutorial-ssx-and-next-js/">  Tutorial: SSX and Next.js  Next.js provides developers with the right tools to create their latest projects. This guide will show you how to install Sign-In with Ethereum in your Next.js app by using SSX.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Assuming you have an SSX-enabled dapp, let’s get started.</p> Customizing Fields in the SIWE Message <p>First, you can customize fields, such as the chainID, with the <code>siweConfig</code> option.<br>SSX enables developers to configure the fields of their SIWE message using the <code>siweConfig</code> option. This option allows you to overwrite the fields found in the SIWE message: </p> <code>const signIn = async () =&gt; {
	const ssx = new SSX){
    	siweConfig: {
        	chainId: 1, // set the chainid to your preferred chain
        },
    });
};</code> <p>A dapp developer can change the chainID to any L2 or EVM-compatible chain and let users authenticate using that chain. </p><p>A list of EVM networks and their associated chainID can be found <a href="https://chainlist.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">here</a>. For example, you’d set chainID to 137 if you want to let your users Sign-In with Polygon. Here are a few other examples:</p>  Sign-In with Avalanche, set chainID to 43114  Sign-In with Optimism, set chainID to 10  Sign In with Arbitrum, set chainID to 42161  Sign-In Fantom, set chainID to 250  Sign-In with Binance Smart Chain, set chainID to 56  <p>And you’re done - it’s that simple! Your users can now authenticate with any EVM-compatible chains you want to enable. </p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.
