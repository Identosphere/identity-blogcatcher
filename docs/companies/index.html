<p>We’re betting that your customers are growing increasingly concerned about safeguarding their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> in an increasingly connected digital world. With data breaches and other privacy infringements at an <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/02/another-reason-to-use-mysudo-data-breaches-hit-record-high-in-2021/">all-time high</a>, it’s hard to escape the headlines screaming at consumers to be more proactive about their privacy. What’s more, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer polls</a> all indicate that a growing number of consumers actually want to be proactive about privacy and want brands to step up too.<br><br>Two valuable ways that your customers can guard against <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">scammers</a> are to develop safe browsing habits and use a password manager. For example, you could give your customers this common advice:</p>



 Safe browsing: navigating the digital landscape securely 







<p>a) Keep your software up to date: Regularly updating your operating system, web browser, and security software is an easy way to make sure you have the latest patches and fixes, shielding you from known vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>b) Beware of phishing attempts: Phishing emails and websites are designed to deceive you into revealing sensitive information. Stay vigilant by double-checking email senders, avoiding suspicious links, and refraining from sharing personal data on unverified websites.</p>



<p>c) Use secure connections: Make sure the websites you visit use the HTTPS protocol, particularly when you’re submitting sensitive information such as passwords or payment details. HTTPS encrypts the data transmission, making it significantly more challenging for malicious actors to intercept.</p>



<p>d) Exercise caution with downloads: Only download files or software from trusted sources. Scan files for malware before opening them, since malicious downloads can compromise your data and privacy.</p>



 Password managers: your secure vault for stronger login credentials 





<p>a) Generate strong, unique passwords: Password managers help you create complex passwords that are difficult to crack. You can generate and store unique passwords for each account, eliminating the need to remember them all.</p>



<p>b) Encrypted password storage: Password managers store your login credentials in an encrypted format, so even if the data is compromised, it remains unreadable to unauthorized people.</p>



<p>c) Convenient autofill and synchronization: With a password manager, you can conveniently autofill login forms across devices, eliminating the need to type passwords manually. Synchronization capabilities allow you to access your passwords securely from multiple devices.</p>



<p>d) Two-factor authentication (2FA) integration: Many password managers support 2FA, providing an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, such as a fingerprint scan or a unique code sent to your mobile device.</p>



<p>Protecting your data privacy requires an active and conscious effort in today’s digital landscape. By embracing safe browsing practices and using a password manager, you take significant steps towards safeguarding your personal information from cyber threats and reclaiming your online privacy.</p>



<p>This is all great advice to give your customers and we highly recommend you do. But what if we told you that you could go the extra mile and easily package a safe browser and VPN into your product mix? You’d make privacy management easier for your customers and build brand loyalty and revenue streams for your bottom line.</p>

<p>Enterprise-managed <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/identity-access-management">identity and access management (IAM)</a> enables cloud administrators to centrally configure access and security settings for the entire organization. To learn about the basics, see “<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-access-enterprises#how-enterprise-iam">How enterprise-managed IAM works</a>.”</p>



<p>The case study in this blog post shows how to easily and securely implement and manage a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/site-reliability-engineering">site reliability engineering (SRE)</a> team’s access across an enterprise.</p>



 Case study 



<p>A large banking client has a centralized site reliability engineering (SRE) team that manages operations for all resources in the organization. The client uses <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-federation-option-for-you">federation</a> to authenticate users to IBM Cloud enterprise accounts. All teams use Kubernetes and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases">IBM Cloud Databases</a> resources as part of their deployment. The SRE team needs operational access to these resources for every team in every account under the company’s IBM Cloud enterprise.</p>



<p>As the teams introduce new resources, the SRE team manages those resources, as well. Manually managing this access setup across a growing number of accounts is error-prone, time-consuming and does not meet certain audit controls since the assigned access can be updated by the child account administrators.</p>



<p>By using enterprise-managed IAM templates to define access for their SRE team and assign them to the organization’s accounts, the client’s process changed from an ongoing effort to a one-time setup activity. Now, SRE access is included in both established and newly created accounts. Additionally, this access cannot be updated by the child account administrator.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll provide step-by-step instructions on how to apply this solution in your organization.</p>



 Prerequisites 



 
 Be in the root enterprise account. 



 Make sure that the enterprise user performing this task has Template Administrator and Template Assignment Administrator roles on IAM services and at least the Viewer role on the Enterprise service. For more information, see “<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-assign-access-enterprise&amp;interface=ui#templates-roles">Assigning access for enterprise management.</a>” 



 Make sure that child accounts enable the enterprise-managed IAM setting. For more information, see “<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-enterprise-managed-opt-in">Opting in to enterprise-managed IAM for new and existing accounts</a>.” 
 



 Solution 



<p>First, create a trusted profile template for the SRE team members and add access policy templates to manage all <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a> clusters and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/databases-for-mongodb">IBM Cloud Databases for MongoDB</a> instances in the child accounts. Next, assign the trusted profile template to the account group containing the account(s) to manage. Finally, we’ll grant additional access policy templates to the SRE team by creating a new trusted profile template version with the additional access required and updating the existing assignment accounts.</p>



<p>To implement this solution, we’ll complete the following steps:</p>



 
 Create a trusted profile template. 



 Add a trust relationship. 



 Add access policy templates. 



 Review and commit the trusted profile template. 



 Assign the trusted profile template. 
 



<p>Then, we’ll update the assignment with these steps:</p>



 
 Create a new template version. 



 Add an additional access policy template. 



 Review and commit the trusted profile template. 



 Update the existing assignment to version 2. 
 



 Steps to create and assign a template 



<p>1. Go to Manage &gt; Access (IAM). In the Enterprise section, click Templates &gt; Trusted Profiles &gt; Create. Click Create to create a trusted profile template for the SRE team:</p>







<p>2. Add a trust relationship to dynamically add the SRE team to the trusted profile based on your Identity provider (IdP):</p>







<p>This will be based on the claims available by your IdP:</p>







<p>3. Go to the Access tab to create access policies:</p>







<p>Administrator role for the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service:</p>







<p>Administrator role for IBM Cloud Databases for MongoDB:</p>







<p>4. Review and commit the trusted profile and policies templates. Committing templates prevents them from being changed:</p>











<p>5. Assign the trusted profile template to the account group. By selecting the entire account group, the system will automatically assign templates to the new accounts when they are added or moved in:</p>











<p>After the assignment is complete, the members of the SRE team can log in to the accounts under the account group and have the required access to perform their duties.</p>



<p>As your teams and cloud workloads grow, you might need to enable the SRE team to manage other resources. In the following example, we are granting the SRE team access to manage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloudant">IBM Cloudant</a> in addition to their existing access.</p>



 Steps to update a template and assignment 



<p>1. First, since we need to update an assigned template, we need to create a new version of the SRE team template:</p>











<p>2. Since we want to expand the SRE team access, we’ll create a new policy template with access to Cloudant resources:</p>







<p>3. Commit the trusted profile template and policy template:</p>







<p>4. Now, we need to update the assignment from version 1 to version 2. First, switch to template version 1:</p>







<p>In the Assignments tab, update the assignment:</p>















<p>Once the assignment is complete, the SRE team will now be able to manage IBM Cloudant resources in addition to the existing IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and IBM Cloud Databases for MongoDB access.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Enterprise-managed identity and access management (IAM) is a powerful solution that simplifies and centralizes access and security configuration. In this article, we explored how this approach can be a game-changer for managing access to resources across a growing number of accounts.</p>



<p>The challenges faced by the banking client in managing access for their SRE team across multiple accounts were complex and time-consuming. However, by leveraging enterprise-managed IAM templates, they transformed an ongoing effort into a one-time setup activity. This streamlined access provisioning and enhanced security by ensuring that access control remained consistent and enforced across accounts.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In the current digital landscape, the line that differentiates identity management from robust security is fast blurring. Many traditional identity solutions, initially designed to assist small businesses in transitioning identities to the cloud, are now buckling under the challenges posed by advanced enterprise complexities. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, initially conceived to simplify cloud-based identity, serves as a case in point. Its ongoing struggles highlight the pivotal difference between companies constructed mainly for identity management and those forged for identity security from the ground up, like HYPR.</p>  
 Defining an Identity Security Company  
<p>An identity security company goes beyond managing credentials; it embodies the protection of every snippet of information, every user interaction, and every digital echo from mounting threats. Unlike traditional identity companies that prioritize convenience, an identity security company places security as its top priority. Moreover, the focal point isn't solely user authentication, but on safeguarding the entire span of digital actions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Foundational Identity Security Controls  
<p>To genuinely emphasize security in identity management it’s important to embed identity security controls into the very fabric of the organization. These include:</p> 
  
  Phishing-Resistant Authentication Everywhere: It’s paramount to implement authentication methods that are <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">resilient to phishing attacks</a>. Moreover, there should never be a fallback to weaker or more vulnerable authentication techniques.  
  Security Education Across the Entire Business: Ensure a continuous inflow of updates on emerging threats and the latest security best practices. This must apply to everyone across the company, not just people touching the product.&nbsp;  
  Make the Business Allergic to Shared Secrets: When a hacker gets a foothold in an environment, they look for shared secrets such as API keys, tokens, static credentials, and others to try to spread throughout the environment. Eliminate shared secrets wherever possible and when you do have to use them, put tight controls on who has access and how they can be used.&nbsp;  
  Routine Security Audits That Aren’t Routine: Don’t just go for the checklist approach to security audits and compliance. Understand the true intent behind the compliance, regulatory or security obligations so that you are addressing core security needs. This keeps you ahead of the curve and able to implement solutions that mesh with your business objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Make Security Your Company Culture:&nbsp; A security-first mindset starts at the top. Understand that your customers' security needs take priority and reflect this in the choices you make.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Designing a Secure Architecture  
<p>A well-designed secure architecture lays the foundation for a strong and reliable identity security solution. Critical elements include:</p> 
  
  Comprehensive Vulnerability Management: Invest time, effort and money into testing your solution from various angles to eliminate blind spots. Partner with multiple third-parties who are experts in their part of the tech stack. For us at HYPR, that means working with specialized pen testing partners on Mobile, Endpoint, Back-End, and Cloud.  
  Adherence to the Least Privilege Principle: Granting access only to essential resources ensures data integrity.  
  Uninterrupted Monitoring: A 24/7 vigil on all operations is vital to preemptively detect and counteract any potential threats.  
  
 Why Security Cannot Be an Afterthought  
<p>For companies in the identity domain, security must not be just a supplementary feature — it's their bedrock. Even a minor breach can erode trust and have <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">lasting financial implications</a>. As the nature of cyber threats intensifies, a persistent and unwavering focus on security transitions from being an option to an imperative. By prioritizing security from the beginning, identity companies like HYPR ensure robust protection at all points of the digital journey.</p> 
 Guidance for Buyers: Making Informed Choices in Identity Products  
<p>When it comes to choosing an identity product, it's essential to make informed choices. Look for companies with a demonstrated track record in prioritizing security. By taking the time to gather information and ask the right questions, buyers can ensure they make the best choice for their identity security needs.</p> 
  
  Delve Deeper Than Features: The underlying principles, commitments, and practices of a company are often more telling than a mere feature list.  
  Ask for a Threat Model: Your Identity partners should be able to walk you through a comprehensive threat model of their business. If your security and technical folks aren’t happy with it, there’s a major issue.&nbsp;  
  Demand Transparency: Reputable companies will be forthright about their security protocols and will not shy away from sharing audit outcomes.  
  Verify Compliance Credentials: It's vital to ensure the solution aligns with global benchmarks like GDPR, CCPA, and the like. Be sure to check out HYPR’s <a href="https://www.hypr.com/trust-center/security-compliance">Compliance and Certifications</a>.  
  Seek Genuine Feedback: Interactions with current clients offer a transparent window into the product’s real-world performance.  
  
<p>To wrap up, as our digital footprints grow and identities become more intertwined with our real-world selves, the distinction between simply managing and truly securing these identities becomes paramount. HYPR, with its foundational emphasis on security, ensures that the complexities of identity management are met with unwavering security measures. While no one can be perfectly secure,&nbsp; our security first approach gives even the largest and most complex businesses in the world the confidence to work with HYPR.</p>

				  Meet business demands with actionable, trustworthy data.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Whether private or public sector, B2B or B2C, our customers are excited by the power&nbsp; and value of verifiable credential technology. It’s a game-changing way to share and verify data and build seamless processes that deliver a multitude of benefits. From passwordless access to seamless account verification, mobile driver’s licenses to digital travel credentials, device monitoring to data sharing networks, verifiable credentials are driving digital transformation through the ability to trust the source and integrity of any kind of data, deter fraud, and deliver the kind of data protection demanded by regulators.</p>
<p>Healthcare companies are using verifiable credentials to develop more accurate and simple ways for patients to share health records between providers. Financial service companies are using verifiable credentials to power real-time account access verification. And governments are using verifiable credentials to deliver better access to business and public services for millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>None of this requires starting afresh or committing to months or years of complex implementation. Verifiable credential technology can be layered on top of what you already have in a matter of weeks or a few months (making it fast and cost effective to implement and use. It’s also easy and cost effective to scale up to whatever scale you need to achieve.</p>
<p>Benefits of verifiable credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are powered by cryptographic trust and digital signatures. You can prove the source of any data presented from a verifiable credential and that the data hasn’t been tampered with. It’s a brilliant, simple, and (energy) efficient use of distributed ledger technology and new protocols and standards.</p>
<p>In practical terms, this means you don’t need to directly integrate different data sources or rely on third parties to manage identity verification. Data issued by a bank can be instantly verified by a retailer with the absolute assurance that it came from the named bank and hasn’t been altered. Instantly actionable data allows you to create new ways of doing business or radically simplify any kind of business interaction or service where high-value information has to be shared and verified (think KYC or mortgage applications or drone flight paths).</p>
<p>The ability to authenticate anyone (and they you) in a secure digital interaction deters fraud and phishing and makes the continuous verification needed for zero-trust security implementations a breeze.</p>
<p>So how do you get started? Indicio Proven™ is our complete product for building what we call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. It’s based on our award-winning solutions for global enterprises and has everything you need to issue, hold, present, and share verifiable credentials — including a simple way to manage governance!</p>
<p>Instead of developer teams spending months installing new IAM systems, here’s how easy it is to go from an idea to implementation in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>Deployment in 3 easy steps</p>
<p>Whether you are a large enterprise with expansive resources or a small team with just a few developers, Indicio Proven™ is designed to be easy to adopt and integrate into your existing systems.</p>
<p>1. Install the Proven™ Issuer software agent on your&nbsp; server and connect it to the data source or service of their choice via standard APIs.</p>
<p>2. Use the&nbsp; Proven™ Issuer agent software to send&nbsp; an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to the person or organization you want to send a verifiable credential to (a “holder”). The verifiable credential contains the holder’s&nbsp; data, in an encrypted format, which is stored in a secure digital wallet app under the holder’s control, usually on their mobile device.</p>
<p>3. The holder can now present the data in their credential to anyone who has the Indicio Proven™ Verifier agent software, which can also be used on a mobile device. The Verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data.</p>
<p>Indicio helps a broad range of companies and organizations — <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">including SITA</a> —to&nbsp; build verifiable credential solutions using the latest open standards and open-source protocols.</p>

  <p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Graph Activity Logs. Have you wondered what applications are doing with the access you've granted them? Have you discovered a compromised user and hoped to find out what operations they have performed? If so, you can now gain full visibility into all HTTP requests accessing your tenant’s resources through the Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Note: We're enabling&nbsp;the feature starting today. Public preview will be available in all public cloud regions within two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>You’re currently able to collect SignIn logs to analyze authentication activity and Audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in SignIn logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph Activity Logs, to ultimate resource changes in Audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Graph Activity Logs include information about the request and client application. Some common use cases include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant. 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs – such as an application enumerating all users; or making probing requests with many 403 errors.  
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions. 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications – such as extreme call volumes that exhaust rate-limits for the tenant. 
 
<p><br>To illustrate working with these logs, we can look at some basic LogAnalytics queries:<br><br>Summarize applications and principals that have made requests to change or delete groups in the past day:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| where RequestUri contains '/group'</p>
<p>| where RequestMethod != "GET"</p>
<p>| summarize UriCount=dcount(RequestUri) by AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode</p>




<p>&nbsp;<br>To see recent requests that failed due to authorization:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1h)</p>
<p>| where ResponseStatusCode == 401 or ResponseStatusCode == 403</p>
<p>| project AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode, RequestUri, RequestMethod</p>
<p>| limit 1000</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get top 20 app instances by request count:<br><br></p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs </p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)</p>
<p>| summarize RequestCount=count() by AppId, IpAddress, UserAgent</p>
<p>| sort by RequestCount</p>
<p>| limit 20</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph Activity Logs are available through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-log-monitoring-integration-options-considerations">Azure Monitor Logs integration of Entra</a>.

<p>It seems you can’t go anywhere today without <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-ai">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> creeping into the conversation. Billed by some as being as, or potentially more disruptive than the internet, AI and machine learning (ML) are laying the foundation for the next digital age, whether we’re ready or not.</p>
<p>Bankers are taking note. According to a survey from <a href="https://impact.economist.com/perspectives/financial-services/forging-new-frontiers-advanced-technologies-will-revolutionise-banking">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, 77% of bankers believe that the ability to unlock the value of AI will be the difference between winning and losing banks. And there are many obvious use cases for bankers to up their game with AI including:</p>
 
 Account inquiries – employing chatbots to provide updates on account balances, transaction history, and other account-related information 
 Credit score monitoring – AI-enabled assistance for customers to check their credit ratings and advice on how to improve them 
 Fraud prevention – training AI models to detect fraudulent patterns and behaviors 
 Customer service – deploying chatbots to provide real-time customer care by answering common questions and addressing simple issues 
 Investment guidance – real-time, personalized investment advice leveraging AI to provide targeted assistance based on consumers’ specific preferences and risk tolerance 
 
<p>But it’s not all sunshine and unicorns as they say. AI is also being adopted by cybercriminals of all shapes and sizes at an alarming rate, straining traditional cybersecurity paradigms. AI’s automation prowess is a double threat – increasing the scale of attacks, while also lowering the required skill level and resources to be able to execute attacks. And banks are seeing the impact firsthand. U.S. banks reported a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2023/banks-and-payment-firms-tap-ai-to-combat-fraud-amid-surge-in-sophisticated-financial-crime/">43% increase in fraud attacks</a> year over year, with the average cost of fraud for large financial institutions jumping by 65%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/colum-lyons-expert-comment-the-rise-of-ai-deepfakes-and-how-to-take-back-control/">Deepfakes</a> and <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/perspective/three-questions-to-ask-about-synthetic-identities">synthetic identities</a> represent two of the most nefarious challenges to banks and credit unions who are seeking to prevent fraudulent account openings and takeovers while also complying with eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) regulations. An added challenge is to apply an extra layer of security AND improve the customer experience. For account opening this starts with AI-enabled document validation and biometric identity verification using the customer’s mobile phone. This ensures the document is a valid form and instance of the credential, and that the person presenting the identity credential is the owner of that credential. Once verified, the customer provides a digital signature to accept the terms and conditions and presto! – a digital payment credential is issued securely, all in a matter of minutes!</p>
<p>Once the account is opened, AI and ML also play a critical role in helping the financial institution model and detect fraud, plus enhanced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/iam-adaptive-authentication-ds.pdf">risk-based authentication</a> with behavioral biometrics helps identify fraudulent patterns and unauthorized users early.</p>

The individual can then access, add, and curate their data, and they can manage how their data is shared with other organizations.”</blockquote><p>Yes. That’s right.

<p>You come into a gathering, and everyone is talking about verifiable credentials. What’s the first thing that comes to mind? You’ll most likely think of certifications, degrees, or anything that belongs to you that can be used to attest that you are who you say you&nbsp;are.</p><p>In the physical world, a credential can be a physical asset one can carry around in their wallet to prove their identity. Credentials can be verified by examining them or by making a call to the issuers of such credentials. For&nbsp;example</p>  A birth certificate issued by a hospital proves when and where you were born and who your parents&nbsp;are  A passport can be issued by the government of a country to prove that you’re a citizen of that&nbsp;country  A certificate issued by the university proves that you have an educational degree  <p>All of these are physical examples of credentials with a human subject, but how does this play out in the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>In the first article in this series, we looked at decentralized identity and why it matters. In this piece, we’ll be delving deeper into verifiable credentials and how they work. First, let’s take a look at some of the problems VCs are trying to&nbsp;solve.</p>  Identity fraud: Verifiable credentials provide a secure and tamper-proof way of sharing personal information, reducing the risk of identity&nbsp;fraud.  Information leakage: Sharing of user data is often done in bulk, leading to leakage of more information than necessary and loss of privacy. Through selective disclosure, verifiable credentials can be used to limit the amount of personal information that is shared while still enabling organizations to verify the information they&nbsp;need.  Data silos: Centralized systems often require individuals to share sensitive information with every organization that needs it, leading to the creation of large honeypots of user data with many organizations, increasing the risk of data breaches.  Walled gardens: Issuers of credentials can impose barriers to verification if they are involved in the verification process. Verifiable credentials are self-certifying and don’t require the involvement of the issuer when being verified.   How VCs&nbsp;work <p>There are three entities you’ll come across quite often while studying verifiable credentials:</p>  The issuer  The holder  The verifier  <p>The entity that issues the credential is known as the issuer; the holder is the subject of the credential; and the verifier is the organization that determines if the credential satisfies the requirements for a VC. Let’s take a look at each of these entities in&nbsp;detail:</p> The Issuer <p>An issuer in a verifiable credentials ecosystem is an entity that creates and issues digital credentials to holders. These issuers can be academic institutions, banks, the government, or corporate bodies.</p><p>For example, a university might be an issuer of a digital diploma to a student named John. The university would be responsible for creating the digital diploma, which would include information such as the student’s name, degree earned, and graduation date.</p><p>The university would then issue the digital diploma to the student, who would be the credential holder. The issuer must prove that they are authorized and competent to issue digital credentials by providing a form of identification and proof of identity, which can be done by providing a digital certificate or signature.</p> The Holder <p>A holder is an individual or entity that holds or possesses a digital credential, such as a diploma, a driver’s license, or a professional certification. The holder can present the credential to a verifier, such as an employer or a government agency, to prove their identity or qualifications.</p><p>John, from our previous example, is a recent graduate from a university. The university is the issuer of John’s diploma. John is the holder of his diploma, meaning he possesses it in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>The holder can also compile the data sent by one or more issuers and create a verifiable presentation.</p> The Verifier <p>A verifier is an entity that checks the authenticity of a credential issued to a holder by an issuer. It also checks for other things, like validity and competency.</p><p>In this example, when John applies for a job, the employer, who is the verifier, will ask John to present his diploma to prove that he has completed his degree. The employer uses a set of verifiable credentials protocols to check the authenticity of the credentials. This includes verifying the issuer’s signature, checking that the credential has not been tampered with, and confirming that the information in the credential matches the information that the employer has on file for&nbsp;John.</p><p>Once the employer has verified the credential, they can trust that the information in the credential is accurate and that it was issued by a trusted issuer, which allows the employer to make informed decisions about John’s qualifications for the&nbsp;job.</p> Let’s graphically look at the workflow for verifiable credentials: <p>The issuer signs an identity and sends it to the holder. The holder creates a verifiable presentation and sends it to the verifier. The verifier checks to know if the data is competent, viable, and authentic. Another possible workflow is that the verifier requests data from the holder, who reaches out to the issuer to send the&nbsp;data.</p><p>In the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem, the issuer and holder are required to use decentralized identifiers or DIDs. A decentralized identifier (DID) is a technique to identify something or oneself online without depending on a centralized entity, such as a large corporation or the government. Imagine it as the digital equivalent of your passport or license that you may use to verify your identity&nbsp;online.</p> Deconstructing a Verifiable Credential <p>A subject is typically a person, but it could also be a thing, such as hardware device type, expiration, and issuer, which are properties of the credential proof used to verify the integrity of a credential. A proof is typically expressed as a digital signature, made with the private key of the&nbsp;issuer.</p> Main problems currently experienced in the VC&nbsp;world. <p>According to Cheqd’s deep-dive survey on technical trends in decentralized identity, the top 5 blockers to the adoption of decentralized identity by enterprises</p><p>The fundamental element of SSI is receiving a set of claims and verifiable credentials in your identity wallet and then presenting them to a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>The mechanism that delivers one verifiable credential to a holder’s wallet must be able to connect with a totally separate piece of software that is receiving a verifiable credential or presentation on the end of the verifier in order for SSI to become an interoperable ecosystem.</p><p>Different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials should be compatible, making it easy for credentials to be recognized and accepted across different platforms and organizations.</p><p>However, the various systems currently do not allow for credential interoperability.</p><p>Verifiable credentials are also not as user-friendly as they should be and are difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use, as they require a certain level of technical knowledge and may involve multiple different software and hardware components.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), the W3C Credentials Community Group, and the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) are working to promote the development of open standards for self-sovereign identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials. They aim to make SSI systems more user-friendly and to promote interoperability between different SSI&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While these organizations are working to solve these problems, they still persist. The complexity of verifiable credentials and the infrastructure required to support them still make them difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and use. Additionally, interoperability issues between different systems for issuing and verifying verifiable credentials remain a problem, as do the privacy and security issues that verifiable credentials can&nbsp;pose.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veramo/how-verifiable-credentials-work-2648733abd59">How Verifiable Credentials Work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veramo">Veramo</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our world is evolving faster than ever. Technology has woven itself into our daily lives, bringing unprecedented convenience and posing new challenges. As we step into the 20th Annual Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we are at a crossroads: a world where much of the way we interact and conduct business and commerce is digital-first, and one where data, privacy, and identity are under rising threats.</p>
<p>Our ability to add trust and security into this digital-first world is the key to unlocking its many benefits to business, government, and our everyday lives.</p>
<p>A Digital World in Flux</p>
<p>This is where Cybersecurity Awareness Month takes center stage. Founded in 2004, this annual initiative has become a global call to action, illuminating the path toward a safer digital future. It’s a collaborative endeavor, uniting businesses, governments, educational institutions, and individuals in a shared mission to educate and empower.</p>
<p>This year, Cybersecurity Awareness Month introduces a new theme, “Secure Our World,” focusing on four pivotal best practices:</p>
 
 Password Manager Advocacy: Debunking myths surrounding password managers and emphasizing their benefits. 
 Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): Encouraging the adoption of multi-factor authentication for enhanced security. 
 Phishing Awareness: Equipping individuals to recognize and thwart phishing attempts, a prominent tactic of cybercriminals. 
 Update Hygiene: Promoting the importance of regular software updates and automated updates. 
 
<p>These best practices are just the start, of course, and critical for individuals seeking to improve their own security posture. We provide many of these services to customers, including <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/datasheets/zero-trust-foundations-sb.pdf">multi-factor authentication and phishing-resistant identities</a>.</p>
<p>Commitment to Cybersecurity That Enables a Digital World</p>
<p>At Entrust, securing the digital world isn’t just a mission; it’s wound into the very fibers of our DNA. We take this mission seriously because our customers take this mission seriously. We know that when we provide solutions that protect data, enable strong identities, and secure payments, we are enabling everyday moments that require a high degree of trust. They are astonishingly easy for end-users yet highly complex to implement.</p>
<p>As digital life accelerates, we‘re helping our customers solve bigger challenges, like Zero Trust frameworks and multi-cloud network security. We are enabling seamless and secure travel, and readying enterprises for post-quantum encryption. We’re also supporting banks and governments to secure and enable digital-first journeys for account opening and government services.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Entrust stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community, embracing the challenge of securing an ever-evolving digital world. While our experts contribute their insights and guidance, security and business leaders need to protect their organizations and enable their growth and scale.</p>
<p>A Collaborative Undertaking</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Awareness Month is co-managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Cybersecurity Alliance, a united effort to create a safer, more resilient cyberspace. It has garnered recognition from federal, state, and local governments, along with industry and academic leaders. This is truly a team sport. Our involvement in Cybersecurity Awareness Month reflects our mission and values, and we encourage everyone to join us on this journey. Explore the activities and resources available throughout the month at the webpages for <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity-awareness-month">CISA</a> and <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/programs/cybersecurity-awareness-month/">the National Cybersecurity Alliance</a>. Follow the conversation and share your insights using the hashtags #CybersecurityAwarenessMonth and #SecureOurWorld on social media.</p>
<p>Together, we can build a safer, more resilient digital future.</p>

 Change announcements: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning January 2024, Microsoft Entra ID will support <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpasskeys.dev%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fterms%2F%23device-bound-passkey&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BLpGtZFtGXHPKMbnR5ifT8fFFrl0nOCa3L4K87QgoQk%3D&amp;reserved=0">device-bound passkeys</a> stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user experiences to support this preview release. For your organization to opt-in to this preview, you will need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhowto-authentication-passwordless-security-key&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ac9DQ7dxszepy0kftYRCNrGS4hqqwUq46SMrAPagpgc%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys will be renamed to “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, computers, and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>

<p>Support for Authenticator Lite in the per-user MFA policy</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>

The first supported application is&nbsp;Outlook mobile. It’s a great alternative for users who can’t or aren’t willing to download another&nbsp;work&nbsp;app on their phone but already have&nbsp;Outlook set up on their mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, Authenticator Lite is only available to organizations who manage Microsoft Authenticator in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fconcept-authentication-methods-manage%23authentication-methods-policy&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xRuXa6iKsZ92fRhu2QzLGrM6vrQf1Rk2mxs%2B6J22vyI%3D&amp;reserved=0">modern authentication methods policy</a>. We're now also making it available as a part of the "Notifications through mobile app" method in the per-user MFA policy.

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations with users in the listed countries that don't want their users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp will need to disable text messages as an authentication method in their tenant(s). Depending on where they manage their authentication methods this means they need to disable "Text message to phone" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.activedirectory.windowsazure.com%2FUserManagement%2FMfaSettings.aspx&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2wENNOj7suQmnsgX%2BErw3SzyGW2dKlEjo7%2BZ7GumgTY%3D&amp;reserved=0">per-user MFA policy</a>&nbsp;and / or "SMS" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fentra.microsoft.com%2F%23view%2FMicrosoft_AAD_IAM%2FAuthenticationMethodsMenuBlade%2F~%2FAdminAuthMethods%2FfromNav%2FIdentity&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347428104%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=47wDN5b8%2FVhKNbOlUc4UEyXhEtBhR9tBKn9kWBe1gac%3D&amp;reserved=0">Authentication methods policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, please see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#make-a-group-available-for-user-self-service">documentation</a>. Note: Admins can still manage end users' ability to create Microsoft 365 and security groups using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#group-settings">group settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On December 5–6, 2023 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, hundreds of developers and software engineers will come together at <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/prestocon/">PrestoCon 2023</a> to support and learn more about Presto, the open-source SQL query engine for data analytics and the Open Data Lakehouse.</p>


<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/prestocon/">Learn more about PrestoCon 2023</a>



<p>We’re excited for the future of Presto. This year, we announced watsonx.data, our Presto-based open data lakehouse that is a fit-for-purpose data store, built on an open lakehouse architecture and supported by querying, governance and open data formats to access and share data.</p>



<p>If you’re involved in data analytics or data infrastructure, PrestoCon is a must-attend event. Here are three reasons you might consider attending:</p>



 1. You’ll get the latest innovation updates about next-gen Presto, the native C++ worker for Presto. 



<p>At PrestoCon, there’s a track dedicated to the latest advancements in the native C++ worker for Presto—code named Prestissimo—built on the open-source Velox project. There’s been a lot of work and innovation that’s gone into Prestissimo over the last few months, and leading contributors from Bytedance, IBM and Meta will be sharing that work.</p>



 2. You’ll hear more from IBM leaders and engineers on the latest advancements of both open-source Presto and watsonx.data. 



<p>At IBM we’re strong advocates of the open-source Presto project with 5 Presto committers and dozens of contributors, all of whom are working on building and executing on the project roadmap.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">Watsonx.data</a> is our data store built on an open data lakehouse architecture with Presto. We’ll share more about what we’ve been working on with Presto in watsonx.data. We’re also working closely with the Presto community on advancing open-source Presto, including Prestissimo, and look forward to presenting our work.</p>



<p>Sessions we’re excited about attending:</p>



 
 VP Hybrid Data Management <a href="https://sched.co/1T3MD">Vikram Murali’s keynote</a>, where he’ll share more about why IBM chose Presto for the watsonx.data open data lakehouse, and IBM’s key contributions to Presto open source. 



 Software Engineer and Presto Committer Aditi Pandit’s <a href="https://sched.co/1T4AR">Intro to Prestissimo</a> session, which will give the community an overview of next-gen Presto and the work going into the C++ native worker. 



 Research Scientists Berthold Reinwald and Nasrullah Sheikh will be sharing more about their <a href="https://sched.co/1T320">Presto Connector for vector search on data indexed by vector databases</a>. 



 Software Engineer Zac Blanco’s session, highlighting IBM’s work on <a href="https://sched.co/1T31c">statistics with sampling using Iceberg on Presto</a>. 
 



 3. You can get hands-on with Presto in technical workshops 



<p>If you want to get hands-on with Presto, PrestoCon workshops are a great way to do that. Created for beginners to advanced Presto users, there will be three workshops on different Presto topics. We recommend you register for these quickly, as capacity is limited and they’ll probably sell out soon (buying a pass to PrestoCon gives you free access to register for a workshop):</p>



 
 Getting Started with Presto: get Presto running locally, connect data sources, run queries (Beginner) 



 Building an Open Data Lakehouse with Presto and Apache Hudi: Put the building blocks in place to build your own Open Data Lakehouse (Beginning) 



 Getting Started with Prestissimo on Docker: For devs and engineers who are interested in getting their hands on Prestissimo (Intermediate) 
 



<p>PrestoCon 2023 is going to be a fantastic event for developers and engineers who are interested in open source and cutting-edge innovation. We’re looking forward to getting together in-person with the community for two days, sharing our work and learning more about Prestissimo.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a seasoned Presto expert or just getting started, this community conference offers an inside look into the latest innovation and community news. Early bird pricing (50 USD) concludes on October 31. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/prestocon/register/">Register today</a> and don’t miss out on the chance to be a part of PrestoCon!</p>

<p>As enterprises invest their time and money into digitally transforming their business operations, and move more of their workloads to cloud platforms, their overall systems organically become largely hybrid by design. A hybrid cloud architecture also means too many moving parts and multiple service providers, therefore posing a much bigger challenge when it comes to maintaining highly resilient hybrid cloud systems.</p>



 The business impact of system outages 



<p>Let’s look at some data points regarding system resiliency over the last few years. <a href="https://uptimeinstitute.com/about-ui/press-releases/2022-outage-analysis-finds-downtime-costs-and-consequences-worsening#:~:text=Public%20outage%20trends%20suggest%20there,27%20were%20serious%20or%20severe">Several studies</a> and <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/it-strategy/guest-article/avoiding-it-outages/">client conversations</a> reveal that major system outages over the last 4-5 years have either remained flat or have increased slightly, year over year. Over the same timeframe, the revenue impact of the same outages has gone up significantly.</p>











<p>There are several factors contributing to this increase in business impact from outages.</p>



 Increased rate of change 



<p>One of the very reasons to invest in digital transformation is to have the ability to make frequent changes to the system to meet business demand. It is also to be noted that <a href="https://www.vertiv.com/globalassets/documents/reports/2016-cost-of-data-center-outages-11-11_51190_1.pdf">60-80% of all outages</a> are usually attributed to a system change, be it functional, configuration or both. While accelerated changes are a must-have for business agility, this has also caused outages to be a lot more impactful to revenue.</p>



 New ways of working 



<p>The human element is mostly under rated when to comes to digital transformation. The skills needed with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/site-reliability-engineering">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)</a> and hybrid cloud management are quite different from a traditional system administration. Most enterprises have invested heavily in technology transformation but not so much on talent transformation. Therefore, there is a glaring lack of skills needed to keep systems highly resilient in a hybrid cloud ecosystem.</p>



 Over-loaded network and other infrastructure components 



<p>With highly distributed architecture comes the challenges of capacity management, especially network. A large portion of hybrid cloud architecture usually includes multiple public cloud providers, which means payloads traversing from on-premises to public cloud and back and forth. This can add disproportionate burden on network capacity, especially if not properly designed leading to either a complete breakdown or unhealthy responses for transactions. The impact of unreliable systems can be felt at all levels. For end users, downtime could mean slight irritation to significant inconvenience (for banking, medical services etc.). For IT Operations team, downtime is a nightmare when it comes to annual metrics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement">SLA</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective">SLO</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_to_recovery">MTTR</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective">RPO</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective">RTO</a>, etc.). Poor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for IT operations mean lower morale and higher degrees of stress, which can lead to human errors with resolutions. <a href="https://www.vertiv.com/globalassets/documents/reports/2016-cost-of-data-center-outages-11-11_51190_1.pdf">Recent studies have described</a> the average cost of IT outages to be in the range of $6000 to $15,000 per minute. Cost of outages is usually proportionate to the number of people depending on the IT systems, meaning large organization will have a much higher cost per outage impact as compared to medium or small businesses.</p>



 AI solutions for hybrid cloud system resiliency 



<p>Now let’s look at some potential mitigating solutions for outages in hybrid cloud systems. Generative AI, when combined with traditional AI and other automation techniques can be very effective in not only containing some of the outages, but also mitigating the overall impact of outages when they do occur.</p>



 Release management 



<p>As stated earlier, rapid releases are a must-have these days. One of the challenges with rapid releases is tracking the specific changes, who did them, and what impact they have on other sub-systems. Especially in large teams of 25+ developers, getting a good handle of changes through change logs is a herculean task, mostly manual and prone to error. Generative AI can help here by looking at bulk change logs and summarizing specifically what changed and who made the change, as well as connecting them to specific work items or user stories associated with the change. This capability is even more relevant when there is a need to rollback a subset of changes because of something being negatively impacted due to the release.</p>



 Toil elimination 



<p>In many enterprises, the process to take workloads from lower environments to production is very cumbersome, and usually has several manual interventions. During outages, while there are “emergency” protocols and process for rapid deployment of fixes, there are still several hoops to go through. Generative AI, along with other automation, can help greatly speed up phase gate decision-making (e.g., reviews, approvals, deployment artifacts, etc.), so deployments can go through faster, while still maintaining the quality and integrity of the deployment process.</p>



 Virtual agent assist 



<p>IT Operations personnel, SREs and other roles can greatly benefit by engaging with virtual agent assist, usually powered by generative AI, to get answers for commonly occurring incidents, historical issue resolution and summarization of knowledge management systems. This often means issues can be resolved faster. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier?gclid=CjwKCAjwp8OpBhAFEiwAG7NaEi0yeywHIJqrUOzP526Uged7Q_VqT0_O_2koX6Wckztufn98pLgzFRoCvtsQAvD_BwE#business-value">Empirical evidence</a> suggests a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-tools-productivity-gains/#:~:text=Summary%3A%20Using%20generative%20AI%20(like,the%20most%20from%20AI%20use">30-40% productivity gain</a> by using generative AI powered virtual agent assist for operations related tasks.</p>



 AIOps 



<p>As an extension to the virtual agent assist concept, generative AI infused AIOps can help with better MTTRs by creating executable runbooks for faster issue resolution. By leveraging historical incidents and resolutions and looking at current health of infrastructure and applications (apps), generative AI can also help prescriptively inform SREs of any potential issues that may be brewing. In essence, generative AI can take operations from being reactive to predictive and get ahead of incidents.</p>



 Challenges with generative AI implementation 



<p>While there are strong use cases for implementing generative AI to improve IT Operations, it would be remiss if some of the challenges weren’t discussed. It is not always easy to figure out what <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/open-source-large-language-models-benefits-risks-and-types/">Large Language Model (LLM)</a> would be the most appropriate for the specific use case being solved. This area is still evolving rapidly, with newer LLMs becoming available almost daily.</p>



<p>Data lineage is another issue with LLMs. There needs to be total transparency on how models were trained so there can be enough trust in the decisions the model will recommend.</p>



<p>Finally, there are additional skill requirements for using generative AI for operations. SREs and other automation engineering will need to be trained on prompt engineering, parameter tuning and other generative AI concepts for them to be successful.</p>



 Next steps for generative AI and hybrid cloud systems 



<p>In conclusion, generative AI can bring in significant productivity gains when augmented with traditional AI and automation for many of the IT Operations tasks. This will help hybrid cloud systems to be more resilient and, in due course, help mitigate outages that are impacting business operations.</p>

<p>In a recent survey conducted by Entrust across 10+ countries, banks, payment companies, and credit unions overwhelmingly reported that flat card technology has accelerated and shifted into overdrive. What may have been originally considered as an “unimpressive” change to the look of traditional embossing, flat cards have evolved into a financial issuance mainstay with astonishing designs and an elegant chic finish. Here we will explore the magnitude of this shift, input drivers, outputs, and future indicators.</p>
<p>Flat Card Adopters</p>
<p>Most interestingly, the survey highlights an astonishing 77% of surveyed financial institutions are actively issuing flat cards today. North America and Europe lead the way as they are typically the first global adopters of innovative technology with large banking headquarters on both continents.</p>
<p>Assuming similar technology adoption rates in this industry, we can expect a proportional upward trend and transition to flat card in the coming years. Even though embossed cards maintain some geographic and niche market presence – for example in Africa and the Middle East – the paradigm shift to flat technology has been further strengthened by significant gains in options for customization and efficiency.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Adoption Drivers</p>
<p>Equally compelling, when asked about the reason organizations choose to move to flat card, 73% of survey respondents identified two key components: enhanced branding opportunities and the modernization of traditional designs. Additionally, 60% cited either reduced cost and/or increased efficiency as the secondary driver, followed by maintaining a competitive advantage, staying relevant in the marketplace, and consumer demand.</p>
<p>When evaluating the factors influencing their decision to adopt flat card technology, respondents were almost evenly split between competitors driving the technology and marketing-driven requests in their go-to-market strategy, with competitors holding a slight edge in this regard. More specifically:</p>
 
 Among project management respondents, 36% attributed adoption to the need to stay competitive, while 26% attributed it to marketing directives. 
 Among those in payment roles, 43% indicated that adoption resulted from marketing department requests, with 30% attributing it to competitive pressure. 
 
<p>An alternative interpretation of the data reveals that internal requests, originating from marketing and operations, drove slightly over half of the adoptions, accounting for 51%, surpassing the influence of external factors such as competition (36%) and customer requests (9%). It is worth mentioning that adoption rates in this context are comparative within the nature of the survey itself and migration to innovative technologies typically includes elevated levels of consumer demand early in the product roadmap process.</p>
<p>Flat Card Technology Features</p>
<p>As financial institutions and fintechs migrate to flat card, the value proposition continues to become clearer. Customers demand fresh designs, a customizable platform, and the ability to connect with loyalty programs or niche movements like eco-friendly formats. Flat cards are delivering. Period.</p>
<p>When asked about the customizable features and benefits offered by flat cards, respondents cited the following as the most frequently utilized within their issuance arsenal:</p>
 
 Personalization on the card’s back, allowing the entire card front for financial institutions to highlight their brand 
 Vertical card orientation 
 Metallic personalization 
 Enhanced personal account number (PAN) features 
 
<p>Flat Card Technology Outputs</p>
<p>Simply, flat card drives business. Upon adoption of flat cards, 77% of respondents saw an increase in transaction volumes, including 61% of those who experienced a 1%-25% increase, and 15% realizing greater than 25% growth by volume. This is the most compelling evidence for any issuer considering the value proposition of switching to flat cards, making it nearly impossible not to draw significant conclusions about ROI and the decision to switch without delay.</p>
<p>The secondary responses in this same category paint a beautiful picture – flat cards save money. 64% saw machine efficiencies and additional cost savings, while another 40% cited third-party issuance efficiencies.</p>
<p>For anyone needing a reason to immediately evaluate the impact of flat cards on their business and, in turn, customer satisfaction, this is where the undeniable evidence is crystal clear. Banks that have adopted flat card are experiencing higher transaction volumes and lower costs. The icing on the cake? 92% highlight their enhanced capacity for personalized customization. Can it get any better than this?</p>
<p>Flat Card Future Predictors</p>
<p>Can we predict the future of flat card? Not quite. However, our survey respondents are certainly leading us down a favorable path. For those financial institutions who are not currently issuing flat cards, 56% plan to in the next two years, while 35% are exploring options to consider this newer technology.</p>
<p>A final thought on future predictors: 61% of those who have not adopted flat card have invested recently in new issuance systems. Although we do not know exactly what type of equipment or systems, this highlights the simple fact that options exist and machine lifecycles are long. We also know that certain geographies or regions continue to demonstrate some demand for traditional embossed cards – they play a significant role in perceived value and probably will continue to do so for the near future.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support the flat card movement, bridging the gap between personalization equipment, secure customer interactions, and the latest technology and innovations in high-volume central and instant financial issuance for this technology. Our portfolio of solutions including Entrust Durable Graphics, Drop on Demand, Artista Desktop, Artista VHD, and Sigma DS4 Light Curing Module continue to offer product and platform flexibility built around flat card opportunities.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">Hybrid cloud</a> has become the new normal for enterprises in nearly all industries. Many enterprises have also deployed a hybrid <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> environment that’s reliant on an ecosystem of different cloud service providers.</p>



<blockquote>
71% of executives think it’s difficult to realize the full potential of a digital transformation without having a solid hybrid cloud strategy in place. [1]
</blockquote>



<p>Managing complex business operations across a hybrid multicloud environment presents leaders with unique challenges, not least of which are cyberthreats that can bring essential business functions to a halt—potentially for days, weeks or months. A robust risk management strategy that takes full advantage of an enterprise’s hybrid multicloud environment and on-premises infrastructure can neutralize those vulnerabilities and deliver business resilience while unlocking innovation.</p>



<p>But what does such a strategy entail? There are three keys to developing a successful <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/LMNA35W8">hybrid cloud risk management strategy</a>: security, compliance and resiliency.</p>



 Security: Keeping sensitive data and workloads safe 



<p>Protecting critical data amid a heightened threat landscape is top of mind for many business leaders, and for good reason. Organizations need a strong risk management strategy to be prepared when the unthinkable happens—and it will happen. Enterprises need to have response mechanisms built into their hybrid cloud environment to get the business back to business, fast.</p>



<blockquote>
The global average cost of a single data breach is USD 4.45 million. [2]
</blockquote>



<p>Adopting a hybrid cloud approach to risk mitigation can assure an enterprise’s IT and security leaders are able to keep sensitive data and workloads safe from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks</a> that can occur anywhere, anytime. Leaders need technical assurance that private workloads, data and access keys remain in the exclusive control of authorized users at all times.</p>



 Compliance: Keeping the regulators at bay 



<p>Noncompliance is a nonstarter in regulated industries. Between 2020 and 2022, the financial services sector saw “fines in excess of 75 million US dollars in response to IT and cloud-specific failures” levied against major banks. [3] To avoid these extraordinary costs, enterprises need to build capabilities that ensure compliance with changing regulations in all the places they do business.</p>



<blockquote>
The cost of a data breach at organizations with high levels of noncompliance is 12.6% higher. [2]
</blockquote>



<p>Failure to act isn’t an option. IBM’s cloud solutions feature built-in controls and continuous compliance to address business leaders’ security and compliance concerns.</p>



 Resiliency: Keeping the business running 



<p>Keeping the business up and running must be the primary consideration of any hybrid cloud risk management strategy—building resilience into the IT environment to help ensure seamless business operations and unfettered innovation. Leaders must ensure their hybrid cloud risk strategy encompasses the tools needed to quickly respond to disruptions and fully recover all data that’s been compromised.</p>



 Learn more 



<p>IBM offers several storage and recovery products that enhance an enterprise’s ability to bounce back from disruptions to keep business running for their clients. And they do so at scale across hybrid cloud and on-premises infrastructure.</p>



<p>Every hour IT teams spend recovering critical data is time not spent developing new products and solutions. Done right, a robust hybrid cloud risk management strategy can provide elevated assurances around security, compliance and resilience while fostering the continuous innovation that underpins a successful business.</p>

Additionally, there’s the microservice layer, serving each decentralized storage (currently Arweave) and future&nbsp;options.</p><p>Moving up the layers, there is the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader.js">open-source library</a> that provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for making API calls within the Ocean Uploader system. Building on this, we’ve also created a <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/uploader-ui-lib">UI component</a> that can be seamlessly integrated into your dApp, offering a range of functionalities right out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>And, to complete this puzzle, there’s the <a href="https://uploader.oceanprotocol.com/">UI</a> deployed by Ocean that you can readily&nbsp;use.</p> Connecting Data Storage with Data Monetization <p>Ocean Uploader is an evolutionary leap for all users of decentralized storage solutions as it connects data storage directly with data monetization solutions provided by Ocean Protocol. By streamlining the data storage, Ocean Uploader encourages greater adoption of decentralized storage options, as well as new business models built on top — eventually benefiting both data providers and data consumers.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has pioneered the fusion of privacy-preserving technology with decentralized application development. The Ocean Protocol toolkit has empowered numerous developers and innovators to reimagine data’s potential, ensuring that it’s both a tool for progress and a valuable asset for its contributors.</p> About Arweave <p><a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> is a permanent and decentralized web inside an open ledger.

<p>Many crypto wallets are out on the market, but they don't all have the same capabilities. They may be specific to a particular ecosystem or lack dapp functionality. But what if there were a way to expand a wallet's abilities to surpass these limitations? </p><p>The Filecoin network has only a few native wallet clients. How can we increase the adoption of the Filecoin network so developers and users can access the ecosystem while also integrating the benefits of the EVM? <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">Metamask's Snaps</a> are one way to add custom functionality to a widely used wallet.</p> Understanding Filecoin Wallet Addresses <p>First, for clarity, let's review some <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/wallet-stack/">wallet terminology</a>. Wallets can contain multiple accounts. Each account has an address. Think of it like a bank account with a checking account number. </p><p>Getting more technical, wallets have Secret Recovery Phrases. Accounts are derived from SRPs, creating private keys that control the account. Addresses are public and are tied to the transactions executed over the blockchain.</p><p>Filecoin has five types of addresses. The ones we'll focus on are F1 and F4. F1 is the Filecoin native address for transactions done solely over the Filecoin network. F4 is the FEVM address. FEVM, or the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to port any existing EVM-based smart contracts straight onto the FVM. The F4 address is a translation layer to the EVM ecosystem. &nbsp;</p><p>EVM-compatible wallets support native Ethereum addresses (Ox) and F4 addresses. But what if you want to send Filecoin from a native F1 address to an F4 or Ox address to take advantage of the FEVM ecosystem? And what if that same wallet could support native FIL transactions?</p> Introducing Filsnap <p>Filsnap is a MetaMask plugin, or <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">snap</a>, that adds support for Filecoin native accounts and functionality. MetaMask only supports the EVM ecosystem, so Fission's plugin enables users to utilize MetaMask as a Filecoin wallet.</p><p>Filecoin native wallet: Filsnap can send transactions and receive assets using F1 addresses.</p><p>F1 to F4: Say a person has a wallet supporting only Filecoin native F1 addresses. The user could send their assets to Filsnap and, from there, send assets to F4 addresses. The same goes for exchanges like Coinbase, which doesn't support F4 addresses yet. </p><p>F4 to F1: Say a user wants to withdraw yield from a liquidity pool and put it in cold storage. They can send assets from an F4 address in the Filsnap wallet to the cold wallet that supports F1 addresses via a FilForwarder smart contract. This contract translates from FEVM to native.</p> The Filsnap Library <p>Although Filecoin JS libraries were already available, we chose not to reuse them for a few reasons. First, MetaMask is constantly changing, and we wanted to ensure the code was as up-to-date as possible. Second, the existing libraries are big and weighed down by many dependencies. A lightweight wallet client is preferred for a better user experience when working with the blockchain. Third, because we take security so seriously, we had all of the cryptography dependencies in our library independently audited for peace of mind.</p><p>The new <a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/iso-repo/tree/main/packages/iso-filecoin">Filecoin JavaScript Library - ISO Filecoin</a> is the foundation for three packages - Filsnap, Filsnap Adapter, and Filsnap Adapter React. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/snap">Filsnap</a> is the snap installed in the MetaMask extension. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter">Filsnap Adapter</a> enables developers to interact with Filsnap from a dapp. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter-react">Filsnap Adapter React</a> includes React-specific hooks for dapp integration. &nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, there are few native Filecoin wallets, and the existing ones don't expose their functionality to dapps. Filsnap, however, has an API for transactions on the native layer, enabling developers to build apps with native Filecoin functionality! </p> The Filsnap Demo <p>The Filsnap demo supports Filecoin native and FEVM transactions using either Filsnap for native or Metamask for EVM. As mentioned above, it's a great way to manage your assets despite the current technical limitations in wallets and exchanges. <a href="https://filecointldr.io/article/guide-how-to-transfer-fil-from-coinbase-to-a-metamask-wallet-0x">It used to be much more complicated</a>, but now you can do it all in the Filsnap demo app.</p><p>Another benefit of using the Filsnap demo app is security through verifiability. Anyone can verify the snap installed in Metamask through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/filsnap/v/0.3.2#user-content-provenance">NPM Provenance</a> and the app code using <a href="https://bafybeihevfatvsypn35ywbloc4vrjpjpk5akhqv7yi4d7mrahzaaatcmp4.ipfs.dweb.link/">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/actions/runs/5984204522/attempts/1#summary-16235152758">GitHub</a>.</p>Release Information: https://filsnap.fission.app/<p>Every app release and git tag is published to IPFS using <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/cli/working-with-apps">Fission apps</a> and can be cloned/forked from <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap">GitHub</a> if a user wishes to self-host or verify integrity using content addressing.</p> Getting Started <p>The Filsnap package has been audited, and the <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">MetaMask Snaps are now in open beta</a>.</p><p>The Fission team, lead by Hugo Dias, implemented the audited Filsnap as part of a contract with Protocol Labs. As part of this process, Hugo also wrote and open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/iso-repo/tree/main/packages/iso-filecoin">ISO Filecoin utilities</a>, which is now the recommended way to work with native Filecoin accounts and supporting cryptography. Please get in touch if you'd like to support long term maintenance of core open source Filecoin utilities.</p><p>Try the <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap demo</a> today, and let us know what you think! We'd love to hear your feedback.

<p>Artificial intelligence platforms enable individuals to create, evaluate, implement and update <a href="https://ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> (ML) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> models in a more scalable way. AI platform tools enable knowledge workers to analyze data, formulate predictions and execute tasks with greater speed and precision than they can manually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI plays a pivotal role as a catalyst in the new era of technological advancement. <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html">PwC</a> calculates that “AI could contribute up to USD 15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined.” Of this, PwC estimates that “USD 6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity, and USD 9.1 trillion is likely to come from consumption-side effects.” When observing its potential impact within industry, <a href="https://oreil.ly/EPGBS">McKinsey Global Institute</a> estimates that in just the manufacturing sector, emerging technologies that use AI will by 2025 add as much as USD 3.7 trillion in value. AI technology is quickly proving to be a critical component of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ibm+what+is+business+intelligence&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">business intelligence</a> within organizations across industries. Major cloud infrastructure providers such as IBM, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have expanded the market by adding AI platforms to their offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI platforms offer a wide range of capabilities that can help organizations streamline operations, make data-driven decisions, deploy AI applications effectively and achieve competitive advantages. These development platforms support collaboration between data science and engineering teams, which decreases costs by reducing redundant efforts and automating routine tasks, such as data duplication or extraction. Some AI platforms also provide advanced AI capabilities, such as <a href="http://ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a> (NLP) and speech recognition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, selecting a platform can be a challenging process, as the wrong system can drive increased costs as well as potentially limit the use of other valuable tools or technologies. Apart from pricing, there are numerous other factors to consider when evaluating the best AI platforms for your business. Gaining an understanding of available AI tools and their capabilities can assist you in making informed decisions when selecting a platform that aligns with your business objectives.&nbsp;</p>



 What types of features do AI platforms offer?&nbsp; 



<p>AI platforms assist with a multitude of tasks ranging from enforcing data governance to better workload distribution to the accelerated construction of machine learning models. Since achieving success with AI usually depends on an organization’s ability to deploy models at scale quickly, it is essential to look for the right capabilities in your AI platform to support your organization’s goals. These can include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>



 MLOps capabilities     &nbsp; 



 
 Orchestration pipelines: A single unified platform allows for teams to have a common set of tools across data analytics, data science, and ML, as well as supporting an extensive range of machine learning algorithms, including <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks">neural networks</a> for complex predictive analytics. This unified experience optimizes the process of developing and deploying ML models by streamlining workflows for increased efficiency.&nbsp; 



 AutoML tools: Automated machine learning, or autoML, supports faster model creation with low-code and no-code functionality.&nbsp;

 Key benefits of an AI platform&nbsp; 



<p>AI platforms can help you harness the power of AI technology, driving a range of benefits for your business, such as increased automation, scale, security and more. These platforms enable businesses to analyze vast amounts of data, derive valuable insights and adapt swiftly to changing market dynamics, ultimately fostering innovation and a competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>



 Increased automation&nbsp; 



<p>Automation plays a pivotal role in expediting both the scale and pace of activities throughout the data lifecycle. Once teams identify a successful, repeatable process, such as consistent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-labeling">data labeling</a>, they can look for ways to automate it with machine learning. In this case, employing the AI platform’s capabilities to automate data labeling would lead to greater accuracy in predictions and enhanced usability of data variables.&nbsp;</p>



 More scalability&nbsp; 



<p>Scalability in both the training and production phases of machine learning models is vital, as constructing and training models on a local machine, such as laptop, has its limitations. This may be sufficient for smaller datasets, but data scientists will not be able to use this approach for more robust models. To scale, they will need a centralized workflow, which facilitates transparency and collaboration with fellow practitioners to align data to standards and monitor compute availability along with GPU and TPU usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Better integration&nbsp; 



<p>An&nbsp; AI platform should also offer user-friendly integrations that facilitate the use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open source software</a> and libraries. Most platforms are already compatible with popular open source frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, but for a comprehensive AI ecosystem, seek an AI platform that offers seamless and convenient access to open source platforms such as MongoDB, Redis and PostgreSQL.</p>



<p>Moreover, the best AI platforms are developed and sustained by organizations and teams deeply involved in the open source community. They contribute to research, allocate resources and offer their expertise, thereby enriching the diversity of skills and research contributions while expanding the array of innovative technologies accessible to data science and machine learning professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM was one of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/opensource/story/">earliest champions of open source</a>, backing influential communities like Linux, Apache and Eclipse, pushing for open licenses, open governance and open standards. IBM’s association with open source became even more prominent after its <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-07-09-IBM-Closes-Landmark-Acquisition-of-Red-Hat-for-34-Billion-Defines-Open-Hybrid-Cloud-Future?_gl=1*1flkngk*_ga*MTU4ODU0NDIxLjE2OTQ1Mjc1ODQ.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NTIzOTI1Ni4yNi4xLjE2OTUyMzk2MjEuMC4wLjA.">acquisition of Red Hat.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it’s crucial to consider the deployment and usage strategy for your AI platform. Will it be implemented on-premises or hosted using a cloud platform? Is it intended for internal team use or to be accessible to external customers? These factors are also important in identifying the AI platform that can be most effectively integrated to align with your business objectives.&nbsp;</p>



 Enhanced security&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Open source packages are frequently used by data scientists, application developers and data engineers, but they can pose a security risk to companies. Security controls are vital to help identify and protect against rapidly evolving threats. The best AI platforms typically have various measures in place to ensure that your data, application endpoints and identity are protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key security measures include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/network-security">Network security</a>: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/network-security">Network security</a> has three chief aims: to prevent unauthorized access to network resources, to detect and stop cyberattacks and security breaches in progress and to ensure that authorized users have secure access to the network resources they need, when they need them.&nbsp; 
 



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">Data security</a>: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">Data security</a> protects digital information from unauthorized access, corruption or theft throughout its entire lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Collaborator security: Collaborator security protects your workspaces by assigning role-based access controls to collaborators. 
 



 Improved governance&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/common/smartpapers/ai-governance-smartpaper/#ai-governance-delivers">AI governance</a> seeks to guarantee the ethical, responsible and compliant development and implementation of an organization’s AI and ML models. An AI platform with thoughtful governance capabilities allows for improved collaboration and coordination on model approvals, monitoring and compliance governance. AI governance is essential to instill trust and reliance in the data-driven decisions made by organizations using the insights from these platforms. This trust extends to meeting both internal compliance mandates and external regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lack of AI governance can lead to consequences such as inefficiency, financial penalties and significant damage to brand reputation. It can also hamper scaling of ML processes, making results harder to reproduce and risking errors due to incorrect or incomplete data.&nbsp;Penalties can be substantial, with bank operators receiving seven-figure fines for biased loan eligibility models, and potential <a href="https://gdpr.eu/fines/">GDPR fines</a> of up to 20 million euros or four percent of annual revenue.</p>



<p>Moreover, ensuring appropriate user access is an essential element of governance within an AI platform as it can prevent certain roles from inadvertently making an error that impacts the whole system. IT administrators should have the ability to allocate accounts based on job roles, monitor user activities and facilitate seamless sharing and collaboration among practitioners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seek a platform that implements robust governance practices to ensure the standardization of data, the mitigation of bias and compliance with industry regulations.&nbsp;</p>



 Technical support&nbsp; 



<p>If you require assistance with training and education, reliable bug reporting and tracking, resolving issues or responding to emergencies, it is wise to choose an AI platform capable of offering the support you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A strong user community along with support resources (e.g., forums, documentation, customer support) can also be invaluable for troubleshooting issues and sharing knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



 Best examples of AI platform use cases&nbsp; 



<p>Embracing AI is essential for organizations to stay competitive and avoid the risk of falling behind. The following use cases demonstrate how organizations have integrated AI in their respective industries.&nbsp;</p>



 Healthcare&nbsp; 



<p>AI’s strengths can help meet the myriad challenges involved in the delivery of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/W9YMLOML">healthcare</a>—challenges that are only growing.&nbsp;</p>



 Addressing challenges in radiology&nbsp; 



<p>As patient data is increasing in volume and complexity, there is also growing pressure on radiologists to be more efficient and tackle larger patient volumes. The shift to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3LVVOQDB">value-based care</a> makes reimbursements more elusive, driving organizations to look for ways to boost efficiency and productivity in order to meet their financial goals. As one would expect, these changes and growing demands have led to mounting provider frustration and burnout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With its robust image and data analysis capabilities, AI can aid radiologists in:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Image acquisition&nbsp; 



 ﻿﻿Initial reads and interpretations&nbsp; 



 ﻿﻿Study prioritization and triage&nbsp; 



 Recommendations of relevant findings from patient records in the EHR&nbsp; 



 Recommendations of relevant findings from literature or clinical guidelines&nbsp;

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Did you know that in the United States, 38% of students enter a university with transfers from other universities? This highlights how crucial credit mobility is. However, there exists significant friction in credit mobility today, as I’m sure some readers have experienced in their own lives. Credit mobility is a challenge in itself within the United States, so we can imagine the challenges when considering students transferring from different countries.</p>
<p>What’s notable about the <a href="https://tech.asu.edu/initiatives/trusted-learner-network">Trusted Learner Network (TLN)</a> is that they’ve brought together key stakeholders from higher education institutions. These institutions recognize the business case for issuing user-controlled, portable, interoperable digital credentials, such as diplomas, to facilitate credit mobility and reduce associated costs and friction. They also understand the importance of making learner data more accessible and dynamic, as opposed to the current static nature of such data.</p>
<p>To give you a feel for the discussion, here are a couple of quote from the episode that I thought to be interested and very related one to another.</p>
<p>The first,</p>
<blockquote><p>So I feel like a diploma is extremely valuable, right? It represents the sort of culmination or termination of a set program of study towards a specific subject that is designed to empower the learner with like a both broad and deep understanding of what it is that they study it. It continues to be valuable and also the strongest trust signal that we have going for us in communicating that value. When we take a step back, though, we recognize that that diploma or degree is composed of a series of other credentials that might have individual that likely do have a very high individual value. So the average undergraduate student, when they graduate, they’re going to have taken about 40 courses or about 120 credits, and each of those 40 courses represents the achievement of a set of knowledge, skills, capabilities, and we can dig down perhaps even further to that to embrace things like skills and competencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>And second,</p>
<blockquote><p>Does the diploma still have meaning? In the vision and the implementation that we’re working on, it actually is way more meaningful because it says so much more in a way that can actually be, you know, understood both&nbsp;by machines and people than, you know, what just a printed out diploma framed on my wall used to be able to communicate. </p></blockquote>
<p>By collaborating with a broader ecosystem, which includes learners and institutions beyond just higher education, such as employers, the Trusted Learner Network seeks to harness advancements in digital trust, enabling technologies, and ecosystem governance frameworks to transform the learner economy. The potential value unlocked by streamlining credit mobility and enhancing the significance of credentials like diplomas is immense. This leads us to consider other types of learner credentials that individuals might accumulate throughout their learning journey. Personally, I’ve gathered numerous ‘credentials’ post-University. How can we digitize these and present them to the rightful owner alongside more traditional credentials like diplomas?</p>
<p>Listen to this episode to learn more, and hopefully it will spark some great thoughts for you on the possible.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kate, Andrew and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Impact of freely available online information on higher education – How has the trend of easily accessible online information, such as courses and certificates, influenced the strategies of universities and higher education institutions? 
 Value of diplomas and other credentials in the modern age – With the rise of various credentials and certificates, is the traditional university diploma still as valuable? What other credentials might a learner want to accumulate? 
 Modernizing systems of records and the role of issuers – How are systems of records being modernized to make credentials more mobile and trusted? Who are the potential issuers beyond traditional universities? 
 Value of personal references and incentives for issuers – Is there value in making it easier for individuals, like professors, to provide references or credentials? How do incentives differ for various types of issuers? 
 Importance of governance in the context of digital credentials – With the growing focus on governance over technology, how is the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital credentials being ensured? 
 User experience (UX) and wallet infrastructure for digital credentials – How is the user experience being optimized for digital credential wallets? Where will learner credentials be stored, and how will they be accessed? 
 Role of verifiers in the TLN digital credential ecosystem – How are verifiers being integrated into the network, and how does their role tie into the prioritization of use cases? How will the adoption of digital credentials be spurred among verifiers?

 We sit down with our Vice President of Global Gaming to discuss the upcoming changes to the UK’s gambling sector, the need for continued industry collaboration, and how to safeguard against the undeniable growth of the unlicensed market. 



 



<p>On the surface, there appears to be little in common between the tiny Caribbean island of Curaçao, and the densely populated island of the United Kingdom, but both will be important case studies in the evolution of the online gambling market, according to Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the established <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK gambling market is undergoing a series of changes to its regulatory framework</a> to reflect the digital age, Curacao, a market known for its low barrier to entry and <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/curacao-to-overhaul-regime-with-new-regulator-higher-bar-to-entry/">little to no scrutiny from operators</a>, is also reforming its licensing regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Important endeavors that Roger believes need to be undertaken carefully or run the risk of an exodus of licensed operators and increase in the use of the illegal market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This conundrum is shared across many international jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, Sweden, Ontario, and very soon, France,” explains Roger. “An open and fair environment is no guarantee of success. If we look at Norway, for example, many of the world’s most experienced and trusted operators have pulled out, leaving players with the binary choice of using a monopolized industry, or unlicensed operators.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although a delicate task to complete, offering a regulated gambling environment is key to the sustainable growth of a jurisdiction’s gambling market, and the pivotal third pillar in propping up a safe, secure and protected player environment. A burden of responsibility that any regulator must share with the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In my opinion, it is first and foremost the operator’s responsibility to provide a safe and responsible gambling experience, because this is good for the operator’s business model. However, this must be facilitated by a reliable regulatory environment that is proactive in its fight against fraud and the illegal market. So, the regulator needs to be an ally to those licensed operators. This is how the player will become better protected.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Roger shares his insights on the likely impact of the now <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/arguments-against-affordability-checks-gambling/">mandatory financial risk checks in the UK</a>, the real reason UK operators are subjected to such high and regular fines, why most operators are looking at <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> completely wrong, and much more.</p>



 The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has started its first round of consultations. Do you agree with UKGC’s four areas of priority? Do you think there are other more pressing areas that it should have started with?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It was 2018 when the UKGC started to discuss issues around affordability, but back then it was under the umbrella topic of customer interactions, and markers of harm were not the center of focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial risk and financial vulnerability is the right topic to prioritize and the most important consultation to undertake, because affordability is the comfort zone for the player and the operator’s business. A gambling platform should be running its business with a business plan that is in line with its risk appetite, and ability to invest and be exposed to financial impact. In online casinos, there can be big losses and big payouts, so it’s important to balance the comfort zone of the operator with the comfort zone of the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, affordability is the customer playing and spending money in a way that is going to be sustainable in the long term for the business and the customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the control of marketing and advertising consultation, however, I don’t think it’s detailed enough in terms of what they are trying to achieve. For example, what ‘good’ actually looks like has not been defined. It’s still quite vague, particularly in terms of the coordination and cooperation between the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice (LCCP) </a>from the UKGC, Competition and Markets Authority regulations, Advertising Standards Authority, and The UK Code of Broadcast Advertising requirements. As there are many contradictions between the various rules, I think the first consultation should be around organizing and encouraging those different regulatory bodies to have one set of objectives, ambitions, and rules.&nbsp;</p>



 What effect do you foresee the now mandatory financial risk checks to have on the UK gambling market?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>If the mandatory financial risk checks really end up being as ‘frictionless’ as the UKGC promises, then this is an opportunity to improve the relationship between the player and the operator, because the financial risk check will allow the operator to better know his customer and better tailor their offering; the pace and velocity of the game, and amounts that are going to be offered, either through marketing or the games themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m unaware of any operator that asks players what kind of games they prefer, or whether they’re playing for the thrill or something else. Usually, they will assess this based on the choice of games made by the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, used correctly, affordability markers of harm and behavioral analysis will enable the operator to increase and improve the granularity of the relationship, or even initiate that relationship between the operator and the players. The other effect is that if it is not as frictionless as is promised, for example, credit checks are not granted to licensed operators, then the immediate effect is going to be a tremendous increase in the illegal market – what is called the black markets – and operators not licensed in the UK and not abiding by the UKGC and LCCP rules are simply going to offer their services illegally to players in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

 Responsible gambling has been a recurring theme for many years and features quite heavily in the UK gambling white paper. What does responsible gambling mean to you, and where should the burden of responsibility lie with regards to providing a safe and responsible gambling experience: with the regulator, the operator, or both?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the history of responsible gambling, the burden to play responsibly has always been on the player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The original approach was that if the player engages in problem gambling, it is because he decided to not use the tools as provided by the operator. The operator only had the responsibility to inform the players of the tools that were available to limit his activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then the industry started to evolve toward safer gambling, meaning the operator accepted its responsibility to create a proactively safe environment, where they conduct behavioral analysis to identify the variations and deviations of player behavior in activity, and proactively interact with players. This led the UKGC to devise its three-pillar strategy of Identify, Act, and Evaluate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there has been a shift from blaming players for problem gambling to accepting that not all players are necessarily aware of the amount of activity that they are engaging in, or the variations of activity they’ve displayed, and that the operator plays a very important part toward empowering player control through transparency, information sharing, interaction and action, alongside the actions of the player, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, this shift really reflects this balancing of the two comfort zones: Who is my player? What is he capable of in terms of the games we are offering? It might be a very rich person that has an extremely high-risk appetite and high affordability, but does that mean he is impervious to harm? Not necessarily. You’ll have some players that have a very low level of affordability, but occasionally they’ll want that thrill. Should we prevent them from having that thrill just because they are not rich? Those are the questions around responsible gambling, affordability and the adequation between the comfort zones. And this is where KYC becomes the compass and blueprint for an operator’s business model: to understand their players, asses the appetite of their players, where you can create fair and transparent promotions that reflect the comfort zone between the operator and player.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 With most gambling and gaming now taking place online, how important will technology, and in particular KYC and onboarding platforms, be in ensuring a safe and secure gaming experience?&nbsp; 



<p>Operators and regulators need to move away from viewing KYC as a process, or “tick box” exercise, and instead focus on the original purpose of KYC as a founding principle of running a sustainable business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem, however, is that many operators are either not currently capable or are not effectively using the data they have access to build a single image of who the player is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you ask any operator if they had a single view and a single understanding of who their customer is, very few have a reliable, accurate, single view across their whole estate. So having this information on an industry level is pointless until operators themselves can aggregate this information, which will enable them to switch from the mindset that KYC is a process, to KYC is a business driver.</p>

 In information released since the publication of both the government and UKGC’s plans, Gambling Commission CEO, Andrew Rhodes, has said that the UKGC’s plans set out changes to ensure the UK is the safest and fairest place to gamble in the world. How feasible do you think this will be in a country that received a record-breaking £44.6 million fine in 2022; a 76% increase on 2021? Why do you think UK operators consistently receive such hefty fines?&nbsp; 



<p>There may be a link between the first and second question. If the UK is handing out so many fines, it could indicate that the UK is not a place where licensed operators are operating in a safe and fair way and are therefore heavily penalized for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing many operators in the UK, however, I do not think this is the reason they receive such hefty fines, so there’s a question around what the fines say about the UK’s regulated landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do know, and what we have seen recently, is many operators withdrawing from licensed activity in the UK, which will ultimately leave just the bigger operators offering services. Will it be fair in terms of pricing and the services that players will receive? I’m far from convinced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second impact of the large and consistent fines is going to be operators applying for UK licenses with no intention of operating in the UK. Their market and customer base, whether in Asia, in Latin America, or Africa will be attracted by the prestige of the UK license. So, I think the UK gambling market will end up as an oligopoly, or filled with brands that have no intention of operating in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The illegal market will take great pleasure in catering to customers seeking a frictionless gaming experience, and I think this is extremely worrying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC should have regular discussions with the gambling industry to ensure the UK remains an attractive place for operators and investors. If most small and midsize investors in gambling companies are fleeing the UK, this is extremely worrying.</p>



 From established gambling markets like the UK to the tiny Caribbean Island of Curaçao, regulatory authorities are balancing offering competitive and flexible approaches to licensing and taxation with a safe and secure environment that discourages fraud and illegal gambling. What effect do you think Curacao’s stricter requirements have on the online gambling industry, and what lessons can be learned?&nbsp; 



<p>If we look at the specific case of Curaçao and the redesign of their regulations and implementation of stricter requirements, this will lead to increased blame of players in problem gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of its news licensing structure, Curaçao will request operators to offer better complaints management, meaning they will be responsible for effectively handling complaints by offering more ways for the player to express their discontent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, under the guise of stricter requirements and stricter responsibility, Curaçao regulations are not actually going to empower the player much more by requiring stronger action from operators, but this is a way to grant more direct responsibility for the operators, which today they do not have, so this is certainly progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the player will remain hostage to the goodwill of the operators. I think these stricter requirements have been put in place to adapt to a world where local regulators from each country are more aware of the capabilities of operators in providing a safe playing environment, and how to fulfil their role as offering better interactions with customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something we see in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Ontario because they know that players need to be protected, and they know that players are best protected when the whole environment Is cooperating, when the regulator provides a reliable framework, and when the operator is interacting in a way that balances the comfort zone of the player with the comfort zone of the business. In this way, the player is protected via regulations, in terms of requirements of fairness, of marketing, transparency, help that they can receive and obligations from the operators.</p>

<p>The landlocked country of Malawi, located in southeastern Africa, is home to rich, arable land and a subtropical climate suitable for farming. As a result, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi/overview#:~:text=Malawi%20remains%20one%20of%20the,external%20shocks%2C%20particularly%20climatic%20shocks.">over 80%</a> of the population is employed in agriculture, and their livelihood revolves around alternating rainy and dry seasons that dictate how the year’s planting, growing and harvesting will unfold. But the once predictable seasons that smallholder farmers rely on are steadily shifting due to climate change.</p>



<p>When the rainy season arrives later than expected, many Malawian farmers still follow outdated agronomy practices that may lead them to plant too early or too late. Smallholder farmers lack access to hyperlocal weather forecasting and data that can help increase their crops’ chances of success, which jeopardizes the productivity and profitability of their season. Their challenges are compounded further by inherent and unavoidable farming risks, such as pests, contamination and natural disasters.</p>



<p>But with access to advanced technology, smart farming recommendations and specialized weather forecasts, farmers can build resilient and flexible operations that can help maximize their fields’ productive potential. That’s why IBM® and global nonprofit <a href="https://www.heifer.org/">Heifer International</a> collaborated through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a> to develop OpenHarvest—a digital tool to empower Malawi’s smallholder farmers through technology and a community ecosystem.</p>



 OpenHarvest sets out to close a digital divide 



<p><a href="https://github.com/Call-for-Code/OpenHarvest">OpenHarvest</a> is an open source platform with a mobile application that expands access to visual agricultural data, delivers specialized recommendations to farmers through AI and climate modeling, and enables better farm and field management.</p>



<p>The OpenHarvest model assigns each participating farmer’s field a set of latitude-longitude points that trigger comprehensive recommendations according to local weather and crop growth stages. Additionally, it monitors soil composition data (nitrogen, phosphorous and other nutrient levels) to identify how fertilizers should be applied.</p>



<p>From the beginning, Heifer International and IBM sought to develop a low-cost tool that maximizes output. A serverless architecture was ideal to keep infrastructure costs to a minimum under a “pay-per-use” model. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/code-engine">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> allowed IBM developers to reduce time to deployment and focus on core objectives for Heifer International and the farms at the heart of the project—namely, being cost-effective, scalable and reliable.</p>



<p>Historically, Malawian farmers have relied on generalized weather information transmitted via radio to make operational decisions. Most farmers do not own smartphones, so Heifer International and IBM had to find an information-sharing method that could transmit precise crop and soil management recommendations generated by the OpenHarvest model, while remaining accessible and affordable to the end user. The solution was an SMS text message.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sustainability">IBM Consulting</a> also brought their sustainability experience to the pilot deployment of the OpenHarvest solution, joining a project ecosystem that included Heifer International’s community facilitators, volunteers from a local university in Malawi and smallholder farmers. It was crucial to support farmers not only with smart technology, but with a network of hands-on experts to help build trust and implement solutions.</p>



 Creating a profitable future 



<p>Climate change is not the only risk that smallholder farmers encounter in Malawi. Though the economy relies on agriculture, farmers have limited access to affordable credit or competitive markets. The cycle of poverty and lack of access to capital have historically pushed farmers in Malawi to purchase cheaper supplies (like recycled seed) which can result in low yields and subpar crops. For this reason, access to affordable capital can be an essential component to promote environmentally resilient practices and drive behavioral change.</p>



<p>IBM and Heifer International saw an opportunity to incentivize farmers to adopt best agricultural practices through a digital extension solution, while simultaneously facilitating connections to access finance and the formal market. Ultimately, the OpenHarvest platform is differentiated by this structure, which encourages farmers to embrace digital technology and retain new farming practices. This leads to long-term profitability and success in a changing environment and economy.</p>



 Expanding deployment for greater impact 



<p>OpenHarvest has now reached 200 users in the district of Mchinji in western Malawi. The application’s impact translates to about 1,000 direct beneficiaries, as Malawi has an average family size of about 5 people. The pilot deployment has now concluded with the sale of the year’s crops. Compared to previous years, most farmers saw increased yields, with some participants even doubling or tripling their output for the season.</p>



<p>As a next step, Heifer International plans to onboard around 300 additional farmers and expand the project into Kasungu, a district in the central region of Malawi. Looking ahead, the program is also evaluating other innovations, such as building out robust AI models and AI integrations based on a roadmap developed with IBM.</p>



<p>IBM and Heifer International are proud to help to change lives in Malawi and build sustainable farming solutions alongside farmers and their communities.</p>

  <p>Cloud computing delivers the benefits of accelerated development without the hardware costs. But the dynamic nature of cloud services and the proprietary security features offered by different cloud service providers make it challenging for customers to manage the risks and to be sure they are meeting security and compliance obligations. Most organizations need some&nbsp;form of guardrails and ways to respond to suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>Join cloud security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Uptycs as they discuss the challenges of the shared responsibility model for cloud security and compliance, examine the range of ways available for dealing with the problem, and consider the benefits of cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud-native application protection platform.</p>
<p>Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole will describe the major risks in the way organizations use cloud services. He will also explain why cloud services need dynamic rather than static controls, list the tools that aim to manage these risks, and outline what to expect from a CSPM solution.</p>
<p>Andre Rall, Director of Cloud Security at Uptycs will describe the benefits of integrating security insights, of standardizing controls and policies, of taking charge of third-party code and resources, and of removing silos by using a single platform, data model, and user interface.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cloud-security-cspm"></a>

<p>Financial institutions want secure and frictionless onboarding and authentication processes and they’re finally seeing it from <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) and verifiable credentials (VCs) technology.</p>



<p>While VCs have been a promise of identification and authentication technologies for decades, decentralization being the fabric through which VCs are established and communicated now makes the whole proposition more viable for FIs.</p>



<p>The decentralized nature of DI eliminates the need for a centralized authority to manage and control the identity certification process underlying current onboarding and authentication systems that are complex and costly for FIs, frustrating for consumers, and open to abuse.</p>



<p>In the DI ecosystem, issuing organizations conveniently and securely issue fraud-proof credentials, and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity and validity of those credentials to grant access to services. The customer accepts, stores, and selectively shares their credentials with unprecedented privacy, security and trust.</p>



<p>Early adopters in the financial services industry are using VCs as customer-controlled, open, standardized, portable, and cryptographically protected digital credentials to enable:</p>



 
 Continuous strong authentication of banking customers, whether they are accessing via web, telephone, or mobile 



 More streamlined banking functions, such as real-time loan approval because the applicant carries credentials such as KYC, credit history, employment history in their identity wallet. 
 



<p>The result is drastically reduced KYC and AML costs, vastly enhanced retail and corporate customer experience, and streamlined regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Read <a>Verifiable </a><a>Credentials</a><a> – the Killer Feature of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



 7 more use cases for VCs in banking 



<p>In addition to an FI issuing its own customers with a VC to prove they’re a customer and speed up onboarding and authentication (which some FIs are already achieving in <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">seconds</a> with the technology), DI pioneer <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/decentralized-identity-for-banks/">Evernym</a> (now Avast) lists 7 other potential use cases:</p>



 
 Enable the customer to use their credential across internal silos of the institution to reduce data lakes and allow them to provide the single view of their information. 



 Maintain a persistent, secure, and unique connection with each customer for all types of sensitive data communications (e.g. sending loan documents). 



 Leverage the credential exchange protocol to prove minimal customer data collection and maintain a verified data trail for regulatory compliance. 



 Leverage the interoperability of VCs to make the FI’s credential useful for consumers anywhere in the world (the “top of wallet” competitive advantage). 



 Leverage the open standards of DI to issue customers with an identity wallet for storing and managing their VCs, or build a wallet into an existing banking app. 



 Support customers’ need to back up and recover their VCs in a “digital safety deposit box” concept. 



 Act as “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Glossary-V2.pdf">guardian</a>” of a customer’s credentials in a similar manner to guarding paper documents or effects in real life. 
 



 <br>Build your VCs solution quickly with Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> offers the key building blocks for a VCs solution with four licensable products and more in development:</p>

<p>Identity Governance is a beacon for organizations aiming to maintain regulatory compliance, safeguard operations and boost efficiency. Let’s demystify this term: Identity Governance, tailored for organizations, refers to the systematic management of digital identities, ensuring that users have the correct access rights to resources. The impact on business security and operations is profound, offering protection against potential breaches and enhancing operational workflows.</p>
 Why Do Organizations Need Identity Governance Today? 
<p>With expanding business ventures, collaborations, and a diversified workforce, organizations are navigating an increasingly complex digital ecosystem. This complexity demands a structured approach to managing sensitive data and systems that control user access.</p>
<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide emphasize the importance of data protection, with compliance standards like <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act">SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</a> making it mandatory for businesses to protect user data. Being compliant not only safeguards user credentials and shields companies from potential penalties but also elevates their reputation.</p>
<p>Cost efficiency and operational excellence are tightly knit with effective identity governance. Organizations that master this see reduced IT costs, witness streamlined operations and operating costs, and save time and resources.</p>
 Why is Regulatory Compliance Important? 
<p>Regulatory compliance ensures companies adhere to relevant laws, policies, and regulations often designed to protect consumer rights and sensitive data. It’s not just about avoiding penalties or legal consequences; it’s also about establishing trust with your customers.</p>
<p>When an organization is compliant, it demonstrates a commitment to maintaining a high standard of operations and building confidence among stakeholders and customers. Moreover, compliance often brings about best practices that can benefit the company in the long run, from enhancing data security to ensuring organizational integrity.</p>
 Key Components of Identity Governance Suited for Organizations 
<p>While “Identity Governance” might seem vast and intricate, its effectiveness refers to core components tailored for organizations. These components serve as the pillars that uphold a robust identity governance structure.</p>
 
 Identity Lifecycle Management: Tailored to businesses’ hierarchical and functional structures, it ensures that user accounts, access, and privileges are aligned with their roles and updated as these roles change. 
 Role-based Access Control (RBAC): Rooted deeply in the essence of an organization, RBAC ensures that access to digital resources aligns with job roles. It simplifies the process of privileged access by categorizing authorized users based on their responsibilities. 
 Access Review: Regular business audits by security teams should focus on digital identities and access controls. Periodic access reviews ensure that only the necessary personnel have access to particular resources, minimizing potential security risks. 
 Policy and Risk Management: Organizations are no strangers to risks. However, with a structured approach and risk management, potential threats are identified, evaluated, and mitigated before they escalate. 
 
<p>Understanding the integral components of Identity Governance makes it equally vital to discern its advantages. When implemented correctly, these components fuse to deliver profound benefits for any organization.</p>
 How Is IGA Different from IAM? 
<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) and Identity and Access Management (IAM) are terms often used interchangeably, but crucial differences exist. While IAM focuses on ensuring that the right individuals have access to the appropriate resources at the correct times and for the right reasons, IGA goes further.</p>
<p>IGA deals with the provisioning, managing access, and de-provisioning of identities. It provides a structured framework for policies and processes related to user identity lifecycle management and management, ensuring compliance with business objectives and regulations. In essence, IAM is a subset of IGA, with IGA providing the overarching governance framework.</p>
 Direct Benefits to Organizations Implementing Identity Governance 
<p>As the famous saying in the business world: “What gets measured gets managed.” And when you measure the tangible benefits reaped from implementing identity governance, the picture becomes abundantly clear. Organizations not only safeguard themselves but also position themselves strategically for growth. Implementing Identity Governance isn’t just about ticking off a checklist; it’s about accruing tangible benefits:</p>
 
 Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to standards like GDPR becomes a smoother journey with structured identity governance, which is especially crucial for organizations operating in regions like the EU. 
 Enhanced Data Security: The numbers don’t lie. Organizations that invest in identity governance are less likely to face data breaches, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential. 
 Streamlined Onboarding and Offboarding: Gone are the days when IT teams spent hours setting up profiles for new hires or removing access for those who’ve left. Identity governance can cut down these times significantly. 
 Facilitated Audits: Compliance checks and internal audits become less hassle, thanks to clear documentation and structured access protocols. 
 
<p>While the merits of Identity Governance are undeniable, the path to its flawless execution can be paved with challenges. However, with a systematic approach, organizations can traverse this path seamlessly. Let’s delve into a systematic step-by-step guide for instituting a successful identity governance model.</p>
 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide for Organizations 
<p>Embarking on implementing Identity Governance in an organization’s security posture is akin to building a fortress brick by brick. Each step is crucial, and each phase must be tackled with precision. While the goal is a secure and efficient operational environment, the route necessitates meticulous planning.</p>
 
 Assessing Organizational Needs and Existing Infrastructure: Begin with an internal review. Identify gaps in the current system and ascertain the necessary tools and resources. 
 Setting Up a Cross-Departmental Implementation Team: Identity governance isn’t just an IT issue. Engage representatives from HR, operations, and other relevant departments. 
 Defining Access Roles in Alignment with Job Descriptions: Collaborate with HR to ensure that digital access mirrors job roles, ensuring every employee has the necessary tools and nothing more. 
 Integrating Identity Governance with Existing IT Infrastructure: Seamless integration is key. Ensure that the identity governance solutions align well with current systems, offering smooth transitions and operations. 
 Monitoring and Iterative Improvement: The job still needs to be completed post-implementation. Regularly review and refine the processes to adapt to organizational growth and change. 
 
<p>Every endeavor, no matter how meticulously planned, is full of hurdles. Identity Governance, with all its nuances, comes with its potential challenges. Recognizing these early and being equipped with solutions can make the journey smoother and more rewarding.</p>
 Best Practices Tailored for Organizations 
 
 Engaging Leadership and Stakeholders Early: A top-down approach to implementing identity governance and administration ensures that the importance of identity administration and governance is recognized at all levels. 
 Regular Training and Awareness Sessions for Employees: A system is only as strong as its weakest link. Equip employees with the knowledge to use and appreciate the identity governance structures. 
 Periodic Review of Access Roles and Permissions: Revisit and revise. As organizations evolve, so do roles and requirements. 
 Establishing a Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement: Encourage feedback. It highlights potential gaps and fosters a culture of collective responsibility. 
 
 Common Misconceptions about Identity Governance 
<p>As we delve deeper into the digital realm, Identity Governance has emerged as a cornerstone for ensuring security and efficiency within organizations. Yet, like many emerging disciplines, it’s shrouded in a mix of misunderstandings and half-truths. It’s essential to address these misconceptions to harness their potential truly.</p>
 
 Access Requests are Fundamental to Identity Verification: Contrary to the belief that access requests are mere formalities, they are pivotal in ensuring that only verified identities gain access to specific resources, thereby safeguarding against unauthorized access and potential breaches. 
 Identity Authentication Surpasses Password Management: While password management is vital, the emphasis should be on advanced identity authentication mechanisms that ensure secure and appropriate access, such as multi-factor authentication and biometric verification, which provide a more robust security posture. 
 All Access Control is Equal: It’s essential to understand that various access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control, access certifications, and access lifecycle management, serve distinct purposes and are crucial in managing different aspects of identity authentication and authorization. 
 Entitlement Management is Just ‘Jargon’: Far from being mere jargon, entitlement management is crucial in defining and controlling the rights and privileges of authenticated identities, ensuring that users have the appropriate access levels in accordance with their roles and responsibilities. 
 IGA Solutions are a ‘One Size Fits All’: It is a misconception that all identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are universally applicable. Selecting and customizing IGA solutions that align with an organization’s specific needs and identity authentication requirements is imperative for effective identity management. 
 Managing User Accounts is an IT-only Responsibility: Managing user accounts and identities should not be siloed within IT departments. Effective identity governance and authentication management require collaborative efforts across various departments, ensuring that identity verifications, access controls, and user privileges are consistently aligned with organizational roles and policies. 
 
<p>Having highlighted the overarching significance of Identity Governance, it’s time to address some widespread myths. Believing these misconceptions could set organizations off course. By clearing the fog around them, we can ensure a more informed and practical approach to managing digital identities.</p>
 Potential Challenges for Organizations and Solutions 
<p>Every transformative initiative confronts its fair share of roadblocks, and Identity Governance is no exception. However, being forewarned is forearmed. By anticipating potential setbacks, organizations can develop strategies to overcome them, ensuring a smoother path to successful implementation.</p>
 
 Navigating the Complexity of Role Definitions: While initially challenging, collaborating with department heads on-premises can simplify role management and definitions. 
 Ensuring User Compliance Without Sacrificing Efficiency: Invest in user-friendly access management solutions to verify user and access privileges and provide ample training to ensure employees are comfortable with the new systems. 
 Adapting to Evolving Regulations: Stay informed. Review global compliance requirements and standards regularly and adjust policies and manual processes accordingly. 
 Addressing Resistance and Ensuring Organizational Buy-In: Highlight the benefits and provide channels for addressing concerns.<br>
Successfully implementing and navigating the challenges of Identity Governance is still ongoing. The digital sphere is continuously evolving, and to stay ahead of the curve, organizations need to remain informed and adapt accordingly. Let’s explore how to stay updated in this ever-changing world of Identity Governance. 
 
 Is Identity Governance Necessary Regardless of Regulatory Compliance Obligations? 
<p>While every company is subject to some form of regulatory compliance, the level of scrutiny and the specific standards applicable can vary significantly depending on the industry, region, and other factors. Regardless of the perceived level of regulatory obligation, the inherent risks within the digital landscape and the advantages of streamlined operations underscore the importance of identity governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a robust identity governance framework serves to proactively mitigate internal and external threats, simplify IT operations, enhance audit readiness, and ensure that employees have precise access to the resources necessary for their roles, thereby reducing the potential for human error. As companies evolve and expand, having a structured identity governance framework in place facilitates smoother transitions and integrations, maintaining a strong security posture in an ever-changing regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Stay Updated: The Evolving World of Identity Governance 
<p>The pace of technological advancement today is unparalleled. A static approach to Identity Governance can leave organizations vulnerable in such a dynamic environment. Staying updated is not just about keeping threats at bay but also about harnessing new opportunities and innovations.</p>
 
 Staying Abreast of Regulatory Changes: Subscribe to updates from regulatory bodies and consider periodic consultations with legal teams. 
 Leveraging Industry Forums and Communities: Discuss, attend seminars, and participate in webinars. 
 Continuous Training and Skill Upgradation for Teams: Consider annual or biannual training sessions to ensure the identity security team remains at the forefront of identity governance best practices. 
 
<p>With the strategies to remain updated and proactive, organizations can truly reap the lasting benefits of Identity Governance. As we conclude our exploration, it’s evident that Identity Governance is not just a fleeting trend but a foundational pillar for an organization.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Earlier this month, HYPR announced our unified Identity Assurance solution, developed to secure the entire modern identity lifecycle. HYPR Identity Assurance brings together the strongest passwordless authentication, comprehensive risk assessment and enhanced identity verification to continuously detect, prevent, and eliminate identity-related risks. That’s a lot of words to describe a simple concept — organizations can now ensure that an individual is who they claim to be at all times.</p> 
 Identity Assurance In the Spotlight  
<p>What does this mean in practice? We had the opportunity to demonstrate at this week’s FIDO Authenticate conference. As one of the pioneers of FIDO authentication and a long time Alliance board member, the annual Authenticate conference was a natural venue to publicly show the power of Identity Assurance.</p> 
 Modern Passkey-Based Authentication  
<p>Given the setting, most folks there were well-acquainted with our leading FIDO <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless multi-factor authentication</a> solution HYPR Authenticate, the backbone of our Identity Assurance platform. Industry experts, security pundits and regulatory agencies all agree that phishing-resistant authentication is no longer optional and must underlie any comprehensive identity security strategy. HYPR Authenticate provides regulatory compliant, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">device-bound passkeys</a> and also works with synced passkeys.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
 Real-time Risk Assessment and Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Newer on the block, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> analyzes risk signals and telemetry from numerous sources, including user behavior, mobile, endpoint and browser signals, as well as changes in the overall threat landscape, and automatically takes action to prevent a breach. This includes enforcing step-up authentication or re-verification, as well as sharing risk data with SIEM, SOAR and other enterprise systems for additional protective actions.</p> 
 The Big Reveal: Enhanced Identity Verification  
<p>The undoubted star of the show, however, was our revolutionary new identity verification system, HYPR Affirm. Purpose-built to meet the unique needs of workforce employee identity verification, HYPR Affirm addresses the major identity security issues, such as help desk fraud, that have dominated <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">recent cybersecurity headlines</a>. HYPR Affirm leverages AI-powered chat, video, face recognition, liveness detection and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming employee identities without ever using a password. It goes beyond traditional point-in-time verification by utilizing AI-driven analysis to proactively and automatically prompt reverification at critical moments defined by high-impact events or times of elevated risk from new threat vectors or detection of suspicious behavior.</p> 
 More Than the Sum of Its Parts  
<p>While each HYPR solution provides critical capabilities to build a robust identity security strategy, the real magic lies in how they work together. The integrated Identity Assurance platform closes persistent identity security gaps and automates previously manual processes. It does away with disconnected, point-in-time approaches and provides dynamic and continuous identity and authentication security. It’s the industry’s only offering where risky behavior can trigger step-up authentication not only to authentication but also to enforcing automatic identity reverification.</p> 
 Why Identity Assurance, Why Now?  
<p>In this era of everywhere, always-on connectivity and generative-AI attacks, identity trust is an imperative. Yet organizations often rely on a patchwork of siloed identity systems, outdated authentication methods, manual and disjointed identity verification techniques and incomplete, reactive identity risk response.</p> 
<p>The fallout from these fragmented and insecure practices is all too evident. Deepfake imposters are driving a new style of fraud and identity-based cyber attacks are paralyzing businesses for weeks if not longer. Recent <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">HYPR research</a> shows that authentication-attributed breaches alone cost organizations an average of $2.95M per year. The issue goes beyond breaches however, affecting employee and customer satisfaction, productivity and a business’s ability to scale and evolve.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance takes a proactive approach that addresses all stages of the user journey or identity lifecycle, starting at day zero. It unites disparate identity and security systems, integrating with and scaling across them. With HYPR, organizations ensure identities can be trusted at all times, while eliminating friction points and improving user experience.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>HYPR Identity Assurance delivers the lowest friction user experience with strongest authentication, automated identity verification and behavior-based risk assessment</p> 
 A New Look to Match Our Expanded Purpose  
<p>Those of you that pay attention to such things may have noticed that HYPR unveiled a new logo along with our Identity Assurance solution. HYPR has moved from “The Passwordless Company” to “The Identity Assurance Company” and we wanted our brand to reflect this strategic shift. We feel our new bold yet approachable logo embodies strength, trust and confidence with a modern sensibility. As such, it aptly represents our comprehensive, unified and dynamic approach to identity security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s a few thoughts I recorded earlier on our expanded Identity Assurance mission:</p>

<p>It appears that Australia has killed off “digital identity”. Australia’s <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">proposed Digital ID legislation</a> is actually not about digital identity — it’s about proving you have been identified.</p>
<p>What’s the big deal? <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-goal-is-identification-not-an-identity/">Identity and identification are different things</a>. Identification is about establishing enough facts about someone in a specific context that you can deal with them; identity is bigger, more amorphous, and <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/on-sovereignty/">usually more personal</a>.</p>
<p>So I am delighted that the term “digital identity” is no longer used in the draft <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-09/Exposure%20draft%20of%20the%20Digital%20ID%20Bill%202023_0.pdf">Digital ID Bill 2023</a> (PDF) or explanatory materials. This is a significant shift in framing, and it will <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/lets-forget-about-identity/">simplify what has been a very tricky problem space</a>.</p>
<p>We can reform identification without disrupting identity. We can make identification <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">resilient against fraud</a> in the wake of data breaches, without introducing any novel new “digital identity”. The concept of digital ID is closer to mundane functional identifiers and does not affect the cherished sense of personal identity we have in the analog world.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill heralds a uniform approach in Australia to digital and data governance across open banking, open data, and digital ID.</p>
<p>We are seeing a transition from plaintext identification to device-assisted identification. Instead of presenting weak plaintext copies of ID numbers or whole ID documents, the proposed Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will enable individuals to use digital ID as a proxy for their existing verified analog IDs.</p>
<p>The previous government’s legislation was going to be called “Trusted Digital Identity”. The new draft bill drops that flowery wording. But we wonder where this leaves the existing <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/tdif">Trusted Digital Identity Framework</a> (TDIF)?</p>
<p>TDIF was based on a centralised identity exchange architecture. This is fine for the government single sign-on systems, myGov and myGovID, but this architecture is <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/collected-submissions-on-au-digital-identity-system/">a poor fit for decentralised verifiable credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Now the AGDIS anticipates a raft of Digital ID Data Standards to be developed, providing an opportunity to rethink the centralised exchange. The new Digital ID Regulator can also reconsider the state of the art in authentication and authorisation technologies.</p>
<p>We look forward to the Australian digital ID system making good use of verifiable credentials, phishing resistant mobile technology, and data signing.</p>

  <p>Hello friends,  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have received feedback from you—our customers—about the need to have user level language localization. We understand that users would like to receive notifications that have their text adapted to their local language, customs, and standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have added logic to check multiple places for language information to make the best possible choice for what language we should send an email in, and these changes are now generally available for Privileged Identity Management, Access Reviews and Entitlement Management. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new approach is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Diagram showing how the logic works</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
 The system checks the Entra user settings:&nbsp;
 
 An Entra ID user updates their language settings via myprofile.microsoft.com or via myaccount.microsoft.com. If they don't have the permissions to update, an admin updates their preferred language.&nbsp; 
 The system will then check if the Entra ID user object has a preferred language set to determine the locale to be used.&nbsp; 
 
 
 If there are no user settings, we will check whether the user has a mailbox and has a set preferred language on that mailbox. If both checks are true, the system uses the preferred language set in their mailbox settings. This will only work for users with a mailbox.&nbsp; 
 If none of the above are set, the system will fall back to the tenant's preferred language concatenated with the tenant's country letter code (fr-FR or en-US).&nbsp;
 
 If a tenant has a preferred language set and no country code, the system will use the tenant's preferred language to find the closest available locale to the one passed, from the localized templates. if fr-CA is missing, the fallback locale is fr-FR. &nbsp; 
 
 
 If they don’t have all the above, the system will default to en-us.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Figure 2: Screenshot of email in English
Figure 3: Screenshot of email in Spanish



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, when a new guest requests an access package in MyAccess, their preferred language will be stamped based on the MyAccess browser language at request time. This will enable new guests to receive email communication in a language they understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is currently only available for the features mentioned above, we will be announcing more features are enrolling to have this logic in the upcoming quarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce IBM watsonx Orders, an AI-powered voice agent for drive-thrus of quick-service restaurants. Powered by the latest technology from IBM Research, watsonx Orders is designed to help restaurant owners solve persistent labor challenges by handling almost all orders and interactions without the help of human cashiers,&nbsp;while&nbsp;delighting&nbsp;restaurant guests&nbsp;with quick service and accurate orders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watsonx Orders joins IBM’s watsonx family of AI&nbsp;Assistants that help you easily deploy and scale&nbsp;conversational&nbsp;AI&nbsp;to maximize revenue and lower costs. It’s finely tuned to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;fast food menu items,&nbsp;customization options, limited time offers and promotions.&nbsp;Integrated into&nbsp;the corporate and restaurant-level points of sale, watsonx Orders can&nbsp;tell customers what’s available—and what’s not—at that moment. And it routes final orders to the cash register and screens and printers in the kitchen.</p>



<p>Across the industry, more than 70 percent of the revenue for quick-service restaurants comes through drive-thrus. Operators consider the drive-thru the most important sales channel by far, even more so than sales inside the restaurant. What’s more, the order taker position in the drive-thru is one of the most difficult and stressful among the crew—which is why it’s also one of the most difficult positions to fill for every shift. So when restaurant owners can’t find someone to fill the order-taker position, either because of unfilled job opening or absenteeism, they face disastrous revenue drops for shifts or whole days.</p>



<p>That’s why we designed watsonx Orders to be considered a valuable crew member: accurate, polite, speedy and reliable 24/7.</p>



 How watsonx Orders works 



<p>Watsonx Orders is a combination of hardware and software&nbsp;installed&nbsp;in the&nbsp;restaurant.&nbsp;It&nbsp;understands the full menu of the restaurant chains and knows which items are available at that specific restaurant by season and time of day. It knows the nicknames of every item and how customers can customize them. And we continuously update the software to be aware of limited time offers nationwide or locally.</p>



<p>Upon guests pulling up to the outdoor menu board, watsonx Orders greets them. Customers can start the conversation by saying, “I’m picking up a mobile order,” or “I’m a rewards member.” Or then can start ordering: “I want&nbsp;a cheeseburger, chocolate shake, large fries, no&nbsp;onions.” Thanks to watsonx’s natural language processing capabilities, the agent&nbsp;asks the customer to specify the size for the shake, and knows that the “no onions” is a customization option for the cheeseburger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike&nbsp;many AI&nbsp;voice agents, watsonx Orders doesn’t convert each spoken word into text for analysis. Instead, it converts&nbsp;audio into&nbsp;phonemes—the individual sounds that make up words, such as the “ha” in “hamburger”—then&nbsp;into orders, vastly speeding up&nbsp;speech recognition. We’ve&nbsp;also used generative AI techniques to think of the hundreds of millions of ways that humans can express the thought “I’d like to order a hamburger.” We use the latest in neural net technology to block noise from freeways, airports, railroads, stereos and cars in the other lane.</p>



<p>On the backend, we connect watsonx Orders to the restaurant’s technology stack. Once we’ve gathered the order ticket, we convert it into commands that the point of sales (cash register) understands, and we send the order to the kitchen staff through displays and printers.</p>



<p>IBM makes and installs all the hardware and software itself for a smooth delivery to the restaurant owner.</p>



 The benefits of watsonx Orders 



<p>In the field, watsonx Orders is as accurate as a human order taker. But it can work every shift, every day, and every holiday. As such, the restaurant owner gains the equivalent of more than eight hours of labor every day, freeing up the crew&nbsp;to&nbsp;focus&nbsp;on delivering even better customer service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as importantly, watsonx Orders&nbsp;takes orders quickly—it speaks in a cheerful, polite voice,&nbsp;knows how to keep the conversation short, and helps the customer toward a decision without being pushy.&nbsp;Restaurant owners have told us speed of service and car counts per hour are among the most important measures of operations.&nbsp;So our team is&nbsp;constantly experimenting to&nbsp;shave split-seconds off each order without sacrificing accuracy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The system also knows how to upsell or sell additional items to customers for additional revenue with each order.</p>



<p>Should something go wrong, or if the guest insists on speaking with a human, the AI agent can gracefully hand the conversation over without any need for customers to repeat themselves.&nbsp;</p>



 Get started with watsonx Orders 



<p>IBM continues to drive innovation for watsonx Orders to achieve the highest level of&nbsp;accuracy and fast service at every restaurant. We are interested in working with the corporate offices of quick-service restaurant brands to understand their pain points and&nbsp;customize the product to meet their specific needs.</p>

   Make Music Count is a new, multidisciplinary approach to learning math that centers play—and the piano—in the student's experience.

<p>Over the past ten years, I’ve been on a journey to create an interactive, patented curriculum that combines the power of math with the joy of music. In our program <a href="https://makemusiccount.com/">Make Music Count</a>, students from elementary to high school get hands-on experience solving math equations while learning how to play the piano. Since launching, I’ve seen the need, desire and impact: Make Music Count is in over 400 schools with 60,000 registered students and 20,000+ downloads on iOS and Android devices.</p>



<p>And today, I am excited to share a new milestone: we have partnered with IBM to use their cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) tools to help personalize students’ educational journeys, empowering students to experience the real-time applications of learning.</p>







 Creating the foundational tools for student success 



<p><a href="https://makemusiccount.com/">Make Music Count</a>&nbsp;was born out of the understanding and realization that math is a foundational tool for all children’s educational success. Too often, math instruction can be a one-size fits all approach, which can end with students thinking that “math is boring.” Our multidisciplinary method builds engagement in math by centering play in the student’s learning process.</p>



<p>We designed Make Music Count to specifically help second through twelfth-grade students solve math equations. Every time a student gets a math problem right, the answer unveils a musical note. Once all questions in a given set of problems are answered, the corresponding notes are highlighted on a virtual piano, enabling students to play their answers on a virtual keyboard while the original song streams in parallel. As a result, we’ve seen students’ confidence and performance in mathematics increase all while playing—and learning—the piano.</p>



<p>And now, IBM has helped us take our platform to the next level by embedding IBM watsonx Assistant and IBM Watson Discovery into Make Music Count’s web application. With this integration, we’re able to use AI to customize lesson plans around each student’s unique needs, enabling students to ask questions and providing real-time math support for students through chat.</p>







 Seamless collaboration inside and outside the classroom 



<p>Early on, we identified that math instruction needs to include the experiences and cultures of kids in class. We saw that students were getting left behind in their math studies, in large part because they didn’t see themselves reflected in the curriculum. As we began developing Make Music Count, conversation was at the core. We found that creating opportunities for dialogue empowered students to take ownership over their own education. On average, we see an average increase of 28% in a student’s score from pre- to post-test, and our app sees 100% engagement during each student’s session, as students are self-motivated to complete each session in order to experience the song in full.</p>



<p>To help deliver on this, our team built a virtual assistant to coordinate discussions among multiple students. Now teachers within our partner school districts are given time back for productivity because students are able to navigate through our supplemental STEAM and SEL curriculum on their own at their own pace.</p>



<p>Teachers and tutors can now spend more time personalizing their lessons with students in-person, while the chat function can help get students up-and-running and ask more basic questions. The AI will learn question patterns over time, and we are excited about the insights it will compile to help us guide our curriculum in the future.</p>







 Personalizing an AI strategy that fit our business&nbsp; 



<p>I was cautious at first about what an AI investment would look like, as an AI strategy and its business execution can seem daunting, but IBM put my mind at ease and made the entire process seamless and helped educate me about how watsonx can help startups like ours. I can now see the good that AI can do for classrooms, which is an oft-overlooked aspect of technology in the classroom.</p>



<p>Our IT team needed help on the back end with data management and navigating user insights so we can keep fine-tuning our platform and resources. The IBM team helped us learn about and implement the IBM Watson Discovery platform, and it was not a huge lift. This milestone is a place where we can start and grow, and the AI tool is going to learn as we use it with our students helping our team transition from only being supplemental to a core curriculum math learning platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By co-creating with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus">IBM Ecosystem Engineering</a>, we can save capital around our customer support headcount.</p>







 Making music count for all (and for the future) 



<p>Accessibility has always been an emphasis for our Atlanta-based team. We believe that every student should feel included during instruction and welcomed to the opportunity of being successful in the classroom. Our platform continues to serve as a supplemental resource for math classes, music classes and intervention spaces, as well as enrichment for after-school programs. We look forward to continuing to scale Make Music Count with school districts across the United States, and even around the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also see exciting opportunities to scale Make Music Count into children’s hospitals, bringing both learning and fun into the hands of those who need them. IBM already has a presence with many hospital systems and can help partner with us to find new collaboration opportunities.&nbsp;Whether you prefer a laptop, phone or tablet, try out Make Music Count and make math and music fun by playing your favorite songs on the (mathematical) piano.</p>

<p>"Door brondata in te zetten realiseerden de adviseurs een tijdsbesparing van 30% tijdens de oriëntatiefase."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Bij hypotheekadvies worden vaak veel privé documenten gebruikt van een klant. Voor De Hypotheker is het van essentieel belang dat de data van klanten goed beveiligd is, én dat de klantdata actueel is. Het originele proces bevat vaak veel papierwerk. </p> 
<p>Om marktleider te blijven en hun klanten goed te kunnen bedienen wilde ze hun proces optimaliseren: de service verbeteren, versnellen en digitaliseren. Vanuit Ockto mochten we De Hypotheker assisteren in deze digitale transformatie. Pieter Dijckmeester (Manager Proposities) en Erik Coehorst &amp; Niki de Boer (beiden Propositiemanager Digital Customer Journey) vertellen over de uitdagingen die ze hadden, waarom ze voor Ockto kozen én wat de samenwerking ze tot nu toe heeft opgeleverd. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I can imagine that some of the readers might look at the title and wonder: what do these three terms even have in common? Well, I must confess that the last one I’ve made up (or should I say “invented”?) recently – and I will explain it later. But the former two are, in fact, connected in more than one way.</p>
<p>Although Generative AI has been with us for quite some time in various forms (remember deepfakes, for example?), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), the new-generation large language models, have literally taken the world by storm. After people saw what ChatGPT can do, they immediately decided they wanted these capabilities in every application, for every industry, and on every occasion. Unfortunately, after a period of initial uncontrolled hype, it became clear that most organizations simply cannot afford to let their employees post sensitive information, like intellectual property, financial records, or customer data into every online chatbot – you don’t need to be a compliance expert to understand the consequences.</p>
<p>So, while governments are working on future legislation to regulate AI usage in general, organizations are scrambling to define security and compliance policies to prevent uncontrolled leakage of their business data into generative AI systems. But how to reconcile the two completely opposite trends and make GenAI usage safe and controlled? Well, there are multiple potential approaches…</p>
<p>The most obvious one is “building your own ChatGPT” – creating, training, and operating a new isolated instance of a large language model (LLM) with all its training and operational data strongly protected. However, only large enterprises with enough skills and budgets can afford such an endeavor. Also, training a general-purpose AI model requires years of hard work and enormous amounts of data from a multitude of sources. Some of those sources, having experienced ChatGPT’s effect on their future job security, are no longer interested in collaborating with AI researchers…</p>
<p>An alternative, more savvy approach is fine-tuning an existing AI model – instead of starting from scratch, you only need to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific domain with your own, much smaller set of data. This is a much more resource-efficient way to get your own LLM, but it still requires a lot of work and skills and is much less flexible in terms of supported use cases. Of course, an even more efficient approach is to use a much leaner specialized model instead of a general-purpose one: for example, a model only trained to perform a specific subset of generative tasks.</p>
<p>What does it all have to do with databases though, and why is everyone suddenly talking about vectors? Well, it turns out that there is an innovative technique for adapting existing LLMs to your specific tasks or even your private, highly sensitive information called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Instead of teaching (sorry, fine-tuning) a model with your custom data and essentially forcing it to memorize it entirely, you just augment each request with a set of additional information that can help its reasoning. It could be a set of documents containing fresh information about recent events or simply some organization’s sensitive data.</p>
<p>RAG not only provides responses much better tailored to the user’s prompts and thus dramatically improves the efficiency of the conversation, but also ensures that the augmenting content remains private and is not shared with other parties. And here comes the twist: to implement RAG you need to be able to quickly produce a set of documents relevant for a certain prompt and to accomplish that, you need a vector database!</p>
<p>Vectors themselves are simply sequences of numbers. While we’re more used to two- or three-dimensional vectors that encode points in space, vectors used for AI applications are usually much longer – with hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Various machine learning algorithms use vectors to store mathematical representations of their inputs. Documents, images, audio files, or any other things processed by an AI model can be stored as vectors called embeddings and by calculating a distance between vectors it is possible to determine similarity between their original objects.</p>
<p>If your model is working with text documents, for example, its embeddings can be used to find the most semantically similar documents just by sorting them by distance. And this is precisely what we need to quickly determine which relevant documents to feed to an LLM when we are crafting a RAG request! And thus, vector databases – solutions that can store data in vector format and perform efficient indexing and searching on it – became a critical part of every AI strategy almost overnight…</p>
<p>Recently I attended <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloudworld/">Oracle CloudWorld</a>, the company’s flagship yearly event where it makes its most important announcements and presents the latest innovations in its products. Do I need to tell you what was the hottest topic this year? From Larry Ellison proclaiming Generative AI the most important technology ever to announcing a strategic partnership with Cohere, an enterprise AI platform vendor, to promising to integrate AI assistants into every business application – “GenAI” dominated the entire event.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, were the announcements that not just Oracle Database but MySQL Heatwave are getting native support for vectors. Of course, it is possible to use a separate specialized database for performing vector operations, but keeping all kinds of data in the same database enables not just faster performance with fewer transformations needed but ensures that sensitive data never leaves your secure perimeter.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-integrated-vector-database-augments-generative-ai-2023-09-19/">AI Vector Search</a>, it is now possible to combine multiple data models including vectors in a single SQL query without any additional effort for developers. MySQL Heatwave’s <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/ocw-mysql-heatwave-vector-store-generative-ai-2023-09-20/">Vector Store</a> goes even further by providing a complete Generative AI and machine learning stack with embeddings created, stored, and processed directly within the database.&nbsp; On top of this foundation, Oracle provides high-level developer features like generating SQL statements or even entire applications with the APEX platform using natural language prompts. But more importantly for our topic at hand, you can now have an entire stack for implementing RAG-powered business applications, while ensuring that your sensitive data is always protected with multiple layers of database security controls.</p>
<p>OK, and finally, we can talk a bit about AI agility. Again, I just basically made this term up to illustrate the problem developers of AI-powered applications are already facing, even if not many realize it yet. You might be familiar with the notion of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">cryptographic agility</a>, which concerns an organization’s ability to quickly replace outdated cryptographic primitives throughout its entire IT infrastructure, should a particular encryption or hashing method be deemed not strong enough, for example, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/quantum-computing-horizons-in-cybersecurity">against quantum algorithms</a>. This should be possible without significant downtime, application refactoring, or other business continuity issues.</p>
<p>Working with AI models and with vector data poses the same challenge. Embeddings produced by a certain ML model are completely proprietary and not compatible with any other model. When an organization wants, say, to upgrade its e-commerce recommendation engine with a more modern and sophisticated model that can produce better recommendations, it has to consider the effort of updating this vector data for its entire catalog, potentially across multiple data stores, cloud services, and third-party integrations. Exchanging data with suppliers will be challenging as well, since they can be using other even more incompatible embedding solutions.</p>
<p>Is there a simple way to address this problem? Perhaps by implementing industry-specific standards? Or by introducing additional layers of abstraction into data and application architectures? To be honest, I have no idea! But perhaps other experts have, and you have an opportunity to meet them at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution conference</a>, which takes place in less than a month in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>

  <p>On October 3, we published a blog entitled <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/harness-power-your-identity-data">Harness the Power of Your Identity Data</a>. In that post, we outlined the role that identity and access management (IAM) plays in delivering the kind of digital experiences that are key to meeting customer acquisition, engagement, and retention targets.</p>

<p>We also covered the challenge of creating the right experience with the right security to various identities with differing needs — business partners, suppliers, employees, contractors, devices, and diverse populations of customers — often engaging with separate brands or lines of business under the same corporate umbrella. And we introduced the secret to providing tailored experiences to these identities by tapping into your identity data.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll outline two specific steps you can take to reach your business goals using your identity data. There is a third step, which we will detail in the next post in this series.</p>

 Step 1: Connect and centrally manage your identity data sources 

<p>So much of the identity data needed to fuel your business growth already exists. It's out there, and you might even know where to find most of it. But the trick is to be able to pull together just the right pieces from a variety of what we call authoritative sources, at just the right time. That's why the first step to harnessing the power of your identity data is to connect to your data sources in a way that gives you a single view of all identity data. In the ForgeRock Identity Cloud, we call this Lifecycle Management, or LCM.</p>

<p>LCM gives you the power to connect to all different kinds of siloed data. This data usually resides in identity directory servers and an array of databases associated with specific applications throughout your organization. Once connected, you can create a composite, single view of your customers and all of your other managed identities. This single view can give you new insights into the same customers with different account names across brands or lines of business — and give you a new level of situational awareness that can provide critical inputs to enhance security.</p>

<p>In addition to connecting to all of your data sources, LCM empowers you to centrally manage all of your identities, which gives you the ability to pull identity data in from multiple sources and combine the data in any way you need. Then, you can provision and manage the ongoing lifecycle of your identity information with the source systems and any other downstream systems or applications.</p>

 Step 2: Enable a business-centric model 

<p>Now that you're centrally managing all of your identity data, you can start to mold it into the shape of your business. This is where things get really exciting, because you can organize your identity data around your business use cases, not the other way around.</p>

<p>With ForgeRock's relationship model, you can design how your identities are organized. Instead of trying to force-fit disparate identity data into a single, rigid hierarchy, you can now create different identity objects that are purpose-built for each identity type.</p>

<p>Think of the different types of identity attributes you'd need to manage for your employees vs. your customers vs. a set of IoT devices.</p>

<p>Like tabs in a spreadsheet, or tables in a database, you can arrange your identities in a way that makes sense for you. Let's continue with the spreadsheet analogy for a moment. Why do you create different tabs? Why not just put everything into a single sheet? Probably because it makes more sense to manage some related data in the columns of Tab A, and others in Tabs B, C, and so on. Think of each new tab as a way to distinctly manage different identity types more efficiently. And there's just one more piece of this spreadsheet analogy to bring this point home: the pivot table! But first, let's set the context by looking at an access management scenario.</p>

<p>Let's say you're a large retail enterprise with multiple brands, and at least one brand is from a recent acquisition. As the user begins the login process, your access manager makes a request to your identity manager. Based on the context, your identity manager looks at the relationships between the user and the associated brand, and returns a set of data parameters that empower you to give that user a tailored experience in accordance with the guidelines of that specific brand. Wow. That was great. But what made it possible lies in our pivot table analogy, so let's get back to it.</p>

<p>Why do you create a pivot table in a spreadsheet? Because you need a view that combines data from different tabs to serve a specific purpose. This is what happened with our brand login experience. The access manager made a request to the identity manager. And the identity manager was able to use the relationship between the user's main identity "tab" and the related brand "tab" to return the data points that the access management system needed to orchestrate a specific brand experience for that user.</p>

<p>Here's another example: maybe one of your business partners or suppliers has access to one of your systems. You require that partners use MFA as part of the authentication, but your partners cannot require their employees to use a personal mobile device as an MFA second factor, therefore they have opted to receive one-time passcodes in their email as the second factor. When your partner's user initiates a login to your system, your identity manager follows the relationship from that user's identity record to their affiliated organization (a different tab in the spreadsheet) and provides that data to the access manager, which selects a login journey that sends and validated a one-time passcode after the password has been correctly entered.</p>

<p>These are just two examples of may. Once you've enabled your business-centric identity model, you can ensure each customer of each brand, or each partner, or contractor, and so on, gets the tailored experience and security required.</p>

<p>AI has inspired millions of people around the world with ideas about what it can make possible. But this technological game changer has also provoked a lot of questions around how it will impact the world of work.</p>



<p>Change is happening, and fast. Research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/augmented-workforce?_gl=1*1xltdk2*_ga*MjgzODg2ODA2LjE2OTUxMjk3NDU.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5NTIxNjkxOS41LjEuMTY5NTIxODU5MS4wLjAuMA..">IBM’s Institute for Business Value</a> (IBV) finds that executives estimate about 40% of their workforce will need to reskill over the next three years due to AI and automation.</p>



<p>Equipping the workforce with the skills to succeed tomorrow is a challenge we must address today. And it’s vitally important that everybody is given equal opportunity to participate and thrive. &nbsp;</p>



<p>For that reason, we at IBM recently announced a <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-18-IBM-Commits-to-Train-2-Million-in-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Three-Years,-with-a-Focus-on-Underrepresented-Communities">new commitment</a> to train two million learners in AI in three years, with a focus on underrepresented communities. Equitable access is a priority for us and we’re working to ensure that everybody—including those who have historically been left behind during previous technological advances—are benefiting from and not being excluded from the latest developments in AI.</p>



 Free course offerings in generative AI for everyone 



<p>Our free education program, <a href="https://skillsbuild.org/">IBM SkillsBuild</a>, makes it possible for learners across the world to benefit from AI education developed by IBM experts to provide the latest in cutting-edge technology developments. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM SkillsBuild <a href="https://skillsbuild.org/students/course-catalog/artificial-intelligence">courses</a> are designed to build on each other, so learners can deepen their understanding as they go along. The core, entry-level learning plan is dedicated to “Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals”. This is comprised of six courses that require about 10 hours to complete, after which the learner earns a digital credential. “Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals” introduces learners to the history of AI and explores the ways that AI makes predictions, understands language and images, and learns using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">Deep Learning</a>, neural networks that attempt to simulate the human brain.</p>



<p>People learn by doing, and so the courses in IBM SkillsBuild are designed to be interactive. For instance, in one hands-on simulation, learners build and run a machine learning model with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-studio">IBM Watson Studio</a>.</p>



<p>Beyond the fundamentals, we recently announced a new generative AI roadmap that includes new coursework on Prompt-Writing, Getting Started with Machine Learning, Improving Customer Service with AI, and Generative AI in Action. But AI is not just about being smart with technology, it is also about building trust and developing models responsibly; and so, IBM SkillsBuild also includes coursework on the important topic of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/ai-ethics">AI ethics</a>.</p>



<p>At course completion, learners earn IBM-branded digital credentials that are recognized by potential employers.</p>



 Using AI to improve the learner experience 



<p>AI features within IBM SkillsBuild enhance the learning experience. AI-powered solutions analyze students’ aptitudes, interests and accomplishments, and then suggest credentials to pursue. When a learner gets started on their educational journey, they will receive an AI-generated, tailored learning path, based on their personal preferences, experiences, and academic level. Meanwhile, chatbots help support learners throughout their journeys.</p>



<p>We are also using AI technologies to make IBM SkillsBuild better. AI helps us review feedback from learners and analyze the program’s performance, informing the improvements we make as we continue to develop it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also work with partners to use AI to analyze market trends, and this helps us be responsive, creating enhanced content that aligns with needs in the job market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Expanding AI skills training through partnerships 



<p>In addition to the online courses that are available to everyone, IBM partners with expert organizations around the globe to help expand the reach of our skills training.</p>



<p>Having people on the ground is key to making an impact. Our local partners work every day to equip learners from underrepresented backgrounds with the cutting-edge STEM know-how they will need to succeed in the future workforce. They understand the diverse needs and realities of their communities.</p>



<p>For instance, in the US, <a href="https://itexperience.org/">IT Experience</a> works with Black, other minority communities, and women returning to the workforce, to provide them with opportunities to gain experience and reskill — or upskill — in the technology sector.&nbsp; We also work to help refugees: Czechitas, a partner in the Czech Republic, is reskilling people who have fled the war in Ukraine. These are just a few examples.</p>



 AI and beyond 



<p>AI has the potential to make work better for everybody—if we get it right. As such, acquiring AI skills will be essential to tomorrow’s workforce.</p>



<p>Through IBM SkillsBuild, we hope to make this game-changing technology a tool that works to the benefit of as many people as possible.</p>

				  Before purchasing a decentralized identity solution you will need to decide if you want to buy a platform or component-based system. But what is the difference, what are the benefits of each approach, and what will provide the best way forward for your organization?&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the descriptions alone, you may have an inkling of what sets these two ways of purchasing solutions apart. But to make sure we’re all on the same page, here’s what we mean when we describe a system as a platform or component-based:</p>
<p>A platform solution is wholly created, packaged, and hosted by someone else. They have decided which features are important and are offering you a full solution.</p>
<p>A component-based solution can be put together either by you or a third party and is made up of several different pieces, potentially from several different sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to decentralized identity solutions, both of these approaches have benefits and drawbacks depending on your goal.</p>
<p>Platform solutions</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of a platform-based approach is that the software is ready to go: It requires little or no work on your team’s part in order to get started. A good example is email. Most organizations do not have to build their own messaging systems because email exists and is already widespread and interoperable. Other benefits of a platform include letting someone else host the data and run the software, thereby reducing the amount you need to be responsible for.</p>
<p>The main drawback of platform solutions is lack of control and flexibility. Going back to the email example, if there is a feature you would like to add, your team is unlikely to be able to edit the features available through Gmail. Another thing to keep in mind is that as someone else is running the software, you may have recurring payments to keep the software running. Also something to consider is that the data you collect will be stored by the platform. If you are an organization with security concerns — such as a government — this option may not be for you.</p>
<p>TLDR; platform solutions offer a more plug and play and less customizable experience that is maintained and owned by a third party. They can be an excellent option for smaller organizations that don’t want to create and maintain their own solutions.</p>
<p>Component-based solutions</p>
<p>The biggest benefit of a component-based solution is flexibility. These solutions let you build exactly what you need, and also allow you to switch out pieces as your needs change or newer features become available. A good example is a car. You fully own your car, you can customize it to your wants and needs, and if something stops working you are responsible for repairing it. In addition to fully owning a component-based solution, you also operate the software yourself, and control where your data goes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main drawback to component-based systems is that it requires expertise and time to implement, all of which increases with each additional feature. Going back to our car analogy, there is a reason that many people opt to go to mechanics rather than fix their cars themselves — they want the mechanic’s years of experience. Other things to keep in mind with this kind of system is that you will need to host it somewhere and maintain it, which can require more computers or cloud server cost and more internal team skill.</p>
<p>TLDR; component-based solutions offer a highly customizable system that may take some time to put together, but is owned and operated by your organization. This is an excellent option for larger organizations that have specific features they need or regulations to follow when it comes to their data.</p>
<p>Indicio’s approach</p>
<p>Indicio offers component-based solutions to our customers. We believe that this is the best way to build decentralized ecosystems because it provides flexibility. As the technology advances, the ability to rapidly adopt newer components and features can be critical to success. — You do not want to be left waiting for your platform to integrate these features into its software.</p>
<p>Our number one goal at Indicio is customer success. Which means that while we sell components, we rarely ever end the interaction there. Our engineers have extensive experience in developing and implementing solutions and can help your team put the components you want&nbsp; together in the way that you need — should you need that kind of help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering, “Isn’t Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> a complete platform?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is similar, but only in the sense that it provides all the components needed to build a complete ecosystem for issuing, holding, presenting, and verifying credentials, including hosting if needed. However, it’s not a platform because you fully own it, you control the data, and you run the software. Indicio never collects or even sees your data. To revisit our car analogy one last time, our team is happy to act as the manufacturer and put it together, or the mechanic and provide IT support, but at the end of the day it is your car.</p>

             October 2023   
	 
		 
			 A Journey Through the Evolution of Blockchain for FIs 
 
<p>October is a memorable month for us as we commemorate Tokeny’s 6th anniversary in 2023.</p>
<p>Reflecting on our journey, the transformative strides in blockchain and its emerging prominence in the financial sector stand out.</p>
<p>🚀 The Early Days (2017-2020):&nbsp;The Need for a Suitable Blockchain</p>
<p>In the fledgling stages of our journey and the evolution of security tokens, many early adopters in the financial system believed that the best solution was to craft their own blockchains. This mindset stemmed from a desire for control instead of utilizing a public blockchain. Given the uncertainty about ensuring compliance on permissionless networks, many chose to develop their own blockchains, adopt private ones, or work within siloed ecosystems.</p>
<p>As time progressed, public networks significantly improved in speed, cost, interoperability, as well as compliance enforcement via smart contracts. The realization grew that the answer wasn’t necessarily about creating a new blockchain. Instead, it became evident that the future would hinge on bridging the sense of compliance on a public ledger.</p>
<p>🔥 The Buzz Period (2020-2022):&nbsp;The Age of Wallet Solutions</p>
<p>The next phase in this evolution was characterized by a realization that blockchain could be a suitable infrastructure for global finance, but then came the next hurdle in solving the custodianship problem. As a reminder, securities are bound by numerous regulatory guidelines for various asset servicers. Implementing these on-chain necessitates creative solutions that comply with the law.</p>
<p>This period witnessed a growing understanding that cryptocurrencies and security tokens don’t function identically. With regulations becoming stronger for custodial wallets, a pressing demand for non-custodial wallets became evident. This shift was indeed a welcome one, aligning with the core essence of blockchain, where end-users should inherently control their assets, manage their accounts, and identities. Moreover, protocols like ERC6343 guarantee the possible recovery of tokens via smart contracts.</p>
<p>🌆 The Scaling Phase (2023-∞):&nbsp;Tokenization in Action</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, after years of exploration and discovery, the time has come to fully harness the power of this technology. Business is now reclaiming the reins from tech departments with a new mantra –&nbsp;“We need tokenization capabilities.”&nbsp;Financial Institutions (FIs) are increasingly eager to design new blockchain-based services for their clientele for a variety of use-cases including but not limited to: treasury management, collateral management, cap table management, alternative liquidity options, and many more.</p>
<p>As time to market becomes increasingly important, to ensure unity and to accelerate adoption we encourage the use of open-source standards like ERC3643, so everyone can interact on the same nomenclature and functioning principles. From investors to issuers, to custodians, to exchanges, to asset servicers, leveraging the same framework is massively beneficial.</p>
<p>In alignment with this vision, Tokeny and 35+ distinguished members across industries have established the non-profit ERC3643 association. Our primary aim is to globalize this standard and expedite its adoption.</p>
<p>We cordially invite FIs aiming to pioneer this transformation to join our collective efforts.</p>
<p>Cheers to Tokeny’s upcoming years and the continued positive trajectory of blockchain!</p>
<p>We appreciate your time, here’s to the next 6 years! 🥂</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 3rd October to 17th&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we shed light on the G20’s move around crypto guidelines and how India is reacting to it, touch upon California’s new rules for crypto businesses, and see how Cyprus is aligning with Europe when it comes to crypto regulations. So, let’s dive right&nbsp;in.</p> Digital Asset Developments Dominate Global Regulatory Landscape <p>Global: The recent assembly in Marrakesh, Morocco, saw G20 nations embracing the “IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper: Policies for Crypto-Assets” as a foundational roadmap for crypto oversight.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1711765709909291041?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The paper underscores increased data sharing and collaboration among G20&nbsp;nations.</p><p>Following this guideline, India, a significant member and current president of the G20, is adjusting its stance on crypto, as indicated by the Secretary Of Economic&nbsp;Affairs.</p><p>The paper outlines guidelines on crypto oversight, with a focus on cross-border collaboration and risk management frameworks. Within these frameworks, an emphasized component is alignment with the Financial Action Task Force’s standards, specifically aiming to curtail the misuse of crypto assets for illicit activities.</p><p>In parallel, the International Monetary Fund’s recent working paper sets forth a risk assessment matrix for countries. This tool aims to spotlight potential sector vulnerabilities, streamlining the understanding of emerging macro-financial risks associated with digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Cyprus: Shifting the lens to Europe, Cyprus, celebrated for its crypto-friendly posture, is contemplating a tighter grip on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>The nation is eyeing stringent penalties for non-compliant crypto service providers and aligning its measures with globally recognized AML/CFT standards.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1712183498465837533?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These moves echo the broader European intent, as the EU is set to unveil the comprehensive “Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulation” in 2024, fortifying consumer safeguards in the evolving web3 environment.</p><p>The United States: On American soil, California emerges as the latest state to formulate a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>The recently signed Digital Financial Assets Law mandates licensing protocols and stringent record-keeping standards, laying the groundwork for transparent crypto operations in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>In the backdrop of these regulatory dynamics, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is contemplating the extension of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to the realm of digital currencies.</p><p>This move, reportedly, intends to offer an additional layer of protection against potential mishaps like unauthorized transfers or cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>Now, let’s look into two of these major developments in detail and analyze their impact on the broader crypto ecosystem in&nbsp;detail.</p> California’s New Crypto Framework: Implications and&nbsp;Impact <p>California has officially delved into crypto regulation by enacting the Digital Financial Assets Law. This decision follows Governor Gavin Newsom’s approval of Assembly Bill&nbsp;39.</p><p>Modeled after New York’s BitLicense, California’s law mandates cryptocurrency entities to acquire a license from the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI).</p><p>This is reportedly to align with the state’s regulatory expectations. Additionally, maintaining accurate financial records and being available for regulatory audits are also part of the compliance requisites.</p><p>Although the law seeks to shape the crypto landscape, prioritizing user privacy and interest and enhancing consumer protection, potentially minimizing fraud, its real-world implications remain to be&nbsp;seen.</p><p>Will it enhance transparency and reliability or could it stifle innovation, leading to an exodus of crypto businesses from the state? The slated 2025 commencement provides time to observe and, if necessary, recalibrate the approach.</p> G20’s Green Light to Crypto Guide: A Two-Edged Sword? <p>The G20’s recent recognition of the “IMF-FSB Synthesis Paper” could reshape the crypto landscape as we know it&nbsp;today.</p><p>The directive, leaning towards comprehensive oversight rather than prohibition, suggests cross-border regulatory synergy and robust risk frameworks.</p><p>Its call for increased data transparency and adherence to FATF’s anti-money laundering benchmarks places a spotlight on preserving the integrity of digital asset transactions.</p><p>On the brighter side, a globally coordinated regulatory stance might boost investor confidence and enhance crypto’s legitimacy in traditional financial spheres. It could bridge the knowledge gap for countries still grappling with crypto’s dynamism, fostering a more harmonized global approach.</p><p>Yet, there’s potential friction. Overzealous data requisition might challenge privacy norms, and stringent compliance could weigh down startups, possibly curbing innovation.</p><p>As 2025 nears, when the first review is due, the crypto realm will keenly watch how this roadmap steers the balance between governance and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>A Distributed Ledger stands at the forefront of modern database technology, a shared database spread across many sites, countries, or institutions. This innovative approach to data management records transactions while ensuring every participant within its network has access to a shared, uniform version of this information. As industries evolve and the need for transparent yet secure transaction methods surges, the relevance and significance of this technology amplify.</p>
 Historical Context 
<p>Origins and evolution of ledgers in accounting and finance: The concept of ledgers is not new. Historically, they’ve served as repositories for financial information, recording and keeping track of transactions in a physical, centralized manner. This method, while foundational, had limitations regarding accessibility, transparency, and real-time updates.</p>
<p>The shift to digital ledgers: The digital age revolutionized data management. Digital ledgers introduced speed and immediate access. However, they also confronted us with challenges concerning security, transparency, potential data manipulation, and reliance on central intermediaries.</p>
<p>The emergence of blockchain and DLT: Recognizing the pitfalls of digital ledgers, the concept of blockchain was birthed, later leading to the broader realm of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This decentralized approach promised to address previous challenges, adding layers of security, transparency, and peer verification without relying on a central authority.</p>
 What is Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)? 
<p>Detailed definition: DLT is a decentralized system that facilitates recording transactions across many computers. It differs from traditional databases because it lacks centralization, ensuring consistent data across its network without relying on a singular control point.</p>
<p>Difference from traditional ledgers: While traditional ledgers hinge on a single entity (like banks or regulatory authorities) for validation, DLT operates using consensus algorithms. These algorithms ensure that all network participants agree on the recorded data’s validity, thus removing intermediaries and providing a democratized system.</p>
<p>Key components and features: Key features making DLT particularly attractive include decentralized control, data immutability, cryptographic data security, and consensus-driven validation mechanisms.</p>
 Types of Distributed Ledgers 
<p>Blockchain vs. other types: Though often used synonymously with DLT, blockchain is a subset. It sequentially links data, with blocks chained chronologically. However, other DLT structures, such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), diverge from this chained data model.</p>
<p>Public vs. Private Ledgers: The difference lies in accessibility. Public ledgers, like the one used by Bitcoin, are accessible to all, allowing anyone to participate. Conversely, private ledgers limit participation and are often used within a single organization.</p>
<p>Consortium Ledgers: This is a middle ground between public and private, controlled by a pre-selected group of nodes or participants, usually multiple organizations collaborating for common objectives.</p>
 Benefits of Using Distributed Ledger 
<p>Enhanced security and immutability: DLT employs sophisticated cryptographic techniques. With its decentralized nature, altering recorded data becomes arduous, ensuring data integrity.</p>
<p>Transparency and traceability: Every transaction is visible to participants, guaranteeing unparalleled transparency, which aids in trust-building and ensures a clear audit trail for every entry.</p>
<p>Reduction in transaction costs and intermediaries: The consensus-driven model of DLT removes the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and potential bottlenecks and creating a more streamlined transaction process.</p>
<p>Increased efficiency and speed: Without intermediaries and with real-time ledger updates, transaction times are drastically reduced, enhancing efficiency.</p>
 Real-World Applications 
 
 Identity Verification: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) fortifies identity verification processes against theft and fraud. By decentralizing personal information and employing robust cryptographic techniques, DLT enhances security, reduces vulnerabilities, and puts individuals in greater control of their data, thereby diminishing the risks of unauthorized access and manipulation. 
 Supply Chain: With a need for authentic, traceable product histories, DLT provides a solution, ensuring real-time tracking and verification of goods at every stage, from origin to end-user. 
 Smart Contracts: These self-executing contracts embed the terms of the agreement within lines of code, making them automatic, transparent, and irreversible 
 Voting Systems and Governance: DLT can overhaul traditional voting systems, introducing enhanced transparency while reducing fraud potential and increasing citizen trust. 
 
 Challenges and Limitations 
 
 Scalability Concerns: As transactions accumulate, the size of the ledger grows. Processing and validating these transactions can become slower over time. 
 Integration with Existing Systems: Organizations with established infrastructures may find transitioning to a DLT-based system daunting, given integration complexities and potential resistance to change. 
 Regulatory and Governance Issues: DLT’s decentralized nature might clash with centralized regulatory frameworks, making universal adoption challenging. 
 Potential Risks and Vulnerabilities: Though secure, as a relatively young technology, undiscovered vulnerabilities could be present, which might be exploited by malicious actors. 
 
 The Future of Distributed Ledgers 
 
 Integration with IoT and AI: As devices become more innovative and connected, merging DLT with IoT and AI can create interconnected systems where transactions are secure and intelligent. 
 Industry Disruption: The applications are vast, from healthcare patient record management to real estate property registries. DLT stands to revolutionize various sectors, enhancing transparency and efficiency. 
 Societal Implications: As decentralized systems become more prevalent, power dynamics might shift, paving the way for more community-driven, democratized structures. 
 
<p>Distributed Ledger Technology is revolutionizing the organizational fabric, presenting opportunities and challenges equally. Its potential is vast, reshaping industries and societal structures alike. Staying informed, adaptable, and proactive is crucial as we move forward in this digital age. Organizations must seize the moment, delving deeper into DLT’s world, collaborating with experts, and considering its implementation for a brighter, more efficient future.</p>

<p>The critical infrastructure is commonly defined as the systems and networks that provide basic services necessary to preserve a standard of living. In today’s interconnected high-technology world, protecting the critical infrastructure has gained growing attention. Increasing threats and a changing geopolitical environment are giving us reasons to reconsider how we define and protect these vital systems. In this blog post we look at how the scope of what is critical infrastructure is being transformed, and how expanded coverage is changing what organizations must do to protect their growing assets and capabilities. We’ll examine how interconnectivity and increasing dependence on digital technologies has resulted in this expanded definition, and how new regulations in the European Union (EU) are affecting the way public and private entities must protect their operations.</p>
<p>A look back</p>
<p>Critical infrastructure traditionally included essential services such as electricity, water and sewer, roads, and the banking system that sustains the economy. As digital technologies have made their way into so many facets of our daily lives, so too has our dependence on these technologies for their continued reliable operation. It’s surprising that the critical infrastructure in the context of national security was not formally defined in many countries until the 1990s in preparation for the year 2000 (Y2K) event that was expected to wreak havoc across systems of the time. Fast forward to 2023 and increasing threats and a changing geopolitical environment have given us good reasons to reassess how we define and how we protect critical infrastructure to mitigate risks and ensure its uninterrupted operation.</p>
<p>Today’s environment</p>
<p>Expanding the scope of what is considered critical infrastructure, the list of services now goes well beyond electricity, water and sewer, roads, and banking. Services today extend to a wide spectrum of financial services, industrial technologies, communications, healthcare, and education. With digital technologies such as cloud-based data storage and processing now forming part of many vital services, the need to ensure their security and resiliency has become paramount. According to the 2023 IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report, 82% of breaches involved data stored in public or private cloud environments. On average these breaches amount to USD 4.45 million cost per incident. With critical infrastructures being primary targets, the cost of breaches across the sector exceeds USD 5 million and has been growing year on year.</p>
<p>Geopolitical events and increasing malware attacks on utilities and public services are also causing concern at national security levels. The use of new technologies in warfare is raising alarms for the urgent need to strengthen the reliability and robustness of the expanded set of services that now comprise the critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The need for resilience</p>
<p>To address these threats, new and updated regulations in the EU will come into effect in the next few years. The new Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the updated Network and Information Systems (NIS2) component of the Directive on Measures for a High Common Level of Cybersecurity across the Union establish procedures for identifying and designating critical infrastructures, and a common approach for assessing the need to improve their protection. As EU-wide initiatives, DORA and NIS2 are aimed to become part of each member state’s domestic legislation process and law.</p>
<p>The focus of DORA is to enhance the operational resilience of the financial sector within member states. Its primary objective is to ensure that financial institutions and the infrastructure they use and depend on can withstand and recover from cybersecurity incidents and disruptions. Covering a wide range of aspects including cybersecurity, IT systems, outsourcing, and incident reporting, DORA emphasizes robust oversight of third-party service providers.</p>
<p>NIS2 expands earlier EU-wide cybersecurity legislation aiming to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure areas. The regulation establishes response teams to coordinate incidents across member states. Most notably, NIS2 expands the scope of critical infrastructure, effectively bringing more organizations under the regulatory umbrella. Among industries now covered under the expanded definition, mobile network operators now play a vital role in the critical infrastructure. Focused on fifth-generation (5G) networks that are being deployed to modernize telecommunications for the next decade, mobile network operators are required to only use components from trusted sources.</p>
<p>Both DORA and NIS2 call for the establishment and maintenance of a skilled cybersecurity workforce that can continuously identify and assess system weaknesses and implement solutions to mitigate risks. The regulations also set auditing requirements and severe fines for non-compliance that can amount up to 2% of a company’s worldwide sales. The combination of DORA’s focus on the financial sector and NIS2’s broader coverage will ensure that critical sectors collaborate and learn from each other’s best practices, enhancing overall resilience against cyber threats.</p>
<p>The way forward</p>
<p>While DORA and NIS2 are crucial steps toward a safer and more resilient digital landscape in the EU, compliance with these regulations can pose challenges for organizations. DORA and NIS2 promulgate the use of innovative technology including state-of-the-art encryption and key management to protect sensitive and private data end-to-end. Compliance with these directives is not just a legal obligation but also a vital step toward building a safer and more prosperous digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>With the right security strategy and solutions, organizations can enhance their security posture and facilitate the process to ensure compliance. End-to-end data protection requires effective management of the keys and secrets that encrypt and control access to critical data assets. Entrust offers a complete suite of innovative cryptographic solutions that provide a unique centralized/decentralized security approach to facilitate regulatory compliance. Paired with support for post-quantum-ready algorithms, along with a world-class Cryptographic Center of Excellence (CryptoCoE) and professional services, customers using Entrust solutions can not only protect their deployments today but also future-proof them, to facilitate ongoing compliance as threats and requirements change.</p>

 The anonymity of online casinos makes them a fertile ground for money laundering, and a significant threat to the stability and integrity of the global gambling industry. But there are things that operators can do to protect their business and customers. 



 



<p>There was a reason why Marty Byrde from Ozark chose casinos as the perfect front for his money laundering activities. Criminals can convert dirty money into physical or digital chips relatively easily with little to no checks, gamble for a short time, and then cash out, with fresh, laundered money. The same is true for online casinos. In fact, the anonymity afforded by online casinos rivals that of even the darkest, dingiest, most back door brick and mortar casino.</p>



<p>The global revenue of the online casino market is projected to reach <a href="https://es.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/online-casinos/worldwide">$32.69 billion by the end of this year</a>, with an estimated 124 million active users by 2027. No longer considered a niche offshoot, online casinos are a sector in their own right, and welcome increasing numbers of players every single day. However, where there are online users, there are weaknesses in online platforms that criminals can exploit.</p>



 Global relationship between casinos and money laundering. 



<p>The impact of money laundering on the gambling industry can be felt around the world, offline and online. In July 2023, Australian-headquartered Crown Resorts found itself at the center of a major legal battle. In a landmark decision, the Federal Court ordered Crown Resorts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/30/crown-to-pay-450m-penalty-after-failing-to-comply-with-anti-money-laundering-laws">pay a staggering $450 million</a> (the country’s third largest corporate fine ever) for breaches to money laundering laws.</p>



<p>During the trial, Crown Resorts openly acknowledged that its casinos had failed to implement adequate systems for monitoring “high-risk” gamblers and the operations of junket tours. The investigation uncovered a total of 546 violations of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, spanning 2016 and 2022.</p>



<p>Despite having a population of just over half a million, money laundering in Malta’s iGaming industry is also a significant issue. The island country is home to over<a href="https://igamingnext.com/news/mga-2021-in-numbers/"> 500 iGaming operators</a>, employs more than 10,000 people and generates over $1.5 billion in revenue each year. As a major industry and significant contributor to the economy, it is important that Malta is able to offer a gambling environment that is safe and secure.</p>



<p>In 2022, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-publishes-its-2022-annual-report-and-financial-statements/">carried out</a> 28 compliance audits, 228 desktop reviews, and additional AML/CFT compliance examinations, which resulted in the cancellation of licenses and the imposition of <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/the-mga-publishes-its-2022-annual-report-and-financial-statements/">administrative penalties totaling €179,150.</a> The MGA also took remediation measures against 25 license holders, amounting to over €738,000. The Fit &amp; Proper Committee found six individuals and companies to have fallen short of its probity standards due to various factors, including the potential risks associated with money laundering.</p>



<p>Operators failing to comply with AML practices can face serious legal and financial consequences. AML failures include not properly assessing the risk factors associated with players, not having appropriate policies in place, failing to comply with regulatory guidance, and not implementing policies effectively.</p>



<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/petfre-gibraltar-ltd-trading-as-betfred-and-oddsking-fined-gbp2-9m">UKGC imposed a £2.87 million fine on operator Petfre Ltd.</a> for failing to comply with AML and social responsibility regulations. At the time, Leanne Oxley, Director of Enforcement and Intelligence at the UKGC, stated that other licensees should take note of the case and assess it to improve their compliance measures.</p>



 One click away: Why money launderers target online casinos. 



<p>There are numerous reasons why money launderers will target online casinos, and online gambling platforms, in general, including:</p>



 Anonymity and privacy. 



<p>Online casinos offer unrivalled anonymity and privacy for customers, which unfortunately makes for very attractive conditions for money laundering and other types of fraud. Since online casinos do not require in-person interaction, criminals can create fake identities or steal others’, making it extremely challenging for authorities to trace the source of funds.&nbsp;</p>



 High transaction volumes. 



<p>As many online gambling platforms process thousands of transactions every day, this makes it harder for payment providers and operators to monitor for fraud, and for law enforcement agencies to detect suspicious activities. Criminals will also often use multiple accounts to transfer money between different platforms, making the tracking of funds even more challenging.</p>



 International reach.&nbsp; 



<p>As gambling platforms often operate in multiple jurisdictions, money launderers often transfer money across different countries to further obfuscate funds and avoid detection.</p>



 Cryptocurrency in online casinos. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-criminals-leverage-crypto-money-laundering/">Crypto money launderers</a> on online gambling platforms use a combination of anonymous and identifiable accounts to deposit funds, which are then withdrawn or transferred to other players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As cryptocurrencies are decentralized, this offers a further level of anonymity, making it even more challenging to trace transaction source and destination, particularly on platforms with subpar KYC and AML measures.</p>



 What methods do criminals use to launder money in online casinos? 



<p>As online gambling platforms provide so many opportunities to launder money, fraudsters have various options to obscure the origin of dirty money and channel it through their gambling platforms of choice. For example, criminals may look to use <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">stolen identities</a> to open accounts and carry out money laundering schemes, and use stolen credit cards for deposits and withdrawals.</p>



<p>Another common method for money laundering in online casinos involves the fraudster depositing money into their account through either prepaid cards, cheques, credit and debit cards, or cryptocurrencies. The money deposited to the gambling account is then withdrawn and ultimately achieves legal status. With this method, the player does not tend to use the funds for actual betting.</p>



<p>If a particularly large amount of money needs to be made clean, the fraudster is likely to be concerned about amy red flags they might set off. Structuring, smurfing, or layering involves fragmenting large sums of illegally sourced funds into smaller transactions to escape detection. Money launderers do this by depositing small amounts at a time, thus eluding possible detection from regulatory authorities.</p>



<p>Another scenario involves the player using deposited funds to bet. The player will place their funds in games, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/collusion-in-betting/">collude</a> with other players, and place coordinated bets. Although this method involves losing some money, fraudsters are willing to make such an investment to launder money. Chip dumping, a technique in which a player intentionally loses chips to another player at an online poker table, is one of the greatest examples of collusion in online gambling. The individual receives chips and then cashes out, effectively laundering money.</p>



<p>The third most common way to launder money through online casinos involves using the gambling account as a makeshift bank account to make illegal transactions. Both parties (buyer and seller) would utilize a gambling account to transfer funds through P2P (player-to-player) transfers. The seller can then cash out illicit funds stored on their gambling account to their payment account. If asked about the source of funds, sellers often claim the money is generated from gambling profits.</p>



<p>Those who use gambling platforms for the purpose of money laundering often use multiple accounts to transact money between different platforms. Gnoming refers to the act of using multiple accounts to help one player win. The other accounts are created to deliberately lose in head-to-head games like poker.</p>



<p>The final method involves using a gambling account to store and conceal illicit funds from authorities. This approach differs from previous methods as funds are not withdrawn but concealed and retrieved from the gambling account using the same (anonymous) banking method.</p>

 Red flags: How to detect money laundering in online casinos. 



<p>Below are the most common money laundering-related red flags operators should watch out for:</p>



  Unusual betting patterns with players placing large bets on low-risk games or frequently changing betting patterns.<br>  Frequent large transactions.<br>  Rapid deposit and withdrawal cycles with criminals depositing large sums to their accounts and withdrawing them quickly.<br>  Multiple accounts and IP addresses for conducting transactions.  



 How are regulatory bodies addressing money laundering in online casinos? 



<p>Regulatory bodies worldwide have taken several initiatives to address money laundering in online casinos. These include the requirement to adhere to strict measures as part of AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a> regulations.</p>



<p>For instance, the UK has one of the most regulated gambling industries in the world. The UK Gambling Commission, which is currently running a series of consultations to bring the gambling environment into the digital age, has recently made customer onboarding and verification processes much stricter. Without complete verification, operators can neither let customers deposit funds nor give them <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/print/changes-to-the-licence-conditions-and-codes-of-practice-on-age-and-identity#:~:text=summarised%20as%20follows%3A-,Age%20verification,-We%20will%20require">access</a> to bonuses, free bets, or even free-to-play games.</p>



<p>Most regulatory bodies also require online casinos to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">Customer Due Diligence</a> checks, also known as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> requirements. This process involves gathering and verifying basic information about the customer via a reliable source. Discover more about the dangers of online casinos, and the importance of KYC in ensuring a safe and secure gambling experience in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/importance-of-kyc-in-online-casinos">‘The importance of KYC in online casinos.’</a></p>



 How can online casinos prevent money laundering? 



<p>Online casinos must embrace the benefits of technology to combat money laundering. Technology can help detect money laundering by analyzing large amounts of data and identifying suspicious transactions and gambling patterns. This is done by utilizing automated systems that flag transactions that meet specific criteria, e.g., large or unusual transactions.</p>



<p>Below are some ways operators can prevent money laundering with the help of technological advances:</p>



 Machine learning and AI solutions. 



<p>AI-enabled identity verification solutions can identify player identities and behavior patterns indicative of money laundering. Such systems learn from past transactions to identify unusual patterns. These solutions are also able to verify huge amounts of information by comparing customer data with identity documents, biometric data, or external databases.</p>



 Blockchain technology. 



<p>Blockchain technology can be utilized to create a transparent and immutable ledger of transactions. All transactions on the blockchain create a permanent trail of unalterable records. Consequently, authorities can more conveniently trace the source of money.</p>



 Reporting suspicious activities. 



<p>Operators must report any suspicious activities or transactions to the relevant authorities. This includes any unusual transaction that does not meet specific financial thresholds or other standards set by local regulations. Here, automated systems that flag suspicious transactions can be used.</p>



 Risk assessments. 



<p>Risk assessments include closely examining transaction patterns, geographic locations, and user profiles to ascertain the likelihood and potential risk of money laundering activities. After risks are detected, operators can take the appropriate measures to mitigate them, e.g., the implementation of advanced due diligence protocols on high-risk users. Adopting an effective risk-based <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/204350/amlctf_supervision_report_201011.pdf">approach</a> by identifying high-risk users and transactions can also lighten the overall burden of regulation on operators.</p>



 Transaction monitoring. 



<p>Lastly, operators can use technology to monitor transactions via SoF (Source of Funds) and SoW (Source of Wealth) checks. This helps ensure transactions are legitimate and funds are not the proceeds of criminal activity.</p>



 How does money laundering impact online casino users? 



<p>The impact of online casinos falling victim to money laundering can be disastrous. Firstly, there is the obvious reputational damage, as existing and future customers will ask questions about the legitimacy and security of the platform, resulting in a loss of player trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players who do stay on the platform and are concerned about money laundering will potentially change their deposit habits. Another likely impact could be players no longer trusting KYC processes for fear their information may be misused.</p>



<p>Operators can allay player fears by remaining proactive and vigilant in their efforts to prevent money laundering, which could involve implementing more advanced anti-fraud technologies and joining forces with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with relevant laws.</p>

 No topic has been more polarizing to the gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks. Now that the UKGC’s consultation on the checks has been conducted, we explore the arguments against affordability checks. 



 



<p>Financial risk checks, formerly known as affordability checks in the UK, were essentially designed to protect players from gambling online with money they cannot afford to lose.&nbsp;Operators conduct them to ensure they are not encouraging problem gambling, and that their products and services are being used responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similar in concept to the ability-to-pay checks conducted by financial service providers of credit cards and loans, financial risk checks run in the background, ultimately satisfying the operator that the gambler has sufficient funds to continue placing bets safely. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The release of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK Gambling White Paper</a> in April 2023, which aimed to bring the regulatory environment into the digital age, caused uproar among gambling operators and players alike. Its proposal on affordability checks, in particular, led to collective apprehension that they would be intrusive and impact the enjoyment of gamblers who were not experiencing gambling-related issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), which is currently running a series of consultations on proposed changes, has identified three key risks it wishes to address via financial risk checks: binge gambling, financially vulnerable customers, and sustained significant losses over time (from gambling). To assuage operator and player fear, the UKGC has stated that “frictionless” player protection checks will only ever be conducted, starting with background checks at a £125 net loss per month or £500 within a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">UKGC’s plans to execute the UK government’s gambling strategy here</a>.</p>



 Privacy concerns and data protection objections. 



<p>The topic of responsible gambling and safer gambling has been on the UKGC’s agenda since as far back as 2018, when it launched a proposal for operators to establish limits on online consumer expenditures until affordability checks were carried out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2020, a month before the government announced it would be carrying out a gambling review, the UKGC launched a consultation that included a call for evidence on the thresholds for affordability checks. During that period, a net monthly loss of £100 was proposed as the lowest possible threshold to prompt an affordability check, after which a gambler would be required to prove they had sufficient funds and could afford to continue gambling on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The consultation caused alarm throughout various gambling sectors, especially the racing administration. The fear is that thousands of gamblers would be uncomfortable divulging such private information and choose to bet via black-market routes or give up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The debate surrounding affordability checks highlighted the tension between safeguarding vulnerable gamblers and preserving individual freedom and privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2022, reports suggested that the government favored “non-intrustive” procedures similar to a credit check in financial services, although the matter was likely to be subject to further consultation.</p>



 Ready, set, stop: Impact of affordability checks. 



<p>The proposal of affordability checks was and is still by far the most controversial of gambling reforms under discussion. Critics argue that affordability checks come with notable drawbacks. For instance, the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/gambling-review/bha-warns-mps-affordability-checks-could-be-financially-devastating-for-british-racing-ajWoc9B6UgCZ/">British Horseracing Authority warned</a> Members of Parliament that introducing affordability checks at low levels of spending may prove financially devastating for the British horse racing industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Establishing appropriate spending limits has long been considered a challenging aspect when it comes to conducting affordability checks. Many factors need to be considered, including customer income, expenses, and overall financial situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In early 2021, Several high-profile names working within the <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/features/series/a-sword-of-damocles-but-how-did-affordability-checks-become-such-a-big-issue-a8n1Q3Q3DO9Q/">racing industry</a> sent letters to Members of Parliament, underscoring that racecourse revenues had suffered a £250 million loss due to the pandemic. Their argument was that if affordability checks as low as £100 were established, it would result in a potential further impact of £60 million per year on profits from lost levy, as well as media rights payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other evaluations proposed that the potential damage would be as high as £100 million per year, with roughly 60% of gamblers likely to reject such requests for information.</p>



 Most recent criticisms of financial risk checks. 



<p>Although the UK gambling white paper appears more balanced than many in the industry feared, there are criticisms from the industry based on allegations of intrusiveness and paternalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The invasion of privacy is staggering,” opined Regulus Partners regulatory analyst Dan Waugh in 2020 regarding the concept of financial risks and would just lead to individuals looking for ways to avoid the level of intrusion needed to enforce the rules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With financial risk checks, the UK’s government proposes “frictionless” and “unintrusive” checks when a player passes a net loss of £125 per month or £500 in a year. As per the proposal, such affordability checks would become more detailed yet “still frictionless” at more substantial loss levels, i.e., £1000 in a day or £2000 within 90 days. Such levels would be halved for gamblers under 25.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the UKGC’s consultations on four initial topics (financial risk checks; remote game design; in-person age verification; customer control over marketing), numerous operators have completed compliance assessments on how the proposed standards on affordability and financial risk checks has been met.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/20668/olbg-survey-65-of-bettors-would-refuse-to-face-affordability-checks-if-asked">survey</a> conducted by YouGov on behalf of the Online Betting Guide, 65% of players showed a lack of willingness to comply with affordability checks. Another <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/ey-report-22">study</a> led by the EY for the Betting and Gaming Council towards the end of 2022 showed that nearly 70% of people who gamble would resist allowing regulated companies to conduct affordability checks to determine whether they could afford to bet.</p>



 An industry “simply unprepared.” 



<p>A 2020 blog from <a href="https://www.wiggin.co.uk/insight/the-affordability-consultation-a-fundamental-shift-in-gambling-regulation/">Wiggin</a>, a law firm based in London, also noted how unprepared the industry and consumers were to adapt to the requirements of financial risk checks. The main crux of the issue for the Wiggin team was proportionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A question posed in the blog was: “How far does the Commission expect operators and regular customers, which constitute the vast majority of British gamblers, to change their behavior to mitigate the risk that only a small yet vulnerable proportion of customers face?”</p>



 What consequences do critics most fear? 



<p>According to Waugh, the likely outcome of extending “official oversight,” via financial risk checks, would be “threefold.”&nbsp;</p>



  Rather than use one operator, players would just allocate funds throughout multiple accounts, until the UKGC’s aspirations toward a <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/an-update-on-the-single-customer-view-industry-challenge">single customer view</a> are fully realized<br>  Gamblers may use proxy accounts owned by family and friends<br>  Players may resort to offshore gambling or black-market gambling platforms&nbsp;  



<p>As mentioned earlier, the final outcome would be players to simply reduce expenditures or stopping gambling altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/ey-report-22">study</a> led by EY for the Betting and Gaming Council highlighted the decline of online gross gambling yield since mid-2021, owing to several possible factors, including the introduction of affordability checks.</p>



 6 financial risk check indicators, 1 frictionless check. 



<p>IDnow combines a robust, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/affordability-financial-risk-checks/">holistic affordability check</a> with multi-dimensional ID verification and fraud prevention, facilitating seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere, all from one platform, all in real-time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We offer the industry’s most comprehensive affordability check (read more: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2.’</a>) to enable seamless gameplay by offering a fully automated journey and enhanced speed and accuracy at the affordability checkpoint. Checks can be added at any point in the journey. For example, while the more cautious operators may wish to implement the full suite of checks at the point of onboarding, some may wish to implement them at the point of withdrawal or deposit or once thresholds are met. Checks from our suite of financial risk indicators can also be done at different points – e.g. Geo, mortality and property at account sign up and application, and vulnerability and derogatory checks once the whitepaper limits have been reached for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow values the importance of non-intrusive affordability checks as they indicate that operators take player protection, privacy, and responsible gambling seriously.</p>

<p>To evolve from an economy of extraction to an economy of care we need to evolve from Communication Design to Conversation Design. While Communication Design builds one-directional relationships between corporations and consumers, Conversational Design builds frameworks and pathways for communities.</p><p>I have not talked about it much, but today is a good day to tell you that I joined a not-for-profit organization at the beginning of 2023 and it is challenging my way of thinking about&nbsp;design.</p><p>The job title they gave me is Visual Conversation Design Lead at Dark Matter Laboratories. DML is an international not-for-profit collaborating with communities to reshape and rebuild their institutions, instruments, and infrastructures.</p><p>I have felt the urge to use my design skills and knowledge to improve the world we live in, on and from, for many years, but did not know how. I was frustrated about seeing human systems destroying us and our planet and not being able to do anything about it. Designing a poster and posting it to social media felt useless. I mean, I get it and I don’t criticize designers doing so. It is what comes to the designer’s mind first. Paraphrasing the saying “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.”: When all you have is the creative cloud, everything looks like a poster on Instagram.</p><p>We do not have no power as designers, we just use our skills for the wrong things, in the wrong context, and for the wrong purposes. When we design a post on social media we try to teach individuals that have no power either and probably are in our network, because they already think like&nbsp;us.</p><p>This year I realized that we DO have power as designers. We have the power to say NO to certain clients, tools, and trends and we have the power to say YES to work with innovative experts and decision-makers in leverage positions that need our help. We can’t do it alone. We need to join communities of practice.</p><p>From Communication Design to Conversation Design</p><p>To evolve from an economy of extraction to an economy of care we need to change complex systems with multipolar problems. This is only possible if we form trans-disciplinary, trans-institutional, and trans-everything networks. To bridge these gaps we need to evolve from Communication Design to Conversation Design. While Communication Design builds one-directional relationships between corporations and consumers, Conversational Design builds frameworks and pathways for communities.</p><p>Communication Design has been strongly influenced by the system it has been used for. In most cases, the attempted kind of communication has been one-directional with the sole purpose of convincing a person to become a customer. As the Visual Conversation Design Lead, I am trying to unlearn the strategies of consumer building and learn the strategies of community building.</p><p>In the following 10 points, I tried to outline the key qualities Conversational Design should&nbsp;have:</p> Simplicity <p>While we need to understand the world in its complexity, we need to strive for simplicity in design. The simplest solution is the solution that wastes the littlest time, energy, and material. Simplicity in Conversational Design does not mean reducing the complexity of information. It means creating flows of knowledge, allowing to join the conversation from different points of view and levels of understanding.</p> Readability <p>We make our texts as comprehensible as possible, in terminology, structure, and typography. We have clearly identifiable hierarchies to allow fast navigation. Longer texts are always left-aligned, not too small, not too big, not too narrow, not too wide, and sufficiently darker than their background. All of the settings are responsively adapted to their&nbsp;display.</p> Transparency <p>We always credit and reference. Our work is the materialization of flows. It emerges through relationships. Making these relationships visible allows our ideas to be questioned and evolve. While staying readable through simple hierarchies, like titles, sub-titles, introductions, and subheadings, we offer opportunities to deepen the knowledge through side-, foot- or endnotes. Transparency also means avoiding layers of concealment that distance us from the matter, like decorative visual or verbal language.</p> Uncertainty <p>Without considering the possibility of being wrong or ignorant, and the wish to listen and learn, there can’t be conversation. Conversational Design has to express a certain degree of uncertainty. Techniques to make the design look unquestionable should be&nbsp;avoided.</p> Friction <p>Frictionless design is the enemy of constructive conversation. The frictionless design confirms one’s beliefs, even if wrong. We need to welcome different perspectives and positions if we want to evolve. Design should create and not hide friction to stimulate conversation.</p> Respect <p>Communication Design seduces consumers. Conversational Design treats its partners as equals. Design should not dumb down, but be challenging. Design can be a chance to evolve visual literacy and stimulate compound learning.</p> Emergent <p>Leave space for the design to evolve and emerge. Think about the constants and variables of your system. What are the variables and how can they be used to show the emergence and evolution of the design? In a world of constant change, everything planned is likely to break. A flexible system able to adapt is more likely to&nbsp;survive.</p> Contextuality <p>If it is our aim to enter into conversation with humans we need to become aware of the conditions under which they are confronted with us. To communicate adequately we need to adapt in size, form, and tone according to the context in which the conversation should take place. Contextual design is about using the right tools for the right people in the right&nbsp;context.</p> Eloquence <p>Visual eloquence means moving away from simplistic visual messages like logos and embracing the diversity and complexity of visual languages. Everything that makes us visible is an identification element. From the people of our organization to the output we create. Whatever is seen most, matters most to the Visual Identity.</p> Kindness <p>Above all rules, we follow the principle of humanity, which states that when interpreting our conversational partner we consider his or her perspective as true to their reality, although it may appear untrue from our perspective. In Conversation Design, we need to be hard on the matter, but soft on the people, to reach a common understanding of a shared&nbsp;faith.</p><p>This blog is authored by Martin Lorenz, Visual Conversation Design Lead at Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>References:</p><p>The ten points mentioned above are influenced by experiences and talks I had with my colleagues at Dark Matter Laboratories, like Indy Johar, Arianna Smaron, Gurden Batra, Leon Seefeld, Jayne Engle, Ivana Stancic, JP King, and many more, which aren’t documented and can’t be referenced here, but there are a couple of readable references that helped me with my thinking and I would like to collect them&nbsp;here.</p><p>This is an ongoing thought process and I would appreciate every hint from you to more relevant sources regarding the creation, application, and implementation of Conversational Design in communities.</p><p>I do not fully agree with all of what is written here, but these sources were definitely relevant to form an&nbsp;opinion:</p><p><a href="https://designobserver.com/feature/against-branding-part-1--design-and-conflict/39433">https://designobserver.com/feature/against-branding-part-1–design-and-conflict/39433</a></p><p><a href="http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK">http://www.untold-stories.net/?p=CAPS_LOCK</a></p><p><a href="https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/first-things-first-manifesto-2000">https://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/first-things-first-manifesto-2000</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/from-communication-design-to-conversation-design-b943f8ea0872">From Communication Design to Conversation Design</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I closed <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/video-trust-in-the-post-identity-world-identiverse-closing-keynote/">my Identiverse 2022 speech</a> with a discomfiting call to action: “If zero trust is a thing, then so is Zero Identity”. This speech from Identiverse 2023 in June extends that concept.</p>
<p>What do I mean? Let’s go as far as we can without identity. Let’s see if we can design systems without putting identity first. We’ve become obsessed with identity. We seem to begin the design process for each new system with identity. When a transaction is risky, we habitually pile on more identification, leading to too much identity data leaking, and too many opportunities for identity abuse.</p>
<p>It is sheer madness that <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-if-we-could-make-data-useless-to-thieves/">so much crime is enabled by simply assuming another person’s identity</a>.</p>
<p>To turn around this race-to-the-bottom, let’s try something different. Let’s try to secure peoples’ transactions with less reliance on their identity.</p>
<p>“Zero Trust” has achieved quasi standard status in cybersecurity but let’s remember it does not literally mean there is no trust. Rather, Zero Trust is an appeal for more discipline in security design. Much-vaunted trustless systems make their security promises with less reliance on people and process.</p>
<p>Similarly, “Zero Identity” is my call to do more with less identification.</p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Research around WebAuthn around creating a consistent signing identity using WebAuthn, creating and signing capability objects using WebAuthn, and using WebAuthn signers with EIP-4337.   Kepler <p></p><p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Kepler is currently being updated to adopt the latest versions of the UCAN spec (v0.10) and the CACAO spec (v3) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/155?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#155</a>). This will keep Kepler up to date with the latest work in cryptographic object capabilities, and help to streamline code while improving performance and safety.  <p></p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  ssi-ucan is being updated to support the latest iteration of the UCAN spec: version 0.10 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/510?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#510</a>). This will enable SSI users to take advantage of cryptographic object capabilities for delegating, invoking, and revoking permissions.  Last month, we upgraded our cryptographic libraries to address a vulnerability with ed25519 keys (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/532?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#532</a>).  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims to describe both the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  Working on a formal specification of TreeLDR’s layout ontology. RDF is the intermediate representation used by the TreeLDR compiler. Having a formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts in RDF will allow us to:  derive a formal definition of the TreeLDR language itself, based on this ontology, leading to the stabilization of TreeLDR;  enable developers to write extensions for TreeLDR through RDF.     Rebase&nbsp;   Support for ReCaps (and Delegated Attestation flows, as a result) is now available. This opens the door to allowing Kepler and Rebase to share a delegation and only requires one signing operation before the user can create and store credentials without re-signing.  A new, more flexible WASM compilation build chain that enables easy importation of the WASM library into the browser, Node, and other WASM-targeting Rust libraries.  Automated testing of all the flows that were missing tests (e-mail, NFT, POAP, Attestation, and Delegated Attestation).  Full support of did:key for ed25519 keys as both issuer and subject. Key additions broaden what applications can be built on top of it and open the door for user-defined credentials which are required for content authenticity projects.   <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

<p>Say goodbye to the network perimeter you know and love. Its days are numbered, and an expansive attack surface is taking its place.</p>
<p>You see, long gone are the days when classic network security policies could safely protect your sensitive data. With a swarm of new users, personal devices, cloud applications, and machine identities floating around your environment, the time has come to take implicit trust out of the equation.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re talking about adopting a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy. But, before you can do that, your organization will have to revisit its approach to identity governance.</p>
<p>Why? Think about it: Post-perimeter cybersecurity is all about knowing who and what has access to your corporate assets. More importantly, it’s about how they’re using them.</p>
<p>That’s where Identity and Access Management (IAM) comes into play. In this blog, we’ll discuss why IAM is key to implementing Zero Trust and what your organization can do to lay a solid foundation.</p>
 The importance of identity to Zero Trust security 
<p>There’s been a significant change in the way most organizations architect their IT infrastructure over the past several years. Given recent advancements in cloud computing, many enterprises have chosen to transition away from legacy, on-premise systems in favor of agile cloud deployments.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-cloud-in-2021-adoption-continues/">over 90% of organizations</a> now operate in the cloud. Gartner estimates that global cloud spending will continue to soar, totaling <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-04-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-in-2023#:~:text=Worldwide%20end%2Duser%20spending%20on,latest%20forecast%20from%20Gartner%2C%20Inc.">over $720 billion</a> in 2024. It begs the question: How did we get here?</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is unquestionably a driving force. When offices closed their doors, a sudden and massive demand for remote access paved the way for rapid digital transformation — and with that, cloud computing. However, because more users, applications, devices, and other assets are connected to the network, the attack surface has grown exponentially.</p>
<p>Worse yet, these connections exist far beyond the bounds of the traditional network perimeter, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access and exploitation. Now that castle-and-moat cybersecurity is insufficient, identity is the only factor standing between hackers and your sensitive data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that’s where a Zero Trust architecture comes into play.</p>
 The Zero Trust framework 
<p>The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust maturity model</a> accounts for the fact that the cybersecurity landscape has fundamentally shifted. In turn, it advocates for an identity-driven security framework, which allows a properly authenticated and verified user, device, or other entity to access network resources from any location.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that cloud services and remote access have effectively nullified the classic perimeter. After all, how do you build a fence around a house if the size of the property is constantly changing? The short answer is you forget about the fence and focus on the people coming and going from the property. In a nutshell, that’s what the Zero Trust strategy is all about.</p>
<p>Adopting an identity-driven approach is best supported in tandem with the three core Zero Trust principles:</p>
 
 Least privileged access: The term “<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege">least privilege access</a>” refers to a policy in which entities are granted the minimum level of authorization needed to perform a given function. For instance, employees may only have user access to network resources essential to doing their job. This is key to limiting the attack surface and containing cyber threats. 
 Assume breach: The Zero Trust model eliminates implicit trust and considers all connections as potential threats. Moreover, it advocates safeguarding against the inevitability of a data breach by taking steps to minimize damage. For example, your security team may segment the network, thereby preventing lateral movement. 
 Explicit verification: Strict identity governance is paramount. A solid Zero Trust architecture will continuously monitor activity even after network access is granted, mandating repeated authentication whenever an entity requests access to an additional resource. 
 
<p>One of the most efficient ways of supporting these principles is to introduce a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.</p>
 What is Identity and Access Management? 
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/identity-and-access-management-iam">is defined as</a> a “security and business discipline that includes multiple technologies and business processes to help the right people or machines to access the right assets at the right time for the right reasons, while keeping unauthorized access and fraud at bay.”</p>
<p>In simpler terms, IAM policies, tools, and technologies are how your organization can provide secure access to its users, third-party partners, and other entities.</p>
 Traditional IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM strategies stem from the classic network security model, which assumes all entities within a certain perimeter are trustworthy and secure (i.e., implicit trust). However, this approach is easily exploited by hackers, insider threats, phishing scams, malware, and more.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s incapable of meeting the scalability and complexity requirements of today’s dynamic IT landscape, which includes cloud services, mobile devices, remote workers, third-party vendors, etc. It lacks visibility over this expanding surface, allowing anomalous behavior to go undetected.</p>
 Zero Trust IAM 
<p>Zero Trust IAM deploys a more robust and advanced security framework. By applying Zero Trust principles to identity governance and access rights, organizations can implement and enforce access control policies on a much more granular level.</p>
<p>Instead of basing authentication decisions purely on location, a Zero Trust IAM system verifies every request using multiple attributes. These include (but aren’t limited to):</p>
 
 User identity 
 Context 
 Device reputation 
 Location 
 User activity or entity behavior 
 Resource sensitivity 
 
<p>Zero Trust identity management has numerous advantages. Taking this approach can help you:</p>
 
 Improve business continuity and resilience by reducing the attack surface 
 Streamline login, access, and authentication procedures 
 Enhance visibility and analytics over user behavior, which supports early threat detection 
 Minimize impact on the user experience, thus maximizing productivity 
 Reduce costs by automating, orchestrating, and consolidating IAM functions, thereby eliminating the need for redundant solutions 
 Simplify compliance for heavily regulated industries 
 Enable secure access for your <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/a-zero-trust-framework-for-the-new-hybrid-workforce/">hybrid workforce</a> 
 
 Implementing Zero Trust IAM: Challenges and solutions 
<p>Many organizations begin their Zero Trust journey with a mixed bag of on- and off-premise technologies, cloud applications, and unmanaged devices. Often, they’re not integrated through an enterprise identity service that catalogs all assets and connections.</p>
<p>Consequently, IT teams are forced to manage disparate identities across a vast number of systems and applications. At an individual level, that means each user has numerous — and oftentimes weak — login credentials. Without visibility over these fragmented identities, organizations are vulnerable to internal and external threats.</p>
 The road to Zero Trust maturity 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">Adopting Zero Trust</a> is no easy feat. It may take several years to fully implement and will certainly require all hands on deck. But, given the cybersecurity landscape, few organizations can afford to put it off any further.</p>
<p>The time to lay the foundation for your Zero Trust architecture is now. Luckily, there are several steps you can take to ease the process and get the ball rolling in the right direction:</p>
 
 The first step in addressing this challenge and advancing the Zero Trust journey is to reign in these many assets, users, and data sources. Organizations must systematically identify and classify all of their resources, assigning each one a risk rating depending on how critical it is to operations and how damaging it would be if leaked in the open. 
 Next, after assets are categorized, the enterprise can establish comprehensive security and access control policies. 
 You can fortify security and introduce layered defenses by consolidating identities under a unified IAM solution. With a comprehensive portfolio of advanced capabilities, IT teams can centralize all processes within a single source of truth for all users. This makes it easier to establish and enforce granular policies across on-premise and cloud environments. 
 With a unified solution in place, enterprises may then begin continuously monitoring user behavior, session patterns, and system-wide activity to rapidly detect anomalies and potential threats. 
 
 Essential IAM capabilities 
<p>You might be wondering what a comprehensive <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management">IAM portfolio</a> actually looks like. In truth, any IAM system worth its weight in gold will support Zero Trust security with a few must-have components.</p>
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) 
<p>Account takeovers are a growing threat to corporate credentials. In fact, a recent report suggests there’s been a <a href="https://cybernews.com/security/criminals-solved-bot-defense-leading-to-an-uptick-in-stolen-accounts/">230% jump</a> in such attacks year over year. Many organizations have implemented MFA to mitigate this risk, but hackers have learned to bypass traditional strategies with ease.</p>
<p>That’s why phishing-resistant MFA is crucial to your identity management strategy. FIDO2 keys, passkeys, and other mechanisms are helping security teams overcome this challenge and authenticate their users with ease.</p>
<p>Essential MFA solutions include:</p>
 
 Single sign-on (SSO): Users can access all applications after only one authentication rather than repeating the process for every unique cloud or on-premise system. SSO protects against password fatigue and reuse while also streamlining provisioning, onboarding, and offboarding. 
 Passwordless security: As mentioned, people tend to recycle passwords for multiple accounts. Worse yet, weak passwords are easily cracked. You can mitigate this risk by leveraging passwordless MFA — a process that instead relies on high-assurance cryptographic tools like FIDO2 or digital passkeys. 
 Certificate-based authentication (CBA): CBA offers a passwordless user experience by allowing you to provision a digital certificate to the user. You can also issue certificates to the user’s device, ensuring that both entities are verified and authorized to access network resources. 
 Certificate lifecycle management (CLM): CLM is a must-have addition to any certificate-based authentication process. It offers a full line of sight into your certificate estate, centralizing control for all environments. Issue, renew, and revoke certificates from one pane of glass. 
 Risk-based adaptive authentication (RBA): RBA provides configurable policies that empower you to factor contextual data into the authentication decision. It only escalates the process when required, ensuring you maintain a seamless user experience. If a request is deemed suspicious, you can issue another challenge to authenticate via other mechanisms. 
 
 Lay your Zero Trust foundation with Entrust 
<p>The access management and authentication tools highlighted above are crucial to supporting your Zero Trust journey. Not only will they enable you to secure your environments against unauthorized access, but they’ll empower your people to leverage essential resources with total confidence.</p>

It concludes on Oct 19. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF59   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF59 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Bluesky is currently in beta. Why should I join?</p>
<p>In September, Bluesky reached 1M users, and less than a month later, we reached 1.5M users. The size of our user base is rapidly growing, and our users include people who follow political news, sports, entertainment, and more. Join us in our early days as we grow from 1M to 10M users!</p>
<p>How do I get verified as a journalist?</p>
<p>On Bluesky, journalists and news organizations can self-verify by setting their website directly as their username. For example, some newspapers’ handles that already exist on Bluesky include @nytimes.com, @washingtonpost.com, and @npr.org.</p>
<p>As a result, each organization now manages verifications for their own journalists too. For example, a newsroom can verify an affiliated journalist through a subdomain like @name.newsroom.com.</p>
<p>Freelance journalists and writers that aren't affiliated with a specific organization can set their username to be their website.</p>
<p>Read more about domain verification in our guide <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">here</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have advice for establishing a presence on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Post and engage often! We have a very active user base, and creating posts and replies is the best way to show up on other people’s feeds.</p>
<p>You can also create and subscribe to custom feeds.</p>
<p>What are custom feeds and how can journalists use them?</p>
<p>Custom feeds are a feature on Bluesky that allow you to pick the algorithm that powers your social media experience. Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports — you can simply pick your chosen feed from an open marketplace of feeds developed by our team and third-party developers.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed gives them back control over how they spend their attention. For developers, an open marketplace of feeds provides the freedom to experiment and publish algorithms that anyone can use.</p>
<p>This means that Bluesky does not control a single algorithmic timeline for all users. Instead, users have created feeds of their own, including feeds specifically for news.</p>
<p>We encourage journalists to experiment with custom feeds too. For example, a local journalist in Portland could create a feed specifically for Portland. Similarly, a finance journalism organization could create a feed specifically for financial news.</p>
<p>How can I get an invite?</p>
<p>Fill out our waitlist for journalists <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOzi1Ty2Xs74E71G_2gHdiCk16yi4kJPQ9VIa-VYx2cmFaiA/viewform">here</a> with your work email address.</p>
<p>If you're a freelance journalist or use a personal email for work, please use the above form as well. We just ask that you provide an author link in the form.</p>
<p>I’m part of a news organization and I’d like to distribute invites to my team. How can I do that?</p>
<p>If you’re an audience editor, you can send us a note at <a href="mailto:press+teaminvites@blueskyweb.xyz">press+teaminvites@blueskyweb.xyz</a> with your Bluesky username and your requested number of invites.</p>
<p>Due to the volume of requests that we receive, if you’re seeking a single or a small number of invites, please use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOzi1Ty2Xs74E71G_2gHdiCk16yi4kJPQ9VIa-VYx2cmFaiA/viewform">waitlist form</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have any tools for scheduled posting or cross-posting?</p>
<p>We don’t currently have any official tools, but since Bluesky is an open social network, third-party developers can create their own. Here is a <a href="https://atproto.com/community/projects#bridges">list</a> of some of the existing third-party projects.</p>

<p>Although it can seem overwhelming — especially for those of us at small companies where identity and access management is just one of the many hats we wear — employee onboarding in Google Workspace can be a breeze, even if you’re not a tech guru. The key is knowing where to start.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step process of setting up new employee accounts, configuring email, and granting access to essential apps within Google Workspace. We’ll also cover common challenges and provide tips for simplifying the process, including how to <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">leverage tools like YeshID to make things even smoother</a>.</p>
 Step 1: Set Up a New Employee Account 
<p>The first step in onboarding a new employee is to set up a new employee account in Google Workspace. It’s worth noting here that we are assuming you have Google Super Admin access, which is a prerequisite for completing the tasks below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s a good idea to do this a couple of days before the employee’s start date to ensure that other applications can be provisioned smoothly. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
 
 Email address: By creating a Google Workspace account, you’re giving the employee an identity within your company, which is centered around their email address. 
 Password management: You’ll need to create a password for them, which you should send them and save so they can access their account on the first day. 
 Security: To enhance security, force the new employee to change their password upon the first login and strongly consider <a href="https://youtu.be/uVStgdfyJx0">enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)</a>. This will grant them access to Google systems like Calendar, Mail, and more. 
 
 Step 2: Grant Access to Google Groups and Organizations 
<p>Next, ensure that the new employee has access to the right email groups and is placed in the appropriate organizational units, or orgs, within Google Workspace. While this process may be manual, you can often use the profile of another user with a similar role as a reference to determine which groups and orgs to assign.</p>
<p></p>
 Step 3: Provide Access to Birthright Apps 
<p>Birthright apps are the applications that every employee should have access to, such as Slack, documentation systems (e.g., Notion or Confluence), and HR applications. To grant access to these apps:</p>
 
 Go into each application and provide access to the new email address you created for the employee. 
 Sometimes, you may need to coordinate with other departments to ensure access is granted appropriately. 
 
 Step 4: Track Access and Compliance 
<p>Whether you handle app provisioning yourself or someone else does it, it’s crucial to keep track of the apps you’ve granted access to for three key reasons:</p>
 
 Offboarding: When an employee leaves the company, you can easily revoke their access to applications.&nbsp; 
 Cost control: Tracking app access helps you manage licenses efficiently, saving your company money. 
 Compliance: Compliance requirements often demand proof of access, so having a record is essential. 
 
<p>Many companies without a full HR or IT department might track this information in a spreadsheet or company wiki that needs to be manually updated and kept private. It’s a lot to manage, but by implementing these best practices today, you set yourself up for success tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
 Simplify Onboarding with YeshID 
<p>There are options that don’t involve doing all of this manually: GAM, Bettercloud, Okta, and Ping are a few. The problem though is that for most small businesses, these products are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to streamline onboarding today while setting up the foundational best practices we outlined in this guide. Benefits include:</p>
 
 Schedule onboarding: YeshID allows you to schedule onboarding tasks. An email is automatically sent to the user on their start date, and their account is provisioned immediately to kickstart the application license process. 
 Create templates for departments: Create templates for different departments to automate the assignment of groups and orgs, reducing manual work. 
 Implement passwordless security: Enhance security by utilizing YeshID’s passwordless authentication method. 
 Manage application provisioning: Manage the application provisioning process through YeshID’s task management system. Assign administrators for each application, and they’ll receive notifications for when to provision access. 
 Compliance management: YeshID serves as a central source of truth for access management, making it easy to demonstrate compliance when needed. 
 
<p>Streamlining employee onboarding in Google Workspace doesn’t have to be a daunting task. With the right approach and tools like YeshID Onboard, you can efficiently manage the process and ensure that new employees have the access they need from day one.</p>
<p>Try <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Onboard</a>. The first 100 people to join will get access to better onboarding and offboarding for free today and early access to future product updates.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>October 10, 2023 Update: By request of our customers, we're now sharing a sample PowerShell script that we've been using at Microsoft to replace Azure AD naming in documentation or content. Get the <a title="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">Azure AD rename code sample on Microsoft Learn</a> and edit it according to your needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The rename of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to Microsoft Entra ID is now rolling across content and product experiences from Microsoft, as per the implementation timeline outlined in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/azure-ad-is-becoming-microsoft-entra-id/ba-p/2520436">Azure AD rename announcement on July 11th</a>. We expect the majority of text updates to be completed by mid-November of this year, and updates for on-premises software to be completed in 2024. Partners, analysts, and influencers have also started using the Microsoft Entra ID name in place of Azure AD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the new product name and the icon appearing in Microsoft Azure, Azure Marketplace, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Security admin centers, you’ll also see the service plan (SKU) display names update to Microsoft Entra ID Free, Microsoft Entra ID P1, and Microsoft Entra ID P2 on October 1, 2023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously announced, this is just a new name, with no impact on deployments or daily work, and no changes to capabilities, licensing, terms of service, or support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the feedback that we’ve received from many of you – our customers and partners throughout this transition. If you are considering an update to your own documentation or experiences to reflect the Microsoft Entra naming, we now have created resources to assist you. I’ll also clarify more details about the rename based on questions from this community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Resources for updating the Azure AD name in your content 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that the name change is rolling out widely, your organization may be interested in updating the Azure AD name accurately in documentation or content. We’re now sharing our internal best practices, tools, and tips in the docs article <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-rename-azure-ad">“How to rename Azure AD” on Microsoft Learn</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "how-to” playbook is designed to help you change the name as needed across your organization’s content. It includes best practices for finding and updating Azure AD text strings and graphic icons. Another important reference is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name">"New name for Azure Active Directory" on Microsoft Learn</a>, which includes a style guide, a comprehensive glossary of updated product and feature naming, the short list of exceptions to the rename, downloads of the new product icons, and a timeline for key milestones for Microsoft implementation of the name change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope it helps you scope and plan your updates in accordance with your own processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s address some questions from the community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, admins can use the Azure portal to manage Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support the ability to manage Microsoft Entra ID in the Azure portal for customers who prefer Azure portal or only need a subset of Microsoft Entra capabilities, similar to identity experiences available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The navigation changes in the Azure portal are minimal, and we’ll continue the messages that Microsoft Entra ID is formerly known as Azure AD for an extended time to ensure discoverability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage all customers to explore the comprehensive <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Entra admin center</a> but will maintain the ability to manage relevant identity experiences within the existing portals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, on-premises identities are still supported with Microsoft Entra ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to support and enhance <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/identity-and-access">Windows Server Active Directory</a> for on-premises identity and access management and the connection to Azure and other clouds, as many organizations continue to rely on this solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The name for Active Directory remains unchanged. Based on extensive feedback we've received about Microsoft Entra ID as the new name for Azure Active Directory, for many customers, the rename will help to better differentiate between the on-premises (Active Directory) and multicloud identity (Microsoft Entra ID) solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, identity developer and devops experiences aren't being renamed 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the transition seamless, all existing login URLs, APIs, PowerShell cmdlets, and Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) stay the same, as do developer experiences and tooling. See details at: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/new-name#whats-changing-for-identity-developer-and-devops-experience">What's changing for identity developer and devops experience? - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many technical components either have low visibility to customers (for example, sign-in URLs), or usually aren't branded, like APIs. For example, here’s how the API for Microsoft Entra Conditional Access (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access) shows up in Microsoft Graph:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "conditions": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessConditionSet"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "createdDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "displayName": "String",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "grantControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessGrantControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "id": "String (identifier)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "modifiedDateTime": "String (timestamp)",&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "sessionControls": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessSessionControls"},&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; "state": "string"&nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/conditionalaccesspolicy?view=graph-rest-1.0">conditionalAccessPolicy resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No, Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets are not being renamed. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we offer two PowerShell modules for administering identity tasks: the Azure AD PowerShell module, which is planned for deprecation in March 2024, and the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Azure AD PowerShell for Graph module, “AzureAD” is in the name of almost all <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0">Azure AD cmdlets</a>. These won’t be changing, and you can continue to use these same cmdlets now that the official product name is Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, my colleague Kristopher Bash from the Microsoft Graph team published an <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">update on the Azure AD Graph retirement and Azure AD PowerShell module deprecation</a>. Both are on multi-year retirement cycles to allow for customer migration to Microsoft Graph technologies, and Kristopher’s article clarifies the timing and customer resources, plus our commitment to work with you during the migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deprecation date for Azure AD PowerShell is planned for March 30, 2024. It will continue to work after that date, but support will be limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to start trying Microsoft Graph PowerShell as the recommended module for interacting with Microsoft Entra ID in the future. Based on your feedback, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq?view=azureadps-2.0#what-is-microsoft-doing-about-the-gaps-in-functionality-between-azure-ad-and-microsoft-graph-powershell-modules">we’re continuing to add functionality for managing Microsoft Entra ID with Microsoft Graph PowerShell</a> to ensure a seamless transition when you decide to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps?view=graph-powershell-1.0">migrate</a> from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Yes, Microsoft continues to support Azure AD B2C 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As announced previously, the name Azure AD B2C is not changing, nor is our commitment to the service and our customers. The service level agreement for Azure AD B2C remains unchanged, and we’ll continue investments to ensure security, availability, and reliability in both <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a>, as well as our next-generation solution for external identities, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/overview-customers-ciam">Microsoft Entra External ID</a>, now in public preview. You can learn more about getting started with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/customers/quickstart-trial-setup">External ID</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview">Azure AD B2C</a> in our documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Focusing on secure access for everyone, everywhere 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renaming of Azure AD represents a shift in how the identity and access management landscape has changed over time. You’ve gone from managing identities behind a firewall to fully enabling a complex fabric of trusted interactions so people can securely collaborate and be productive, while being increasingly under threat from attackers. Traditional identity and access management services aren’t enough anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe the Microsoft Entra ID name more accurately represents the multicloud and multiplatform functionality of the product, alleviates any confusion with the on-premises identity solution Active Directory, and creates a path to deliver a simpler way to protect every identity and secure every access point as we expand the Microsoft Entra identity and network access portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of where the family name of Microsoft Entra helps clarify functionality is Microsoft Entra <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview">Conditional Access</a> (formerly Azure AD Conditional Access). Conditional Access policies can now be consistently enforced and shared across identity and new security service edge (SSE) products:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a>. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/concept-universal-conditional-access">controls expanding to network traffic</a> — not just cloud applications — and policies based on traffic profiles — not just applications or actions — this cross-product feature now uses the unified identity and network access name: Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to innovate and expand our portfolio as digital environments expand, and access points become more diverse, so our customers can protect any access point with a holistic solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, all you need to remember is that the most comprehensive approach for securing access is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Ongoing commitment to our Microsoft Entra ID customers 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

New functionality and feature improvements help our customers become more secure, more effective, and more resilient, and that hasn’t stopped with the rename.

<blockquote><p>“Organisation identity is a parallel and just as valuable identity type as individual identity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>At IDM Europe 2023 in October Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, presented the facet of identity management that’s often overlooked – Organisational Identity. In this session overview, we delve into the importance of organisation identity, its impact, and how it’s poised to transform the digital landscape. Alternatively, watch the full 15-minute presentation in the video below.</p>
<p></p>
 The Significance of Organisational Identity 
<p>Individual identity has thus far taken the forefront in discussions about digital security. However, organisation identity is an equally valuable aspect of the broader identity landscape. To grasp this concept, it’s crucial to understand what organisational identity encompasses.</p>
 Defining Organisational Identity 
<p>Organisations come in various forms and structures, from social groups and families to contractual entities and legal corporations. Just as there are assurance levels associated with individual identities, the same holds true for organisation identities, ranging from low to high assurance levels. This is where the distinction between low assurance organisation identities, such as social groups, and high assurance ones, like legal entities, becomes evident.</p>
<p></p>
 Case Studies: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly 
<p>The significance of organisation identity is illustrated through a series of case studies.</p>
 The Good: 
<p>In an example from Ubisecure’s <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="Finnish government case study">Finnish government case study</a>, the combination of individual and organisational identities resulted in remarkable cost savings. By allowing organisation identities to be represented by highly assured individuals, the Tax Office achieved cost savings of 99%. This real-world case shows how organisation identity can lead to substantial financial benefits.</p>
 The Bad: 
<p>The vulnerability of organisation identity became apparent when Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter (or X as it’s known this week) led to the removal of verified organisation accounts. Fake accounts naturally emerged. Due to a tweet from a fake Eli Lilly account claiming false information, Eli Lilly saw a &gt;4% drop in the stock price.</p>
 The Ugly: 
<p>The 2008 financial crisis was partly driven by the complex world of collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). The interconnection of organisations within this financial web led to a catastrophic market collapse when triggered, serving as a stark reminder of the importance of transparent and accountable organisation identity in complex financial ecosystems.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) – A Key to Organisation Identity? 
<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) plays a central role in organisation identity. Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis by the Financial Stability Board, the LEI identifies legal entities and their ownership structures. As a globally recognised, highly assured organisation identity, the G20 and World Trade Organisation (WTO) support the LEI as a solution to the complexities of modern financial markets.</p>
 The Road to Widespread LEI Adoption 
<p>The adoption of the LEI is steadily growing, with a target of 20 million LEIs by 2027 set by the G20. This critical mass will promote its use across various industries and use cases. Several driving forces are pushing for the broader adoption of organisation identities, including the WTO’s focus on cross-border digital payments, changing regulations for electronic trade documents, and the integration of LEIs into financial transactions.</p>
 The Future of Digital Identity: Context Matters 
<p>Ubisecure’s vision for the future of digital identity management involves connecting highly assured organisation identities with strongly authenticated individual identities. This synergy allows us to understand who an individual is, whom they represent, and the rights and responsibilities associated with different contexts. The context in which identity operates is paramount, as it determines what an individual or organisation can do within a specific setting.</p>
<p>This session sheds light on the growing trend towards effective organisation identity and the critical role it plays in financial markets, security, and digital transactions. As we look to the future of digital identity management, the synergy between individual and organisation identities becomes increasingly vital.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>There are rare individuals who carve out spaces of brilliance wherever they tread. Vittorio Bertocci was one of those souls; a luminary whose impact resonated not only in the corridors of professional seminars but in the hearts of those fortunate to know him personally. Today, we mourn the loss of Vittorio, who, after a fierce battle with cancer, left a void that words alone cannot fill.</p>
<p>The European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference (EIC) was one of the many platforms where Vittorio shone brightly. With every keynote he delivered, his fervor for the Digital ID realm was palpable. He was not just a speaker who would deliver a rehearsed lecture. No, Vittorio was an artist, painting vivid tapestries of innovation, possibilities, and a future filled with secure digital identities.</p>
<p>Our whole team at KuppingerCole was privy to his genius, but more importantly, to his spirit. Every collaboration was a fusion of knowledge, passion, and a genuine desire to make a difference. That's who Vittorio was—a catalyst for change, a beacon for progress.</p>
<p>On a personal note, my friendship with Vittorio was one of those blessings. His laughter was infectious, his counsel invaluable, and his presence reassuring. In a world that often felt like an echo chamber of repetitive ideas, Vittorio’s voice was distinct—an Italian melody of originality and deep insight. Our conversations, be it on the latest trends in digital identity or simply recounting anecdotes from his home in Genova, were treasures.</p>
<p>But what truly made Vittorio stand out was his ability to connect on a human level. He wasn't just a technical maestro. He was compassionate, understanding, and had this uncanny knack to make anyone feel seen and heard. In the midst of conferences bustling with professionals, it was not uncommon to see Vittorio in deep conversation with a newcomer, instilling confidence and sharing wisdom.</p>
<p>The sorrow we feel is deep, not just as friends who will miss those enlightening chats over coffee but as a member of the Digital ID community. We've lost a guiding star. Vittorio's innovations weren't just about the next best product or solution; they were about creating a world where our digital selves were protected, honored, and seamlessly integrated into our real lives. His visions for the future were grand, yet grounded in an intimate understanding of the present.</p>
<p>Cancer may have taken Vittorio from us, but his legacy remains indelible. Every keynote, every workshop, every casual chat at the conference coffee stand is a testament to the man who believed in a digitally secure future and poured his soul into making it a reality.</p>
<p>It's often said that the brightest stars burn half as long, and perhaps that's true. Vittorio's light shone intensely, illuminating paths, sparking ideas, and warming hearts. In his absence, it's up to us to ensure that the trails he blazed are not left in darkness. Let's honor him by being torchbearers of his vision, and by embodying the same passion, dedication, and warmth that Vittorio exuded every day.</p>
<p>For now, as we grapple with this profound loss, let's remember Vittorio for the force of nature he was. Let's recount stories that made us laugh, lessons that spurred us forward, and moments when his sheer presence made everything seem right.</p>
<p>To Vittorio - the maestro, the mentor, the friend. Your journey may have ended, but your symphony plays on in the hearts and minds of everyone you touched.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, dear friend. You are deeply missed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Let`s keep on celebrating the enduring impact of Vittorio Bertocci's work. Therefore, we are making all of Vittorio’s talks at the European Identity and Cloud Conference publicly available. Watch them, they are worth every single minute.</p>

 Als verhuurder wil je snel én uitvoerig screenen of een huurder geschikt is. Zo kun je inschatten of iemand de huur kan betalen, voorkom je fraude en doorzie je risico’s op overlast.

Maar een huurderscheck is een tijdrovend proces voor zowel woningcorporaties als kandidaat-huurders. Er komen allerlei documenten bij kijken die de huurder ook nog op een specifieke manier moet aanleveren. Regelmatig gaan er dan ook dingen mis, met veel tijdverlies, frustratie, ontevredenheid en soms zelfs problemen tot gevolg.</p>

<p>How do you create a community around a protocol?</p><p>That was the challenge Daniel Norman, developer advocate for <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, faced. Daniel was not new to the field. Before working for Protocol Labs, he was a developer advocate at Prisma and a Web3 engineer at Aragon. Prior to entering the P2P and distributed systems space, Daniel worked in SaSS and, therefore, was aware of the questions and challenges Web2 developers would face transitioning into Web3. </p><p>He needed to provide resources to developers so they could be successful. These resources had to be engaging and scalable, where developers could learn key concepts and achieve something. Maybe they spin up an app or install IPFS on their computer - whatever it is, they must walk away with a sense of accomplishment.</p> Building a Demo App <p>With this in mind, Daniel created a <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/universal-connectivity">demo chat app</a> that utilized <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>. Libp2p provides the foundational networking infrastructure and protocols that enable IPFS nodes to communicate, discover each other, and form a decentralized and resilient network for sharing and distributing content. A chat demo is the perfect project for explaining how IPFS works when sending information to other nodes in the network.</p><p>The demo was beginner-friendly and implemented the most <a href="https://connectivity.libp2p.io/">novel transport protocols</a> at the time compared to other example apps. Libp2p is used in many ecosystems beyond IPFS, including Ethereum, Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polkadot, so developers who might have been familiar with another ecosystem were able to transition nicely into IPFS through this exercise. As a result, the demo was a successful tool for both Web2 and Web3 devs alike. </p> Awesome IPFS <p>Today's IPFS ecosystem is vast, with hundreds of projects building on the protocol. And like any good ecosystem, it needs cultivating. Daniel views himself as a gardener in the IPFS ecosystem - there to keep it healthy and thriving. He does this through demos, as previously mentioned, and through shooting videos, hosting events, building relationships, and developing written resources. </p><p>One of those written resources is <a href="https://awesome.ipfs.tech/?utm_content=265643364&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-3030006159">Awesome IPFS</a>. Awesome IPFS is a community-generated collection of projects, tools, implementations, services, platforms, and more, all built on the IPFS protocol. Daniel is one of the key maintainers (another is Fission's CEO and Founder, Boris Mann!) and helps ensure that the repo is up-to-date. </p>   Challenges in Cultivating a Community <p>While these resources are great for introducing developers to IPFS, they take time and energy to maintain. For example, inactive projects must be removed from the list and dependencies monitored so that the IPFS Awesome resource remains useful. </p><p>There need to be fair guidelines for platforming and showcasing projects so that both existing and new projects get fair and equal access to marketing opportunities. </p><p>Working with multiple companies, organizations, and people is also key, as diversity only strengthens the ecosystem. It's important that everyone feels heard and empowered to contribute.</p> Key Takeaways <p>If you're interested in building a community around your tech product, here are some key tips that Daniel has learned over the years:</p>  Be honest and transparent. Don't over-promise or mislead interested parties.  Avoid too much technical jargon. People don't have the time or energy to sort through all of that when first being introduced to your project.  Don't create a closed community. Ensure everyone feels welcome and make contributing and asking questions easy and enjoyable.  Clearly communicate, especially in your writing. Most people are not native English speakers, so keep your writing concise and accessible.  <p>Learn more about IPFS by joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/ipfs">IPFS Discord</a> community. Heading to Istanbul for LabWeek23 or Devconnect? Don't miss <a href="https://istanbul2023.ipfsconnect.org/">IPFS Connect</a>, an all-day event filled with lightning talks, presentations, workshops, and more led by experienced builders.</p><p>And don't forget to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel2color">Daniel</a> for exciting resources and news from the IPFS ecosystem.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts recently found itself in the midst of a major cybersecurity incident that not only crippled its operations but also exposed sensitive customer data. The sophisticated attack orchestrated by a group known as Scattered Spider employed social engineering to the IT department to reset credentials. The attackers then gained access to the SSO, raised their identity credentials to super user level and then systematically got into other systems.</p> 
<p>The cyberattack cost MGM over $100 million according to its <a href="http://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000119312523251667/d461062d8k.htm">FORM 8-K filing</a> with the SEC.</p> 
<p>While the attack chain involved multiple steps, exploiting several points of failure, the initial attack vector was low tech and all too common. We look at what happened and how organizations can protect themselves from these increasingly prevalent attacks.</p> 
 Anatomy of the Attack: Unraveling Scattered Spider's Web  
<p>On September 11, MGM Resorts announced a "cybersecurity issue" affecting its systems, prompting a shutdown to protect data integrity. Reports surfaced that essential services, from hotel room access to slot machines, were offline, leading to resort staff shifting to manual processes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It wasn't until October 5 that the true extent of the breach came to light. Personally identifiable&nbsp; information (PII), had been compromised. This same information was encrypted and a ransomware demand was made.</p> 
<p>Scattered Spider, the group claiming responsibility (the same group involved in breaching Clorox), demonstrated a proficiency in social engineering, specializing in voice phishing, or "vishing" — exploiting human vulnerability through convincing phone calls. The hackers allegedly gained access to MGM's systems by impersonating an employee. Utilizing publicly available information found on LinkedIn and other social platforms, they targeted the IT help desk, manipulating their way into obtaining credentials. The attackers utilized ransomware-as-a-service to encrypt MGM's data.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Key Lessons  
<p>This incident underscores the vulnerability of even well-established organizations to social engineering and identity-related attacks. Most IT services desks/help desks are short-staffed, and dealing with large volumes of calls, many of which are related to password or MFA issues. In the case of MGM Resorts, the attackers exploited human nature and publicly available information to trick IT service desk personnel and gain the credentials necessary to simply login as a legitimate employee. From there they were able to breach multiple systems and gain command and control of the entire organization.</p> 
 Identity Assurance for the Entire Identity Lifecycle  
<p>Human nature will always be the weakest point in any system — the 2023 Verizon DBIR found the human element to be a factor in 74% of all breaches. The MGM attack underscores the need for a comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> approach that secures the modern user lifecycle and addresses the Achilles heel of current authentication and identity verification processes. Organizations need to ensure they can trust that somebody is who they claim to be at all times — when that call to the service desk comes through, the staff responding must be absolutely certain that the person they are speaking to is the legitimate holder of that identity. If, for example, they request access through a new device or credential reset, there must be a secure, efficient way to do so.</p> 
<p>A complete Identity Assurance approach unites strong passkey-based authentication, continuous risk monitoring and intelligent identity verification into a comprehensive solution.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Authentication  
<p>Deploying passwordless, phishing resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds a crucial layer of security. Eliminating traditional passwords and adopting <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication methods</a>, such as biometrics, security tokens, or mobile-based authentication, could have thwarted the MGM attackers. Passwords are often the weakest link, and removing them from the equation reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p> 
 Continuous Risk Monitoring  
<p>Threat vectors and risk levels change constantly. Risk signals and telemetry from a broad variety of sources must be continuously monitored and used to trigger appropriate authentication and verification actions. These should include various device and browser signals, user behavior anomalies and information from the broader security ecosystem.</p> 
 Identity Verification  
<p>Simply put, identity verification helps ensure that someone is who they say they are at all times. It can eliminate many of the social engineering tactics currently being used. It should meet the unique needs of the population in question whether workforce or consumer. This requires a multi-verification approach that includes but is not limited to AI, chat, video, face recognition and other cutting-edge technologies to create a seamless and secure method of confirming the individuals’ identities — and re-verifying them at critical moments in time. This would eliminate the vishing attack vector which is based on implied and unreliable trust without a specific and comprehensive verification methodology.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here’s an example of intelligent identity verification in action:</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
 Protecting Against Helpdesk Social Engineering and Other Identity Attacks  
<p>The MGM Resorts cyber incident serves as a stark reminder that no organization is immune to cyber threats, regardless of its size or industry. As cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, it is imperative for businesses to stay ahead by implementing advanced security measures. Identity verification and passwordless authentication can stand as formidable defense against social engineering and other identity-related attacks, providing a robust protection for organizations, their systems, and their data. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform">HYPR Identity Assurance</a> protects the entire lifecycle and includes HYPR Affirm, the only <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification solution</a> designed specifically for the workforce.

				  Verifiable credentials allow you to cryptographically verify who issued information, and they allow you to know if that information has been tampered with. But what does this mean in a practical sense?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Recently our team was asked a question that we encounter, in different forms, all the time: “Well, what can we do with verifiable credentials?” Or, “Why would we want them?” The answer is so broad that we, typically, narrow it down by industry and offer some examples that make sense for that particular customer.</p>
<p>But really the answer is quite simple:</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to cryptographically verify who issued data, and they allow you to know if that data has been changed or tampered with.</p>
<p>In practical terms this means that, assuming the data has not been changed, you can trust the data as much as you trust the source. Once you have data that you know has not been altered, from a source you trust, the possibilities are close to endless, and our team had some fun contributing a — by no means exhaustive — list of examples of how you can use this technology across industries.</p>
 In the Public Sector 
<p>Replace your passwords with credentials<br>Unlike passwords, credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied, and don’t require your employees to remember them.</p>
<p>Access management<br>Both physical and digital access management can be done through credentials for enhanced security — and unlike access cards, credentials cannot be lost, stolen, or copied.</p>
<p>Manage social and welfare programs<br>By issuing each citizen a credential you can reduce fraud in aid / benefits applications.</p>
<p>Employment authorization<br>Ensure that applicants are eligible to work.</p>
<p>Manage travel<br>Verifiable credentials can replace passports and offer a faster, more secure way to cross borders.</p>
<p>Replace driver’s licenses<br>These licenses would be impossible to fake and offer a fast way to provide only the identity information necessary when needed.</p>
<p>Replace important personal documents<br>Marriage licenses, death certificates, social security information could all be digitized and more secure than a paper document that can be lost or damaged.</p>
<p>Proof of residency<br>By using credentials you could automate parts of the residency process and quickly verify status.</p>
<p>First responder credentials<br>Quickly ensure only authorized personnel are allowed access to emergency areas.</p>
<p>Replacement permits<br>Digitizing permits would speed up the process for checking that they are up to date and could notify holders when they are about to expire and need to be renewed.</p>
<p>Professional licenses<br>Know for certain that your doctor or lawyer is licensed, and allow the end customer to verify their credentials for themselves.</p>
<p>Certifications<br>Keep your certifications up to date and easily share them, as opposed to keeping them safe in a box somewhere.</p>
<p>Manage age restricted substances<br>By sharing identification through a credential you can be more confident that only people that are old enough are buying restricted products.</p>
 Healthcare 
<p>Access management<br>Better track who has access to what areas / controlled substances.</p>
<p>Patient health data<br>Remove the need for contacting a third party for medical history, have patients hold it themselves securely on a credential or be able to provide consent for other providers to access it.</p>
<p>Store insurance information<br>No more paper cards that can be lost or forgotten; instead, hold quickly transferable information in a credential.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>No more storing private patient information at the hospital, making it a target for bad actors. All personal identifying data should be stored with the patient, removing the need for storing or deleting data in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>Enhance security<br>Verifiable credentials will let you know if their information has been copied, meaning even if they are obtained by bad actors they cannot use them without the system knowing and denying access.</p>
<p>Data sharing<br>The patient can choose to securely share only the data they deem necessary with the healthcare provider.</p>
 Travel and hospitality 
<p>Use a Digital Travel Credential<br>Scan and transform your passport into a verifiable credential (with liveness and biometric assurance) for check in and border crossing.</p>
<p>Manage check-in<br>Customers can pre fill out any information needed for their stay, recurring only a quick scan at the front desk to check in at a hotel or potentially just issuing digital room keys without a check in.</p>
<p>Digital room keys<br>Securely issue and revoke room keys directly to customers, reducing time spent at the front desk.</p>
<p>Store tickets on a credential<br>You can manage your airport experience through a credential, storing boarding pass info, passport info, and visa details in a way that is easily shareable.</p>
<p>Manage loyalty programs<br>Verified loyalty program holders can be offered special deals, quick and easy lounge access and more.</p>
<p>Reduce fraud<br>Credentials will immediately alert you if any information presented is fraudulent.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>Remove the need to store any customer information locally, which also removes the need to delete it in a regulatory compliant way.</p>
<p>Reduce the stress of travel<br>When traveling is easy and everything a traveler needs is accessible through one place on their phone they are more likely to do it more.</p>
<p>Reduce lines<br>A quick scan keeps the line moving much faster than a person checking every ID and document.</p>
 Financial services 
<p>Reduce fraud<br>Use verifiable credentials for frictionless, mutual authentication before any data is shared. A bank is able to cryptographically authenticate that it is interacting with a real account holder, and the account holder is able to authenticate that he or she is interacting with their bank.</p>
<p>Reuse KYC information<br>Credentials can be configured to store the information required for more complex financial transactions and a KYC credential is a way for a bank or its partners to reuse and share this information. If a third party trusts the original bank’s KYC process, they can trust the veracity of the KYC credential.</p>
<p>Provide more secure customer access<br>The customer can securely access their account without a username or password.</p>
<p>Use as a credit card<br>Credit card information can be put into a verifiable credential; virtual CC numbers can be used; temporary cards for one-time use can be issued as a credential.</p>
<p>Reduce the time necessary for larger transactions<br>Credentials remove the need to contact third parties to verify funds.</p>
<p>Data sharing<br>Know that any data shared with or between your team can be trusted.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>The customer can choose to disclose only the information necessary for a transaction, removing the need to securely store or delete customer information.</p>
 Retail 
<p>Track the origins of products<br>A verifiable credential can track a product back to who created it and let you know if something is a knock-off.</p>
<p>Provide better customer retention programs<br>Customer credentials allow you to better know who is shopping with you or visiting your store.</p>
<p>Employee management<br>Easily set which employees can access certain areas, manage payroll, or time clocks.</p>
<p>Mitigate chargeback fraud<br>Require pre-authorization of payments through verifiable credentials</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>No need to store customer personal data in a regulatory compliant way, they will store it locally on their credential.</p>
 Education 
<p>Student awards and certificates<br>Quickly issue and securely store any awards a student receives from the school.</p>
<p>Student access management<br>Easily issue or revoke access to buildings or digital assets.</p>
<p>Diplomas<br>Issue verifiable certificates of completion that can be quickly shared with prospective employers, removing the need to contact the school.</p>
<p>School issued permits<br>Quickly issue and check parking permits, bike permits, and residential permits etc.</p>
<p>Reduce liability<br>Unlike passwords or keys these credentials can’t be misplaced, stolen, or copied, so you can be more confident that only students have access to school areas.</p>
<p>Reduce student stress<br>You can store all the classes a student has completed on a credential, streamlining the process for knowing which classes they are eligible to take next.</p>
<p>Faster data sharing<br>All the data a student accumulates through the education process can be stored on one credential, removing the need to look back through paper records.</p>
<p>As you can see this list very quickly stretches on — and we only briefly covered 6 industries! To oversimplify, if you would like to be able to immediately act on your data, reduce the liability of storing customer information, and have more confidence in your security, it may be time to look into verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>If you’re on the fence, or have questions about the technology our team would be happy to talk you through some options applicable to your organization. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch here.</a></p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>What is generative AI? This week Russ Cohn, from IDVerse has joined us to discuss generative AI and deepfakes and the threat this imposes on businesses and consumers for their digital identities. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, Generative Artificial Intelligence is a topic that has been, I believe on most of our radars in the last 12 months, particularly. And there are amazing things going on. But also, we know that the bad guys are also using those tools. And one of those is related to deepfakes that are being used to cheat the identity verification system having existing until now.</p>
<p>So, to see how we are going to solve those problems in identity verification, these newer problems, we have a special guest today who is Russ Cohn. He is the go-to market for IDVerse, a company which provides online identification technology for businesses in the digital economy.</p>
<p>Russ has spent more than 20 years scaling businesses of all sizes by delivering successful growth strategies across the UK, EMEA, and US markets, within fast-paced and high-growth online media, fraud, identity, SaaS, e-commerce, and data-driven technology solutions. His strong tech knowledge is coupled with deep operational and commercial experience building things with SaaS, advertising and marketing technology driven revenue models.</p>
<p>Hello, Russ.</p>
<p>Russ Cohn: Hello, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Happy to have you here.</p>
<p>Russ: Thank you. Very glad to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. It’s great to have you here. And we’ll talk about the deepfakes and how the newest practices in identity verification are solving these problems. So, let’s start, let’s talk about digital identity, Russ.</p>
<p>So first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, your story. Tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Russ: Absolutely. I am fairly new to identity. I’ve only really started in the industry probably just over three years ago. I was the first international employee of OCR Labs, which is we recently rebranded to IDVerse, but I joined about three years ago. We’ve since then built the international team to over half the company, and we continue to grow in EMEA and the US.</p>
<p>As a background, I’m a marketer, a commercial leader, investor. I’ve spent probably over 20 years in technology-driven companies of all sizes. And I was lucky enough to join Google very early on, and there were 20 people in the UK, and 600 people around the world. And I grew up with them a little bit, and I left there with 65,000 people. So, I’ve got a fairly good experience at scanning companies and have invested and advised companies since then.</p>
<p>I’m now, as I said at IDVerse. And I’m focused on the go-to market. So, helping them globally, to take our products and execute them in the best possible areas and help our customers with the most cutting-edge technology to drive identity verification, make it effortless. Obviously, through the use of our sophisticated technologies and techniques, including Generative AI.</p>
<p>I’m excited about the opportunity for identity verification, as the need for verified trusted identities has grown exponentially, globally, really, since the pandemic. And with digital growing at such a phenomenal rate as well, we’re now living in a mobile-first world, and we need the right kind of identity verification to support that growth.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, let’s go to some basics. For someone who has heard about that term, Generative AI and still is not so clear what it is, particularly. Could you tell us what is that? What is Generative AI?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, sure, I think, you know, everybody is talking about ChatGPT and Bard and it’s brought these techniques, the AI techniques to the public, and we can’t get enough of them. But everyone is using ChatGPT and Bard, etc to learn more, do their jobs better, find new facts. It’s pretty addictive and very, very useful but still at the at the fairly early stage.</p>
<p>So Generative AI, short for Generative Artificial Intelligence refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems and techniques that focus on generating new content or data rather than simply recognising patterns or making decisions based on existing data. Now these systems are designed to create original content that resembles human created data such as images, music, texts, videos, and more.</p>
<p>I use Spotify extensively. I’m sure most people do. And I’ve got an AI system on there now a couple months ago that’s going through my music catalogue in my background and choosing the right music based on my tastes. Generative AI models are generally trained on large datasets, and they learn to understand the underlying patterns and structures within the data.</p>
<p>So once trained, they can produce new examples that are similar to the data they were exposed to during their training. These models are capable of generating content that didn’t exist in the original dataset, making them a very powerful tool for creative tasks in content creation. Now at IDVerse, we’ve been doing Generative AI for a long time, probably since the start, seven or eight years ago.</p>
<p>And we use a technique, a very familiar technique called Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, I’m sure a lot of your audience will be familiar with. Now GANs, just to go back to basics, consists of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. These are trained together in a competitive manner. The generator creates the synthetic data, and the discriminative task is to differentiate between the real and the generated data.</p>
<p>So, the competition between the two networks leads to the generation of increasingly realistic content, which we see everywhere in videos, photos, documents, et cetera. Now, we’ve trained millions of synthetic and real documents and millions and millions of synthetic faces using these techniques. For us, just to be clear, we only use ethically sourced or fair source data for face biometric, particularly in the training. This refers to the facial recognition datasets collected and used in a manner that upholds strict ethical standards and respects individual’s privacy, consent and fairness.</p>
<p>Such data is obtained transparently with informed consent, minimal intrusion and efforts to mitigate bias. So, these measures ensure the responsible and equitable use of biometric technology. In the context of facial identity verification, training data refers to the specialised datasets of facial images used to train the machine learning algorithm, or deep neural networks that are responsible for recognising and verifying individual’s identities based on their facial features.</p>
<p>So that’s quite a mouthful. Hopefully, that gives you some context. But this is how we look at Generative AI in identity verification.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you for that introduction. Of course, in one of the products of this type of Generative AI, in related tools are deepfakes that we are seeing more often, sometimes we saw that only for, like, say celebrities or famous people. But now, they can be used to attack me or to attack you, actually anybody right?</p>
<p>So, tell us how the use of deepfakes is a threat, a real threat for both consumers and businesses?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, absolutely. I think they are a massive threat as the rise of Gen AI, and you touched on it, &nbsp;fraudsters use the same if not better techniques than we do, or many companies do. And they are very, very good at surging ahead of these technologies and finding ways to create very realistic synthetic identities to both impersonate real people, as well as to create brand new identities of people who actually don’t even exist in real life.</p>
<p>And so, while that’s exciting as we talk about Web3 and avatars and these opportunities and possibilities, I think both consumers and businesses will continue to fall victim to many of the risks out there, unless measures are taken to prevent this.</p>
<p>Now, I just want to highlight a couple of examples of these like disinformation and fake news, right? So, creating videos of public figures, you can grab off Facebook or YouTube, and replicate those and make them do things that they never did. That can be exploited to spread false information.</p>
<p>This can incite conflicts and it can really manipulate public opinion. For us, we see and obviously, we’re very close to and care a lot about frauds and scams, so businesses and consumers of course, can – in the UK particularly we have a huge fraud problem. And we see a lot of deepfake base scams that can impersonate company executives, trusted individuals, they can deceive employees or the customers who can make them reveal sensitive information for financial transactions.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some of that just recently with MGM in the US in this recent breach. We don’t know it exactly, but we do know, I think somebody, an employee was actually targeted. This can cause you know I think like reputation damage of people, you know, politicians, businesses and people, fake videos and audio can be created. To endorse a product or not support it and that can create problems. And of course, the things we care about a lot of, identity theft, right?</p>
<p>And deepfakes can be used to impersonate individuals leading to identity theft. This may result in unauthorised access to personal data or systems. And of course, manipulation in financial markets, personal bank accounts, breaches of banks. So, this can cause big issues like privacy concerns, security threats and erosion of trust, through the wide use of this, and internal security problems for businesses, and privacy for people when they violated, and their identities are stolen.</p>
<p>So, it’s very, very important that we understand these threats and start to mitigate and create ways of helping to support and stop these practices.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you already explained some cases in which these criminals are already targeting the identification system that has been existing in the last years. If we focus on these services that are today and have been protecting us or helping us in identifying people in the last years. So, what are these – the biggest pain points or the weaknesses that they are being attacked by these criminals?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, I mean, there’s a lot of weakness in existing systems, which can come across in the fact that vendors don’t disclose, for example, that they don’t use their own technology, and they can’t always deliver on their promises. So, I think a lack of global document coverage, old style techniques like templating exclusion, like racial bias, gender and age in these poorly designed systems can cause huge problems. And systems that don’t have the ability to understand where these attacks are coming from with these synthetic IDs.</p>
<p>We create all of our own tech in-house. So, we don’t use external vendors to drive our fully automated solutions. So, we feel pretty confident. But they are, as you mentioned, these legacy systems that we’ve relied on, that aren’t necessarily up to speed. We’ve seen, from a pain point of view, is badly trained human spotters in remote locations, for example. So, some people in the industry and vendors use those, this can cause slow response times, and they can’t keep up with the standards and the technology that’s being used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>And also, the biometrics of people that are not real. So, it’s very difficult for them to keep up. And then, we’ve seen an issue around a lot of bias or differentials in the natural bias that’s in previous ID systems designed by, traditionally older white male engineers. And that’s a problem because these biases are built into these systems. And the humans who are evaluating physical documents, depending on where and how and what can inflict their own biases on age, gender, and race as well.</p>
<p>Now, this can slow down experiences for customers, as they take a lot longer. And of course, they aren’t as accurate, you know, humans can’t scale. And so, technology can do a lot of that heavy lifting, and can solve a lot of that. And you can still have humans for critical tasks, but it’s important that you use technology to identify these gaps.</p>
<p>In fact, we ran a study a few months ago with an external testing company called BixeLabs of 1500 subjects, male, female and transgender, across eight regions in the world for our facial biometrics. And we came back with zero bias on either race or gender on the facial biometrics. So, it’s pretty important that businesses start to use, and people start to get comfortable with one of the strongest, probably the strongest biometric there is for lots of actions that we do take in our everyday lives, whether it’s on a personal or work basis.</p>
<p>And I think that the other things that are challenging for us in the identity space is we see a lot of unethically sourced based biometrics, right? And that can refer to the acquisition usage or distribution of these, that can violate privacy, I mentioned earlier consent or ethics.</p>
<p>And these practices really can result in privacy infringements, discrimination, social harm and legal issues. And some examples of that are data scraping and profiling, lack of informed consent, data breaches, of course, we’ve seen that recently and frequently, deepfakes as we talked about and manipulation of people, government surveillance, employment discrimination. These are big issues.</p>
<p>And I think the lack of unified government standards around these things is also difficult. And it’s important that people use the latest technologies like computer vision and Generative AI to start, to be able to scale and address some of these issues and keep users and businesses safe going forward. But those are definitely some of the issues that we’ve seen accumulate over the last few years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, I can see there are quite a few. And how these more recent generation of identity verification system that are working together with Generative AI. So, if you can tell us a bit of the how, how they are different to the previous products, and how they are tackling these problems?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, as I expressed in some of the technologies that we use, I mean, training data for Gen AI, for example, if you think of it, if I can frame it in like nutritional labels like food, right? So, you’re feeding a machine, essentially. And so that training data should come with some sort of nutritional label, and to know what the macro nutrients will affect performance. So, you know, it’s important that when using Gen AI, you understand that the nutritional makeup of their training data, supply chain transparency, where do you get their data from, for example.</p>
<p>But it’s important, these techniques are able to detect the proliferation of these fake documents. I think digital identity is becoming more and more, of course, prolific and governments are starting to bring onboard connectivity into these digital identity databases that are able to verify customers in a much more robust way than potentially documents were.</p>
<p>So, I think we’ll see that constant trend of digitisation of technology, mobile-first, wallets, and of course, documentation that will become digital will make life a little bit easier. But, in order to protect themselves, consumers and businesses really need to think about what they can do to stop and be vigilant, right?</p>
<p>So, I think consumers need to educate themselves. They need to use things like password protection and protect their devices and be aware of things like phishing tactics in social media and email. So, we can do as much as we can for businesses, but I think businesses need to invest in these systems because they are stronger, the security measures are stronger, and will help protect them and their customers ultimately.</p>
<p>I think the differences that we see, we believe facial biometrics is a very, very strong and has been proven externally through, you know, NIST iBeta certification, for example, we have a 99.998 certification of liveness biometrics, I mentioned the inclusion and lack of racial bias. If you want to capture and work with people of all races, all genders, all colours across the world, it’s important to use systems that are inclusive, otherwise, you’ll end up discriminating and losing customers.</p>
<p>So, it is important to make these investments into these systems to help protect your business and help protect the consumers behind that. But ultimately, consumers have to also be educated themselves. They have to think about what they’re doing and be aware of things that are out of the ordinary or suspicious, unsolicited requests, for example. And then lastly, I think, you know, government needs to engage in some sort of public dialogue as well to help consumers about understanding what they’re doing in these initiatives.</p>
<p>And government needs to work with business as well to inform the public about things like biometric technology, ethical implications, and why they should be using these. But ultimately, there should be some ethical guidelines and review boards to be able to support the usage of this new technology that’s coming at us at such a pace. It’s really strong, really powerful and really useful.</p>
<p>But there have to be some guardrails around that, and I think it’s going to take a collective effort from consumers, businesses and government to get us there.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned, for instance, a liveness detection that is one of the ways that this identity verification tools are checking that the person is a real person moving in front of the camera. In terms of the end user, so when the end user is in front of this identity verification system that are based on Generative AI, so let’s say user experience is similar, is so how transparent or is different?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, I think, look, with facial recognition, for example, and the techniques we use in identifying people when they’re going through the process of verifying themselves or for account access or re-authentication, no personal data is stored. So, the use of those biometrics is the ability to give people a robust way to prove themselves and their proof of life, if you will, when doing a particular action.</p>
<p>And I think what’s been missing in the past is people have accepted a document which could or could not belong to that person to be the valid form of identity. The reason why identity documents around the world had been the standard is there was always a picture of your face on that document.</p>
<p>So, you had a passport or driver’s license, you could see it was you in a sense. So, with liveness, people are protected the same way as using phones to open up access to your phone and to those systems. But these systems are tested and there is no personal data. People should feel very comfortable that the data that they’re using to generate that action is protected and their own in terms of doing that.</p>
<p>We’re just using technology to be able to verify that that person is live and present, and is not a deepfake, was not a synthetic ID. Because what we see a lot is these presentation attacks when people are using video footage that are grabbed from external sources, for example, to try and fake systems or try and trick systems that they are actually live and present.</p>
<p>But we are able to detect these digital footprints and be able to detect using multiple sources of multiple techniques on the mobile phone that we build software for that that person is live and present and is presenting the document that they say they are in order to verify themselves.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you, for explaining better how it worked for users. So, it’s simple for users. It’s not more complicated.</p>
<p>Russ: Simple and seamless and quick as well. It’s not more complicated. It’s less complicated, in fact, right? So, when you presented with it – there has to be a trust of course in the environment that you’re doing, and then providing your face to do that.</p>
<p>But ultimately, it’s safer and quicker, and ultimately more secure than any sort of biometric that they might have used previously.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s true. You mentioned also faster sometimes I think, being in front of these systems and yeah you are, waiting a little bit in front of the camera, right until it processes.</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, it depends on the speed and the connectivity in the region you’re in, and it might be the phone and your mobile network, for example. But we account for all of that in the software that we design in helping people to process that. So, we shoot like a live stream video, and we take the best shots out of about 100, 120 frames that we shoot out of that video. It’s a very quick two or three second capture, and we’re able to compare the best quality face to the document that’s presented in this process.</p>
<p>Now, we can account for age, facial degradation, loss of hair, glasses, et cetera because we are looking at the underlying structure of someone’s face when doing that. So, we’re 3D mapping essentially that person’s face, and are able to then tell against the original document that’s presented if that person is the same person.</p>
<p>And that you can’t do, it’s very hard to do with humans, for example. And that’s why technology can do a lot of this lifting very, very quickly. We can do it in seconds and verify the person against very old very age documents or changes to their facial structures. And so, we’re very excited about how these techniques can verify people to the grade that I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, it sounds like there’s a lot of innovation hearing what you’re talking, you are describing. So, what we say looking at the future, so what is the future of Generative AI in identity verification?</p>
<p>Russ: We were excited about Gen AI’s ability to create these huge datasets of synthetic personas, because it’s going to help prevent fraudsters trying to use this synthetically created people and documents that they create to trick and penetrate low grade systems.</p>
<p>And the more people we can support, the more businesses we can get our technology into, the more we can stop this the synthetic IDs and penetration attacks that are happening. And we’ve seen the velocity of these increase as we see better and better tools and faster processing time to be able to do this.</p>
<p>So, the ability to cover the identities of the world’s population through technology and creating inclusivity for all ethnicities, all genders, means that people can be granted access regardless of where they live, what device they’re using, what colour they are, what gender they are.</p>
<p>So, we’re very excited about how Gen AI can train and help people. And again, this is all ethically sourced data, right? So, we didn’t go and grab it elsewhere. It’s very hard to get in front of tens of millions of faces of variations of age and, again, colour, ethnicity, gender, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, Gen AI really helps us to do that, I think detection tools. So, developing and using advanced technology like Gen AI to detect this deepfake content can be crucial to mitigate the potential harmful effects that might come from that. Authentication mechanisms. So, implementing strong authentication, like facial can help, again, verify the identity of individuals and reduce that risk of impersonation.</p>
<p>So, trust has to be ensured that it’s in place there. And of course, eliminating frauds and scams, so businesses and consumers fall victim to deepfake base scams and others every day.&nbsp; For instance, a scammer can impersonate a company executive, as I said, and deceive employees into revealing sensitive information or maybe making financial transactions.</p>
<p>So, we want to stop fraud at the door. We want to stop fraud internally, externally. And we want to help protect businesses and their customers, whether their business or consumers from the rising threat of what’s coming on synthetic identities and the scale of using Generative AI at the fraudster level.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds good. Final question, for all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Russ: Yeah, look, there are a lot to choose from. I think the one action from my opinion, maybe is – you’ve got to think like we’re living in a mobile-first world, right? And Gen AI solutions, as we’ve talked about are surging.</p>
<p>So, the action I would take is take the time to speak to your fellow executives and to the teams and to the people inside your business and understand how identity is currently viewed in your approach to your people, your processes, your security, your products and your customers. Where I sit and where we sit, is we are seeing the velocity increase of identity usage across the world.</p>
<p>Governments are enforcing and implementing more and more identity standards in order to control obviously, governmental services. And so, it’s important that people think about identity for their own businesses. It’s going to become critical to protect them and their customers. They need to think about everything from employee onboarding, how well you know your employee and your customers.</p>
<p>And of course, ultimately, what we’re all achieving, or trying to achieve in digital is improving user experiences, anything from onboarding to account management, to customer services interaction. So, it’s everything that your customer, your employee might touch within your business, potentially has something to do with identity. And the better you know the people in your business and your customers, I think, the better positioned you’re going to be to be able to not only stop these threats but take advantage of beating your competition by staying ahead and knowing your customer much better.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, thank you very much, Russ, for all this very interesting conversation about how Generative AI is going to help us for the identity verification now and in the future.</p>
<p>So, for the ones listening to us who would like to know more about you or get in touch with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Russ: Yes, thank you again, for the time letting me talk about something we, you know, and I’m very passionate about and obviously we’re very passionate about fraud and particularly technology.</p>
<p>If they want to get a hold of me, I’m on LinkedIn, you know, Russ Cohn, C-O-H-N. IDVerse.com has a repository of amazing content and information and thought leadership around a lot of these areas, so please take your time to look across the site. And if you want to get in touch with us, there’s lots of ways to do that on the site.</p>
<p>So, look forward to seeing and speaking with anybody who’s interested in learning more about IDVerse and about – chatting about fraud and identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thank you very much, Russ. And all the best.</p>
<p>Russ: Thank you, Oscar. Appreciate the time.</p>

  <p>A Zero Trust breach prevention strategy based on user risk is critical for organizations in today's digital landscape. However, managing user risks in hybrid environments has posed several challenges. Today, we’re making it easier to manage user risk in hybrid environments in Microsoft Entra ID Protection (formerly Azure AD Identity Protection) – on-premises password change can now automatically remediate user risk! This feature is now in public preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we recommend mastering password changes in Entra ID to take advantage of Password Protection, hybrid customers who do password changes on-premises found it challenging to enable user risk policies. Users would get blocked when becoming risky and could not self-remediate by resetting passwords on-premises because the password change wasn’t visible to Entra ID, and so couldn’t dismiss the risk. This has resulted in a build-up of users marked at risk who may or may not have changed their passwords on-prem, making it challenging for some customers to take advantage of Entra ID Protection signals, and to leverage risk-based policies to protect their hybrid tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, we’re introducing the new setting called "Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk" in Entra ID Protection. Customers that have Password Hash Synchronization enabled on their tenants can now enable this setting. When enabled, users’ risks will be automatically remediated when their passwords are changed on-premises, and customers can confidently deploy user risk policy to effectively protect their hybrid users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enhancement empowers our customers with two main advantages:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Efficient Remediation: With this capability, risky hybrid users can efficiently self-remediate without manual interventions from administrators, reducing the administrative burden. When a password is changed on-premises, user risk will be automatically remediated within Entra ID Protection, bringing the user to a safe state. 
 Proactive Security: Organizations can now proactively deploy user risk policies that require password changes to confidently protect their hybrid users and environments. This proactive approach strengthens your organization's security posture, simplifies security management with access control policies while ensuring that user risks are promptly addressed, even in complex hybrid environments. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable the “Allow on-premises password change to reset user risk” setting today in <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/IdentityProtectionMenuBlade/~/OverviewNew">Identity Protection - Microsoft Entra admin center</a> and visit <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock">Remediate risks and unblock users in Azure AD Identity Protection</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>A new method for controlling and confirming digital identities is emerging: distributed digital identity (DDI). By removing the need for a single authoritative source, DDI empowers users to take charge of their digital identities and reduces their dependence on centralized structures.</p>
 The Evolution of Identity Verification 
<p>In the tapestry of human history, identity verification methods have constantly evolved, with each era bringing forth innovations to validate one’s credentials. From clay tablets to holographic passports, the quest for foolproof identification is an age-old journey.</p>
<p>Historically, physical documents, such as birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and passports, were the gold standards for verifying identity. These paper-based systems, although practical, were cumbersome, often leading to administrative bottlenecks and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>With technological advancements, the shift was evident. Digital platforms started introducing usernames, passwords, and biometric verifications. This transition streamlined many processes, enabling real-time verifications and instant service access.</p>
<p>Centralized identity systems, while efficient, are susceptible to various vulnerabilities. They create a concentrated data storehouse, becoming a prime target for cyber-attacks. Moreover, these systems often grapple with privacy and data misuse concerns, leading to a growing user mistrust.</p>
<p>As we journeyed from paper-based identifications to more digital counterparts, we encountered both leaps in efficiency and new challenges. Let’s explore the metamorphosis of these systems and the nuances of the digital identity realm.</p>
 Understanding Distributed Systems 
<p>The traditional centralized structures are giving way to more collaborative and decentralized mechanisms. Enter the realm of distributed systems, a paradigm shift revolutionizing the tech landscape.</p>
<p>Distributed systems encompass networked computers, each functioning autonomously. These individual entities communicate and coordinate actions via message-passing mechanisms without relying on a central authority.</p>
<p>On the upside, distributed systems offer inherent fault tolerance, resilience, and decentralization, making them robust against system-wide failures. On the flip side, their decentralized nature can lead to complexities in data reconciliation, and latency might occasionally be an issue due to multiple verification points.</p>
<p>Distributed systems offer a fresh lens through which we can view and process data. With this backdrop, the concept of distributed digital identity starts to take shape, offering a new approach to online identification.</p>
 The Concept of Distributed Digital Identity 
<p>Amid the complex web of digital interactions, there’s a pressing need to ensure the authenticity of identity and its protection. Distributed Digital Identity (DDI) emerges as the answer, combining the strengths of various technological principles.</p>
 How it Works: A Technical Overview: 
<p>Encryption: The bedrock of DDI, encryption ensures that data remains confidential, tamper-proof, and accessible only by the intended recipients. Robust cryptographic methods convert information into codes, decipherable only with the correct keys.</p>
<p>Decentralized Ledgers (Blockchain): As the backbone, blockchains are transparent, immutable data records. Every entry is time-stamped and linked, ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized alterations.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer Networks: This structure eradicates the middleman. By enabling direct interactions between parties, it enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and heightens security.</p>
<p>To truly grasp the impact of DDI, one must delve into its core components and how they interweave to create a fortified and user-centric identity system.</p>
<p>Behind the facade of any complex system lie intricate gears and mechanisms. DDI is no different. With its unique jargon and foundational elements, it becomes essential to demystify its terms for a comprehensive understanding.</p>
 
 DID (Decentralized Identifier): This is the digital equivalent of a unique fingerprint in the DDI landscape. Every DID is distinct, assuring pinpoint identity recognition. 
 Verifiable Credentials: These are the digital attestations provided by issuers about a holder. Think of them as digital testimonials attesting to the authenticity of the presented data. 
 Issuer, Holder, and Verifier: A triad that forms the DDI ecosystem, Issuers grant digital credentials; holders, typically users, store and present these credentials, and verifiers authenticate them. 
 
<p>With knowledge about the cornerstone terms of DDI, it becomes imperative to explore the tangible benefits this system offers users and organizations alike.</p>
 Benefits of Distributed Digital Identity 
<p>Pursuing any new technology is driven by the promise of betterment – in efficiency, security, or user experience. This promise manifests in many ways with DDI, benefiting end-users and businesses.</p>
 
 Data Privacy: DDI platforms ensure users have sole control over their data. Data resides in user-controlled digital wallets, which means third parties can’t compromise, even during a data breach. 
 Data Security: Following standards like the W3C DID specifications, DDI ensures that data is decentralized, encrypted, and secure. 
 Secure Sharing: End-to-end encryption is inherent in DDI, ensuring that all data shared is secure and private. 
 Edge/Cloud Agents: This allows users to manage their identities effortlessly, ensuring they don’t need to be continuously online. 
 Verifiable Credentials: Using cryptographic tools like zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), DDI systems can verify claims about a person’s identity without revealing the data. 
 
<p>While the advantages of DDI are aplenty, like any pioneering technology, it is full of challenges. As we stride forward, it’s crucial to acknowledge and address the obstacles.</p>
 BlockID’s Digital Identity Compilation: 
<p>The beauty of BlockID’s digital identity system lies in its ability to compile attributes from a diverse range of verifiable sources. This streamlines and accelerates new account registration and ensures that vital information is instantly available, wherever and whenever needed, contingent upon user consent.&nbsp;</p>
 Beyond Traditional Verification: 
<p>Additionally, BlockID recognizes the multifaceted nature of identity. Hence, it’s possible to bolster the authentication process by including other pertinent information. To cite a few examples, educational certificates, and vaccination records can be incorporated into the distributed identifier. This enriches the ID proofing process, rendering it virtually indisputable.</p>
 DDI Implementation with BlockID: 
<p>To provide a more concrete understanding, let’s delve into some real-world applications of the BlockID system:</p>
 
 Employee Onboarding: Firms can seamlessly perform new employee identity verification, ensuring that only legitimate hires access corporate resources. 
 Corporate Systems: Existing staff members can authenticate their access credentials, significantly bolstering cybersecurity defenses. 
 Data Management: Companies can update corporate records, significantly reducing the risk of manual errors that can compromise integrity. 
 Privacy &amp; Security Compliance: In an age where data breaches are common, BlockID helps organizations comply with privacy and security standards for personally identifiable information. 
 Fraud Prevention: The technology acts as a formidable barrier against the creation of deceptive accounts, and it’s a crucial tool in the fight against account takeovers. 
 Financial Transactions: Financial institutions can leverage BlockID to secure transactions and safeguard against fraudulent activities. 
 Data Sharing: With the rise of information-centric services, there’s a pressing need for secure data-sharing mechanisms. BlockID offers a solution, allowing the safe transmission of personally identifiable information. 
 
<p>Every silver lining has a cloud, and in the luminous dawn of Distributed Digital Identity, there are shadows of challenges and considerations. Embracing DDI is not just about heralding its merits but also about addressing the intricacies and hurdles it brings.</p>
 Technological Barriers: 
<p>Scalability: While DDI offers myriad benefits, it needs to scale to accommodate growing user bases and data volumes without compromising performance.</p>
<p>Interoperability with Legacy Systems: Merging DDI with existing systems can be challenging, often requiring extensive revamps.</p>
 Societal and Regulatory Challenges: 
<p>Privacy Concerns: Transparent systems can sometimes overstep, raising alarms about user privacy. Balancing transparency with confidentiality is crucial.</p>
<p>Regulation and Compliance: The decentralized nature of DDI can pose regulatory challenges, with different jurisdictions having varied compliance requirements.</p>
 Adoption Barriers: 
<p>Educating Stakeholders: A new system demands understanding. Ensuring stakeholders, from employees to customers, grasp the DDI concept is pivotal.</p>

 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 Moderate Baseline - AC-2(3) Control&nbsp; - <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Management | Disable Accounts - Disable accounts within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the accounts: (a) Have expired; (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual; (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or (d) Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These standards serve as additional confirmation of the importance of monitoring inactive or dormant accounts. Let's proceed to explore how Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews can assist in identifying these inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setting up Entra ID Governance Access Reviews&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that it's essential to review the licensing requirements for Microsoft Entra ID Governance before proceeding. Check out <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-is-generally-available/ba-p/2466932.">this blog</a> about Microsoft Entra ID Governance to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up an access review for inactive accounts, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Log in to Entra as the Identity Governance administrator at <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Navigate to Identity Governance and select Access Reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar1 - Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Select '+ New access review' to proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar2 – initiate configuration of new access review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;On the next page, choose 'Teams + Groups' as the review type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar3 – Defining review scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. For the review scope, choose 'Select Teams + groups.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar4 – Targeting teams and groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Then, visit the link under '+ Select group(s)' and choose the desired group from the list. In this demo, we are using a group that includes all standard users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar5 – Choosing the security group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Select the option 'Inactive users (on tenant level) only' and specify the number of days an account should be inactive; this can range up to 720 days. Once the settings are configured, choose 'Next: Reviews.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar6 – Choosing inactive users as review type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. In the review pages, select the reviewers for the task. You can also configure a multi-stage review process to align with your organization's requirements. Once the review settings are defined, use 'Next: Settings.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar7 – defining reviewers and schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Under the settings page, you can specify what actions should occur upon completion of the review. You can choose to auto-apply results or leave it for manual review. Additionally, you can utilize 'No sign-in within 30 days' data as a decision-making aid. After configuring the settings, use 'Next: Review + Create.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar8 – Post review settings and other advanced settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. On the last page, define a name for the review task and then choose 'Create' to finalize the setup process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar9 – Configuration summary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This completes the setup process for an Access Review targeting inactive accounts. The next step is to review the results of the access review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the review is complete, the assigned reviewers will receive an email notification:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar10 – Access review notification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the review results, reviewers can access details about the users and recommended actions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar11 – Access review results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using the link for the details, reviewers can access additional information:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ar12 – Additional information about task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the findings, reviewers can choose to approve or deny access for the identified accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews provide a valuable tool for identifying and managing inactive accounts within the organization. This can be seamlessly integrated into the Just-in-Time (JML) process, ensuring regular reviews to identify and address inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations are exploiting cloud services to accelerate business changes without the need for capital expenditure or lengthy procurement delays to obtain hardware. However, the dynamic nature of cloud services creates new security challenges that need a dynamic approach to governance and security controls.</p>
 
<p>In addition, the responsibilities for security and compliance are shared between the CSP (Cloud Service Providers) and the cloud customer and it is up to the customer to ensure that they use the cloud in a secure and compliant manner. On top of that, each cloud service provides its own proprietary tools for security.</p>
<p>How can an organization be sure that it is using cloud services securely and in a way that meets its compliance obligations and its appetite for risk?</p>
 Shared Responsibility 
<p>While major CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) go to great lengths to secure the services that they provide, it is up to the cloud service customers to secure how they use these services. The responsibility for security and compliance is shared between the cloud customer and the CSP.&nbsp; The customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but is responsible for managing everything above the service provided.&nbsp; The customer also remains responsible for compliance with laws and regulations governing the processing of their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The basics of security hygiene are the same for both cloud and non-cloud. However, cloud and virtualized environments are very dynamic with resources being created and destroyed in milliseconds. Static detective controls are not appropriate in this dynamic environment. A policy-based approach is needed to prevent misconfigurations and vulnerabilities before they can be deployed rather than to detect them afterward. These policies are sometimes referred to as guardrails that stop mistakes before they create a risk.</p>
 Ad Hoc Approach 
<p>Cyber hygiene is a set of routines that implement best practices intended to keep systems, data, and users secure against cyber-attacks, data breaches, and data loss. These are the same for cloud services as for other forms of IT delivery. These are documented in numerous security frameworks and best practices and cover areas such as:</p>
 
 Asset management – which needs an inventory – hard to maintain for the transient virtual resources. 
 Identity management – which must also include the entitlements of the virtual resources. 
 Vulnerability management – which must ensure that known vulnerabilities must be removed from virtual resources before they become live. 
 Network security management – of the virtual in-cloud network as well as the connection to the cloud. 
 Data protection – controlling what data is held in which locations and how this data is protected against theft and unauthorized access. 
 Monitoring to ensure that the risks are managed and that obligations under laws and regulations are met. 
 
<p>However, each cloud has its own tools that support these processes, and these are all different. This has led to an ad hoc approach to security and compliance on the multi-cloud environment now found in most organizations.</p>
 Alphabet Soup 
<p>In response to these challenges, there is now a wide range of solutions on the market intended to help secure the way in which cloud services are used. While these tools are aligned with the security threats and risks that are relevant to the cloud they are often not integrated. To add to the confusion they are now referred to using yet another set of acronyms including:</p>
 
 CAASM (Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management) - is&nbsp;an emerging technology focused on presenting a unified view of cyber assets to help prevent and manage attacks. 
 CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) – provides controls over the entitlements possessed by virtual resources.&nbsp; 
 CNAPP (Cloud Native Application Protection Platform) – provides capabilities to view and manage security controls for cloud accounts and workloads integrated into the cloud DevOps workflow. 
 CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) - providing visibility of security and compliance posture. 
 CWPP (Cloud Workload Protection Platform) – provides controls at the microservices instance/container level. 
 CXDR (Cloud Extended Threat Detection and Response) – covering cloud threat detection and response. 
 DSPM (Data Security Posture Management) – provides visibility into sensitive data, where it is located, and who has access. 
 KSPM (Kubernetes Security Posture Management) – discover and fix security and compliance issues within the various Kubernetes components. 
 SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) – provides network-based access controls to cloud services.&nbsp; 
 
 Cloud Security Platform 
<p>What is needed is a consistent cloud security platform that covers all the required capabilities for the customer to secure their use of cloud services. Some CNAPP solutions currently offered provide a platform that integrates several of the above capabilities for IaaS that were previously offered as standalone products. A key success factor for a cloud security platform is the ability of the tools to work in unison across environments, architectural layers, and, ideally, 3rd party integrations providing the additional context needed to achieve robust cloud security.</p>

Operating power grids in nine European countries including Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, EON is “constantly” under attack by cybercriminals, some of which are suspected state-backed actors.</p>
<p>Unlike most cybercriminals, the aim of state-backed actors is increasingly not about making money but using data encryption malware attacks to create fear for political purposes. This is what Alexander Klimburg, Senior Fellow at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies calls “ransomwar”. In his opinion, WannaCry and NotPetya were the first major ransomwar attacks launched by governments.</p>
<p>At cyberevolution, Alexander will give a keynote about “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5660">Surviving between the Cyber Frontlines</a>” in which he will address information and cyber warfare and what organizations can do to protect themselves. Take a glimpse into is keynote in today’s cyberfile and learn which good habits need to be instilled through training to minimize the chances of being hit. &nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>On October 4, 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) jointly released new guidance titled <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Oct/04/2003313510/-1/-1/0/ESF%20CTR%20IAM%20MFA%20SSO%20CHALLENGES.PDF">Identity and Access Management: Developer and Vendor Challenges</a>, which addresses technology gaps that limit adoption of more secure identity and access management (IAM) practices. This guidance is a follow on to their <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Mar/21/2003183448/-1/-1/0/ESF%20IDENTITY%20AND%20ACCESS%20MANAGEMENT%20RECOMMENDED%20BEST%20PRACTICES%20FOR%20ADMINISTRATORS%20PP-23-0248_508C.PDF">comprehensive guidance report on IAM</a> published earlier this year. Together, these documents describe key principles and best practices to fortify organizations against the rising tide of cyberthreats.</p> 
<p>The NSA / CISA IAM guidelines covers deterrence, prevention, detection, damage limitation, and response. Here, we'll explore key takeaways from the reports as well as how HYPR, with its Identity Assurance approach, helps you overcome challenges to successfully align with the recommended NSA / CISA IAM security strategies.</p> 
 IAM Threat Landscape  
<p>One of the most significant threats trends in the past few years is the specific targeting of IAM systems and processes. According to <a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/white-paper/2023-trends-in-securing-digital-identities/">one recent study</a>, 90% of organizations experienced an identity-related incident, ranging from phishing and credential theft to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks.</p> 
<p>The NSA / CISA IAM guidance points out that attacks on SSO technology, in particular, have become more prevalent. By compromising SSO systems, cybercriminals can gain access to numerous protected applications and resources throughout an organization. The agencies state that defense against such a broad range of attacks requires a comprehensive solution “with operational awareness of the environment to detect anomalies and attribute anomalous activity to adversary exploits.”</p> 
 Key Takeaways From the NSA / CISA IAM Guidelines  
 1. Enterprises Must Look at the Entire Identity Lifecycle  
<p>The guidance stresses the importance of managing the entire identity and access lifecycle, emphasizing "Join, Move, and Leave" (JML) events. The report notably calls out the inadequacy of MFA enrollment processes that make it difficult to be certain that a user’s credentials are tied to an established, verified employee identity. Such processes often rely on user self-enrollment that utilize inconsistent and insecure methods such as a “one time enrollment code” flow.</p> 
<p>The directives recommend that organizations develop secure enrollment processes which can support the complex provisioning needs of large organizations, with tools that operate across systems and JML lifecycle events. These processes should also address unexpected events, such as detecting and responding to abnormal user behavior or other potential risks, and lost or stolen authenticators or devices.</p> 
<p>In addition, the NSA / CISA IAM report strongly recommends organizations maintain an audit trail or a “chain of evidence” by requiring the manager or designated individual to “attest” to the fact that all required checks passed to the manager’s satisfaction.</p> 
 2. Hardening the Enterprise Environment  
<p>The guidance emphasizes the need to harden the enterprise environment, including “making sure the foundations and implementations of IAM are sufficiently secured, assured, and trusted."</p> 
<p>Environmental hardening makes it tougher to exploit IAM components and software. While some of the recommendations center around physical hardening and general cyber hygiene, like regular patching and vulnerability testing, a key component of enterprise hardening is the use of strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to IAM systems. Moreover, cryptographic keys used for authentication and other IAM functions should be protected at appropriate assurance levels, preferably using hardware-based methods.</p> 
 3. Authentication Best Practices: Strong, Phishing-Resistant MFA&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<p>Unsurprisingly, the NSA / CISA IAM recommendations unequivocally state the need for organizations to deploy MFA to mitigate common attacks. The agencies distinguish between weak and strong, phishing-resistant forms of MFA, noting that critical implementation details impact the security and usability of an MFA deployment. Some forms of MFA are susceptible to phishing, replay, MitM and other attacks. The guidance specifically warns against push notification-based authenticator apps that prompt the user to approve login attempts as these are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a> (MFA bombing). It advocates for local biometric matching on mobile devices and emphasizes FIDO-certified device requirements.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>&nbsp;Weakest to Strongest Types of MFA<br>Source:The National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</p> 
 4. Coverage Is Key  
<p>Before deploying MFA and monitoring solutions, understanding the full scope of use cases is crucial. The NSA / CISA IAM guidance warns against an ad-hoc approach that may lead to incomplete coverage and a complex environment. Multiple IAM systems and the use of different authenticators creates adoption challenges and confusion for users, as well as management and security monitoring difficulties.</p> 
<p>This is currently a tremendous challenge for organizations. According to the 2023 IDSA report, the biggest obstacle to implementing more secure identity practices stems from complicated identity frameworks with multiple vendors and different architectures. Organizations should choose a comprehensive solution that can unify siloed systems and supports all of their business and operational use cases.</p> 
 5. Respond to Elevated Risk  
<p>Because security and threat vectors are dynamic, the guidance advises organizations to implement automated risk analysis. Of course, quantifying risk is based on the policies that are in place. As such, the guidance highlights the requirements for policies that can trigger the need to re-authenticate or perform step-up authentication (i.e., requiring higher-assurance authentication than was used to initially establish a user’s session) when users access sensitive applications or perform high-risk activities. This provides the flexibility to require high assurance when needed without frustrating users engaged in routine, low-risk tasks with repeated MFA prompts. It also provides an integration point for Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) policies such as requiring re-authentication or step-up based on risk signals from threat defense systems.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Organizations Can Meet the NSA and CISA IAM Provisions  
<p>The release of CISA and NSA's new guidance on Identity and Access Management underscores the critical role IAM plays in fortifying cybersecurity defenses. As organizations navigate the complexities of an ever-changing threat landscape, adhering to recommended best practices is essential.</p> 
<p>HYPR's Identity Assurance solution, consisting of HYPR Authenticate, HYPR Adapt and HYPR Affirm, ensures IAM security aligns with the CISA/NSA guidance. Designed to create trust in the entire identity lifecycle, it combines modern passkey-based authentication with adaptive risk mitigation, automated identity verification and a simple, intuitive user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  HYPR Authenticate provides the most secure FIDO-based, phishing-resistant MFA. It ensures that biometric templates are bound to a single device, mitigating privacy and security concerns and adhering to the best practices recommended by CISA and NSA. It provides complete coverage across all populations and use cases, from desktop to cloud.  
  HYPR Adapt stands out by providing a flexible policy framework based on the Open Policy Agent (OPA) standard. This empowers organizations to create policies aligned with their risk criteria. HYPR's policies can dynamically trigger re-authentication or step-up authentication based on risk signals, in accordance with Zero Trust Architecture policies.  
  HYPR Affirm integrates intelligent identity verification into an organization's identity and authentication practice, covering all JML events as well as high-risk and high-impact moments. This includes “new device” capabilities, where users can effortlessly but securely disable a device and move to a new one, verifying identity through a multi-faceted check that ensures the integrity of the device and the identity of the user. Moreover, it maintains an auditable attestation trail in alignment with NSA and CISA best practices.

  <p>Digital organizations face unprecedented challenges. There's incredible pressure to innovate ahead of the competition and deliver digital experiences that help to acquire, retain, and build loyalty with customers — all while fending off ever-present and increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. A robust identity and access management (IAM) platform plays a pivotal role in transforming these challenges into achievable goals.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to introduce the latest evolution in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> with the release of software version 7.4.</p>

<p>This update includes innovative features that will help our self-managed software customers elevate user experiences, expedite solution development, and enhance security. The <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.4/platform-guide/about.html">ForgeRock Identity Platform 7.4</a> release includes:</p>

  ForgeRock Access Management 7.4 
	 ForgeRock Identity Management 7.4 
	 ForgeRock Directory Services 7.4 
	 ForgeRock Identity Gateway 2023.9 
	 ForgeRock SDKs 4.2 
  Elevate user experiences 

<p>Latency is the enemy of the frictionless user experiences that keep employees productive and keep customers coming back. Delivering great experiences is central to the ForgeRock platform, and the latest release offers several features that reduce latency, perceived or actual, and ensure customer and workforce users have a seamless and enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>No one wants to wait in a long line, especially when it comes to using an application. Unfortunately, some legacy and protected applications can be slow to respond to requests for an available HTTP connection. This creates a queue of requests from all applications and inhibits the user experience even for those accessing other, unrelated applications.</p>

<p>That's why we've added the capability to control and limit the number of outbound HTTP requests waiting for an available HTTP connection to a protected application or API. This control limits the cascading effect of wait times created by slow responses, so it&nbsp; reduces user frustration due to unresponsive applications, ultimately delivering a better customer experience.</p>

<p>We've established that latency is an obstacle to a favorable user experience. Client-side (stateless) sessions simplify infrastructure and reduce client-perceived latency, thus enhancing user experience. However, client-side sessions are constrained by a 4kb cookie size limit that hampers an organization's ability to implement session-based client-side use cases. In the latest <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/ig/latest/release-notes/whats-new.html">Identity Gateway release</a>, organizations can now automatically split the client-side sessions over multiple cookies. This improves flexibility and ease of design by eliminating cookie size limitations, enabling use cases such as Post Data Preservation, so that developers can engineer better user experiences.</p>

 Expedite solution development 

<p>Expediting project delivery can be a key competitive advantage. However, projects often require customizations that slow delivery and make new features difficult to integrate, deliver, debug, and maintain.</p>

<p>For this reason, the 7.4 release incorporates significant enhancements to our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">identity orchestration</a> engine that seamlessly integrate access management with identity management and enable developers to share code across journeys with a library of scripts.</p>

<p>For developers, the enhancements offer a number of benefits, including reduced duplication, less development work thanks to more out-of-the-box nodes, simplified code integration, lower maintenance overheads, easier debugging, and an overall increase in code stability. These features boost developer productivity, accelerate delivery of innovation, and expedite time to value for the business.</p>

 Enhance security 

<p>With data breaches and cyberthreats more prevalent than ever, security remains a top priority. Organizations need to ensure transactions are secured using strong cryptography. To this end, the 7.4 release provides the option to sign and verify data.</p>

<p>Signing generates a unique digital signature that is linked to the transaction data and serves as proof of identity. It can help to keep the data intact during transmission and execution, which ensures the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of online transactions.</p>

<p>In addition to signing and verifying data, the 7.4 release offers the ability to store and retrieve privileged account credentials from vaults and rotate them without the need for a restart. This, coupled with ensuring nothing is stored in the clear (no plain-text credentials), enables fast and automatic rotation of privileged account credentials to deliver additional protection against security vulnerabilities associated with compromised passwords — without disruption to the business.</p>

<p>Another security feature of the 7.4 offers OAuth IP allowlisting. Organizations need to be able to control which clients are able to connect and receive access tokens. An allowlist approach enables a number of use cases, such as restricting the issuance of access tokens to clients that match a specific IP or list of IPs via custom scripting.</p>

<p>ForgeRock is fully committed to supporting all identities in any environment — whether the deployment is self-managed on-prem, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">hybrid cloud</a>, or as-a-service. The ForgeRock Identity Platform 7.4 release empowers organizations to provide an unparalleled user experience, expedite project delivery, and strengthen security.</p>

<p>Many of the features in the 7.4 release are also currently available in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a>. These capabilities support our existing cloud and hybrid customers, while offering organizations seeking a turnkey SaaS solution the same benefits available to our self-managed customers.</p>

<p>In addition to the features highlighted above, you can read about the many new 7.4 release capabilities in our <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/platform/7.4/release-notes/preface.html">release notes</a>.

  <p>In 2021, temporary and contract staffing made up <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/220682/us-total-annual-temporary-employment/">more than 14 million members of the workforce</a>. While the numbers have fluctuated, the preceding decade never saw that number dip below 10 million, and in some years exceeded 14 million. Contract workers remain essential to business, often filling strategic roles and those that call for specialized skills. However, in the digital age, these workers pose some challenges, particularly around cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity breaches in the United States in 2022 cost an average of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">$9.44 million</a>, and attack techniques are only increasing in sophistication. Traditional security methods like employee identity and access management (IAM) <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/customer-targeted-cybercrime-rises-traditional-digital-identity-fails">protocols may no longer be sufficient</a> for a company's protection against growing cybersecurity threats.</p>

 How do contract workers increase cybersecurity risks? 

<p>Companies that employ contract workers may face some specific cybersecurity risks as a result of qualities specific to these types of employees. Since contractors have the potential to frequently move from company to company, they may have access to private data from numerous sources, with little accountability.</p>

<p>Contractors may also be under less scrutiny than other workers, especially if they are working on a limited or temporary basis. They can pose threats to cybersecurity through human error, data mismanagement, or malicious activity, particularly the use of a device infected with malware.</p>

 Types of cybersecurity risks associated with contract workers 

<p>To do their jobs, contractors may have access to networks, internal drives, and sensitive data. Here's why that can pose risks.</p>

  Limited control and oversight: Contractors may not be subject to the same level of scrutiny or oversight as regular employees, which could potentially allow negligent or malicious activity to go unnoticed. 
	 Insufficient training: It can be difficult for companies to offer contract employees the same level of training that regular employees receive. For example, some companies may provide more general company-wide training on an annual schedule. As a result, a planned cybersecurity training program may not coincide with the duration of a contract. 
	 Device security: Contract workers often use their own devices or work remotely. This increases the potential for security breaches from insecure networks or compromised devices. 
	 Access privileges: To effectively perform their jobs, contractors may need access to specific networks or systems. A company without a robust <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity</a> strategy may have vulnerabilities related to this relatively unmonitored access. 
 <p>The U.S. government has been making <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/us-national-cybersecurity-strategy-what-it-means-digital-identity">policy changes and initiatives in order to address cybersecurity threats</a>. Some of these factors, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, may help to reduce some of the vulnerabilities associated with contract workers.</p>

 How to reduce cybersecurity risks associated with contract workers 

<p>When working with contractors, it may be necessary to consider additional cybersecurity measures. Reducing or eliminating the unique security risks and vulnerabilities posed by contract workers can involve a mix of new technologies and procedural changes.</p>

  Cloud technology: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Cloud identity solutions</a> can help to ensure the identity of those accessing privileged company information. It can also reduce the vulnerabilities of device-stored data by offering protected interactions on the cloud. 
	 Identity governance: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> enables organizations to prevent inappropriate access and comply with regulations. 
 <p>As with any potential cyberthreat, keeping an ongoing watch for suspicious activity is one of the most important ways to reduce the risk of an attack, and minimize the damage if it occurs.</p>

 How to recover from a cybersecurity breach 

<p>The first thing to recognize is that it's important to act quickly. Depending on how the breach occurred, if the problem is unaddressed, malicious actors could further exploit the vulnerability that led to the breach and perpetuate the damage.</p>

  Identify and contain the breach: Identifying and addressing a breach should be the first priority following detection. Try to isolate affected systems or networks in order to prevent an attacker from causing further damage. Preserving evidence can also help during investigation. 
	 Notify affected parties: Nobody wants to hear their private data has been compromised, especially if it comes as the result of a seemingly preventable cyberattack. In some jurisdictions, a company may be <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/cybersecurity-legislation-2021">legally required to report cybersecurity breaches</a>. 
	 Restore systems and data: Restoring a network to normal operation may involve using data backups, reinstalling software, and replacing compromised hardware. 
	 Implement measures to prevent future attacks: After recovering from a breach, it's important to take steps to ensure that a similar breach won't happen again. Try to close any security gaps, and provide additional employee training if necessary. 
 <p>Recovering from a cybersecurity breach can be a long and expensive process. However, knowing how to react and what a restoration entails can help to plan for this type of disaster.</p>

 Choosing contract workers 

<p>To reduce potential security concerns when hiring contract workers, try to take these activities into consideration:</p>

  Background checks: Before hiring a contractor, perform a background check to ensure their identity, history, and qualifications. 
	 Regular security audits: Monitoring and performing regular security audits on contractor activities can help to ensure they are acting responsibly and with cybersecurity in mind. This can also be a good way to ensure all workers are on the same page when it comes to taking adequate security measures. 
	 Provide secure equipment: A good way to avoid issues with device security is to provide workers with secure, company-managed equipment. 
	 Communication: Establishing easy and open communication with contractors helps ensure they feel comfortable and compelled to report potential security issues they encounter. 
 <p>Ultimately, hiring contract workers should, whenever possible, involve the same rigorous vetting that other employees require.</p>

 Additional risk factors 

<p>There are many potential sources of cybersecurity risk for a business. Some of these could potentially stem from contractors, but could come from other sources as well.</p>

  Phishing: Malicious actors can pose as authority figures in order to steal information, such as login credentials. Phishing can stem from social engineering attacks, as well as malicious links made to look legitimate. 
	 Ransomware: Malware attacks such as ransomware hold access to information, computer systems, or networks hostage until a ransom is paid. Ransomware attacks accounted for <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/494947/ransomware-attacks-per-year-worldwide/">over a billion cyber attacks since 2020</a>. 
	 AI-powered cyberattacks: While AI has powerful uses in cybersecurity, it is also helping malicious actors to execute more authentic-looking attacks and it makes it far easier to impersonate others to carry out fraud, such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a>. 
 <p>Cyberattacks are only becoming more sophisticated and more targeted, which means companies need to take a proactive and sustained approach to cybersecurity.</p>

 Options for legal recourse 

<p>If your business experiences a data breach due to the actions of a contractor, it may be prudent to look into legal actions. Depending on the nature of the breach, or the location it occurred, the contractor may be legally liable. Consult with legal counsel, who can inform you of the relevant state and federal violations that may have occurred.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Joining forces to compete against Microsoft and Okta 
<p>A couple of months ago, the series of acquisitions of SailPoint, ForgeRock, and Ping Identity by Thoma Bravo triggered discussions and rumors about the impact on the broader Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) market. Recently, Thoma Bravo <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-of-forgerock-combines-forgerock-into-ping-identity-301908059.html">announced</a> that ForgeRock would be combined into Ping Identity. Such merger &amp; acquisition (M&amp;A) developments prompt the spate of usual questions:</p>
 
 What does this mean to customers of the two companies? 
 What to expect strategically from the combined companies? 
 Where are the risks of such a combination? 
 How could this potentially impact the market? 
 
<p>As always, responding to these questions is a mixture of known facts, experience from other mergers and acquisitions, knowledge of the companies and markets as well as the competitive landscape, and last but not least, some educated guessing.</p>
 The impact on customers 
<p>As with every transaction of this type, this raises questions about the impact on the mutual product roadmaps. Will the combined companies increase or slow down product development? Will products be discontinued? Will there arise a need for major migration projects?</p>
<p>For understanding the potential impact, there are a couple of aspects to look at, such as:</p>
 
 The functional and technological differences and similarities 
 The target customers 
 The impact on corporate strategies 
 
<p>The functional differences and similarities can be well-analyzed by utilizing reference architectures such as the KuppingerCole Analysts <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81216/2022-iam-reference-architecture">IAM Reference Architecture</a>. Both companies offer Access Management solutions, including Adaptive Authentication / Passwordless Authentication, Web Access Management, and Identity Federation. Also, both companies provide their Directory Services and a certain level of API Management.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are unique product areas. In particular, ForgeRock supports Identity Governance &amp; Administration (IGA) capabilities, while Ping Identity supports identity verification and acquired a specialist in the decentralized identity space a while ago. Additionally, some services, such as multi-factor authentication, have different deployment options across the two vendors.</p>
<p>When examining the types of identities served by the respective platforms Ping Identity is concentrated primarily on business identities (such as workforce, customer, and partner identities), while ForgeRock, in addition to consumer and customer use cases and support for partner and workforce use cases, adds specific support for IoT and Edge computing use cases, supporting both consumer IoT devices and industrial IoT (IIoT) scenarios. Ping Identity also has limited support for consumer IoT device management, CIAM-related user self service capabilities, and also provides Data Governance features.</p>
<p>From a technology perspective, there are significant differences between the Ping and the ForgeRock product portfolio. ForgeRock, rooted in open source, provides a solution that is very flexible for customization. However, such customization comes at the expense of complexity. Ping, on the other hand, provides more a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solution. Ping has also already developed a robust multi-tenant cloud solution.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, the DaVinci orchestration capabilities of Ping Identity are also a relevant differentiator. There is no doubt that convergence of the product portfolios will be a daunting task, even though modern architectures with microservices and API-based integration allow for easier integration of different technology stacks than it had been the case in the past. The DaVinci orchestration capabilities can become an important factor for such integration, though.</p>
<p>We expect, due to the structure of the transaction and with Andre Durand, CEO of Ping Identity, becoming the CEO of the combined entity, Ping Identity being in the lead, but with joint teams from both companies. Thus, Ping Identity will have more influence on the joint strategy. From a strategic perspective, with both companies being (in different stages) on their journey to the cloud, there is no strategy disruption to be expected.</p>
<p>If you are a customer of Ping Identity or ForgeRock or in the procurement process, feel free to reach out to the KuppingerCole Analysts team for further insights and advice.</p>
 The strategic potential 
<p>With the mutual portfolios, and the individual strengths of both vendors, there is a potential of Ping and ForgeRock building a powerful platform for Digital Identity Management that covers all types of identities, from humans (consumers, customers, partners, and workforce) to silicon identities, including the IoT and IIoT space.</p>
<p>The previous investments of Ping Identity into orchestration technology, identity verification and support for decentralized identity provide a foundation for a fundamental modernization of approaches in this area, beyond today’s established IAM solutions.</p>
<p>Potentially, Ping/ForgeRock can provide a modern, integrated, feature-rich cloud-based Identity Fabric as a strategic solution approach to their customers, beyond serving isolated use cases. Moving towards this target will take some time and is best done by evolving a modern, cloud-based solution stack with a high degree of integration that allows smooth migration at least for customers that already are relying on cloud-based solutions.</p>
 The risks 
<p>Other than the common risks of mergers and acquisitions such as building a joint organization, there are several challenges to face.</p>
<p>One is that many ForgeRock customers are still using legacy on-premises solutions, and many also have customized the solution significantly, baking it, for instance, into their digital services. Evolving from there will become more challenging than it is for other COTS solutions. This requires offerings involving well-thought-out migration paths with both technical and consulting support.</p>
<p>As always, communicating a strong strategy, a well-thought-out roadmap, and a migration path that simplifies migration for existing customers and allows them to migrate at their own pace (within boundaries) is key to success.</p>
<p>Another specific risk is the pace of the competition. In each market Ping Identity and ForgeRock are playing, there is fierce competition. Thus, the combined entity will need to move fast with strategy and roadmap and execute on these plans, to not give room to their competitors.</p>
 The market impacts 
<p>While Ping Identity and ForgeRock are well-known players in the broader IAM space, they are facing strong competition.&nbsp; In addition to established vendors such as Broadcom (which acquired identity products from CA Technologies), Oracle, IBM, SAP, RSA, and others that are strong in large enterprises, there are many specialist vendors across all market segments Ping Identity and ForgeRock play in.</p>
<p>Specific competitors to watch are Okta and Microsoft, with Microsoft 365 present in a majority of organizations, involving also Entra ID. Both have strong offerings competing directly with the Ping Identity and ForgeRock portfolios, and both are significantly larger than the new, combined entity.&nbsp; In addition, privileged access management leader CyberArk has recently expanded into access management, and the space is also seeing a major influx of new entries, including a fast-growing customer identity company Transmit Security.</p>
<p>Thus, it will be essential for Ping Identity to demonstrate innovativeness beyond merging portfolios but also delivering some breakthrough innovation. Ping Identity has built the foundation with their previous acquisitions. Even then, the combined entity will face fierce competition.</p>
 Conclusion &amp; recommendations 
<p>The combination of Ping Identity and ForgeRock shows potential. Ping Identity is well-advised to focus on breakthrough innovation and thinking beyond the established state of IAM, also to differentiate from their competitors.</p>
<p>End users, as common at such stages, are best advised to keep calm until further information about strategy, roadmaps, and the future product portfolio are released.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Today’s evolving and expanding threat landscape has rendered traditional security measures inadequate for safeguarding sensitive data and systems. Organizations grapple with elevated risks as malicious actors continuously devise new ways to circumvent standard security protocols and exploit vulnerabilities. Additionally, the shift towards remote and hybrid work models has brought new avenues of attack. Recent breaches show just how easy it is for hackers to use social engineering tactics to call an IT service desk, impersonate an end user to gain access, and then elevate privileges, install malware, or even shut down entire systems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In response to these challenges, government agencies, cybersecurity experts and industry bodies unanimously advocate for the adoption of a Zero Trust security approach. Zero Trust challenges the outdated notion that traditional network security perimeters are sufficient for defense, instead taking a "Never trust, always verify" stance. This involves the constant authentication and validation of users' identities, their devices, and their security configurations before granting or maintaining access to applications and data. Risk-based authentication is a pivotal component of a Zero Trust strategy, and is essential for mitigating these threats and attacks.</p> 
 What Is Zero Trust?  
<p>Zero Trust is a comprehensive security framework designed to counteract modern cyberthreats. It operates on the foundational premise that secure perimeters and network edges are obsolete. With resources dispersed across various locations, encompassing on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments, and with personnel accessing them from anywhere, conventional security models no longer suffice.</p> 
<p>Zero Trust endeavors to eradicate trust assumptions at every layer of the network architecture. All users, whether internal or external to the organization's network, are treated as potential threats until they conclusively prove otherwise through rigorous authentication and authorization processes. The principal components of Zero Trust encompass perpetual monitoring, stringent access controls, and continuous validation that the user is who they say they are at all times.</p> 
 What Is Risk-Based Authentication?  
<p>Risk-based authentication, also referred to as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a>, constitutes an essential&nbsp; element of a Zero Trust strategy. It assesses the probability of an account being compromised and adjusts authentication requirements and actions based on risk level. A risk-based authentication system continuously evaluates various factors, including:</p> 
  
  Trust Level: Is the user logging in from a recognized and trusted device, or is it an unfamiliar device?  
  Location: Is the user accessing resources from an expected location or a remote, potentially suspicious location?  
  Network: Is the user connecting from a known and secure network, or is the network connection unverified?  
  Other user behavior and device and browser risk signals: For example, what is device health status (is it rooted or jailbroken, is the OS up to date), time of day the user is logging in, does the user behavior match behavior history?  
  Sensitivity: Is the requested resource highly sensitive, necessitating additional security measures?  
  Threat Landscape Risks: Are there emerging security threats that create an additional level of risk?  
  
<p>Based on analysis of these factors, the risk-based authentication system determines a risk score. The user may either proceed with a standard login method or be prompted to provide additional proof of identity and authorization. Some more sophisticated systems may even prompt users to re-verify their identity altogether according to defined policies.</p> 
 Why Is Risk-Based Authentication Imperative for Zero Trust?  
<p>Zero Trust hinges on context-driven security policies and rigorous user authentication, eschewing reliance on trust assumptions. Risk-based authentication plays a central role by continuously monitoring risk indicators and adapting authentication criteria accordingly.</p> 
<p>Risk-based authentication empowers organizations to:</p> 
  
  Identify High-Risk Scenarios: By assessing real-time risk factors, organizations can promptly discern potentially high-risk activities or access attempts. Subsequently, they can prompt users for additional authentication or re-authentication.  
  Safeguard Sensitive Resources: Zero Trust authentication grants organizations the ability to restrict access to sensitive resources based on risk assessments. For instance, they can block access to critical data when unusual or risky behavior, such as an attempt to access from an unmanaged device, is detected.  
  Enhance User Experience: While elevating security, risk-based authentication also streamlines the user experience. Users are prompted for additional authentication only when deemed necessary, thus reducing friction during routine access attempts.  
  
 Continuous Risk-Based Authentication vs. Point-in-Time  
<p>In the contemporary threat landscape, point-in-time authentication, limited to initial login or upon access of specific resources, is no longer adequate. To attain genuine <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a>, organizations must continually validate a user's identity and authorization constantly and consistently. This ongoing verification is indispensable for preempting unauthorized access and promptly identifying suspicious activities.</p> 
<p>In a Zero Trust environment, access to diverse resources is subject to control and monitoring through enforcement points aligned with policies. For instance, instead of solely relying on users “claimed” identity, a risk-based policy takes into account the user's complete behavior and risk profile, empowering organizations to take immediate action upon detecting abnormal or high-risk behavior or situations.</p> 
 HYPR Risk-Based Authentication Accelerates Your Zero Trust Strategy  
<p>Risk-based authentication serves as a cornerstone of a Zero Trust approach, allowing organizations to outpace cyber adversaries and offer a more secure and user-friendly authentication experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR provides continuous, rigorous Zero Trust authentication while removing user friction. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt </a>continuously assesses risk signals and telemetry from a broad and diverse set of sources. Results can be used to dynamically enforce step-up authentication or re-verification, as well as shared with SIEM, SOAR and other enterprise systems for additional enforcement or reporting actions.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">HYPR Authenticate</a> replaces passwords and traditional MFA with phishing-resistant passkeys that remain in the most secured areas of the user device at all times. It combines two strong factors into a single user action; users log in only once to safely access organizational resources, desktop to cloud. For the most complete Zero Trust solution, which addresses the entire identity lifecycle, including establishing and maintaining secure, verified identities, HYPR also offers integrated <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification with HYPR Affirm</a>.</p>

  <p>On July 11, 2023, we introduced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-expands-into-security-service-edge-with-two-new/ba-p/3847829">Microsoft’s identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution</a> and two new services: Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access, which are now in public preview. In this blog, we take a deeper look into Microsoft&nbsp;Entra Private Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Traditional network security stacks and legacy VPNs are no longer sufficient</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional network security approaches that use legacy VPNs simply cannot scale to modern demands. Once your remote users connect to your corporate network through VPN, they are granted excessive access to your entire network, all it takes is a single compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to gain entry, move laterally, and access your most critical assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access, an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), reduces the operational complexity and cost of legacy VPNs, while eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. It modernizes access to private applications and resources, helping users quickly and easily connect to private applications from any device and any network, whether they’re at home, remote, or in their corporate office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Private Access unique&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of Microsoft’s SSE solution, Private Access is built on Zero Trust principles. It verifies every user and enforces least privilege, giving users access only to the private applications and resources they need. Private Access significantly expands Entra ID Application Proxy capabilities in Microsoft Entra to a complete ZTNA solution that shares the same connectors but offers so much more, it helps you simplify and secure access to any private resource on any port, and protocol. You can apply policies that enable secure, segmented, and granular access to all your private applications in your corporate network, on-premises, or in the cloud. For customers already using Application Proxy, they can seamlessly transition to Private Access – all existing use-cases and access to existing private web applications would continue to work with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create and enforce per-app, least privilege access controls based on the granular Conditional Access policies that are enriched with context about users, devices, and their locations. You can also terminate ongoing sessions in response to anomalies or changes in user context or device health. For example, if a user connects from one part of the world and then immediately connects from another part of the world (what we call “impossible travel"), you can enforce re-authorization or step up to a stronger authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access enables secure access to any application, on-premises or cloud-based, and it works across any port or protocol, including RDP, SSH, SMB, FTP, and anything else that uses TCP or UDP. In addition, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using SAML or http headers or even legacy Kerberos authentication for both web and non-web applications, without making any changes to those applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, your private applications are not only more secure, but your employees can also access them faster compared to legacy VPNs. The unmatched scale and vast global network edge presence enables you to optimally connect your users and devices to private resources, especially those who work in a hybrid or remote work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Secure access to all private applications, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Private Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access can help you enable secure access to all your private applications and resources. Key capabilities include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access. Replacing legacy VPNs with an identity-centric ZTNA minimizes the risk of implicit trust and lateral movement. Using Quick Access, you can easily configure broad private IP ranges and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to quickly enable identity-centric, Zero-Trust-based access to all private resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications. With Private Access, you can create Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that require modern authentication for accessing any private application, even those using legacy protocols such as Kerberos and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This brings policies based on the sensitivity of the application, level of user risk, network compliance, and so forth to legacy applications. For example, you can easily require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device compliance checks for users trying to access remote desktop (RDP), secure shell (SSH) or SMB applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic private application discovery and onboarding. You can discover private applications, including existing App Proxy private web applications, whether the applications are hosted locally in a private network, in an on-premises data center, or in the cloud.&nbsp; You can then onboard them to Microsoft Entra ID, group them, and define granular access policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granular segmented application access. Instead of granting remote users access to your entire network, as traditional VPNs do, you can define granular segmented access policies for each application or group of applications based on user, device, or processes running on the endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Granular segmented application access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intelligent local access. Employees need a consistent security posture whether they’re accessing private applications remotely or on-premises. The intelligent local access capability enables fast and seamless ZTNA for users, whether they’re within the corporate network or connecting remotely from anywhere outside corporate network boundaries. For example, a user while on the corporate network can connect to on-premises private applications such as RDP or SMB while CA policies such as MFA are still enforced, and application traffic remains local on the corporate network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Intelligent local access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with Entra Private Access&nbsp;

<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Private Access. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them with the resources they need. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickAccess makes it very easy to get started with a minimum configuration for Private Access, especially when you are planning to move from legacy VPN to ZTNA. After completing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access">initial configurations</a>, and once you deploy a connector agent on-premises, to enable quick access all you need to do is specify the IP address, IP address range, or FQDN and port number. You can then assign specific conditional access policies, which QuickAccess applies to ALL app segments you configured. For example, you can create a “myRDP app” and assign it an IP address-based app segment. You only need to provide a name for the private app, then select the connector you wish to use with the app, and then specify the IP address/range and port number. You can then access your destination by simply launching an RDP session from your remote client machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s no secret that the arrival of 5G technology will usher in a new wave of powerful business advantages. However, it’s also opening the door for an influx of threat vectors your enterprise will have to navigate along the way.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll help you learn the ins and outs of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/the-data-protection-puzzle-piece-for-telecoms/">5G security</a>. From what it is and why it’s at risk to how you can protect it, we’ll discuss everything there is to know about strengthening your 5G security architecture.</p>
 Understanding 5G 
<p>Building a solid 5G security posture requires a stable foundation. Let’s review the basics of 5G, how it compares to past generations, and why it’s so important for the future of enterprise networking.</p>
 What is 5G? 
<p>In short, 5G is the fifth generation of wireless telecommunication networks. As the latest in a line of innovations, each iteration has introduced its own set of new and impactful capabilities.</p>
<p>According to the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA), each generation of mobile network technology is released roughly <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/5g-security-and-resilience">every 10 years</a> — and with it, a host of benefits. For example, here’s how networking has evolved over the past few decades:</p>
 
 1980s: First generation (1G) wireless networks brought the very first cell phones. 
 1990s: 2G brought improved coverage and texting. 
 2000s: 3G introduced voice with data and internet access. 
 2010s: 4G long-term evolution (LTE) delivered faster speeds to keep up with increasing mobile data demand and rising network traffic. 
 Now: 5G technology will transform the digital landscape and serve as a catalyst for innovation, new markets, and economic growth. As tens of billions of devices are connected to the internet through 5G, these connections will empower a vast array of new services in healthcare, manufacturing, finance, artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure. Likewise, 5G connectivity is stepping up to handle enormous bandwidth demands and enable seamless live streaming at scale. 
 
<p>As of 2023, 5G wireless networks are available in most major American cities and towns. Globally, Italy ranks the highest on the <a href="https://5gobservatory.eu/observatory-overview/eu-scoreboard/">European 5G scoreboard</a>, with 99.7% of households having access to 5G connectivity. Looking ahead, telecom operators are continuing to invest heavily in the infrastructure necessary to expand their 5G reach and will do exactly that in the coming years.</p>
 How does 5G work? 
<p>As <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/5g_basics_infographic_508.pdf">CISA explains</a>, the 5G infrastructure enables billions of additional connected devices, sensors, and systems to intelligently access the network based on time sensitivity and computational needs.</p>
<p>Like 4G LTE, it’s based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), a process that encodes digital signals in a particular way to reduce interference. Alongside OFDM, 5G wireless networks leverage low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum, which requires the deployment of small cells and macro towers.</p>
<p>In simple terms, small cells act as signal repeaters that enhance speed, network capacity, and reliability in high-density areas. Macro towers are small transmitters installed on buildings and other structures, allowing telecom operators to support even more devices at faster speeds.</p>
 What’s the difference between 4G and 5G? 
<p>For all intents and purposes, 5G represents a marked improvement over previous networking technologies. According to CISA, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/risk-management/5g-security-and-resilience">5G offers</a>:</p>
 
 100x faster download speeds: A 3GB movie would take 40 minutes to download on 4G LTE, but only 35 seconds on a 5G network. 
 10x decrease in latency: 5G rapidly accelerates data response times, which can be as low as one millisecond. In other words, you can find what you’re looking for at a moment’s notice. 
 100x network capacity: 5G can handle a much greater volume of network traffic, allowing millions of connected devices to access the same network from the same area without failure. 
 
<p>From telemedicine to industry 4.0, these benefits translate into substantial productivity gains for use cases of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Notably, 5G also represents a significant improvement in terms of cybersecurity. Compared to past generations, it’s been designed from the outset with threat protection as one of its most foundational elements.</p>
<p>The fifth generation also introduces the concept of the Subscriber Concealed Identity (SUCI). In essence, 5G devices don’t send their true identity over the air; instead, they send an encrypted version — the SUCI. This concealment relies on public key cryptography, which encrypts the member’s ID to safeguard against vulnerabilities.</p>
 What is 5G security? 
<p>5G security can be defined as the convergence of cyber and physical security controls for the purpose of protecting an underlying 5G infrastructure. This includes securing hardware, software, network traffic, users, and data that access or flow through any 5G network.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Because It’s only a matter of time before security threats challenge your 5G deployment. Although the technology is relatively new, many bad actors are already attempting to exploit vulnerabilities. Given how many critical infrastructures rely on 5G networking, the stakes are growing larger by the day.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are several considerations to keep in mind:</p>
 
 Increased attack surface: With millions and even billions more connected devices, 5G is potentially vulnerable to larger and more sophisticated security threats. 
 IoT device vulnerabilities: IoT devices — especially personal, unmanaged assets — are inherently risky because security isn’t normally built-in by design. Each IoT device on a network represents another potential gap a hacker can expose. Worse yet, whether purposefully or not, organizations are adding new devices in troves. In fact, IDC predicts there will be <a href="https://blogs.idc.com/2021/01/06/future-of-industry-ecosystems-shared-data-and-insights/">55.7 billion</a> connected devices in the world by 2025. 
 Decreased network visibility: With 5G, our networks will only expand and become more usable by mobile users and devices. This means organizations have much more network traffic to manage. But, without a robust security solution, companies may not be able to gain the network visibility required to identify abnormalities or a potential attack. 
 Legacy infrastructure and untrusted components with known vulnerabilities: 5G builds upon previous generations and is currently being integrated with 4G LTE networks that contain legacy vulnerabilities. Some of these may affect 5G equipment and networks despite the integration of additional security features. 
 
 Strategies for a secure 5G network 
<p>Knowing your security gaps is half the battle when it comes to hardening 5G defenses. Let’s explore the possible threat vectors you may face and the various mitigation strategies at your disposal.</p>
 5G security vulnerabilities 
<p>Network slicing, equipment, and virtualized cloud-first configurations are all essential components of 5G infrastructure. However, they also represent important threats with the potential to compromise network security. Here’s a closer look at each one individually:</p>
 
 Network slicing is a configuration strategy that allows multiple networks to stack on top of a common physical infrastructure. Each “slice” of the network can be allocated based on specific needs or use cases. On the downside, this <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3697269/5g-network-slices-could-be-vulnerable-to-attack-researchers-say.html">increases complexity</a> and requires each slice to implement its own security requirements commensurate with its use case. A misconfigured network could allow denial-of-service, man-in-the-middle, and other attacks to slip through the cracks. Worse yet, the sheer scale of network slicing introduces billions of potential attack vectors, as a successful breach could infiltrate many slices or domains simultaneously. 
 User equipment (UE) refers to hardware intended for consumer use, such as a mobile phone or IoT device. In a 2022 study, researchers <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10024587">tested the impact</a> that UE-based Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks could have on 5G infrastructure. Not only did their results indicate that 5G networks are vulnerable to DDoS attacks, but a successful strike would prove devastating to network performance. 
 Virtualization and cloud services play a big role in 5G deployment. According to CISA, <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jul/17/2003260829/-1/-1/0/ESF%205G%20NETWORK%20SLICING-SECURITY%20CONSIDERATIONS%20FOR%20DESIGN,%20DEPLOYMENT,%20AND%20MAINTENANCE_FINAL.PDF">most networks</a> are instantiated on virtualized compute, network, and storage resources and leverage both private and public cloud platforms. This means they exist outside the walled perimeter of dedicated servers and protocols. Network functions are now performed by software, and software is hackable — therefore, 5G infrastructure built atop software code is susceptible to attack. 
 
 How to strengthen 5G security 
<p>As <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/tmt/5g/pwc-securing-5gs-future.pdf">PwC argues</a>, all participants in the 5G ecosystem — including mobile operators, network vendors, system integrators and end businesses — should agree to assess the health of every component before it’s permitted to connect to the network. Moreover, they should agree to limit or deny access based on this assessment.</p>
<p>In other words, a robust 5G security architecture must be built upon strict authentication. Accordingly, there are several best practice solutions for doing exactly that:</p>
 1. Zero Trust 
<p>A vital first step towards protecting any network is to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">implement a Zero Trust framework</a>. Eliminating implicit trust for all entities will reduce risk exposure across the board, as all components must first undergo a process of risk-based authentication. Only if they meet all access control requirements will they be allowed a network connection, thereby mitigating the threat of unauthorized access.</p>
 2. Public key infrastructure (PKI) 
<p>With an advanced PKI solution, organizations can use cryptographic keys to provide a secure foundation for 5G networking. PKI enables strong authentication procedures, as each entity is issued its own <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates">digital certificate</a> proving its identity.</p>
<p>Take the Entrust PKI portfolio, for example. Our <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/certificate-authority">Certificate Authority</a> solution simplifies certificate lifecycle management, allowing you to issue, revoke, or renew at scale. Reduce the risk of expired certificates poking holes in your security posture by automating the workflow in one transparent interface. Administrators can be automatically notified by email about certificates approaching expiration and can view certificates approaching key lifecycle events via the system dashboard.</p>
 3. Hardware security modules 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/hsm">Hardware security modules</a> (HSMs) should be used to generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys. This critical protection layer keeps keys out of plain sight where a threat actor could intercept them. More importantly, HSMs store high-value cryptographic assets in hardened, tamper-resistant devices, which is widely considered to be best practice. The use of HSMs such as Entrust nShield HSMs are recommended in national and regional standards such as the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Security in 5G Specifications.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In this episode, Drummond Reed, Director, Trust Services at <a href="https://www.gendigital.com/us/en/">Gen Digital</a>, gives a great overview of the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP), through its 7 Key Pillars.</p>
<p>For listeners of the SSI Orbit Podcast, you may recall Drummond talking about the TSP on some previous episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/converging-towards-a-common-trust-spanning-protocol-with-drummond-reed/">#41</a> &amp; <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/one-trust-spanning-protocol-and-many-trust-tasks-drummond-reed/">#45</a>). These initial episodes still remain great primers on the topic. But since those last episodes, lots of work has been done within the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> to start shaping what this ‘missing trust layer of the internet’ should look like. This podcast episode aims to use the recent <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">Mid-year Progress Report on the TSP</a> as a basis for the conversation.</p>
<p>Once again, Drummond is able to breakdown these somewhat technical concepts into easy to digest content, and does so as eloquently as usual.</p>
<p>As a side note, here is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/">Part 1</a> of the blog post series: Net of Insecurity that is referred to during the podcast discussion.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Drummond and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 Internet’s Broken State: Is the internet considered broken due to issues with security, privacy, authenticity, and confidentiality (SPAC)? How does this relate to the work in the digital trust space, especially with Trust over IP? 
 Trust over IP’s Role: How does the Trust over IP technology architecture address the internet’s shortcomings? Is the SPAC acronym a good framework for understanding the Trust over IP’s approach? 
 Design Principles of Trust Finding Protocol: During the design phase of the trust spanning protocol, were there any trade-offs or concessions made, especially in terms of security, privacy, authenticity, or confidentiality? 
 Pillar 1: Verifiable Identifiers: Explaining the importance of verifiable identifiers as the first key pillar in the design of the trust spanning protocol. 
 Interoperability and Identifiers: Will endpoints need to support the same types of identifiers for interoperability? How does one endpoint evaluate another’s capability to support a particular identifier? 
 Pillar 2: End-to-End Authenticity &amp; Confidentiality: How does the trust spanning protocol ensure both authenticity and confidentiality in communications? 
 Pillar 3: Direct Connections: How does the trust spanning protocol handle direct connections between endpoints using different types of channels? 
 Pillar 4: Routing via Intermediaries: How does the protocol handle routing through intermediaries to ensure privacy and security? What might a practical implementation of this look like in the future? 
 Pillar 5: Relationship Context Channels: How does the trust spanning protocol handle changes in the context of interactions between endpoints? 
 Pillar 6: Text and Binary Encoding: How does the trust spanning protocol standardize the way endpoints communicate using text and binary encoding? 
 Pillar 7: Trust Task Protocol Framework: What is the trust task protocol framework, and how does it relate to specific protocols for different types of trust tasks? 
 Conclusion and Future: What’s next for the trust spanning protocol? Are there any regulatory movements, like the Digital Markets Act, that might influence its development and adoption?

<p>I use the word “own” here figuratively, in the sense of taking responsibility for the consequences of biometric face matching.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kashmirhill.com/bio">Kashmir Hill</a>’s forceful new book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Face-Belongs-Us-Secretive/dp/0593448561">Your face belongs to us</a>” sets out the challenges posed by facial recognition technology for privacy, personal safety, law and order, even national security.&nbsp; She expertly stakes out the territory, for which there is no clear way to best respond.</p>
<p>There have been isolated regulatory initiatives to rein in facial recognition such as Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act 2008.</p>
<p>At the same time, biometric authentication has become normalised through smart phones. Here the technology is well managed and in my view benign, thanks to strict standards set by handset manufacturers and the FIDO Alliance that restrain biometric storage and matching to the secure elements inside personal devices.</p>
<p>Facial recognition for authentication is a hot topic in Australia. Here the federal government’s IDMatch facility includes a <a href="https://www.idmatch.gov.au/our-services#section-1">Face Verification Service.</a> And the recently released draft <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say">Digital ID Bill</a> incorporates various biometric safeguards, in anticipation of facially verified identification.</p>
<p>New laws to regulate new technologies is a familiar battleground. It seems that the same sort of public debates have come and gone for years, and reappeared. When a given technology has legitimate uses, the arguments are especially fraught.</p>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but I have been close to law reform since the late 1990s when electronic signature regulations emerged, and then through several waves of privacy reviews. I have learned the practical strength of technology neutrality and now laud the <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-regulatory-superpower-of-technology-neutrality/">superpower</a> of principles-based data protection. This regulatory philosophy leads to controls that are relatively resilient in the face of technologicl progress.</p>
<p>Given how difficult it is to write new laws, it’s important to make use of existing jurisprudence wherever we can. I call myself a regulatory conservationist – if there is such a thing.</p>
<p>In this regard, existing privacy law may contain a way to restrain facial recognition, at least in the predominant technology-neutral <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4426146">jurisdictions</a>.</p>
<p>Australia’s data protection authority, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) has led the way in extending the principle of collection limitation from direct to indirect collection. In looking at the way data analytics can generate personal information, the OAIC has issued this <a>guidance</a>:</p>
<p>“The concept of ‘collects’ applies broadly, and includes gathering, acquiring or obtaining personal information from any source and by any means. This includes collection by ‘creation’ which may occur when information is created with reference to, or generated from, other information” (italics added by me).</p>
<p>So this suggests to me that the generation of facial matches constitutes personal information collection and as such, needs to comply with data protection laws.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when a facial recognition service such as Clearview AI is used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These services hold databases of reference images and names (exactly how these databases are put together is another story). A query is sent to the service with an image of the target person, known in biometrics as a probe, which is run against the reference set.&nbsp; If a match is found, then a response is generated with the effect of adding a name or other identification to the probe image.</p>
<p>So here’s the thing. A record that associates an image of a natural person with their name is new personal data.</p>
<p>That record did not exist before the biometric match was made. And under technology neutral laws as we have seen, such a record can be deemed to have been collected by both the facial recognition service and the party making the query. How the record is then used is another matter. Even if the record is not used, the Collection Limitation principle may apply (and anyway, the facial recognition services probably do retain and continue to use the new match as part of their ongoing training efforts).</p>
[Note also that it is irrelevant if reference material is sourced from the “public domain” (by trawling web sites and social media as Clearview AI has done). The publicness of the reference material is not relevant to the case I am trying to make here. I know there are separate arguments that repurposing “public” images (for training biometric algorithms for instance) represents another sort of privacy breach.]
<p>This sort of remote identification is therefore subject to existing data privacy principles and laws where applicable. &nbsp;Such laws might mandate that the naming of a facial image be done only with the consent of the named individual. And the fact that sort of creation and collection is being offered would also have to be declared and explained in a privacy notice.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF57 rewards. DF58 runs Oct 05 — Oct 12,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 57 (DF57) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Sep 28, 2023 and ended 12:01am Oct 05. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF58 is live today, Oct 5. It concludes on Oct 12. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF58   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF58 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>The second half of September was jam-packed with exciting events for local-first, programming language theory, and distributed systems aficionados. First, <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> partnered with <a href="https://www.gradientretreat.com/">Gradient Retreat</a> to host <a href="https://lu.ma/trainjam2023">TrainJam</a>, a rail adventure to St. Louis, to attend the last 😭 Strange Loop conference. Then, at <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a>, Brooklyn gave a talk on IPVM and Fission's edge computing stack, and we attended the PWLConf co-located with Strange Loop (and co-organized by Fission Staff Researcher Zeeshan). Finally, we capped it all off with the <a href="https://lu.ma/localfirstswunconf-stlouis">LoFi Unconference</a>. Organized by ourselves, <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>, this sold-out event explored how we can bring local-first software into the hands of more users. </p> TrainJam <p>Departing from Seattle, fourteen engineers set out for St. Louis via the Empire Builder Line, sharing ideas, code, and coffee along the way. Here's a dispatch from Fission Protocol Engineer Brian, who rode the rails:</p><p>The TrainJam experience was a bit like being at a conference but with just the hallway track. We didn’t have structured sessions and instead spent time in ad hoc discussions about local first, offline, and many other topics.</p><p>One train jammer brought a 5G hotspot and distributed little mesh nodes to a few roomettes. In places where cell service was available, we had reasonably good Internet!</p>TrainJam sticker designed by Bruno Monteiro<p>The highlights for me were getting to know people and their stories. What have they worked on in tech? What do they work on now? One unexpected bonus was that sometimes you would take a meal with random other train riders. I heard great stories from folks riding the rails for travel and pleasure.</p><p>Also, I made a lot of coffee for folks. Amtrak coffee is pretty terrible, and I brought two pounds of coffee in preparation. My little barista setup ended up being quite popular. 😄</p> Strange Loop <p>Kicking off Strange Loop was the <a href="https://pwlconf.org/">PWLConf track</a>, co-organized and run by Staff Research Engineer Zeeshan Lakhani. </p><p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, presented on IPVM. Below is the abstract for her talk and the recording:</p><p>The advent of TCP/IP and the web produced an explosion of innovation by radically lowering the barrier to entry to networking. Thanks to recent technical and social innovation, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation. This talk presents UCAN Invocation and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). IPVM code runs anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly without pre-negotiation. Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed invocations, results, and workflows. This greatly lowers the complexity over traditional architectures (e.g. LAMP). Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) has better than linear scaling: the more it's used, the faster it is! As anyone can participate, it doesn't depend on the handful of data centres provided by large orgs: anyone can provide capacity (including in underserved regions like Africa and South America).</p><p>Fission Staff Research Engineer Zeeshan Lakhani had a unique role during Strange Loop as co-organizer of the <a href="https://pwlconf.org/">PWLConf</a>; an official speaker track this year. Here are his thoughts about PWLConf and StrangeLoop:</p><p>In all its grandeur, Strange Loop has been a special conference for me over the years. I’ve been attending since 2012 almost regularly; we started running PWLConf in 2016. </p><p>For me, Strange Loop is a time to see old friends, commiserate about the state of our world and technology, and try to find a few bits and pieces of inspiration for the future. Our track and the conference as a whole were amazing, and Alex Miller really put on one hell of a run. I can’t weigh in on any PWL talks (I’m an organizer, after all). But, I will give a big shout-out to Valeria de Paiva’s <a href="https://pwlconf.org/2023/valeria-de-paiva/">War Time Proofs and Futuristic Programs</a>, which beautifully wove lots of context, history, and theory.</p><p>Additionally, we had a lot of people wondering about Papers We Love’s plans for 2024. All I can say right now is, please fill out our <a href="https://zfrmz.com/dbTykoGvhN4dbthJskaP">survey</a>; more is to come!</p><p>From Brian:</p><p>At the conference, I volunteered with Zeeshan and the Papers We Love crew on the PWLConf track. </p><p>The opening talk by Andrew Black <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/why-programming-languages-matter.html">Why Programming Languages Matter</a> had great reflections on the languages he has worked on over the years, and he discussed some interesting aspects of usability and the design of new languages. His talk and the three after were absolutely packed. We had to track down additional chairs to seat the audience despite it being the largest room at the conference!</p><p>Mae Milano’s <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/programming-distributed-systems.html">Programming Distributed Systems</a> talk that followed immediately afterward was also excellent and felt like an overview of many of the topics we have covered in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey_Adz2pUZFQdw7sp2mSiSbV">Distributed Systems reading group</a>. </p><p>I stepped out of volunteer duty to watch Evan Czaplicki’s <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/2023/the-economics-of-programming-languages.html">The Economics of Programming Languages</a>. Evan invented the Elm programming language, which inspired me while I was learning to program. Evan has struggled over the years to find the best way to support work on Elm. Patronage worked well for many years, but corporate (mis)incentives have not always worked out. He compared Elm with other programming languages and how they are funded. It’s not great; corporate and patronage models seem the most successful, and mostly community and open source approaches have only succeeded in a few cases. (Python is one example.)</p> Lo-Fi Unconference <p>Nearly 100 attendees came to the TechArtista Downtown for a day filled with small-group discussions, demos, and lightning talks. The event brought together folks building frameworks or tools, developing local-first apps, or researching the area. Some attendees were new to local-first software development and wanted to learn more. Here are some insights about that day from Brian:</p><p>What a great gathering of interesting folks and projects! I presented a version of our <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/local-first-unconf-workshop-2023">ODD SDK workshop</a> that focused on local-only data with the option to make a Fission account to sync and persist data. We teamed up with <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> to demonstrate frameworks that focus on local-first apps. </p><p>One takeaway was that lots of folks are interested in local first! The event was sold out, with folks waiting to enter. A few folks listed themselves and their projects in a <a href="https://github.com/LoFiUnconf/stlouis2023">GitHub repo</a>. In addition, <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/%201">a community has formed</a> around LoFi with an active Discord server.</p>Todd explaining the LoFi Unconf logo design and conceptual background.Intro by Brooklyn of the LoFi Unconf frontiers. Privacy, trust, accounts, disorderly programming - some of the stuff to work on.Kicking off LoFi Unconf with Martin Kleppman presenting remotely.<p>All in all, our visit to St. Louis was invigorating. We connected with many talented builders with novel ideas that will undoubtedly push the field forward. Even though the curtain has fallen on Strange Loop, the community that has grown out of it is strong and will continue to thrive.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who joined us at our various events!

 CNP fraud is projected to account for 73% of all payment fraud in 2023; a whopping 57% increase on 2019. But, what’s the reason for the increase, and what can businesses do about it? 



 



<p>In recent years, card not present (CNP) fraud has become one of the most common types of payment fraud, especially in the online gambling sector. In fact, <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/card-not-present-fraud-payment">overall losses are expected to reach $9.49 billion</a> by the end of the year, marking an 8.5% increase on 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why CNP fraud is so common is because CNP transactions don’t require a physical card, just the details from it. Fraudsters can therefore steal and use the cardholder’s name, billing address, account number, CVV security code, and expiration date without needing to obtain the actual card. But online casinos are fighting back.&nbsp;</p>



 What is CNP fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Put simply, CNP fraud occurs when a fraudster steals someone’s credit card information for transactions that do not involve a physical card, such as over the phone or on the internet. It usually constitutes a criminal using someone else’s credit card information and is also seen as a form of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Understanding CNP fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can be detrimental to businesses and users in numerous ways. The most obvious is that the victim of CNP fraud may be unable to reclaim their lost money. If a cardholder is unable to file a chargeback successfully, then the responsibility for the fraudulent transaction passes to the gambling platform. What can make this scenario even worse is that if a gambling platform receives excessive chargebacks within a specific timeframe, its payment service provider may impose penalties on the operator or even terminate their contract.&nbsp;</p>



 How does CNP fraud occur?&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud occurs when a criminal acquires payment information from a cardholder without their permission and uses it to buy products or services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nowadays, criminals can easily buy ‘fullz’ (packages of individuals’ identifying information) through the dark web or obtain via phishing attacks or data breaches.&nbsp;</p>



 Online casinos and CNP fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>Online casinos rely solely on digital payments, so are considered prime targets for CNP fraud. As cardholders are not present during CNP transactions, it makes it all the more convenient for criminals to use stolen card details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casinos often deal with high transaction volumes, making identifying fraudulent transactions difficult. That alone gives rise to payment fraud in online gambling. A few signs that an online casino may be vulnerable to CNP fraud include a lack of proper security measures like SSL encryption and 2FA and a considerable number of chargebacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that not all casino platforms are equally vulnerable to CNP fraud since some have better payment fraud prevention measures in place than others.&nbsp;</p>



 What are CNP red flags to look out for?&nbsp; 



<p>Red flags for potential CNP fraud in online casinos include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Frequent chargebacks: Many chargebacks can be considered a clear sign of CNP fraud since players may be using stolen cards and later reporting unauthorized transactions.<br>  Large numbers of small transactions: Fraudsters may make several small transactions to test the validity of stolen card information.<br>  Failed transactions: Repeated failed attempts to verify payment information usually indicates fraudulent activity.<br>  Multiple accounts from a single IP address: Multiple accounts originating from the same IP address usually implies fraudulent activities, e.g., one individual using multiple stolen cards.<br>  Rapid deposits and withdrawals: Fraudsters often try to deposit funds, play a few rounds, and quickly withdraw their funds before their activity is detected.&nbsp;  



 How does CNP fraud impact online casinos?&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can have a significant impact on online casinos in numerous ways:&nbsp;</p>



 Financial losses.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can result in significant financial losses for casino platforms. Chargebacks are a common phenomenon in this type of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/fraud/">fraud</a>. If a platform receives significant chargebacks within a specific period, its payment provider may impose penalties or even end its contract.&nbsp;</p>



 Reputational damage.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud, once discovered, can severely damage the reputation of online casinos. Negative reviews and publicity discourage new users from joining, resulting in a decrease in revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Legal and regulatory consequences.&nbsp; 



<p>CNP fraud can lead to severe legal and regulatory consequences for online casinos. Operators may face hefty fines or even criminal charges if they are found to be negligent in preventing CNP fraud. The costs related to legal proceedings can be considerable, which further adds to the financial impact of CNP fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Can online casinos recover from the damage caused by CNP fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>While online casinos can recover from the reputational and financial damage caused by CNP fraud, it requires time and effort. For financial recovery, casino platforms need to implement strict CNP fraud prevention measures, such as anti-fraud software and multi-factor authentication. Operators can also work with payment service providers to reduce charges and potentially recover lost funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of dealing with reputational damage, casino operators can be transparent with their users regarding the steps they need to take to prevent fraud and offer compensation to those affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Preventing CNP fraud in online casinos.&nbsp; 



<p>Operators can implement various CNP fraud prevention strategies:&nbsp;</p>



 Robust identity verification. 



<p>Implementing robust identity verification processes like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC),</a> is effective in fraud prevention and can combat crimes like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>. KYC processes typically include document verification, which involves submitting government-issued identification documents that the online casino verifies. Biometric authentication, such as fingerprint scanning and facial recognition, is also effective in verifying the identity of users.&nbsp;Read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/importance-of-kyc-in-online-casinos/">importance of KYC in online casinos in our blog</a>.</p>



 Multi-factor authentication.&nbsp; 



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires users to provide multiple forms of authentication, such as a one-time password sent to their mobile phone, before accessing their account. MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of authentication. There are three main categories. Something you know, such as a password; Something you have, like a phone with an authentication app or one time passcode; and Something you are, such as a biometric feature like a fingerprint, face, voice, or other biometric piece of information. With MFA, users must present more than one of these factors, before gaining access to their account. This adds an extra layer of security to the conventional login process.&nbsp;</p>



 AI and machine learning solutions.&nbsp; 



<p>Emerging technologies like AI and ML can help operators combat CNP fraud. For example, AI-powered identity verification services can validate player identities by comparing submitted information with external databases, identity documents, and biometric data. This helps ensure players are who they claim to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Regular security updates. 



<p>Online casinos should regularly update their security measures for protection against CNP fraud. How often they should update their online casino security measures depends on factors including the size of the casino, the existing security measures, and the risk associated with fraud. However, operators must review their security protocols at least once a year. It is also important to note that operators must comply with anti-fraud laws like KYC and AML.&nbsp;</p>



 How can players protect themselves against CNP fraud in online casinos?&nbsp; 



<p>Players can protect themselves and prevent CNP fraud by the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Only signing up with licensed casinos<br>  Verifying their identity through the online casino’s KYC process<br>  Keeping their login information secure<br>  Following the casino’s fraud prevention policies and procedures<br>  Using security features such as multiple-factor authentication<br>  Frequently checking their accounts for suspicious activity or transactions<br>  Informing the online casino of any suspicious transactions or activity on their account&nbsp;  



 How online casinos can prevent CNP fraud while ensuring seamless gaming experiences.&nbsp; 



<p>As CNP fraud remains a serious threat to online casinos, operators must implement robust safety measures to prevent it. Online casinos can achieve this through the use of MFA processes, state-of-the-art fraud detection technologies such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">anti-spoofing facial recognition</a>, and secure payment gateways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, it is equally crucial to maintain a healthy balance between security and a seamless gaming experience for users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Preventing CNP fraud should be a top priority for operators to maintain their integrity and protect their bottom line.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Blockchain technology, though in the mainstream for less than a decade, has already seen a meteoric rise. The boom&nbsp;has been reminiscent of previous groundbreaking innovations like the printing press, the lightbulb, and the telephone. What the internet was for information, blockchain is for value.&nbsp;While price fluctuations of crypto and NFTs dominate headlines, the true potential of blockchain lies in its application to RWA (real-world assets) and securities. ERC3643</p>
<p>However, when dealing with RWA and securities, regulatory bodies worldwide have many requirements that must be abided by. But how do we enforce these guidelines while operating on a public blockchain infrastructure?&nbsp;The implementation of ERC3643 solves this&nbsp;problem.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 How RWAs are the next stage in the blockchain evolution 
<p>In the fledgling years of blockchain, many were led to believe that crypto and NFTs are the most transformational innovations to come out of decentralized technologies.</p>
<p>In fact, that couldn’t be further from reality. The reality is it doesn’t even come close to the global market cap of RWAs. According to&nbsp;<a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>, as of September 1st, 2023, the overall crypto market cap is&nbsp;$1.09T.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/for-digital-assets-private-markets-offer-the-greatest-opportunities/">report</a>&nbsp;titled: “For Digital Assets, Private Markets Offer the Greatest Opportunities” published by Bain and Co, the global real estate market alone&nbsp;exceeds ˜$330T.&nbsp;The overall crypto market size is about 0.3% of this market alone, not to mention the entire capital market.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>When combined with all private and public assets worldwide, RWA vastly surpasses the market cap of crypto, NFTs, and other blockchain subsets put together.</p>
<p>Blockchain is a transformative technology with numerous applications. Its potential is immense when tailored to RWA. The primary reason we haven’t unlocked the vast value and potential of these assets yet is their&nbsp;predominantly private nature. The private markets are notably fragmented and opaque. This results in operational inefficiencies, which blockchain aims to eliminate.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 The complexities and inefficiencies that exist in the private markets today 
<p>Traditionally, for investors in the private sector, addressing liquidity and finding a market for private investments is a critical challenge globally. Despite the potential for higher returns in the private sector, an illiquid investment can be a problem without an active market or willing buyers.</p>
<p>The main reason for this pitfall is the outdated and fragmented infrastructure of the current framework.&nbsp;Due to this limited infrastructure, the buying and selling process of private assets becomes inefficient.&nbsp;This leads to a significant liquidity discount and sometimes even the avoidance of transactions.</p>
<p>Whether you own a real estate property, a limited partner (LP) interest in a fund, or a stake in a private company, the seller has to take some arduous steps in order to find a willing buyer.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 The process includes: 
 
 Sourcing a buyer 
 Negotiating the terms of the sale 
 Conducting due diligence 
 Transfer of ownership 
 

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>The duration of the process involved in private market transactions can be prolonged. Often, it can span from several weeks to several months and, in some cases, even years. It is a high-cost and time-consuming process that would be improved if conducted on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The good news is in every fragmented market, there is room for innovation and disruption, which is where blockchain comes into play. A suitable blockchain standard must be specifically designed with&nbsp;smart contracts&nbsp;to meet regulatory needs and unlock the vast value of these assets.</p>
<p>When conducting the same activities on a blockchain-based system, many of these processes previously mentioned steps are achieved in a vastly faster and more efficient manner.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>Here is what is different in the four steps mentioned above in the traditional private market, versus when using ERC3643:</p>

		 
	 
     <a>Traditional Private Market</a>  <a>Private Market with ERC3643</a>      <a>  Traditional Private Market   </a>  
	 
		 
			 
 Sourcing a buyer:&nbsp;Personal networks, word of mouth, or by working with an intermediary, such as a broker-dealer or investment bank. 
 
 
 Negotiating the terms of the sale:&nbsp;This can involve several rounds of discussions and revisions before both parties agree on the terms of the sale. 
 
 
 Conducting due diligence: This can involve reviewing financial statements, legal documents, contracts, and other company records, as well as the buyer’s eligibility.&nbsp;The entire process requires document sharing via mail, emails, and sometimes even through a fax. 
 
 
 Transfer of ownership:&nbsp;This is the end of the lifecycle and where the ownership of the asset or&nbsp;security&nbsp;actually changes hands. In many cases, the ownership is contained in Excel sheets. In other cases, there is a clearing process; custodians of buyers and sellers have to ensure payment has arrived before transferring the ownership. 
 

		 
	 
    <a>  Private Market with ERC3643   </a>  
	 
		 
			 
 Sourcing a buyer:&nbsp;Once assets are published on the blockchain network, it is made available to interact with any applications on the same network, allowing asset holders to have direct access to a vastly larger amount of potential counterparties. It could be on a multitude of marketplaces, including centralized exchanges,&nbsp;decentralized exchanges, even using your security as a means for&nbsp;staking&nbsp;or collateralized loans, and more. 
 Negotiating terms of the sale:&nbsp;On the trading platforms, the negotiation is up to the market and supply and demand. On the platform, the investor is seeking a counterparty, not so much negotiating with one individual, making it a more streamlined process. For peer-to-peer trading, on-chain or off-chain negotiations can take place to reach an agreement. 
 Conducting due diligence:&nbsp;A verifiable due diligence certificate can be made available and embedded into the tokens. Moreover, counterparts’ eligibility can also be verified by smart contracts directly through verifiable credentials. The entire process is streamlined to improve efficiency while ensuring compliance. 
 Transfer of ownership:&nbsp;If the payment method is a token (stablecoins, tokenized cash, or crypto), the transfer/swap of tokens is instant without counterparty risk. The ERC3643 smart contract ensures transfers only occur when investor and offering rules are met, enabling peer-to-peer transfers, which was impossible before in the traditional world. 
 

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 How does RWA tokenization work? 
<p>We must ensure compliance since tokenized RWA are&nbsp;securities. In most jurisdictions, RWA must be owned by an investment vehicle, and investors will invest in the financial products that this vehicle structures, such as shares or debt. These financial products are securities that require enforced compliance based on existing regulations. This means that only certain investors can become asset owners (e.g., KYC’d European citizens). In Europe, the MiCA regulation clearly defines&nbsp;<a href="https://securities.cib.bnpparibas/markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation/">security tokens as securities</a>, necessitating adherence to MiFID, the existing securities regulations.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Comparing and contrasting the major token standards 
<p>When one uses the term “standard,” it refers to a&nbsp;predefined set of rules or guidelines tailored for a specific purpose. Such standards ensure consistency and uniformity, allowing diverse applications and assets to interact smoothly through the <a href="https://tokeny.com/how-we-are-building-an-interoperable-ecosystem-for-private-markets/">interoperability</a> offered by a blockchain network.</p>
<p>However, standards can bring certain limitations and when trying to utilize them for a specific purpose or use case. Take RWA, for example. A standard is needed that can potentially deal with hundreds of different jurisdictional securities laws for a multitude of parties, all automatically executable on-chain. That is no easy job to do.</p>
<p>Now that one has a good understanding of what a standard is, let’s break down some of the more commonly utilized standards like ERC20 and ERC721.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>ERC20</a>  <a>ERC721</a>  <a>ERC3643</a>      <a>  ERC20   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ERC20 is a permissionless token standard. It is the most commonly known and used standard today and defines a set of simple rules that developers can follow to create their own tokens on the Ethereum blockchain or any EVM-compatible blockchain.&nbsp;This standard relates to fungible tokens, meaning they are identical in both type and value. This feature enables their easy exchange on platforms like trading exchanges and for various similar functions. Any token and platform compatible with ERC20 are interoperable.</p>
 Common examples:&nbsp; 
 
 Tokens:&nbsp;WETH, BAT, USDC 
 Exchanges:&nbsp;Decentralized exchanges&nbsp;like&nbsp;Uniswap&nbsp;or&nbsp;Sushiswap&nbsp;are compatible with all ERC20 tokens 
 Other&nbsp;DeFi&nbsp;governance tokens:&nbsp;Aave, Compound 
 

		 
	 
    <a>  ERC721   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ERC721 is a popular standard employed in the non-fungible&nbsp;token (NFT) domain. Unlike ERC20 tokens, which are interchangeable with one another, ERC721 tokens are innately unique.&nbsp;Each token issued from the smart contract represents ownership over a specific digital asset. Their unique nature makes them ideal for applications like collectibles or any item that demands distinct representation.</p>
 Common examples&nbsp; 
 
 NFTs: Bored Apes, Cryptopunks, etc 
 Marketplaces:&nbsp;Opensea, LooksRare 
 

		 
	 
  <p>Important to understand: ERC721 is the specific standard utilized for innately unique assets on any EVM-compatible blockchain.</p>      <a>  ERC3643   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ERC3643 is a standard tailored for <a href="https://tokeny.com/permissioned-tokens-the-key-to-interoperable-distribution/">permissioned tokens</a>, allowing issuers and users to track the ownership of tokens and to program lifecycle management rules. It makes this standard perfectly suitable for securities tokenization,&nbsp;web3&nbsp;loyalty programs, or digital payment systems.&nbsp;Given the intricate regulations around securities, this standard is crucial for those aiming to tokenize RWA.</p>
<p>The primary distinction between RWA and ERC20/ERC721 tokens is that they are&nbsp;permissionless&nbsp;tokens and can be transferred to anyone. Moreover, it’s difficult to differentiate the identities of their users. In the securities realm, this is problematic because they can not be transferred to unidentified investors. Users must undergo KYC/AML checks and get qualified by issuers or their compliance agent before making an investment as required by law. Moreover, if RWA were freely traded by anyone on the blockchain, it would permit unrestricted buying and selling globally, which is not allowed in the world of securities.</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>ERC3643 tokens ensure that transfers can only happen when both investor rules and offering rules are met.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			<p>Notably, the ERC3643 token is not solely used for compliance. Instead, guarantees the rights and duties of different stakeholders via digital identities. This enables investors to prove their ownership and enforce rights even for offchain assets.</p>
<p>Moreover, securities have an extensive lifecycle, requiring many more functions than what the ERC20 standard provides. In order to accommodate the complexities, the ERC3643 standard provides more than 120 functions — 10 times more than ERC20 tokens — to bring control and automation for post-issuance operations, such as the ability to block or recover tokens. These functions empower issuers to carry out necessary operations and fulfill their regulatory obligations.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>So, the question is: “How do we combine the best of both worlds of an open blockchain network and compliance integrated, while protecting the privacy of the users?”</p>
<p>The answer to that is by embedding verifiable digital identities on-chain into the token via&nbsp;ONCHAINID.</p>
 Verifiable on-chain digital identities coupled with ERC3643 
<p>ONCHAINID is an open-source self-sovereign identity smart contract that enables tokens and applications to identify individuals and organizations, allowing them to enforce automated compliance and access digital assets all on-chain without intermediary intervention.</p>
<p>ERC3643 uses ONCHAINID to verify if users meet eligibility rules token issuers preset. ERC3643 tokens also link token ownership with users’ ONCHAINID instead of&nbsp;wallet&nbsp;addresses.</p>
<p>The eligibility rules are verified through credentials issued by an identifier. Token issuers are the one who decide which identifier they trust. For example, they can appoint a KYC provider ABC to be the identifier to check users’ eligibility A.</p>
<p>Once investors’ documents and information are verified off-chain by KYC provider ABC, a hashed/anonymous credential will be issued as proof of this user fulfilling eligibility A.&nbsp;The ERC3643 token this user invests in and acquires is directly checking their on-chain proof (credentials), determining their permissions.</p>
<p>This on-chain evidence directly correlates with the purchased security. Since everything operates on-chain, the smart contract has embedded rules that are automatically executed or denied.</p>
 Consider three investors: 
 
 Investor A:&nbsp;Completed KYC/AML and other onboarding requirements and invested in security X 
 Investor B:&nbsp;Same as Investor A 
 Investor C:&nbsp;Hasn’t completed onboarding but possesses a self-custody wallet 
 
 Now consider these scenarios: 
 
 Scenario 1:&nbsp;Investor A seeks a counterparty on a public blockchain to sell to Investor C. Due to the smart contract’s configuration, since Investor C isn’t verified, the transaction is declined 
 Scenario 2:&nbsp;Investor A looks for a counterparty on a public blockchain to sell security X to Investor B. The transaction is authorized and executed by the blockchain, as both Investor A and B comply with the smart contract’s guidelines 
 
<p>Thanks to embedding compliance rules on-chain into the token itself, investors are free to do as they wish with their assets as long as they abide by the rules.</p>
 Interoperable securities unlock liquidity 
<p>Imagine when RWA tokens can be used just like any other ERC20 while complying with regulations. It can open the door for global distribution to be connected and make peer-to-peer transfers as long as counterparts are verified users. It can also be used in&nbsp;DeFi&nbsp;to earn extra yields or borrow funds.&nbsp;Ultimately, the liquidity of RWA will be unlocked and facilitate financial inclusions.</p>
 The future of blockchain 
<p>Blockchain is entering a new era where regulation reigns supreme, and if issuers aren’t following any regulatory guidelines, the clock is ticking.</p>
<p>The forthcoming blockchain trend won’t be characterized by dramatic peaks and valleys but by enduring sustainability. Public blockchain networks are poised to revolutionize global capital markets.

    <a>  How does ERC3643 differ from other Ethereum standards like ERC20 or ERC721?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>While ERC20 and ERC721 standards cater to fungible and non-fungible tokens respectively, ERC3643 is tailored for permissioned tokens. This means it’s designed to integrate with real-world regulations and compliance requirements, making it ideal for RWA. It provides over 120 functions to offer control and automation, which are crucial for post-issuance operations of security tokens.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>  Why is regulatory compliance so important in the context of tokenizing RWA?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>Regulatory compliance ensures the legitimacy and security of tokenized assets, and it is a regulatory obligation of token issuers. Without adhering to regulations, there’s a risk of legal repercussions, loss of trust, and potential misuse or fraud. Especially with RWA, where assets have real-world implications and values, compliance ensures smooth operation and acceptance by traditional financial institutions.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>  What is ONCHAINID and how does it fit into the ERC3643 standard?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>ONCHAINID is a blockchain-based identity system. It provides a method to verify and embed digital identities directly on-chain without disclosing any private information, ensuring that investors and participants meet required regulatory checks without compromising their privacy. When coupled with ERC3643, it offers a comprehensive solution where RWA can be tokenized, traded, and managed on public blockchains while adhering to global securities regulations.</p>

		 
	 
    <a>  How do digital identities protect user privacy while ensuring compliance?   </a>  
	 
		 
			<p>Digital identities, when embedded on-chain, can anonymize user details while retaining necessary compliance attributes. So, while the specific identity of a user might be protected, their eligibility or permission to transact, based on regulatory requirements, is still verifiable on the blockchain. This ensures both user privacy and regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>With billions of dollars being exchanged online every day, identity has become the new battleground in the high-stakes world of internet fraud. In response to increasingly sophisticated and brazen attacks, identity solution providers like Ping are integrating threat protection tools to block account takeover (ATO) and new account fraud (NAF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From e-commerce sites to online banking, ATO and NAF by cybercriminals are very real threats to individuals and businesses alike. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2022/07/18/the-account-takeover-epidemic-a-wake-up-call-for-chief-digital-officers/?sh=3801b9a94196">Forbes</a>, ATO and NAF scams allow bad actors “to cash in without needing to steal a credit card before using it; they just take over a customer account ... It’s the digital equivalent of a gold mine.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With criminals employing aggressive tactics like password spraying and credential stuffing, it's more important than ever to strengthen your security posture with threat protection. Ping Identity has identified 5 key elements of threat protection that are used to stop ATO and NAF:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether it’s Henry the Navigator leading The Age of Discovery or Cristiano Ronaldo nailing a mid-air pirouette on the football field, Portugal has long been home to game-changing innovation—and digital identity is no different. Like most nations grappling with a challenging new world of cyber threats, it’ll need all the modernization it can muster.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, this postcard-perfect republic on the Iberian Peninsula has combined its natural beauty and Old World charm with cutting-edge technology to mold itself into a digital phenom. Thanks in no small part to the Portuguese government’s ambitious <a href="https://fagenwasanni.com/news/portugals-digital-transformation-a-statistical-overview-of-telecoms-and-broadband-services/45116/">digital transformation</a> agenda, investments in telecom infrastructure have led to one of the highest mobile broadband penetration rates in Europe, with some of the fastest and highest-quality online and mobile connections on the Continent.</p>
<p>Hell, even the most remote, 200-year-old beachside villa sports state-of-the-art connectivity. So it’s no wonder Portugal has successfully expanded on its appeal as a beloved holiday hotspot to rank among the world’s top destinations for <a href="https://www.timeout.com/news/its-official-portugal-is-the-best-country-for-digital-nomads-072523">digital nomads</a>—beating out Thailand, Spain, and others. Lisbon alone boasts a community of more than <a href="https://www.theportugalnews.com/news/2023-08-18/residency-solutions-launches-a-beacon-for-expatriates-and-digital-nomads-eyeing-portugal/80563">16,000 digital nomads</a>, with more arriving by the day. Unfortunately, cybercriminal networks got the memo.</p>
 Digital Identity: More Beach, Less Breach 
<p>In addition to its role as a leader in Instagram-worthy tourism and <a href="https://www.trafalgar.com/real-word/fado-portuguese-music/">Fado</a>, Portugal has been at the vanguard of the transition to digital identity for its 10 million citizens and foreign residents.</p>
<p>Building on the Portuguese national ID card scheme launched in 2007, the country’s <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/customer-cases/portugal-id">eID program</a> began providing a cryptographic means for citizens to access government and healthcare services in 2014. In 2019, it expanded the scheme to the private sector through an <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/portuguese-egovernment-solutions/news/portugals-pioneering-eid-solutions">API-based platform</a>. And earlier this year, officials announced the rollout of new, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202301/portugal-announces-new-biometric-id-card-card-issuance-ongoing-in-syria#:~:text=Portugal%27s%20new%20contactless%20ID%20card%20coming%20soon&amp;text=This%20means%20a%20card%20reader,obtained%20digitally%20using%20the%20card.">biometric-enabled ID cards</a> that facilitate digital and physical access to public services without needing a card reader to verify the data on the card.</p>
<p>It’s a smart move. Identity verification and proofing have long played an essential role in civilized societies. But providing a means for individuals to prove their identity in person to make purchases, manage finances, or receive entitlements and services is one thing. Doing the same in digital channels through authentication based on the usernames and passwords that emerged to protect online accounts has been another thing altogether.</p>
<p>Today, the global cybercrime economy finds appalling new ways to swipe and monetize users’ login credentials. Non-stop phishing and spyware attacks harvest credentials, leading to corporate data breaches that have compromised <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2023/04/buyers-beware-cybercriminals-target-your-online-credentials/">over 24 billion</a> login credentials and personal identity files in recent years. One recent study found <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/sale-of-stolen-credentials-and-initial-access-dominate-dark-web-markets">775 million logins</a> available through underworld “access-as-a-service” offerings on the dark web.</p>
<p>Thieves and state-sponsored threat actors leverage automated technologies to exploit these logins in credential-stuffing attacks that can test more than <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">22 trillion</a> password-and-username combinations in seconds. Once they’ve successfully pirated an account, these cyber-bandits can drain bank funds, steal personal identity information or corporate data to sell online, or impersonate account owners to defraud businesses and governments. More than <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-to-cost-the-world-8-trillion-annually-in-2023/#:~:text=Our%20report%20provides%20a%20breakdown,%24667%20billion%20a%20Month.">US$20 billion</a> stolen through this kind of fraud every day of the year.</p>
<p>For all of Portugal’s progress, its citizens’ identity information isn’t yet completely imperious to risk from ever-evolving cyberattacks. In just the past year, NATO documents of “extreme gravity” were exfiltrated from <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/nato-documents-stolen-in-breach-of-portuguese-armed-forces-found-for-sale-on-dark-web/">Portuguese government systems</a> and put up for sale in underworld marketplaces. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint/-operation-magalenha-attacks-window-brazil-cybercrime-ecosystem">credentials stuffing</a> has been a factor in recent attacks targeting Portuguese banking customers. And stolen credentials played a part in hacks that led to the leak of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-testify-new-football-30432046">18 million documents</a> involving embarrassing information about European football clubs and stars—including Portugal’s Ronaldo.</p>
 Portugal: A Head Start on Self-Sovereign Identity? 
<p>Typically issued by a national ID scheme, digital identity like Portugal’s is comprised of validated digital attributes and credentials designed for the digital world that are verified through cross-referencing government-issued physical world credentials—birth certificate, driver’s license, passport, etc.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of Portugal’s eID system is that it combines several pieces of identity in one. Citizens can use the country’s physical ID or the <a href="https://www.eipa.eu/epsa/id-gov-pt/">ID.Gov.PT</a> app for elections, health insurance, social security, and taxes without needing multiple usernames and passwords. In addition to authentication compliant with the European Union’s “Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust” (EIDAS) standards. More than 80% of the population uses the eID, making nearly <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/portuguese-egovernment-solutions/news/portugals-pioneering-eid-solutions">13 million</a> authentications per year.</p>
<p>Users can access and manage the equivalent of personal identity documents within a <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202101/privacy-and-security-concerns-from-digital-identity-growth-addressed-by-civil-society-governments">digital wallet</a>. By Portuguese law, none of this information can be saved on centralized servers, which puts the country in compliance with new EIDAS 2.0 standards that go into effect this fall and gives Portugal a head start on achieving <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/self-sovereign-identity-helps-users-own-data">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, SSI is predicated on distributed ledger technology to authenticate users without requiring personal data to be stored centrally on servers belonging to large public or private organizations where it can be hacked, ransomed, or otherwise exploited to commit fraud. Instead, individual users <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/digital-identity-a-centerpiece-of-the-digital-economy-problems-challenges-and-solutions">maintain full ownership</a> and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party. And they can control what information they share, for what purpose, and for how long.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>While there remains more to do, Portugal is heading in the right direction. The success of digital identity is predicated on the kinds of distributed models the country has been pioneering.</p>
<p>With distributed ledger-based systems, someone applying for a loan, for instance, can do so without revealing personal information or having a decision tied to outdated or inaccurate information stored on far-flung corporate servers. By leveraging immutable records of identity without storing them, financial services firms can comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and Know Your Customer (KYC) mandates without sacrificing privacy or security.</p>
<p>But according to a <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/digital-identity-a-centerpiece-of-the-digital-economy-problems-challenges-and-solutions">recent study</a> from the Global Government Forum, distributed, user-centric digital identity must also be easy to use and give citizens’ full control over their personal information. To be practical, digital identity wallets like those being deployed in Portugal and elsewhere should also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta</a> biometrics-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating virtually any attempt at identity spoofing or unauthorized access to accounts in a process that’s nearly effortless for users.</p>
<p>Far from a long-off vision, the architecture for this kind of digital identity is readily available today and is baked into <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/citizen-identity/">1Kosmos BlockID</a>. In light of the non-stop threats to personal data and privacy, it’s the kind of protection anyone navigating the Digital Age would welcome, including Portugal’s citizens—and their favorite football star.</p>

  <p>It's no secret that growing revenue through digital channels is a do-or-die business requirement. And the quality of digital experiences offered through these channels is a key factor in meeting your customer acquisition, engagement, and retention targets.</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) plays a strategic role in delivering superior customer experiences. For your customer journeys, this includes account creation, secure login without needless friction, and self-service activities, such as multi-factor enrollment and password reset, for example. But that's just the beginning.</p>

<p>Like most large companies, you likely have many different types of identities — all with slightly differing security and experience needs. These identities may include business partners, suppliers, employees, contractors, devices, and diverse populations of customers — and they often engage with separate brands or lines of business under the same corporate umbrella.</p>

<p>Your challenge: How do you efficiently and securely provide tailored experiences to each different set of identities? The secret lies in the untapped potential of your identity data.</p>

<p>In the world of IAM, a lot of attention has been paid to orchestrating the A and the M — access management — which are critical runtime procedures like user login (authentication), authorization, and all the things that go along with it, including MFA, passwordless, AI-driven protection from account takeover, and so on. But the I in IAM — the identity management piece of the puzzle — is typically less visible, yet it's now more important than ever. After all, it's the identity data, combined from many different sources, that is the prerequisite input to orchestrating great user experiences.</p>

 The need for dynamic, business-centric identity management 

<p>Business isn't static. It's a living organism that is constantly evolving — adding new lines of business and sunsetting others; bringing on new partners and suppliers; adapting go-to-market strategies; updating organizational structures, and so on. But most of today's identity management (not access management) systems were built for a bygone era. Their data structures are static and rigid. But as business evolves, it extends or changes the identity data requirements for your diverse populations of users. And traditional identity systems can't keep up in any way that comes close to being cost-effective.</p>

<p>This is why you need a dynamic, business-centric identity management system that has the flexibility to model your business realities and continuously adapt as your organization grows and changes. Because when your identity data is aligned with your business, you can deliver a highly differentiated set of digital experiences across all identity types — and reduce your operating costs along the way.</p>

 Learn how to use identity data to fuel business growth 

<p>In the coming weeks, we'll explore three specific actions you can take to harness the power of your identity data, including:</p>

  Connecting and centrally managing your identity data sources 
	 Enabling a business-centric identity model 
	 Scaling your identity data operations

  <p>As part of our mission to enable customers to manage access with least privilege, we’re excited to announce the general availability of two additions to Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM): PIM for Groups and PIM integration with Conditional Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Just-in-time access to privileged roles&nbsp;with PIM for groups 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of Microsoft Entra ID Governance and Microsoft Entra ID P2, PIM enables you to manage just-in-time access to privileged roles in Microsoft Entra, Microsoft 365 services, and Azure.</p>
<p><br>With the new just-in-time group membership capability, you can now further simplify least privilege access by enabling just-in-time access for all resources that support security group or Microsoft 365 group assignments. This includes support for a wide range of roles such as Microsoft Entra roles, Azure resource roles, Microsoft Intune and non-Microsoft application roles and services. IT admins, developers, and security experts can now activate group membership once and have access to all defined resources precisely when needed to do their job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PIM for Groups supports:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Just-in-time group membership and ownership. Members get access to various resources through the group membership, while owners can manage group properties such as membership. 
 Role-assignable and non-role-assignable groups, which removed the previous limit of 500 groups managed in PIM. 
 Security and Microsoft 365 group types.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enforce security requirements for activation using PIM integration with Conditional Access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a> allows you to apply granular policies to sensitive data and actions, going beyond app-level policies. By combining PIM with Conditional Access, you can now enforce specific requirements for PIM role activations, enhancing your security posture. During public preview, customers have leveraged this integration for various scenarios, such as: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Requiring strong modern authentication methods, using Conditional Access <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">Authentication Strengths</a>. 
 Requiring a compliant device for role activation. 
 Validating the user’s location through GPS-based named locations. 
 Blocking activation for risky users using Microsoft Entra ID Protection. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In today's perpetually changing digital landscape, the importance of identity within the enterprise has taken center stage.&nbsp; As both workforce and consumer demands grow, there's a critical need for robust solutions that can manage the entire identity lifecycle, securely linking an individual's identity with who they claim to be.</p>  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> provides a comprehensive framework for managing and securing the modern user lifecycle. It ensures that organizations have the confidence that the identity of each individual aligns with who they claim to be, providing seamless validation and protection at every stage of the identity lifecycle.</p> 
 Why Is There an Increasing Need for Identity Assurance?  
<p>Organizations typically use point-in-time and ad-hoc processes to establish an individual’s identity and then assert this identity through authentication. This does not meaningfully address the continuous changes that occur in terms of attack vector, methods or risk factors. Key moments in time such as changes in the individual’s status, high-risk events like resetting credentials, or changes to the threat landscape, challenge the legacy process to establish an individual’s identity. Nearly half of organizations <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/95392-of-businesses-dont-use-a-user-verification-policy-for-password-reset-calls-to-it-service-desks">lack a user verification policy for password reset calls</a> to IT service desks. Identity assurance takes a comprehensive, integrated approach to address these limitations and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Identity and authentication attacks impact a wide range of industries, but some are more frequently targeted due to the potential for financial gain or access to sensitive information. Industries most affected include:</p> 
  
  Financial Services: Banks, credit card companies, and fintech firms are prime targets for identity theft and authentication attacks. Cybercriminals aim to gain access to financial accounts, steal funds, or commit fraud.  
  Critical Infrastructure: Including energy and utility companies, oil &amp; gas, supply chain and 13 other critical infrastructure verticals as defined by CISA are susceptible to attacks that can disrupt critical services, compromise sensitive data, and potentially lead to widespread blackouts or damage.  
  Hospitality Industry: Hotels and restaurants make attractive targets because of the valuable guest data they collect and maintain, including payment details, addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive information.  
  E-commerce and Online Marketplaces: Online marketplaces are frequently targeted by attackers aiming to compromise user accounts, engage in fraudulent transactions, and steal personal information.  
  
 What Is the Difference Between Identity Assurance and Authentication?  
<p>Authentication is primarily concerned with verifying identity at the point of access, typically for a specific session or transaction. It is the daily or multi-daily process of verifying the credentials of an entity based on the presented information, such as biometric data (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition), smart cards or tokens. It answers the question, "Is this user who they claim to be right now?"&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance goes beyond authentication. It incorporates authentication as one of its components but also includes key complementary identity technologies and processes that together create a comprehensive and continuous trust framework. Identity Assurance involves a comprehensive assessment of identity, often incorporating factors like identity verification (also referred to as identity proofing), continuous monitoring, and risk assessment. It is not limited to a single transaction or access request, but extends to the overall trustworthiness of an identity over time, and is invoked at specific “moments in time” such as onboarding a new employee or completion of a high risk transaction.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 How Does Identity Assurance Work?  
<p>1. Authenticate</p> 
<p>A systematic Identity Assurance approach is built on a foundation of strong, phishing-resistant authentication, which completely eliminates passwords across populations, applications and locations. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">Passwordless authentication</a> that is based on FIDO2 standards replaces passwords with passkeys and is considered the gold standard for phishing-resistant authentication by CISA, the OMB and other industry bodies. This strong authentication is used for daily access to organizational systems and resources.</p> 
<p>2. Verify</p> 
<p>Before any type of access can be provisioned, the person’s identity needs to be established and verified. Under an Identity Assurance model, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-verification-vs-authentication">identity verification</a> is an automated and ongoing process that is integrated into manager and help desk workflows. The verification process generally leverages multiple techniques, such as document proofing, biometrics and database verification and ideally includes additional measures such as video verification through a live video feed and manager attestation. It’s critical that the process does not use passwords or knowledge-based factors at any point.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>3. Monitor</p> 
<p>Complete assurance is maintained throughout the employee or customer lifecycle by <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">monitoring for risky or unusual behavior</a> on a per-user basis through the use of a risk and policy engine. Risks can be determined based on either the user behavior or changes in the overall threat landscape. Upon detecting an increased level of risk, the system can alert or invoke a re-authentication or re-verification based on defined policies.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>4. Unify</p> 
<p>Comprehensive Identity Assurance unifies all elements of the user lifecycle from the first point of contact with the user through offboarding. This eliminates security gaps caused by manual or disconnected processes.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Are the Benefits?  
<p>Identity Assurance takes a holistic view toward identity security, uniting a currently fragmented landscape. This creates many improvements for organizations implementing this approach, including:</p> 
  
  Preventing credential-based attacks: Weak authentication accounts for more than 60% of all breaches but many organizations struggle to even implement legacy MFA due to the challenges with the user experience. Identity Assurance is built on the foundation of strong authentication, eliminating one of the largest attack vectors while improving user experience and accelerating adoption.&nbsp;  
  
  
  Continuous assurance: With identity as the new perimeter and a strategic imperative for the business, organizations need to know which of their employees and customers are accessing what resources and that the identity presented truly matches the individual providing it.&nbsp; The risk associated with an individual continuously changes as they perform new actions or take on new responsibilities and as the threat landscape continues to evolve.&nbsp; Identity Assurance complements the strongest authentication with continuous monitoring that utilizes risk signals from endpoint, cloud, and mobile sources. &nbsp; Risky behavior can be mitigated by forcing the user to reauthenticate or even reverify their identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
  
  Business acceleration: Identity Assurance reduces risk and accelerates the business across all parts of the employee lifecycle. For employers, it directly improves the employee onboarding experience and the interactions that the employee has with the help desk and other identity-related interactions. For consumers, it eliminates processes where the consumer needs to physically interact with an organization (ie: speaking with a teller at a bank to get verified). By substantially reducing identity risk to the organization, it also enables organizations to securely and confidently make changes that save on costs.  
  
 Identity Assurance Best Practices  
<p>Here are some guidelines to get you started in building your own Identity Assurance approach.&nbsp;</p> 
1. Start with the strongest authentication
<br> 
<p>Make sure you deploy strong, phishing-resistant authentication based on the FIDO passkey standard.</p> 
2. Enhance security with integrated identity verification/proofing
<br> 
<p>Identity proofing should be integrated with ongoing authentication processes and risk-based analysis, rather than performed only at specific points in time.&nbsp;</p> 
3. Create a password-free employee or customer lifecycle&nbsp;
<br> 
<p>Integrate proofing and provisioning into the onboarding process such that people never have to use a password.</p> 
4. Take steps to prevent pre-employment fraud
<br>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 26th September to 2nd&nbsp;October <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we bring clarity to the key regulatory developments influencing the world of cryptocurrency.</p><p>In this issue, we explore Brazil’s responsive strategies to rising crypto engagement and the United States’ initiatives for clearer transactional insights. We also delve into Hong Kong’s evolving stance on stablecoin regulation and review the global efforts by the World Federation of Exchanges to standardize procedures in crypto trading platforms. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Global Regulatory Roundup: A Convergence of Oversight and Innovation <p>Brazil: With Brazil experiencing a crypto boom, the Central Bank found itself walking on a tightrope, as it has to tighten regulations around digital assets without stifling innovation. A 44.2% surge in crypto engagement prompted it to look closer at stablecoins and refine frameworks to mitigate risks and ensure compliance, striving for equilibrium between innovation and oversight.</p><p>The United States: Representative Don Beyer is championing legislation to enhance clarity in crypto transactions by mandating the disclosure of internal asset flows by exchanges. This move seeks to fortify the integrity and reliability of digital asset transactions, carving a path to a more secure and well-organized crypto ecosystem.</p><p>Hong Kong: Keeping in line with its efforts to construct a solid regulatory environment for stablecoins, Hong Kong intends to publish definitive guidelines by 2024. This pursuit reflects the region’s dedication to assimilating digital assets effectively within its financial domain, offering a platform for innovation while maintaining stringent regulatory practices to safeguard market stability.</p><p>International: The World Federation of Exchanges outlines six foundational principles aiming to standardize operations across crypto trading platforms. It highlights the necessity of parallel regulatory approaches for comparable activities in the crypto and traditional financial sectors, with an eye on sustaining market integrity and secure, responsible growth in the crypto industry.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of these significant developments to see how they may impact the broader crypto ecosystem.</p> US Legislative Push for Transparent Crypto Asset Flow: A Closer Examination <p>The proposed legislation by Rep. Don Beyer seeks to mitigate risks in the crypto space by enforcing enhanced transparency around asset flows within major exchanges.</p><p>This legislative initiative necessitates recording internal crypto transactions in regulated repositories, a move designed to standardize internal record-keeping and reduce susceptibility to fraud and manipulation.</p><p>Such uniformity in transaction reporting could serve as a protective layer for investors and consumers, ensuring that the variances in internal record-keeping don’t compromise the security and integrity of digital asset transactions.</p> Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects <p>Investor Protection:</p><p>The mandatory reporting of internal transactions can significantly minimize risks associated with inaccuracies and inconsistencies in transaction recording, thereby safeguarding investor interests.</p><p>Market Integrity:</p><p>Uniform reporting and record-keeping can uphold the reliability and authenticity of transactions, reinforcing the credibility of the crypto&nbsp;market.</p> Negative Aspects <p>Operational Strain:</p><p>The legislation could impose additional compliance burdens, necessitating substantial adjustments in operational practices and inducing potential delays in transaction processes.</p><p>Privacy Concerns:</p><p>The mandatory sharing of transaction data may raise apprehensions regarding the confidentiality and privacy of user information and transaction details, potentially leading to reluctance among prospective participants.</p> Regulatory Evolution Amid Rising Crypto Adoption: Brazil’s Proactive Approach <p>With Brazil experiencing an unprecedented surge in cryptocurrency adoption, reflected in a 44.2% increase in crypto imports, reaching approximately $7.4 billion from January to August 2023, it finds itself at the intersection of innovation and regulation. The Central Bank of Brazil, recognizing the metamorphosis of stablecoins from investment vehicles to transactional tools, is keen on recalibrating its regulatory stance to curb potential financial misdemeanors.</p><p>Simultaneously, Brazil is not shying away from embracing the digital asset revolution. The unveiling of a Central Bank Digital Currency, Drex, and enabling cryptocurrency for tax payments via Banco do Brasil underscore the country’s commitment to integrating digital currencies into the financial fabric.</p> Impact on Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects <p>Market Maturity:</p><p>Regulatory advancements and governmental adoption can signal market maturity, potentially attracting more sophisticated and institutional investors to the Brazilian crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>Consumer Protection:</p><p>The enhanced regulatory environment aims at providing a safer ecosystem for consumers, potentially reducing fraud and enhancing the overall trust in digital&nbsp;assets.</p> Negative Aspects <p>Innovation Dilemma:</p><p>The intensified regulatory scrutiny may impose barriers on creative initiatives and could potentially deter small-scale innovators and startups from entering the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Privacy Concerns:</p><p>The development and adoption of state-backed digital assets like Drex could raise concerns over user privacy and financial autonomy, potentially influencing user preferences and market dynamics.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Conclusions 
 
 The SelfKey DAO - Benefits and How to Become a Member 
 Introduction to the SelfKey DAO 
<p>With a focus on digital identity security and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID), SelfKey DAO’s vision is to become a network of individuals with the common goal to contribute to a more secure decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As opposed to some centralized systems, which rely on a single authority to control and manage the private data of all individuals which take part of it, SelfKey DAO strives to have no centralized authority. The aim is to maintain fairness, transparency and equality among its members, by encouraging every individual to participate in the governance process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey DAO is focused on minimizing private data exposure during engagement between individuals online. The intent is to enhance digital identity security and mitigate the risks associated with data breaches and identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a more in-depth presentation of the SelfKey DAO, please visit the following <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">link</a>.</p>
 How to become a member of the SelfKey DAO 
<p>In order to become a valued member of the SelfKey DAO you must fulfill certain requirements. For instance, you must be of legal adulthood in your respective country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, you must own a SelfKey iD, which you can obtain simply by visiting this <a href="https://selfkey.org/">link</a> and connecting your digital wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that in order to obtain a SelfKey iD, you must provide legal, authentic documents and a selfie as proof of individuality. The purpose of this is to preserve digital security within the DAO.</p>
 What is a SelfKey iD? 
<p>A SelfKey iD is a revolutionary method of digital identity management aimed at enhancing your digital security through the minimization of data sharing, or through the use of zero-knowledge filters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a SelfKey iD, you may participate in the SelfKey DAO and enjoy the benefits which come with owning and using one, such as the possibility to vote the unlocking of the SELF token.</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey iD owners may qualify for and mint SELF tokens by participating in certain actions aimed at enhancing the security, well-being and overall balance of the DAO.</p>
<p>What makes a DAO thrive is consistent, active participation from its valued members. Therefore, SelfKey DAO provides this opportunity to its esteemed members to qualify for more SELF by taking part in the Bug Bounty.</p>
 The Bug Bounty&nbsp; 
 What’s the Bug Bounty? 
<p>SelfKey DAO presents the Bug Bounty initiative, inviting members to actively spot and report technical glitches, errors, or bugs within SelfKey DAO products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This endeavor seeks to foster community involvement, ensuring SelfKey DAO’s tools function optimally. It may not only enhance product reliability, but participants also stand a chance to qualify for additional SELF tokens.</p>
<p>In the Bug Bounty, members can submit errors they stumble upon while using SelfKey DAO products.</p>
 Who can submit bugs? 
<p>This opportunity is exclusively available only to eligible members of the SelfKey DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that in order to benefit from this engagement proposal, you must be a SelfKey iD owner, otherwise you will not qualify for SELF tokens.</p>
 How to submit bugs? 
<p>At the moment, active members can only submit bugs via the official SelfKey DAO discord group. If you aren’t part of it, you are welcomed to join by clicking on the following <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mtfrm4pw">link</a>.</p>
<p>There is a dedicated channel on discord where you can submit errors or bugs and in which you can open a <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/897002577831526460/1154686519525789756">ticket</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please take note of the following requirements before submitting a bug report:</p>
 
 Make sure that the bug isn't already listed in the <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/897002577831526460/1154686899907199027">known-bugs</a> channel. Support will not take duplicates into consideration. 
 Provide a detailed step-by-step walkthrough and screenshots for bug reproduction. The report needs to be clear and contain precise information on the error. 
 Please include essential technical details, such as OS and browser versions, with your report. 
 Only bugs found on app.selfkey.org and selfkey.org web apps will be accepted at the moment. 
 
 How will support handle the bug reports? 
<p>After you’ve made sure you have correctly submitted a bug report, please wait patiently for support to handle the process. If your submission respects the requirements listed above, you will be informed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Support will check and determine if you qualify for SELF tokens, including the amount of SELF you may be eligible for if your submission is accepted. The severity* of the bug you’ve reported will have a huge influence on determining how much SELF you may qualify for:</p>
 
 For one minor bug - 1 SELF 
 For one medium bug - 3 SELF 
 For one critical bug - 10 SELF 
 
<p>*Please note that support will determine the severity of the bug.</p>
<p>Be aware that the quantity of SELF tokens you may be eligible for bug report submissions may vary over time. Stay updated and continue contributing to ensure you benefit from this initiative.</p>
<p>Additionally, if support determines you qualify for SELF, you will see the respective tokens in the DApp.</p>
<p></p>
 Other Ways To Qualify For SELF Tokens 
<p>Given that decentralization is against having a single authority control and manage the whole system, SelfKey DAO values participation from all members. The purpose is to include members by inviting them to contribute to the development of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, SelfKey DAO has opened another opportunity for participants to qualify for SELF tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated above, you must be a SelfKey iD owner in order to participate in the SelfKey DAO and benefit from the privileges it offers. By introducing an eligible member to the SelfKey DAO, you may qualify for more SELF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is indeed as effortless as that - simply invite another eligible member to become part of the thriving SelfKey DAO, and you may be eligible for SELF tokens yourself.</p>
 Conclusions

<p>Since the term ‘Zero Trust’ was coined back in 2010, Zero Trust has become the de facto cybersecurity industry paradigm. And for good reason - understanding security broadly through the lens of trust in users ultimately better protects your organization’s resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Zero Trust is a journey: one that hinges upon how well you can truly evaluate trust in a user when handling their access requests day in and day out. Continuous Adaptive Trust is the key step to achieving Zero Trust Architecture. Moving to a model of Continuous Adaptive Trust, one where trust in users is repeatedly evaluated and reevaluated, is worth striving for in the journey towards Zero Trust with best-defined trust with users for user protection.</p>

 This data challenge took NFL player performance data and fantasy points from the last 6 seasons to calculate forecasted points to be scored in the 2024 NFL season that began Sept. 7,&nbsp;2023. <p>AI / ML offers tools to give a competitive edge in predictive analytics, business intelligence, and performance metrics. Fantasy Football is a popular pastime for a large amount of the world, we gathered data around the past 6 seasons of player performance data to see what our community of data scientists could&nbsp;create.</p><p>The task at hand was the following:</p>  Conduct EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  Implement Feature Engineering  Build a Model to predict next season’s&nbsp;scores  Evaluate the Model’s performance in metrics like RMSE, MAE (Mean Absolute&nbsp;Error)  Submit a Final Prediction   Winners <p>The winning reports are available to download in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and are summarized below:</p><p>1st place ($2500): Mohammad&nbsp;Jamali</p><p>Report + Prediction is available for download via: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:79219d53c70e285c0ad607fa71fadcc170491f972220de91747520c71416daa4">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:79219d53c70e285c0ad607fa71fadcc170491f972220de91747520c71416daa4</a></p><p>Mohammad took gold in this challenge to predict the scores of NFL players in fantasy football. This report took the data set provided in the challenge, as well as external data feeds and alternative sources. In the link above, you will find great detail in data visualization, script explanation, use of neural networks, and several different iterations of predictive analytics for each category of NFL&nbsp;player.</p><p>2nd Place ($1500):&nbsp;Goblin</p><p>This report is available for download via: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:3d642c18c5d3e044a2b9c501af7b5bb91f0258e48f22c9eaaa63f464bc51b803">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:3d642c18c5d3e044a2b9c501af7b5bb91f0258e48f22c9eaaa63f464bc51b803</a></p><p>Prediction dataset: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:f38ec66f009d8ff88f8a10d394d38804da3d51bc5610ae6b21166547e50f7f2f">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:f38ec66f009d8ff88f8a10d394d38804da3d51bc5610ae6b21166547e50f7f2f</a></p><p>Goblin’s report differentiated from others off the bat by immediately identifying missing values in the dataset provided for this challenge. The predictions above include value factors of players' years of experience, age, BMI, and team to influence the task of predicting player performance scores. Another advantage this report gives is yearly positional averages for the dominant point scorers on a given fantasy team (Quarterback, Running Backs, Wide receivers) which supports the prediction report seen above for download.

There’s a long tail, indicating that only a few players score exceptionally high points per&nbsp;game.</p><p>2) Player Experience (Age) vs. Fantasy Points Per Game: There’s no clear linear relationship between age and fantasy points per game. However, we do see a wide distribution of points across all age groups, with younger players (around age 25) having some of the highest&nbsp;scores.</p><p>Goat displayed fascinating feature engineering in this data challenge and chose to base the predictive analytics model on the following attributes:</p><p>completions_per_game and attempts_per_game</p><p>passing_yards_per_game</p><p>passing_tds_per_game</p><p>Interceptions_per_game</p><p>Passing_air_yards_per_game</p><p>passing_yards_after_catch_per_game (YAC)</p><p>Rushing_attempts_per_game</p><p>Rushing_yards_per_game</p><p>Rushing_tds_per_game</p><p>Receptions_per_game</p><p>Targets_per_game</p><p>Receiving_yards_per_game</p><p>Receiving_tds_per_game</p><p>Receiving_yards_after_catch_per_game</p><p>receiving_air_yards_per_game</p><p>For the performance of this model, initially, 5-fold cross-validation was performed on the data spanning from 2016 to 2022. This method was chosen to rigorously assess and fine-tune each model’s performance using a comprehensive range of hyperparameters. By leveraging cross-validation, we ensured the model’s assessment wasn’t reliant on a singular data split.

			 Ali Naci Arbak is a Senior Software Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I’m Ali. I was born in 1997 and currently reside in Istanbul, where I work as a software developer at Tokeny. My journey into programming began during my primary school years when I aspired to create my own game modes. Determining my career path at a young age made things easier. As I entered high school, I made the decision to fully commit to programming, kickstarting my career with freelance projects. Since then, I have worked in various domains and technologies, and my ongoing journey has now led me to blockchain.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>A few years ago, I had no experience with blockchain, but some friends and I decided to start a project using blockchain technology. We began developing smart contracts, and I became really interested in it. That’s when I decided to explore opportunities in this field and started researching blockchain companies. My main criteria were finding a company that was solving real-world problems with meaningful products. Tokenization is crucial in bringing blockchain to the financial industry, and Tokeny is a leader in providing the technology for it. It seemed like a perfect fit for me 😊.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>One thing that stood out to me during the interviews was that everyone was sincere and clear. I didn’t hear any empty buzzwords, which I appreciated. Now that I am an employee, my experience with internal communication has been just as good. We’re a team that works well together, and it’s easy to reach out to anyone for help when needed.</p>
<p>Our product is based on cutting-edge technology, so there’s a lot of room for learning and self-improvement. On top of that, since blockchain is a field that’s always evolving, we have the chance to help shape industry standards. We’ve already made progress with the ERC-3643 protocol, and I believe we’ll achieve even more with ONCHAINID and the new solutions we’re developing. It’s truly exciting to be a part of all this.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream is that people can work when they want, where they want, and how much they want, rather than working out of necessity. They should have the time and freedom to pursue their personal goals and fulfillment. This dream may not be a reality today, but with the progress of artificial intelligence and automation, it might be achievable in the future, perhaps a century from now. Of course, this depends on how well we distribute resources fairly and justly.</p>
<p>When the technical limitations are no longer an issue, and human labor in production becomes less necessary, I’d like to see where humanity goes.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me about Tokeny’s future is the potential of tokenization to become increasingly prevalent in financial markets and everyday life as time goes on. Having entered the industry during its early stages and contributed to solutions, I believe that we can play a crucial role in this development and make significant contributions to the adoption of blockchain in the industry. Being a part of a company with the potential to become a unicorn is just a bonus! 😊</p>

 Introducing WalletConnect V2: Discover the New Upgrades 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in September 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we’re firm believers that accelerating mass adoption doesn’t mean drowning issuers and users in the complexities of blockchain. It’s about offering a user-friendly experience that mirrors the platforms and interfaces they already know.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we’ve integrated blockchain wallets in a way that’s transparent to the end user. Moreover, we’re thrilled to support connections to third-party protocols, like WalletConnect, opening doors to a broader spectrum of blockchain applications.</p>
<p>For those new to it, WalletConnect is a protocol enabling users to link their blockchain wallets to decentralized applications (DApps) via a straightforward QR code scan — all without exposing their private keys.</p>
<p>With protocols like WalletConnect, Tokeny’s platform readies and verifies the blockchain transaction, then forwards the prepped transaction to the selected wallet provider. This allows customers to review and authorize it.</p>
<p>Here’s a practical guide for clarity:</p>
<p>Background context: Investor 1 has invested in company X and stores their shares in a self-custody wallet on their computer. MetaMask is an example of a popular wallet.</p>
<p>Step 1: The investor holds their shares in their self-custody wallet that is connected to Tokeny’s platform</p>
<p>Step 2: The investor is seeking liquidity and sees that a certain decentralized exchange is an eligible platform to sell/swap their shares</p>
<p>Step 3: The investor goes to the decentralized exhange’s website, receives the QR code then scans the QR code directly from Tokeny which creates a secure ‘bridge’ between Tokeny and the decentralized exchange</p>
<p>Step 4: Once the secure connection is established, the investor is prompted to confirm the transaction details on their self-custody wallet, ensuring that the correct amount and share type are being transacted</p>
<p>Step 5: After verifying the transaction details, the investor confirms the sale or swap on their wallet</p>
<p>Step 6: The decentralized exchange processes the transaction, updating both the exchange’s ledger and Tokeny’s platform to reflect the new status of the investor’s shares</p>
<p>Here is a visual representation of what it could look like:</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Excitingly, WalletConnect’s team has elevated the experience even further. They’ve recently launched V2, and we’re elated to declare our successful migration, making the new updates accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse into V2’s enhanced offerings:</p>
 
 Multi-Chain Support: Embracing all EVM-compatible blockchains and more 
 Increased Session Duration Times: Enhance stability with prolonged session durations, minimizing disconnections 
 Improved User Experience: While the interface’s visuals remain consistent, users will notice a swifter, more dependable, and streamlined experience 
 
<p>With these upgrades, our users and investors can seamlessly connect to a wide range of supported blockchain applications using WalletConnect, all directly from their self-custody wallet.</p>
<p>We continuously refine our tech stack and integrations to provide an unparalleled tokenization platform for the future of finance to ultimately benefit all of our users.</p>
<p>Thank you for staying updated with us. Looking forward to next month’s edition!</p>

<p>This summer, we kicked off the beta program for YeshID, the all-in-one identity management tool for growing organizations. We invited participants to help us build the future of identity, access, and application management for small- and medium-sized businesses. But there was a catch — you had to talk with us. We realized this was a bump in the process and potentially scary because you might think we were going to sell something to you.</p>
<p>We’ve onboarded more than 20 companies to the beta, ranging from faith-based nonprofits to financial technology companies. The only stipulation to join is that they run on Google Workspace and have fewer than 250 employees. Our beta members do vastly different things and are different sizes, but we’ve discovered that they all have three things in common:</p>
 
 The people who are running Google Workspace access to the apps their companies use are strapped, and this isn’t their only responsibility. We’ve found they’re split into two camps. There’s the one-person IT team that’s bogged down with a million and one tasks. Or there’s someone (like me at my company!) who just got saddled with the task because someone has to do it. 
 The biggest obstacle these folks currently face is onboarding/offboarding. Solutions are either too rudimentary, like tracking data in a spreadsheet, or too advanced, like biting off more than you need with Okta. There’s no good middle ground, and these IT teams of one, or Unexpected Google Admins, <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/unexpected-google-admins-tom-daly-ceo-of-big-network-former-co-founder-cto-dyn/">as we like to call them</a>, are left to figure it all out on their own.&nbsp; 
 Everyone we’ve talked to so far has said they need the same things out of their onboarding and offboarding tool: They need to be able to get people to work ASAP, they need a smart process default for setting up access, and they need it to be available at a low cost or for free.&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the needs around onboarding and offboarding being so great (and purse strings being so tight), we’ve decided to offer Onboard, our beta onboarding and offboarding functionality, for free to the first 100 customers who join the beta. And now you don’t even need to talk to us. You can <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard">simply sign up and get immediate access</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 The Goldilocks of onboarding and offboarding 
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/starting-up-a-pain-the-saas/">Running a startup</a> ourselves, we understand the need to get employees started yesterday because the team is lean and we need those hands. We want to save ourselves time and money, too, because those are two things any business leader is short on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s true that there are other options in this space: GAM, Bettercloud, Okta, and Ping, to name a few. The problem though is that for most small businesses, these products are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to “birthright apps,” or those that are automatically granted to every new employee (think: Slack, Zoom, etc.), YeshID helps you save tons of time.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Templatize and schedule onboarding and offboarding tasks to set up a repeatable process for ease and speed. 
 Assign application administrator(s) then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper owners. 
 Track provisioning/de-provisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. 
 Empower employees to initiate requests for new application access that are automatically routed to the proper application administrator. 
 
 Let’s grow together 
<p>Onboarding and offboarding are so fundamental to companies of all kinds, yet solutions have either lagged behind business needs or leap-frogged over a whole market size. This feels like the perfect entry point for YeshID and for companies looking to take the next step in their identity and access management journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So get <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard">Onboard!</a> The first 100 people to join will get access to better onboarding and offboarding for free today and early access to future product updates. And you’ll be helping us learn even more about the small business needs that have been overlooked until now.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Hi everyone. Welcome to our latest vlog. My name is Rob MacDonald. I’m vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and I’m joined today by Mike Engle. Mike, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Doing great. Thanks for having me, Rob. I’m a co-founder here at 1Kosmos, and excited to be here on this Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Listen, it’s always good to sit down and chat with you. Today, we’re going to talk a little bit about the latest cyber attack that we’ve seen come across the newswire this week. MGM, I think being part of the high-tech world, we’ve all been to Vegas for various different events. I know that I’ve stayed in a couple of MGM resorts. Mike, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your initial thoughts on it and explain what happened?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Well, sadly, this has happened countless times over the past couple of years. This one was a bad actor getting in through the front door by coercing some type of help desk to give out a credential. The rumor has it that the bad guy found out about employee information on LinkedIn. You’re Robert MacDonald, you work at 1Kosmos, and then use that information to engage with the help desk to figure out how to trick the help desk into giving them something they shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
I think the hack is something referred to as vishing.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
You’ve touched, just kind of quickly on that just now. Why don’t you tell us a little bit about what vishing is and the concept behind that, and why it’s become so significant in terms of a cybersecurity threat over the last little while?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
There’s a couple of ishings out there.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Lots of ishings.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I think we all know phishing very well because we’ve been using email for so long. That’s P-H-I-S-H-I-N-G, right? Well, vishing is using your voice, using a phone call or voiceover IP call to reach out to somebody and pull information from them or convince them to do something. So it’s similar. In emails, you get an email. You’re tricked into clicking a link or changing a routing number. It’s really a similar concept, just a different medium. There’s other terms for SMS phishing, I think that’s called smishing or… I can’t keep up with all the issues, but they’re all the same basic principle.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
All fun terms, just they have pretty serious consequences behind them. Listen, MGM’s not a small organization, they’re worth billions with a B. Do you find it surprising, and again, not to pick on MGM, but do you find it surprising something like this happened and that they were vulnerable to an attack such as this?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It’s surprising that they got impacted as badly as they did. I’m not surprised that it happened because people are fallible. It’s just things are going to happen. Could I accidentally leave my super trusted authenticator and something sitting somewhere by accident? Of course. You could leave the bank vault open by mistake. But what surprised me is that it took them, I think it was 12 days to get back in operational, and that’s, I don’t know, some serious business continuity challenges that they had there, so that part is really surprising.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
What did they need to do to get back online? I’m assuming there was ransomware or something along those lines. Can you tell me a little bit about what happened there and maybe what some of the consequences are?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I don’t have details. I just heard about 15 hours ago that they’re back to being pretty fully operational, so that’s in the 12th day or 10 plus days, and I didn’t hear that they paid the ransom. Caesars, on the other hand, paid double-digit millions of dollars to get their systems put back online. MGM must have decided not to do that, which you’re not supposed to, because it encourages the bad behavior.</p>
<p>But that means the bad guys locked up all of their data that made their systems not work and would not give it back. Now MGM was forced to go to probably backups or alternate data centers to try to get things back online, so that’s the recovery process that needs to happen.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
That’s interesting because I think the Caesars happened on the very same day as the MGM one from what I can recall. Listen, how can organizations better prepare themselves against a social engineering attack like vishing or phishing or any of the other ishings in the future?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
I mean, it’s really, a lot of it is user education, so there’s security awareness training and monitoring too. If you monitor those help desk calls and then the subsequent actions that happen. There’s all kinds of InfoSec things that companies typically do. You test your systems regularly, etc.</p>
<p>But one of the things that struck me about this is they said the organization did use multifactor authentication. Username, password, plus some type of one-time code, etc. and they bypassed that as well. There’s probably an opportunity to shore up that part of the vector and provide some options there that might be a little harder for bad guys to get their hands on.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
For sure. Now, one of the things that pops up over your shoulder every now and again is, know who’s behind the device.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
What? Really?</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Look at that.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Coincidentally. How could knowing who’s behind the device help companies like MGM prevent these types of attacks?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It sounds so simple. Know who it is, but digitally, that’s not easy to do, but something we’ve gotten really good at here at 1Kosmos obviously. Flip the script a little bit. Bad actor calls the help desk says, “I’m Bob Smith,” and the help desk pushes a button that says, prove it. Not tell me about your first day of employment or the amount of your last direct deposit. All that stuff is stealable. Or fetch me this thing over there.</p>
<p>But what if they had to look into a camera and match Bob’s photo? Now you’ve upped the game quite a bit. Bad actor in this case, sitting behind their computer in Eastern Europe or wherever it was they were. I don’t want to pick on Eastern Europe, I love the place. But now that’s a much harder attack. Now they have to do deep fakes, or there’s all kinds of other things that takes it to another level. That’s something that we’re seeing more companies have a lot of interest in, is a way to reach out and prove who it is that’s there.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Awesome. Again, not to pick on MGM or even Caesars for that matter, or any organization that runs into an issue like this because it is pretty serious. But what lessons can we take from this, that organizations or individuals can learn from what happened at MGM, for what happened at Caesars from a cyber attack standpoint to enhance their cybersecurity practices going forward?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
First is always keep your resume current. I think understanding the gaps in the authentication controls and the reset password, reset controls are a big deal. I’ll give you an example. What if my authenticator, which many people use mobiles, they’re very secure, but there’s ways now for the authentication data on here to replicate to my cloud, to iCloud or Google Cloud. If that happens, you’re exposing now the organization or whatever you’re logging into to the cloud security. It’s only as secure then as my Google Cloud password in that example.</p>
<p>There are some rumors that they might’ve had that type of exposure. But in general, understanding that whole process of proving who you are to a help desk and ensuring that you truly know who is behind the device is one of the most important steps. Of course, training and business having really good backups and testing them regularly and stuff is other things that lots of other companies do as well.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
Speaking of which, I have training I have to do today.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, get busy or you get yelled at.</p>
<p>Rob MacDonald:<br>
For our own certification. Mike, I appreciate you coming by to tell us a little bit about the latest breach, and I look forward to having another vlog with you again sometime soon. Thanks everybody.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF56 rewards. DF57 runs Sep 28 — Oct 5,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 56 (DF56) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Sep 21, 2023 and ended 12:01am Sep 28. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF57 is live today, Sep 28. It concludes on Oct 05. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF57   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF57 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Extrimian y zkSync se asocian para llevar QuarkID y la identidad digital auto-soberana y descentralizada a los ciudadanos de Buenos Aires. 
 
 
 La iniciativa pionera permitirá a los ciudadanos reclamar la propiedad de sus documentos y datos personales y brindar mayor seguridad y privacidad. 
 
 
 QuarkID, un protocolo de identidad digital de código abierto (open source), utilizará zkSync Era para empoderar a los usuarios y garantizar la privacidad. 
 
 
 La colaboración establece a la Ciudad de Buenos Aires como líder en la adopción de tecnologías blockchain para el beneficio de sus ciudadanos. 
 
 
 El proyecto tiene como objetivo expandirse a nivel nacional, beneficiando a más de 45 millones de personas en Argentina. 
 
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://quarkid.com">QuarkID </a>&nbsp;es el protocolo de Identidad Digital Descentralizado anclado en <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync </a>Era, desarrollado por <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>, e impulsado por el Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires y otras empresas con gran experiencia en tecnologías descentralizadas, y seguridad de datos. Esta iniciativa&nbsp;busca poner el poder de los datos en manos de los ciudadanos.<br>
</p>
<p>El principal protocolo de Identidad Descentralizada de América Latina se asocia con zkSync para transformar la Identidad Digital en la región, empezando por la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>En el siempre cambiante panorama de la tecnología blockchain, la búsqueda de mil millones de usuarios sigue siendo un objetivo constante. Entonces, ¿Qué tecnología o casos de uso deberíamos impulsar para lograr mayor adopción de la tecnología Blockchain?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Y es que, teniendo en cuenta las necesidades de privacidad y seguridad digital debido al incremento de cibercrimen y robo de identidad que está sucediendo en estos tiempos, un sistema de identidad y verificación de datos privados que ponga al usuario en el centro, es imperioso.</p>
<p>En el corazón de la ética de Web3 se encuentra la soberanía personal, un principio que se extiende mucho más allá de los activos financieros para abarcar aplicaciones más amplias y prácticas. Hoy, nos complace anunciar una iniciativa innovadora en esta dirección: la identidad digital de propiedad ciudadana. Buenos Aires, Argentina, está lista para liderar la carga, introduciendo gradualmente soluciones de identidad Web3 impulsadas por las propiedades centradas en la privacidad de zkSync Era.</p>
<p>En el esfuerzo por llevar las soluciones de identidad Web3 al escenario global, es imperativo que la privacidad siga siendo una preocupación primordial en las tecnologías que permiten la propiedad de datos personales. Un mundo descentralizado que descuida las consideraciones de privacidad va en contra de la esencia misma de Web3.</p>
<p>Visualizamos un futuro en el que la libertad personal y la identidad digital autónoma capaciten a las personas para administrar sus datos de manera segura.</p>
 Empoderando a los Ciudadanos de Buenos Aires con la Identidad Digital Descentralizada y Auto-Soberana. 
<p>Bajo la iniciativa de identificación basada en blockchain de Argentina, los ciudadanos obtendrán el control sobre sus documentos personales, datos de salud y, en el futuro, el procesamiento de pagos. Para construir la infraestructura de este programa transformador, Buenos Aires se ha asociado con QuarkID, un protocolo de identidad digital de código abierto desarrollado por Extrimian, la principal empresa de identidad descentralizada de América Latina. QuarkID utiliza zkSync Era como su protocolo ancla, alimentando las billeteras a través de las cuales los individuos reclamarán sus documentos.</p>
<p>“Esto marca un salto monumental hacia un futuro más seguro y eficiente para los servicios gubernamentales en América Latina”, afirma <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillevillanueva/">Guillermo Villanueva</a>, CEO de Extrimian. “QuarkID fomenta vínculos más estrechos entre los gobiernos y los ciudadanos al mismo tiempo que introduce prácticas de identidad digital y estándares de seguridad en América Latina”.</p>
<p>Los datos almacenados en las billeteras de QuarkID son autónomos, lo que permite a los ciudadanos controlar la entrega de sus credenciales al interactuar con servicios administrativos. zkSync Era sirve como capa de liquidación para QuarkID, asegurando que cada ciudadano participante mantenga la propiedad de sus credenciales legítimas.</p>
<p>Si bien QuarkID hace su debut en Buenos Aires, su arquitectura está diseñada para escalar globalmente. Cumpliendo con estándares internacionales como W3C, Trust Over IP y Sovrin Foundation, QuarkID es interoperable con redes de todo el mundo.</p>
 Aprovechando la Tecnología ZK para Empoderar a 650 Millones de Personas en América Latina 
<p>Si bien la identidad digital basada en blockchain promete un cambio revolucionario en la propiedad de datos, a menudo genera controversia en cuanto a la verdadera descentralización de estos procesos. Eventos recientes, como las preocupaciones del gobierno de Kenia sobre la privacidad de los datos en un proyecto de criptomoneda biométrica, resaltan estos problemas.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, la transparencia y la seguridad inherentes a la vanguardia de la tecnología de Conocimiento Cero (ZK), combinadas con Ethereum, tienen el potencial de disipar tales preocupaciones. Esta asociación desbloquea la aplicación de identidad digital preservadora de la privacidad para naciones enteras.</p>
zkSync Era partnership with QuarkID
<p>Source: ZkSync Blog: https://zksync.mirror.xyz/w4_Dyhbx1X2BEGpYNCn8rEAS_2uC1hV0qPQl_m5AChk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con zkSync y Ethereum como columna vertebral de esta iniciativa, los datos personales almacenados en cadena mitigan el robo de identidad y los ataques de información personal comúnmente asociados con tecnologías centralizadas de almacenamiento de datos. zkSync garantiza que la propiedad digital sea confiable, sin necesidad de confianza y segura, al tiempo que prioriza la privacidad.</p>
<p>El gobierno argentino y la Ciudad de Buenos Aires tienen como objetivo establecer su marco de identidad digital como un bien público, lo que permite a las personas realizar transacciones de información de manera fluida entre el gobierno, las empresas y sus pares.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhfernandez/?locale=es_ES">Diego Fernandez</a>, Secretario de Innovación del Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, enfatiza: “Con este desarrollo, Buenos Aires se convierte en la primera ciudad de América Latina y una de las primeras en el mundo en integrar y promover esta nueva tecnología y establecer el estándar de cómo otros países de la región deberían utilizar la tecnología blockchain en beneficio de su gente”.</p>
<p>Lee esta <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-government-blockchain-birth-certificate-zero-knowledge-proofs/">Nota a Diego Fernandez en Fortune Crypto</a> para conocer más sobre esta alianza y cómo se llevará a cabo.</p>
QuarkID protocolo de confianza digital descentralizado, y verificación de datos privados
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comenzando en octubre, los residentes de Buenos Aires podrán descargar una billetera QuarkID para reclamar documentos de identificación personal, incluyendo certificados de nacimiento y matrimonio. QuarkID estará disponible para todos los ciudadanos argentinos y eventualmente se convertirá en obligatorio en todo el país. En noviembre, documentos como comprobantes de ingresos y verificaciones académicas estarán disponibles para obtener en las billeteras de QuarkID. A fines de 2023, el gobierno establecerá la hoja de ruta futura de QuarkID y delineará los hitos de expansión para brindar inicialmente sus servicios a más de 3&nbsp;millones de ciudadanos.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires lidera esta iniciativa, marcando el comienzo de una nueva era de Internet a través de la propiedad digital. Esperamos que las naciones de todo el mundo vean a Argentina como un ejemplo de cómo la identidad Web3 puede prosperar a nivel gubernamental.</p>

 IDCheck.io is now certified by the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Here’s why it’s important. 



 



<p>It’s been over a year since the UK government released its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-alpha-version-2">Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> (DIATF) – a set of rules and standards for digital identity providers to follow. The Framework gives an authoritative jab to the concept of digital identity verification in the UK, or at least that’s what the UK government hopes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the UK market still lags significantly behind some of its European counterparts, digital identity verification has the potential to optimize the user experience and improve business efficiencies in hundreds of use cases across the UK’s public and private sector. From account opening in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">banking</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>, age verification in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a>, automated check-in processes in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel</a>, financial risk checks in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling</a>, and contract signing in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">telecommunication</a>. The UK government has decided to start off with the release of guidelines and requirements for a few initial use cases: Right to Work, Right to Rent, and DBS Checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is understandable, considering the UK’s government services are the area perhaps most in need of a digital update, as anyone who has recently tried to update their <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dwp-please-dont-hang-up-i-want-to-top-up-my-state-pension-b0wjznrt6">National Insurance contributions</a> can attest. In fact, there are almost <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202306/blair-institute-its-possible-to-transform-uk-public-services-with-digital-id">200 different ways</a> for people to access local and national government services in the United Kingdom, with a head-scratching 44 different sign-in methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leading by example, in February 2022, the UK government rolled outs its GOV.uk One Login digital identity app. By June 2023, <a href="https://www.thinkdigitalpartners.com/news/2023/06/27/gov-uk-one-login-rolling-out-across-government/?utm_campaign=shareaholic&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_source=socialnetwork">eight government departments</a> were using the digital identity service, with more than 1.5 million verified identities issued. The government has pledged that by the end of 2024, most governmental services would be available via the one platform.</p>

 Why the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework is important. 



<p>With the release of the Framework, the journey toward a brave new digital world in the UK has once again begun, but this time with more confidence, direction, and sense of collective buy-in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s unlikely the British public will ever actually know what the Framework is, they will undoubtedly benefit from the guidelines and best practices contained therein, for example, whenever they open bank accounts, sign contracts, or join a gaming or crypto platform. As such, the Framework will be pivotal when&nbsp;businesses decide which identity service provider to choose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to become certified, providers are required to adhere to rules and requirements in the following areas:</p>



 1. Ensuring products and services are inclusive 



<p>Providers should ensure everyone can use their products and services, regardless of who they are or where they’re from. Offering a wide range of accepted identity documents is key.</p>



 2. Privacy and data protection 



<p>Providers must follow data protection legislation and ensure users can easily find out why providers are collecting personal data; what it will be used for; and who it might be shared with. Providers must also receive user agreements, and let users access and update their personal data at any point.</p>



 3. Fraud management 



<p>Providers must follow best practice guidance on fraud management, from, for example the <a href="https://www.cipfa.org/policy-and-guidance">Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy</a>. They must also be able to regularly monitor threats and fraud, and have a way of identifying, notifying, and supporting a user whose identity, attribute or account has been compromised. They must also engage in regular fraud reporting, and a way to look for suspicious activity.</p>



 4. Security 



<p>Providers must have an information management system that follows an industry standard, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-gmbh-iso-iec-27001-certification/">ISO/IEC 27001:2017</a>, and adhere to the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</p>



 5. Future-proof 



<p>Choosing a DIATF-certified identity verification provider is a sure-fire way of futureproofing your digital identify proofing offering in the UK market, even for use cases other than the three currently available.</p>



<p>As certification against the Framework requires a thorough assessment against Home Office requirements, users of any certified identity verification provider’s services can rest assured that they meet the requisite standards of safety and security regarding customers’ personal data.&nbsp;Equally as important are the guardrails it plants in UK infrastructure to ensure sustainable growth and widespread adoption of digital identity in the UK.</p>

 Fully automated IDCheck.io passes guidelines for government use cases in the UK 



<p>London, September 28, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, has received the accreditation on the levels medium and high for the UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) for its fully automated, AI-based solution IDCheck.io. Valid for two years, IDnow received this badge from <a href="https://www.accscheme.com/services/identity-assurance/digital-identity-systems-certification">government-accredited Digital Identity Systems Certification</a>.</p>



<p>The DIATF is a set of rules and standards designed by the UK government to establish trust in digital identity products coupled with proper governance on how identity service providers (IDSPs) should verify claimed identities via remote methods. Currently, the Framework sets out guidelines and requirements for a few use cases, namely “Right to Work”, “Right to Rent”, and “Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Checks”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Handling identity data in a secure and consistent way</p>



<p>To become certified under <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">DIATF</a>, IDnow was required to adhere to specific rules and requirements. For instance, the identity proofing provider had to ensure that IDCheck.io is inclusive by offering a wide range of accepted identity documents. Certified providers must also follow data protection legislation and ensure that users can easily find out why and how their personal data is stored. Additionally, IDnow was required to have an information management system (IMS) in place that follows a recognized industry standard, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-gmbh-iso-iec-27001-certification/">ISO/IEC 27001</a>. </p>



<p>Finally, the accreditation confirms that IDnow follows best practice fraud management guidelines including regular fraud reporting. Under DIATF, IDnow is able to monitor threats and fraud regularly, and has a way to identify, notify, and assist a user whose identity, attribute, or account has been compromised. </p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow, explains: “In the UK, there has historically been a sense of caution in how an individual’s data is being stored and used. This extends to concern in the systems’ privacy, security, and governance. The Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework should act as a wakeup call for all service providers to prepare for the next generation of digital identity proofing solutions in the UK”.</p>



<p>“The Framework can go a long way to encourage UK businesses to implement digital identity solutions by enabling smoother, more secure online transactions that lead to higher conversion. This will instill trust and save businesses considerable time and money. Because of these benefits, there are likely to be many more use cases across multiple industries released in the coming years. With the accreditation for our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">AI-powered IDCheck.io solution</a>, we are ready for these developments on the UK market”, she adds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Given the stunning success of the recent hacks at MGM and Caesars, it’s a safe bet what happened in Vegas won’t stay there for long. Even though technology to prevent such breaches is readily available, there’s every reason to believe large organizations in any number of sectors could soon face a rude awakening.</p>
<p>Success breeds success, after all. It also inspires copycats. The attacks on Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International in early September appear to have been perpetrated by a group of <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/15/23875113/mgm-hack-casino-vishing-cybersecurity-ransomware">teenagers and young adults</a> that employs simple social engineering techniques to infiltrate corporate systems for fun and serious profit.</p>
<p>Dubbed “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a25d2897-b0ce-4ba7-92ed-ff5df09d1b47">Scattered Spider</a>” by some security analysts and UNC3944 or “Muddled Libra” by others, the group of Gen-Z threat actors is believed to have pulled off a series of cryptocurrency heists before breaching and then <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/09/22/mgm-hack-laid-to-star-fraud/">extorting Western Digital</a> and other technology firms over the past few years. Reuters reports the group has been implicated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/power-influence-notoriety-gen-z-hackers-who-struck-mgm-caesars-2023-09-22/">52 attacks</a> spanning multiple industries worldwide since 2022.</p>
<p>Specifics in the casino breaches are still emerging. However, it appears that operatives in the MGM attack used <a href="https://specopssoft.com/blog/mgm-resorts-service-desk-hack/">LinkedIn</a> profile information to impersonate a resort employee in “vishing” calls to an outsourced IT support vendor, requesting access to the employee’s corporate accounts after getting “accidentally” locked out. After gaining entry, the hackers gained super administrator rights to MGM’s Okta environment. They even configured a second identity provider to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) and impersonate highly privileged users within the corporate systems.</p>
<p>In a word: diabolical, especially for a group of suspected 17- to 22-year-olds. But as the Washington Post reports, Scattered Spider’s Vegas jackpot also represents a troubling new escalation in the group’s MO. The hackers threw the company into utter chaos by deploying crippling ransomware from notorious Russian cyber gang ALPHV into MGM’s systems. Ten days into the breach, MGM was <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/9/15/23875113/mgm-hack-casino-vishing-cybersecurity-ransomware">still struggling</a> to repair corporate email, restaurant reservation systems, hotel booking operations, slot machines, and digital keycard access at its Aria, Bellagio, and MGM Grand properties. There’s little reason to believe Scattered Spider isn’t already scouting new prey.</p>
 Gaming the System: Harvesting Passwords, Short-Circuiting MFA 
<p>Ransomware attacks are nothing new, of course. Last year, more than <a href="https://www.getastra.com/blog/security-audit/ransomware-attack-statistics/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20ransomware%20attacks%20per%20year%20is%20around%20620.5,(USD)%20annually%20by%202031.">620 million</a> ransomware attacks worldwide cost victims more than $30 billion. According to Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report, <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-to-train-employees-to-avoid-ransomware">74% of breaches</a> stem from credentials stolen through phishing, vishing, and SIM-swapping attacks.</p>
<p>Indeed, stolen passwords are implicated in up to <a href="https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/cyber-risk-and-cfos">$25 million</a> in average losses suffered by a third of all businesses that have fallen victim to cyberattacks over the last 36 months. When an ATO leads to a data breach, it can mean an average additional cost of <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/ransomware-and-data-breaches-impacts-continue-to-grow-louder">$9.5 million</a> per incident for US-based companies. ATOs account for more than $300 million in losses annually. And as WAPO points out, Scattered Spider and its Eastern European business partners could worsen matters in coming weeks.</p>
<p>For one thing, you have financially motivated, English-speaking hackers with a proven talent for pulling off <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mgm-and-caesars-hacked-by-scattered-spider-in-span-of-few-weeks-1.1971066">social engineering</a> and data exfiltration schemes. Now add the Russian “ransomware-as-a-service” operatives believed to be behind the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/10/colonial-pipeline-gas-oil-markets/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9">Colonial Pipeline</a> attack and an underworld network as technologically sophisticated as any modern enterprise.</p>
<p>Mix in plentiful targets with outsourced IT support and call center operations crewed by untrained, often short-term employees <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vishing+call+center&amp;newwindow=1&amp;client=safari&amp;sca_esv=568238426&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=1046&amp;tbm=nws&amp;ei=lssRZc73MLeTwPAPuZWKuAM&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOmpfGrMaBAxW3CRAIHbmKAjcQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=vishing+call+center&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MiE3Zpc2hpbmcgY2FsbCBjZW50ZXIyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMgYQABgWGB4yBhAAGBYYHjIGEAAYFhgeMggQABiKBRiGAzIIEAAYigUYhgNIvSNQ9hFY3SJwAHgAkAEAmAHuBqABhiOqAQkzLTEuNS4yLjG4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgUQABiiBMICCBAAGIoFGJECwgIOEAAYigUYsQMYgwEYkQLCAgsQABiKBRixAxiDAcICCBAAGIAEGLEDwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAgsQABiKBRixAxiRAsICBxAAGIAEGAqIBgE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-news">vulnerable to vishing</a>. And sprinkle in emerging, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fbi-hackers-are-having-a-field-day-with-open-source-ai-programs">AI-powered phishing</a> and vishing tactics and automated <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2023/06/can-singapore-become-a-passwordless-nation/">credentials-stuffing</a> technologies. Put it together, and far too many organizations in health care, telecom, government, financial services, and others <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/american-companies-too-vulnerable-to-attacks-like-mgm-hack-cybersecurity-expert-says/">may be vulnerable</a> to an emboldened Scattered Spider and copycat groups. The good news: Organizations can quickly deploy effective defenses. But they’d better move fast.</p>
 No More Rolling the Dice with Outdated Forms of MFA 
<p>According to a recent survey from <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/11/17/marketers-must-be-proactive-data-privacy-maintain-customer-trust">Google and Ipsos</a>, a successful data breach can erode customer trust by as much as 44%. As the MGM and Caesars breaches so vividly illustrate, legacy forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) won’t cut it anymore. Cybercriminal organizations like Scattered Spider have clearly developed inventive ways to acquire login credentials and circumvent things like one-time passcodes and limited biometric authentication systems designed to confirm the legitimate user is attempting to access their account.</p>
<p>The problem: Traditional forms of MFA are built around login passwords and a device instead of the identity of the person accessing an account. Even with Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) and Okta Verify Authenticator, anybody with administrative access can register things like user biometrics to any device they can access—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures altogether.</p>
<p>For some business applications, that may not be a significant risk. But it still leaves the door open to account compromise that puts IT and security teams in reactive mode against data breaches and ransomware after access to systems has already been granted. Fortunately, a new generation of strong, non-phishable biometric identity solutions is changing all that.</p>
 Enter: “Liveness”-based Biometric Authentication 
<p>With traditional forms of MFA becoming so unreliable as a means of identity verification, modern forms of biometric authentication are helping to set a new standard for security and convenience. Solutions certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a> , <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics-</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, for instance, use “live” biometric markers tied to a registered identity to provide reliable, strong authentication impervious to account takeover.</p>
<p>These modern biometric solutions offer machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable non-phishable multi-factor authentication when users login to digital services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/next-generation-mfa/">1Kosmos BlockID</a>, for instance, uses the private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device as a possession factor (ie, “what you have”), while a live facial scan becomes the “what you are” or inherent authentication element. To access a site, app, or system, a live image scan is compared to an image scan captured at the time of enrollment. If they match, the identity of the person of authentication is confirmed to be in fact, the authorized user—and not a bot, deep fake or imposter—with 99.9% accuracy.</p>
<p>This technology is widely available and supports a consistent onboarding and authentication experience into all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems. Any organization can stop phishing, ransomware attacks, and data breaches before hackers can infiltrate accounts. Scattered Spider simply provided an urgent new reason to stop gambling with security now.</p>

I am happy to report that I successfully got <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> running on my machine during their workshop.</p> Ethereum Meetup @ c-base <p>Last but not least, a night of interesting talks with the homies at C-base. Joshua Davila introduced his new book <a href="https://theblockchainsocialist.com/blockchain-radicals-book-announcement/">Blockchain Radicals</a>, which proposes a few counter-narratives to the typical read of what’s happening in the blockchain space. Juan Caballero gave a great introduction to the mission of the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a>, which was followed by a super entertaining dive into the blockchain-based games that <a href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol">social-dist0rtion-protocol</a> has built.</p> Human Made: ntnt x Bright Moment <p>One last thing …</p><p>Berlin Art Week runs simultaneously, and I was lucky to work on a collage alongside the ntnt collective and their AI named Jan. It was a beautifully installed and crafted installation and performance of human+machine co-creation. I texted an AI, shook a magic 8-ball, and flipped a few coins.

  Tangle Labs are no strangers to building technology for social good, and 
over the past nine months we have been focusing on exploring the value 
verifiable identity can provide to support opportunities in line with the 
UNESCO mandate for lifelong learning through decentralised identity, open 
badges, and verifiable credentials for learners.

<p><a href="https://www.tanglelabs.io/">Tangle Labs</a> are no strangers to building technology for social good, and over the past nine months we have been focusing on exploring the value verifiable identity can provide to support opportunities in line with the <a href="https://www.uil.unesco.org/en/unesco-institute/mandate#:~:text=The%20UNESCO%20Institute%20for%20Lifelong,education%20and%20learning%20throughout%20life.">UNESCO mandate for lifelong learning</a> through decentralised identity, open badges, and verifiable credentials for learners.</p><p>Earlier this year we announced our role as one of two leading technology partners within the <a href="https://ngdil.com/">NGDIL</a> (Next Generation Digital Identity in Learning) project. Working alongside <a href="https://www.talentencampusoss.nl/">UNESCO learning city Oss</a> and <a href="https://www.kw1c.nl/">UNESCO learning institute Koning Willem I College</a>, in the Netherlands, we spent the past nine months researching and developing a live demonstration of self-sovereign identity technology that can support learners with seamless lifelong learning experiences. Putting the privacy and security of the user front and centre, the demo, built using the backend for the upcoming AuvoID no-code identity platform from Tangle Labs, was a valuable illustration of the interoperability of the technology, displayed by the use of not only the <a href="https://www.tanglelabs.io/vira">Vira identity wallet</a> from Tangle Labs, but also the UniMe wallet from <a href="https://impierce.com/">Impierce Technologies</a>.&nbsp;</p>














































  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
                
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                
            
          
        
          
        

        
          
          
            <p>Vira and UniMe identity wallet applications on two mobile devices laying in front of a laptop with the NGDIL demo on the screen.</p>
          
        
      
        
      

    
  


  





   Why interoperability matters. <p>The technology used to build out the wallets, both at Tangle Labs and Impierce, follows the EU guidelines for <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> framework. These standards-based frameworks will be coming into effect in 2025 and provide a guideline for interoperability between different technology providers, to establish an EU wide ecosystem that can support reusable verifiable identity and credentials across borders.</p><p>What we achieved with the <a href="https://demo.ngdil.com/">NGDIL demo</a> is to show that the technology already works in a live implementation. Having multiple technology providers interacting in the same ecosystem shows that there is no necessary vendor lock-in and that if the standards are used, anyone can build and gain value from participating in such an ecosystem.</p><p>The importance of interoperability and a collaborative approach to the adoption of the technology is centred around the value it brings to everyone within an ecosystem. In current identity ecosystems a centralised approach is taken, with one central party having oversight over everything, take Google single sign on as an example. With a more decentralised approach, the user can securely interact using self-sovereign identity, without the need of a third party. This allows for complete control over who learners share their data with and how. This also allows for more streamlined experiences, through the portability of user data. Rather than having to share numerous paper documents, or go through laborious verification processes, a simple sharing of instantly verifiable credentials is all that is required – cutting down onboarding times, simplifying verification, and creating accessible user experiences that can offer more inclusive and obtainable lifelong learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

   Where do we go from here? <p>As eIDAS 2.0 comes into effect in 2025, this technology will become <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281#:~:text=IDENTIFICATION%20MEANS%E2%80%99%3B-,(16),-the%20following%20Articles">mandatory for numerous sectors</a> – including education, banking, healthcare – which means it’s time to start integrating now. And, after presenting the NGDIL project and live technology demonstration at numerous events across Europe, it has evidently opened the eyes of many to the potential this technology can provide within the context of lifelong learning. &nbsp;</p><p>Through the research and development of this year we have opened doors to new partnerships, projects, and opportunities that will bring this technology into the real world in 2024. The enthusiasm behind what we have created, along with KW1C, Oss, and Impierce, at the NGDIL is clear from the ever-increasing partners that want to join the group.</p><p>2024 will bring numerous live deployments of the technology using open badges and micro-credentials for learners, as well as expanding the versatility of the technology to support wider interoperability across different ecosystems. </p><p>From Tangle Labs you can expect regular feature expansion within the Vira wallet and the launch of our no-code identity platform AuvoID and AuvoVault – a compartmentalised, encrypted identity back-up system for the cloud, as well as more partnership and project announcements over the coming months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Try out the <a href="https://demo.ngdil.com/">NGDIL demo here</a></p><p><br><br></p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This week we are discussing verifiable credentials. I am joined by Riley Hughes, the host of <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity Podcast</a>, to explore some of the most recent success stories of verifiable credentials and how we can work to improve adoption moving forward. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for joining a new episode over Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. One term that has been in our radar for the last – I would say four or five years has been verifiable credentials. Which I will say personally, I’m feeling that is becoming in the last one, two years pretty crystallised. And we have not talked too much about this lately, so I have a very special guest who has a lot of insight – what’s going on worldwide about verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Riley Hughes. He is the CEO and Co-founder of Trinsic, a reusable identity infrastructure provider. As a leader in the decentralised identity community, Riley has pioneered efforts on making emerging privacy preserving technologies – such as identity wallets and verifiable credentials – adoptable to the masses. He began his career in the decentralised identity space as the second employee hired at the Sovrin Foundation, where he established and led several teams. Hello, Riley.</p>
<p>Riley Hughes: Hi, Oscar. Great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great to have this conversation with you. So very welcome. And let’s talk about digital identity. And as usual, I want to hear more about our guests. So, if you can tell us about yourself, and especially your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Riley: Happy to do so. I am very fortunate to have totally fallen into this amazing industry. And it happened because while I was at college, I was seeing all those smart people around me going and getting jobs at elite places, you know, investment banks and management consulting firms, and so forth. And I thought that I wanted to kind of differentiate my resume enough that I could, maybe I could get an interview as well at one of these places. So, I thought, “What is the most, kind of, off the wall internship that I could get that would differentiate me from all of my peers?”</p>
<p>And I ended up getting a job at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>, as you mentioned. Sovrin at that time was very early. I was, as mentioned, the second employee hired, and it was kind of a blockchain meets identity meets nonprofit, you know, meets early employee kind of a role. And so, it, sort of, fit my criteria for differentiating my resume. But it was also just really, really exciting to be part of an early organisation. It grew up to about 25 employees in short order. And I was able to participate in some of that growth. And that was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And what I realised is that there are a lot of problems to solve in this world of digital identity. I remember just thinking, “Man, it seems crazy that we are sending people to outer space, and we’re editing genes, and we’re doing all kinds of unbelievable things with science and technology. And yet, the best way to prove who I am on the internet is to take a photograph of my government-issued document and a selfie, or something. It just seems kind of backwards.” It seems like the future of identity will be much better than it is today.</p>
<p>And so, although I didn’t necessarily know whether Sovrin would be the ultimate manifestation of that better digital identity future, I did know that something would happen here that would lead to that better future. And so, I thought I would stick around in this space. I decided not to go for those other kind of recruiting opportunities that I alluded to. And instead, I started Trinsic with a couple of -. And that’s kind of how we got to where we are today. That was a little over four years ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, super interesting that one of the first jobs – when you start to differentiate yourself – it was Sovrin. How did they find you? How did you find them?</p>
<p>Riley: The Chair of the Board of Sovrin was Phil Windley. And he was a professor at the university that I was attending. So, they had a job posting out for university students. And they didn’t have any money yet so they couldn’t pay very much and so they needed a university student and that’s sort of where I came in.</p>
<p>Oscar: Right place, right time. Fantastic, those coincidences that sometimes happened.</p>
<p>So, you’ve been around, as you said, four years/five years in this space already. So, what would you say has been something that has surprised you the most, something special you would like to tell us?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, that’s a great question. I think that when I started in this space, and the way we were talking about verifiable credentials, was as if it was a digital representation of a physical document. Right? And we can get into more about what verifiable credentials are and what they aspire to be. But the thing that was most kind of interesting and surprising recently, is – at Trinsic we are an infrastructure provider for verifiable credentials. And so, when companies want to incorporate a verifiable credential-based solution into their offerings, we’re an infrastructure to enable them to do that.</p>
<p>And as we did a kind of – an inventory or a survey of the landscape, of all of our customers and the ones that were most successful. What we realised was that people were not using verifiable credentials as a replacement for a physical document, generally. Instead, what they were using it for, is – in the same way that a FinTech developer might use an open banking API, right?</p>
<p>Basically, open banking allows you to unlock your data from its original silo, which is your bank account, and reuse that financial data and make it interoperable across other third-party applications. And, you know, what our customers were using verifiable credentials to do is something similar, but for personal data. Unlocking that personal data from its original silos and making it useful and interoperable and reusable across multiple applications.</p>
<p>And so, it actually changed, Oscar, the kind of form factor of the product we needed to build, right? And we realised that the correct – you know, we needed to change some things about how we were approaching our product.</p>
<p>So that’s been what we’ve been in the thick of doing for the last few months. And it’s been a fun journey. Startups are always a little bit of a roller coaster. And this is a fun part of that roller coaster.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, super interesting, Riley. So, let’s jump into the main topic. So, tell us please, what are verifiable credentials?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I alluded to verifiable credentials often being talked about as a digital representation of a physical document. And generally, when you hear the term verifiable and credential – a credential is sort of an attestation, or a claim made about one party by another party. So, in healthcare, right, your credentials are something that you’ve obtained, from a trusted source, that you can use to prove to somebody else certain things about you, and what your qualifications are, et cetera. And verifiable credentials are a way to do that verifiably, cryptographically in a digital form.</p>
<p>Now, if we’re talking about – I think there’s two ways that people use the term ‘verifiable credentials’ today. One is with an uppercase, V and C, an uppercase Verifiable Credentials, that is the formal official W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model Standard. And that is a specific kind of verifiable credential that is sort of an interoperable, and probably the most well-adopted, and well talked about kind of verifiable credential.</p>
<p>And then you have the lowercase, vc, verifiable credential. And there are lots of different kinds of lowercase verifiable credentials. Lots of things that can fit this model of an attestation that is given to you by some trusted party, and used to get access to the things you need throughout your life. So, I guess it depends on which of those you’re talking about. But I hope that that’s a helpful kind of intro.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, thank you for that. And the same term can mean different things from different perspectives. Let’s make even more concrete.</p>
<p>So, let’s hear from you some concrete examples. If you can tell us something that is already widely used, some that most of us might already know about. So, tell us a bit of some examples of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I mean, again, if we’re to zoom out a little bit and talk about verifiable credentials in the broadest sense. Even something like a credit card could be considered a verifiable credential. It is something that was given to you by a trusted source, likely a bank, and you can use it with third party merchants in a way that they can authenticate that card and charge your account based on your actions with that card. And so it is, you know, in the broadest sense, even something like a credit card or a government-issued ID could be considered a form of a verifiable credential.</p>
<p>But if we’re talking about specifically, the new W3C Verifiable Credential Standard, I think, one example that is helpful to conceptualise what this looks like, is the vaccine, or the sort of travel pass type products – that many of us used throughout the pandemic. I think this is where – this is the first use case that we found that Trinsic received broad adoption. And, you know, these are products that allowed you to prove that you were vaccinated against COVID, or that you had obtained a recent COVID test, and that you are therefore eligible to travel. And you know that is a form of verifiable credential, Apple and Google even were accepting those credentials into their native operating system wallets as verifiable credentials as well. And so that is maybe an example that a lot of people have used in the recent years.</p>
<p>Oscar: And those were already based on the W3C standards.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, technically, I think the smart health cards was what they were based on, and smart health cards were based on the W3C standard, so yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yes, definitely that has been a case that millions of people have used. Those helped us during the pandemic without knowing the term of ‘verifiable credential’. So that definitely has been widely used in different regions, different implementations. But yeah, that’s correct.</p>
<p>OK, if you tell us also some other examples, how has been, yeah, across different sectors, let’s say verifiable credentials are being implemented and as well, interesting stories.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah. So, I think when you look at Trinsic, we are, again, an infrastructure provider. And so, we see companies all across the spectrum using Trinsic to accomplish their verifiable credential use cases. Everybody from a car manufacturer to a B2B supplier, an invoice management solution to a consumer product application for events and concerts, to education and healthcare use cases, I think.</p>
<p>A use case that I really like, is the medical staff passport. It is something that’s easy to conceptualise, really, it’s an identity wallet that a provider, a physician or a nurse could use to prove that they have the correct credentials and qualifications to do that job.</p>
<p>And so, if you’re a physician that needs to go to a new hospital, to substitute for some staffing shortage or something. The way this works today is there’s a big, long credentialing process where the new hospital needs to spend a lot of time checking lots of different things to make sure that you are eligible to do your job. And still, there’s fraud that gets through. With a digital staff passport, a doctor could simply prove who they are much faster, prove their credentials much faster, and get to work serving patients much sooner. So that’s a use case that I think is pretty helpful and has been succeeding, I think there’s four or five projects that I’m aware of around the world that are that are doing that, including some that are being built on Trinsic.</p>
<p>But I think regardless of where you look across all of those different industries that I mentioned, you see a couple of common patterns. And one of those common patterns is – you often need to anchor that credential in something, some foundational verifiable credential. So, what we’re seeing is, you know, if you’re a doctor, and you want to get your credentials in a digital verifiable credential form. The first thing that you’ll do is not actually go get your doctor credentials. But instead, the first thing that you do is verify your identity, scan a government document and authenticate yourself against some authoritative, again, government type document. And then when you obtain your doctor credentials, you can then make sure that those match. And then when you prove who you are in subsequent interactions, it’s much higher trust. Because you can cross reference the two credentials, and that brings a high degree of trust.</p>
<p>And so, what we see across a lot of these use cases are people doing, sort of, an identity verification step. In addition, and that becomes the foundational verifiable credential, or reusable identity (as we call it) that anchors some of these verifiable credentials. And that step is something that we at Trinsic help facilitate as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, so the very first identity verification. So, when you mentioned that for this healthcare professionals, credential, you mentioned, there are a few worldwide. So, will these initiatives, I don’t know how much if they are in production, or is still in development? I don’t know, but if you know enough about the difference of these projects, do you think they will become interoperable or they are following different paths? What’s your view?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I think that, yeah, I think that they will become interoperable. It’s hard for me to say a blanket statement that every single one will definitely be. But yeah, but I think that many of these projects are based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model. And if they’re not based on that data model, they’re based on something else that is very similar. And I think the important thing to remember as it relates to interoperability is there’s a little bit of a conflict, actually, between two very important things.</p>
<p>When you’re launching a product, you want the ability to move fast, to iterate on the form factor, and change things to the extent that they’re not working, and bring the best technologies to bear, to build the best product that you can for the customer. And at the same time, you also want interoperability and compatibility across applications. And these things come into conflict because in order to be interoperable or compatible with other applications, you sort of need to slow down and agree upon a set of standards. But to be sort of innovative and moving fast, you kind of need to speed up and be willing to throw away your old solution and replace it with something better. And so, you get is this tension between innovation and interoperability.</p>
<p>So many of the solutions that you see out in the market today are not interoperable simply because they’re focusing more on the innovation side of the equation. And yes, there are proof points of kind of interoperability testing and interoperability suites that people can come into compliance to. But oftentimes, that’s kind of a steppingstone and will come into compliance with that. And then you’ll see another divergence of different attempts, and then they’ll sort of converge back to another point of interoperability at some point in the future. And so, it’s never quite as cut and dry as just interoperable or not.</p>
<p>And so, the important thing, before you build a bridge between your island and someone else’s island, you need to make sure there’s stuff on the islands for people to do, right? You need to make sure that people actually get to drive their car across the bridge. And so, in my opinion, the most important thing to do first, is get a product out there and get people using it and get happy customers where you’re solving their problem. And once you’ve done that, you can incorporate interoperability to make your product even better for those customers and solve even more problems. But I think trying to solve interoperability before you have a product in market is a little bit of putting the cart before the horse in some ways.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. Definitely a good observation. And I agree that, yeah, you need adoption, you need adoption, you need to solve problems. To see that yeah, this new technology, this new product is really solving, solving problems for a big enough mass of users. And from that perspective also, my impression is that most of the companies who are building these products are not the big ones, right? Not the big companies, that’s my impression. So, it’s like, startup entrepreneurs, mostly. So how is the – are they doing profit in this space of verifiable credentials? What is, what you have seen?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I don’t think I can say that there’s a, you know, hundreds of really successful, kind of, high profit generating companies out there. But there’s definitely companies earning revenue. To the extent that their revenues exceed their costs, I don’t know. But from a revenue standpoint, I think, you know, the key to making money with verifiable credentials is not the verifiable credentials. The key to making money with verifiable credentials is to – solving a problem with a customer. And to the extent that verifiable credentials can help you do that better and more effectively, that’s the extent that you will profit with verifiable credentials, right? So, you know, what we’ve seen is really not a whole cloth reinventing of the fundamental economics of the internet, or anything like that.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few ways that people are making money. The first way is they build a consumer product that makes a person’s life better, and they charge the consumer for that product. Right? Password managers cost a few bucks a month. CLEAR is an identity product that you might see in airports, especially in the United States, you know, where you can skip the line at the security by enrolling in this identity company called CLEAR. These are examples of consumer products that consumers pay for because it makes their lives a little bit easier.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen verifiable credential type products that do the same thing. I’ve also seen products that solve a problem for our business, and they take, maybe it’s a subscription revenue, maybe it’s a usage-based fee for that. And they follow the software as a service playbook that is sort of tried and true. And, you know, this is – I mentioned the doctor, kind of the staff passport solutions a minute ago.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen some of these types of solutions that have done really well by leaning into a vertical, a vertical software approach. And using the kind of verification of individuals and employees of a given hospital or something like that, as a benefit, a value-add to their existing software as a service product. And so that just sort of strengthens their revenue proposition there.</p>
<p>And then the third way that I’ve seen are companies that are already doing some kind of an attestation, but in a non-verifiable credential way. So, for example, this might be an identity verification company, a background check company, a student ID verification company, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen, you know, these kinds of companies incorporate reusable identity or incorporate verifiable credentials into their product. Or in other words, issue their attestation as a verifiable credential, instead of just simply, you know, an API response, and continue charging the same business model that they always have, and actually make more money than they were making previously. Because now that it’s a reusable credential, people can use it more places than they otherwise would have. Or it becomes their go-to resource for authenticating themselves, which then leads to even more revenue for the attestation provider. So, these are a few ways I’ve seen people make money with verifiable credentials, and then our fundamental kind of transformations of the business models that may have come before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but it’s very interesting to see that there is value generation on top of solving problems and solving people’s problem. Excellent. So, one, relatively new term that is relatively new is wallets. And that is a term that I feel that is already reaching the masses, so people hear about that more commonly at this point, 2023, that we are having these conversations. So, what is the relationship between – or the connection between verifiable credentials and wallets?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, it’s pretty simple. I think the easy answer is wallets are where your verifiable credentials are stored. So, you get – just like in real life, you obtain a driving license. Where do you put it? Well, generally speaking, you put it in a wallet. And in a verifiable credential world, that holds true. I think this breaks down just a little bit if you think about wallet in the way that most people use the term. Most people associate a wallet with payment of some kind.</p>
<p>So today, your verifiable credentials are unlikely to fit inside of your Apple wallet. They’re unlikely to fit inside of your crypto wallet. They’re unlikely to fit inside of some other things, which are called wallets today. But I think that’s just a function of the maturity of the technology. I think, you know, we’ll get there.</p>
<p>For now, the term that I use are ID wallets, right? They’re sort of wallets that are built for verifiable credentials. And today, they sit alongside other kinds of wallets. So, in the Web3 space, we have some customers in that world. And for the users of their products, the ID wallet is a separate container or a separate data store or separate wallet that sits alongside or next to a crypto wallet for those Web3 applications. And, you know, in a Web2 world, again, a user ends up getting a wallet, oftentimes, they don’t even know that it is a wallet, they don’t even know that we refer to it as a wallet. To them, it’s just storage of their verifiable credential, or of their staff passport or something. But, yeah, hopefully that helps.</p>
<p>Oscar: But the ID wallet that you mentioned, it’s also from a normal user perspective, you just want one more app in the mobile, something like that?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, it could be an app. It also could not be an app. I think oftentimes if you are requiring your user to redirect out to an app store, download an app, authenticate to the app and get on boarded through the onboarding screens, and then obtain a verifiable credential. Also, that they can verify themselves and get the thing they actually want, that user experience becomes pretty tricky.</p>
<p>So, while we have seen some apps, you know, mobile apps, you know, succeeding and that is a model that is definitely a viable option. It definitely should not be the only option. And I think we’ve even seen web-based wallets or cloud-based wallets really taking off in much, much greater numbers than a lot of the mobile app wallets that we have, that we’ve seen. And I think it’s just a function of the friction required for a user to go through that journey is just so much less.</p>
<p>So yeah, it could be an app on your phone, it could be embedded into an existing app you already use. Or it could be a web resource that you, you know, authenticate to and get access to your credentials that way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Looking at the future from where we are now, what do you say is needed in order to see a broader adoption of verifiable credentials?</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I think we need more products, and more focus on product. So, you may have kind of heard from some of my previous answers that I, you know, I tend to think a lot about adoption. I think a lot about product. And I think a lot about business models. And that’s obviously because of my background. You know, I’m not an engineer by training.</p>
<p>But I do think that a lot of times, people get a little bit lost into the weeds with the technology. There’s a lot of cases where, you know, we’re talking about theoreticals in the technology, before anybody is actually using the product and we’re sort of holding up these, you know, certain technology principles as gold standards or best practices. When in reality, many verifiable credential approaches do not have product market fit yet. And so, we could build the most amazing, elegant, utopian technological solution. But if nobody uses that solution, then what’s the point?</p>
<p>So, I think really, the thing we need to focus on so much more is adoption and product execution over anything else. The technology is there, it’s good enough, it’s plenty good enough. It’s been good enough for – I mean, four years ago, literally, we launched the first version of our product, which allowed any developer to issue a credential within five minutes on Sovrin. And then a few weeks later, we expanded it to where there was a dashboard where even a non-technical person could issue credentials within five minutes.</p>
<p>So, the technology has been really accessible for a long time now. And when we look at our customer base, and we look at the success rates, and then we try to correlate those success rates with something and see what predicts success in this market. Every single time it comes down to product execution, and just being focused on solving a real problem for people. And so really what we need to get more verifiable credential adoption, is we just need – more of that, more problems being solved for businesses and people who are willing to pay for it. Right?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree. All right, thank you for the explanation of what’s going on verifiable credentials. And I agree a lot of your views on the focus on solving problems. So, leaving us with a final question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Riley: Well, I am going to piggyback off my last answer for this one, Oscar. I’m going to say, if you are a company that has an identity product, or some kind of attestation service for people, or something like that. You should write on your agenda to explore how verifiable credentials could augment your business, because it’s likely that there’s some startup out there that is sort of doing something using verifiable credentials in your space or an adjacent space. And, you know, and they’re learning fast about what’s working and what doesn’t, and what this new world will look like. And so, as the world moves to fully digital and moves to reusable identity, the ones that sort of obtain those insights fastest and move first are going to get a lot of the benefits. And so, that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>If you are not in that category of a company that would sort of incorporate verifiable credentials, then the action item that I would give to you is to be a user of one of these products. And if you can’t find a product that uses verifiable credentials, if you can’t find an ID wallet that solves a problem for you, that’s maybe a little bit of an indicative of where we are as a space. But if there is something that you can use and try out and actually use it in the real world to solve some problem for you, I encourage you to do it, give it a try and give feedback to the developer of that product and let them know your experience. Because these are the kinds of things that will drive adoption of better identity systems in the future than what we have today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. Oh, thanks a lot for this very interesting interview, Riley. Please let us know how people can follow the conversation with you.</p>
<p>Riley: Yeah, I – so the first thing I’ll say is that we do a podcast as well. This has been a blast, Oscar. This is a great podcast. I love it. I think if you’re interested in reusable identity, specifically, and diving deeper into some of the stories of companies that have launched reusable identity products, or verifiable credential-based products out into the wild, I have a podcast that we do, called <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity podcast</a>. And so that’s what I would encourage you to check out.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in following me or getting in touch, you can email me at riley@trinsic.id. Find me on Twitter @rileyphughes. I’m also accessible on LinkedIn. If you search my name, I’m sure you’ll find us. And I’m always open to feedback and love the conversation so please reach out if you think there’s a way we could work together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, thank you and indeed I’ve been listening to your podcasts, The Future of Identity, so it’s highly, highly recommended. So, if you want to learn more in identity especially the topics that Riley has been bringing us today. So again, thanks a lot Riley for joining us. And all the best.</p>

<p>Mattereum has recently announced a <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/07/23/announcing-swarm-x-mattereum-partnership/">partnership with Swarm</a>, a German exchange, and, you may ask, why is this one so important? Well, while we’ve made crucial partnerships with companies like <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/11/24/announcing-neoswap-x-mattereum-partnership/">NeoSwap</a> and <a href="https://mattereum.com/2023/04/21/announcing-crypto-real-estate-x-mattereum-partnership/">Crypto Real Estate</a> this year, connecting to Swarm is the link that can really make things happen and act as a force multiplier for all these other partnerships, and for others we’ll make in the future. The combination of Mattereum’s legaltech innovation and Swarm’s ability to create fractional ownership tokens has enabled what is literally the Holy Grail of the blockchain - creating legally enforceable fractional ownership of real world assets with tokens that can be traded on-chain - and that has the potential to change everything. Let’s look at&nbsp;why.</p><blockquote>Creating legally enforceable fractional ownership of real world assets with tokens that can be traded on-chain has the potential to change everything</blockquote><p><a href="https://swarm.com/">Swarm</a> is a really, really well-established company in the crypto space, going back as far as 2014, and they are German. In Germany, they just put the same criteria around crypto as you would for any other class of financial instruments that were issued in the normal way, the old-fashioned way, the TradFi [traditional finance] way. So Swarm got their licences, and now they are just like real-world finance in Germany, but they have a license that lets them do things with crypto, and they’ve got the attitude, they’ve got the experience, they’ve got the institutional knowledge... So, they’re not really TradFi, and they’re not really DeFi; they’re just Fi. They don’t have the whizzy kind of craziness of DeFi, they also don’t have the dullness of traditional finance; they use the blockchain to get things done, and they’re exactly the kind of institution that we thought mainstream banks were going to turn into in the 2016 era. This means that what they do is backed by all kinds of regulatory oversight and legal compliances; they are not going to take anyone’s money and do something crazy and unexpected with it. This meshes perfectly with the Mattereum approach, where our <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> provides evidence that the owner of the token issued by Swarm has full legal ownership of the underlying physical asset, or their fraction of it, and this works in 172 jurisdictions worldwide. With Swarm as Mattereum’s fractionization partner you have full legal protection at every stage of the&nbsp;process.</p><blockquote>With Swarm as our fractionization partner you have full legal protection at every&nbsp;stage</blockquote><p>Swarm is the first really serious way of joining together TradFi and DeFi, and then Mattereum comes in and says, “Okay, so you want to do something like take a thousand acres of rainforest, you want to take an industrial facility, you want to take a collection of fine art that’s been accumulated over a few centuries... You want to take these things, and you want to split them into shares and allow people to buy them, you want to split them into tokens and allow people to buy them, you want to take revenue streams and allow people to buy those, you want to do governance...” For all of these things, you have to know for certain that the assets are real and that there’s no fraud in the assets, you need insurance, you need underwriting, you need machine-readable definitions of those assets so that you can do things like automated investment portfolio management.</p><blockquote>You have to know for certain that the assets are real and that there’s no fraud in the&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>You need specialised entities external to regular financial organisations that put together those kinds of deals, and Mattereum is one of the those entities. In the real world, Mattereum might be seen as something a bit like KPMG or one of the other big-four accounting firms. It could have some overlap with the kind of stuff that some of the more entrepreneurial merchant functions that are out there. What we’re seeing here is the buildout of real-world finance, neither TradFi nor DeFi, but real-world finance with many of the same kind of business models that you get in the real world, but all implemented on the new technological backbone of the blockchain. This is really what we always thought Ethereum was going to be, this is back to the original vision – we can now implement through Mattereum all of the stuff that we talked about at Ethereum nearly 10 years&nbsp;ago.</p><blockquote>You need external entities that put together the deals, and Mattereum is one of the audit-like entities that helps put together the&nbsp;deals</blockquote><p>If Ethereum was a Jedi, Swarm is the lightsaber, because it’s going to cut right through the separation between the Ethereum community and the real world. Once we can get through that door, you can buy-and-sell 20% of a house as Ethereum tokens in a way that is government-approved, and at the end the lawyer who is involved in the deal can read the paperwork and go “Sure, that’s fine, that’s just a transaction”. There’s been a frothy, very delicate kind of enthusiasm with tokens, where the enthusiasm goes away and then suddenly all the money goes away. How different would it be, if all of the enthusiasm around NFTs a couple of years ago had been for instruments that had durable value, like real estate or gold or fine art? You wouldn’t have a situation where there was this sudden dramatic popping of a bubble. Real estate bubbles pop, but when a real estate bubble pops, people lose 20% of their value; when a token bubble pops, people lose <a href="https://www.levelup.com/en/news/756539/Report-95-of-NFTs-Have-Lost-All-Their-Value-Theyre-Now-Worth-Nothing#:~:text=New%20information%20suggests%20that%20NFTs,have%20lost%20all%20their%20value.">99.9% of their value</a>, and then sue a celebrity.</p><blockquote>If Ethereum was a Jedi, Swarm is the lightsaber</blockquote><p>With real-world stuff when you buy something it doesn’t have this kind of inherent volatility. This is because what you’re not buying is “Does this asset class really exist or not?” which is where we are with NFTs, it’s where we are with DeFi, it’s where we are with ICO tokens, You’re not making a bet on whether the asset class turns into something; you’re taking an asset class that, in some instances, is tens of thousands of years old and you’re making a bet on an individual thing inside of that asset class. It’s a completely different kind of risk, it’s a much lower risk in most cases, it’s certainly a much more easy-to-understand risk, and it doesn’t have the same kind of correlation, because even if one piece of real estate turns out to be a bad deal, somewhere in the world all the rest of the real estate is much the same as it ever&nbsp;was.</p><blockquote>You’re not buying “Does this asset class really exist or&nbsp;not?”</blockquote><p>Right now, the only way to buy things if you cannot afford them yourself is credit. You want something, the thing is expensive, you need something, the thing is expensive... The only way that you’re going to get that thing is if you can borrow money from one or more people, and then you take all of that money, you buy the thing outright, and now there’s your thing. That as an approach involves paying interest: 2-3% for a long time, when interest rates were super low, now interest rates are high, high, high and they’re probably going to go higher, and you start thinking like 30% APR [annual percentage rate] on credit cards, and even higher instances in some instances... But even the core borrowing from bank base rates, the interest rate numbers are going up and up and up – it’s getting more and more difficult and dangerous to use debt to finance&nbsp;things.</p><blockquote>Right now the only way to buy things if you cannot afford them yourself is&nbsp;credit</blockquote><p>The other way of doing this thing is that you get people together to buy things collectively. Equity, not debt. “Hey, I want to buy this thing; I can’t afford it. How about I take two-thirds of it, and you take one-third of it? How would that be? – Oh yeah, that’s fine. Sure, absolutely.” Now, if that’s something like a riding lawn mower, then you sort of divide this up in terms of who’s going to use it when, and you’re sort of dividing these things up in time. That is a very, very small set of use cases. Most of the time, what people do is they divide things up in terms of value: here’s an enormous building, four different companies, each put money into that building, and one of them owns 5%, one of them owns 10%, one of them owns 25%, the other owns the rest of the building with rules, governance, for how the entities that all own parts of the thing interact. If you get to the really big-scale things, like publicly-traded companies, you could have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of shareholders. At the end of that you can do transactions at really huge scale and the thing that they own collectively together, is something like a power grid or an airline. These mechanisms are really alternatives to&nbsp;debt.</p><blockquote>The other way of doing this is that you get people together to buy things collectively.</blockquote><p>What tokenisation does is it takes the transactional costs of doing those kinds of deals down 10, 100, 1,000 times in time. Rather than getting a lot of different partners together and it costing $350,000 in legal paperwork you get something like that, but it’s a set of operations done on DeFi, and it costs you, maybe $18 worth of gas because you did it on one of the L2s [layer two platforms]. It’s going to take us a few years before we can get those prices down to those kinds of levels because it needs an established ecosystem, templated legals and so on, but when you can offer these kinds of things as services all kinds of new things become possible. Imagine you want to buy a house. Your grandparents and your parents and your cousins are going to put up 30% of the money for the house in exchange for so many shares to the house, that’s what you’re going to do, instead of taking this enormous loan from the bank; you could get a smaller loan at a much better interest rate, and you could put together these kind of combined debt-and-equity packages for the day-to-day business of staying alive as an ordinary person that works for a living. It takes these super powerful tools from high finance, and it brings them down as a way of replacing massive mortgages and credit card debt. It gets us out of a debt paradigm and into a debt and equity paradigm, or even a pure equity paradigm. That really changes our relationships with each other, because not everything is then mediated by an adversarial relationship of who owes who money; these things then become mediated by a collaborative relationship, which is that we own this thing together. That changes the whole tone of your society, debt society is hostile; co-ownership society is much, much more benign, much friendlier.</p><blockquote>Debt society is hostile; co-ownership society is much friendlier.</blockquote><p>Democratising access to fractional ownership of assets is going to revolutionise the world much more than the credit card itself did. The credit card was a huge deal, because before that people only really had cash economies. So the first transformation was that ordinary people got access to debt: you got mortgages, then you got credit cards, and that fuelled this enormous burst of people making long-term plans. “I am going to buy this thing on credit, I’m going to take out a loan, or I’m going to put it on my credit cards,” and so people’s lives speeded up enormously, because they could bring money from the future into the&nbsp;present.</p><blockquote>Democratising fractional ownership of assets is going to revolutionise the world much more than the credit card&nbsp;did</blockquote><p>Now you say, “Well, what happens if we start replacing this debt-based society and debt based economy that we have now with a debt-and-equity-based economy?” There are $42 trillion of transactions a year on<br>credit cards – the numbers are staggering! Imagine a similar transformation, where we give people access to equity as an instrument. It’s a percentage of the entire mortgage market, it’s a percentage of every car purchase, it might be a percentage for every time somebody buys resalable consumer electronics like laptops. There are just staggering things that can happen once you’ve got equity on the table, and the level of social transformation I expect to be even larger than the social transformation caused by credit cards and the debt revolution.</p><blockquote>There are just staggering things that can happen once you’ve got equity on the&nbsp;table,</blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAOs [decentralised autonomous organisation]</a> can be created based on this, reshaping collective ownership and governance of physical assets. DAOs have massive potential as a way of managing and governing collective ownership of real world assets, but so far, without that as a purpose to shape them, they’ve struggled to find a niche in the real world. But to me DAOs are the best example of an Ethereum technology which is poised to take over the world, and it just needs that extra step — connecting them to real world assets — and then suddenly they’re going to be everywhere. I know a lot of people in the DAO community had very high hopes for them as an instrument that would change everything and then, a bit like Ethereum itself, they’ve had this phenomenon where you just keep stamping on the accelerator and the wheels don’t move. It’s the gearbox problem – DAOs also need a gearbox; what we’re providing is the&nbsp;gearbox.</p><blockquote>DAOs need a gearbox; what Mattereum is providing is the&nbsp;gearbox.</blockquote><p>The approximate real-world equivalent of the DAO is the publicly-traded company: you buy a share of stock, you now have some economic rights. The board cannot just screw you over and disenfranchise you, because you have legal protections, and they have to consider your wishes when they make decisions. They can do things like get together and elect board members. If you think of the CEO of the company as kind of like the president, the board are kind of like the supreme court, they sit over the president, they enforce law. The shareholders pick the board, the board then picks the CEO. It’s kind of slightly democratic, but in practice it doesn’t seem very democratic because the people that run large companies have gotten very good at fighting shareholder democracy. But in principle, shareholder democracy can work, maybe one fine&nbsp;day.</p><blockquote>People that run large companies have gotten very good at fighting shareholder democracy</blockquote><p>The DAOs have the ability to automate this governance: you own some tokens in a project, you have some rights, there is some protection for your interests as a result of those economic rights, there is some contract law, there might be even some statute law, but these things all together create a situation where we are collectively governing an asset that we co-own together. “Here is a thousand acres of rainforest. 50,000 people own some of that rainforest. They collectively have voted that they’re going to preserve that rainforest for the next 25 years, and they will not even consider selling land to any entity that isn’t a better rainforest protector than the one they are currently themselves.” Those rules can be written into the process, and then no future set of owners can change those rules because this stuff is immutable. All of that stuff, if you try to do it with lawyers, the time and the cost and the expense is massive, if you try to get the voting done and people have to turn up at shareholders’ meetings and they have to fill in proxy forms... It’s hard. That’s one of the reasons why shareholder democracy is not so effective in large companies, but if all of that stuff was brought online and it was all managed through DAOs with properly set-up legals and contract law and all the rest of this, proper voting rights, proper economic protection for minority token holders, the rest of these necessary steps, then what you get is an economic democracy revolution. All of the technology that’s been worked out by the DAOs is suddenly applied to collective ownership of the world’s assets. The DAOs suddenly have an enormous amount of work to do in the real world, the software will get better and better and easier and easier, and in ten years you could see hundreds of millions of people participating in DAOs, in the same way that hundreds of millions of people participate in social media&nbsp;today.</p><blockquote>What you get is an economic democracy revolution.</blockquote><p>We never really thought that individuals were going to go out there and become one-person movie studios, and now that's a huge sector of the economy. In the same way, you don’t think that individuals are going to become governance geeks and they’re going to wind up managing investment portfolios and they’re going to wind up as sort of stewards of planetary resources. I think that that transformation is necessary and inevitable, because we know that we cannot run the global economy in the way that we’re doing it today. It’s a disaster zone, and we can only fix that by re-democratising the world. That doesn’t just mean going to<br>a ballot box and voting once every four years; it also means direct engagement and direct ownership of the world’s productive assets, from the rainforests to the airlines so that these things are well-stewarded by the people that are affected by how they are run, rather than just being controlled by a very small corporate elite that does everything possible to make sure that shareholders have no actual&nbsp;power.</p><blockquote>The global economy today is a disaster zone, and we can only fix that by re-democratising the&nbsp;world</blockquote><p>With the combination of Mattereum and Swarm, all this becomes possible, and ultimately easy. Any real world asset can be tokenized, people can use the tokens to share equity for their own purposes, they can form DAOs to manage larger assets and they can re-democratise things at a level that doesn’t need governments to be involved, beyond providing the legal framework in which these things operate. This is something we are doing now, not something that we are hoping to make possible in the future; the Mattereum system is<a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/09/26/mattereum-customer-west-london-city-lets-launch-first-real-estate-physical-asset-nft-for-land-in-uk/"> live and working</a>, and has been for two years. Swarm are up and running and have been for even longer. It’s two mature and effective players coming together to create a synergy that can change the world from day one, putting real world assets securely on-chain and giving people the tools to manage them; we’re not some new hopefuls promising vapourware for some indeterminate, distant&nbsp;date.</p><p>The future is here, now, and ready for&nbsp;use.</p><blockquote><a href="https://mattereum.com/sell-assets/">Contact us</a> if you have assets you would like to fractionalize using the Mattereum system</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fractional-ownership-rwa-daos-and-the-holy-grail-557b99e8e045">Fractional Ownership, RWA DAOs, and the Holy Grail</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Generative AI has emerged as a transformative force. These advanced large language models can autonomously create content ranging from text to images and even music, offering unprecedented capabilities for creativity and innovation. However, as with any groundbreaking technology, generative AI presents a host of cybersecurity challenges that demand immediate attention.</p>
<p>Understanding Generative AI</p>
<p>Before delving into the cybersecurity challenges, let’s grasp the basics of generative AI. At its core, generative AI employs deep learning techniques to generate data that is almost indistinguishable from human-generated content. ChatGPT, a prime example, has amazed the world with its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, sparking applications in content creation, chatbots, and more. Generative AI models like ChatGPT can be fine-tuned for various tasks, making them incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>The Dual-Edged Sword of Generative AI</p>
<p>The versatility of generative AI is both its greatest strength and a cybersecurity Achilles’ heel. While these algorithms have limitless potential for good, they also possess the capacity to wreak havoc in the wrong hands. Here are some of the significant cybersecurity challenges that arise from generative AI:</p>
 
 Deepfakes and Misinformation: Generative AI can create highly realistic deepfake videos, audio clips, and texts. This poses a severe threat to individuals, organizations, and even governments, as malicious actors can use these creations to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and even impersonate others including important people, celebrities, or even a boss or loved one. 
 Data Privacy and Theft: Generative AI models often require massive amounts of data for training. The misuse of this data, whether through unauthorized access or data breaches, can have catastrophic consequences for individuals and organizations, leading to identity theft, fraud, and privacy violations. 
 Automated Phishing Attacks: Cybercriminals can leverage generative AI to craft highly convincing phishing emails and messages. These messages can mimic the writing style of trusted contacts, making it difficult for users to distinguish between genuine and malicious communication. 
 Content Spam: Generative AI can be exploited to generate vast quantities of spam content, saturating online platforms ranging from social media to forums and open-source code repositories and degrading the user experience. This can result in content poisoning and increased susceptibility to phishing and malware attacks. 
 Adversarial Attacks: Generative AI models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight alterations to input data can produce unexpected and often malicious outputs. This makes it challenging to secure applications that rely on these models, such as image recognition systems and natural language processing. 
 Bias and Discrimination: Generative AI models can inadvertently perpetuate bias and discrimination present in their training data. This raises ethical concerns and can lead to discrimination in various applications, such as hiring processes or content moderation. 
 
<p>Mitigating Generative AI Cybersecurity Challenges</p>
<p>Addressing the cybersecurity challenges associated with generative AI requires a multifaceted approach:</p>
 
 Robust Model Testing: Developers must rigorously test generative AI models to identify vulnerabilities and potential misuse cases. This includes assessing the model’s response to adversarial inputs and ensuring it adheres to ethical guidelines. 
 Data Privacy Measures: Organizations should implement stringent data privacy measures to protect sensitive data used in training generative AI models. Encryption, access controls, and regular security audits are essential. 
 User Education: Raising awareness among users about the existence of generative AI and its potential for misuse is crucial. Users should be educated on how to spot deepfakes, phishing attempts, and other malicious uses of AI-generated content. 
 Regulation and Legislation: Governments and regulatory bodies should establish clear guidelines and regulations for the responsible use of generative AI. These regulations should address issues like data privacy, deepfakes, and the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. 
 Advanced Authentication: Organizations should implement robust authentication mechanisms to protect against AI-generated attacks, such as biometric authentication and phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
 AI Ethics and Bias Mitigation: Developers should prioritize ethical considerations when training generative AI models. Efforts to reduce bias and discrimination in AI-generated content must be ongoing. 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Generative AI holds immense promise for innovation and creativity, but it also presents a host of cybersecurity challenges that cannot be ignored. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from developers, organizations, and governments alike. However, AI is also a great tool for helping us to meet these challenges. Furthermore, by implementing robust security measures, educating users, and regulating the responsible use of generative AI, we can harness its potential while safeguarding against its misuse in an increasingly digital world. The future of generative AI hinges on our ability to navigate these uncharted waters with wisdom and foresight.</p>

  <p>Innovations in cybersecurity have typically taken hold on the business side before making their way to consumers as controls gained broad acceptance. However, with passwordless multi-factor authentication, or MFA, the script is flipped.</p>

<p>Consumers have grown accustomed to logging in to the latest Apple device and web application using biometrics — fingerprint, voice, or facial scanners — instead of typing in passwords that can be lost, forgotten, or stolen. They have embraced the idea of stronger security and a more seamless digital experience by ditching the password and using passwordless authentication.</p>

 "Where's my passwordless MFA?" 

<p>Now, internal employees, contractors, and stakeholders (collectively known as workforce users) are asking the same question: "Where's my passwordless MFA?"</p>

<p>We recently met with <a href="http://www.doubleoctopus.com">Secret Double Octopus</a> (SDO), a leader in workforce passwordless MFA and a collaboration partner in the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">ForgeRock Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> solution. We set out to explore this question and outline a realistic path to secure, frictionless passwordless MFA for the workforce. Our discussion revealed that the roadblocks for workforce users have stemmed from three common perceptions — or misperceptions — about passwordless MFA:</p>

  The password policy/2FA/MFA we already have is "good enough" 
	 Passwordless MFA isn't ready for the workforce 
	 The change to get there won't be worth the effort 
  The "good enough" paradox 

<p>Many organizations operate with passwords and some MFA for high-value applications. However, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon</a> estimates that phishing and compromised credentials still factor into 85% of security breaches. These attacks include modern, highly automated ransomware, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> (ATO), and business email compromise (BEC), and often target crown-jewel assets. In other words, the password approach is not even close to "good enough."</p>

<p>New regulations, security frameworks, and cyber insurance all place a premium on stopping phishing. Businesses continue to invest in education, monitoring and detection, endpoint protection, and cloud security. But most look to MFA and user education to stop the relentless exploitation of user credentials.</p>

<p>While MFA supplements vulnerable passwords, cybercriminals continue to develop sophisticated workarounds like advanced man-in-the-middle (MiTM) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them">MFA prompt bombing</a> or "MFA fatigue" attacks that target authentication itself. Modern passwordless methods solve the problem at the source by taking away attackers' ability to exploit passwords or phish users.</p>

<p>But stronger security is just one part of passwordless MFA's compelling value proposition. Many organizations are lulled into thinking their current MFA is good enough, but it won't pass security or regulatory muster, and it will continue to frustrate and perplex users.</p>

 Securing a better user experience 

<p>At the top of many executives' priority list is improving their organizations' security posture, but some place equal or greater importance on improving user experience (UX). Passwords represent a huge hassle for all involved, as employees and help desk technicians waste cycles setting, resetting, and rotating passwords, and improving cyber hygiene.</p>

<p>Horacio Zambrano, CMO at Secret Double Octopus (SDO), says passwordless MFA delivers greater speed and flexibility. "Ideally, you want to deliver a simple, universal login experience that strengthens security and takes the burden of managing passwords away from users," Zambrano says. He noted that "MFA sprawl" — using multiple login screens, devices, and workflows — compounds user frustration. "We all have our phones with us all the time, so using them to authenticate makes great sense. If you can use the same app for everything and eliminate having to remember different passwords for the desktop, VPN access, and web applications, it's a big win. A universal experience with biometrics, and fast, ubiquitous connectivity from a mobile device is as modern as it gets."</p>

<p>Though there may be resistance at first, consumers and employees will flock to solutions that secure their digital identity and data — so long as it's easy. "Change is hard and there's always concern about user inertia," Zambrano says. "But once users experience passwordless and see how it makes their lives easier, they typically love the simplicity."</p>

 Passwordless offers exponentially greater business value 

<p>ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> integrates SDO's Octopus platform for passwordless MFA to deliver a greater return on investment (ROI) than traditional MFA methods that rely on passwords. "Organizations can 'buy down' cyber-risk by stopping phishing — and the disruptive breaches that follow — while meeting new compliance mandates and possibly lowering cyber insurance premiums," says Fred Kost, VP of Product and Solutions Marketing at ForgeRock.</p>

<p>Getting rid of passwords eliminates a huge portion of annual help desk calls, each of which costs companies $70 or more on average. When all is said and done, SDO estimates the transition saves organizations nearly $2M within two years of implementing passwordless MFA.</p>

<p>It has the added benefit of reducing administration costs and relieving the burden on IT.</p>

<p>Passwordless MFA delivers the rare trifecta — less risk, less cost, less effort — so why isn't every business doing it already? Where the budget is already earmarked for MFA, the hesitation centers around the second misconception about modern MFA.</p>

 "Is passwordless ready for workforce primetime?" 

<p>Doing away with passwords effectively takes the phish out of the sea by replacing shared secrets with cryptographically strong authentication. But in order to achieve phishing resistance, organizations must be able to upgrade all or most applications to support passwordless, something those in IT generally don't consider feasible. Skeptics continue to question whether passwordless MFA can prove to be robust enough for workforce authentication.</p>

<p>To keep semantics from clouding the benefits, SDO defines passwordless MFA as:</p>

<blockquote><p>Authentication that works for all workforce applications — on-premises, remote, and in the cloud — without requiring users to set, remember, or reset passwords ever again.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Octopus platform decouples user authentication from backend identity management to enable comprehensive coverage for workforce use cases. The decoupling allows companies to extend a safe <a href="https://doubleoctopus.com/security-wiki/authentication/passwordless-authentication/">passwordless authentication</a> experience to users of any application, including password-centric legacy and custom solutions, without having to retool those apps and directories.</p>

<p>"ForgeRock and SDO give customers the ability to roll out passwordless MFA to any workforce application quickly without retooling applications or disrupting identity infrastructures," says Kost. "Digital identity managers can make changes at any time with a non-technical staff, so you're not always having to involve developers and coders."</p>

<p>The integrated ForgeRock/SDO approach immediately improves security by virtue of fast, easy onboarding, with IT free to modernize the backend identity infrastructure at its optimal pace. Even with a win-win value proposition for employees and IT, it can be hard to navigate change.</p>

 "How much, how soon?" 

<p>Passwordless MFA delivers on ROI — less risk with less effort at less cost — leading some progressive enterprises to become early adopters. Once the passwordless MFA champion in your organization gains support for the project, the question becomes, "Where do we start?"</p>

<p>Though not always easy, answering this question produces valuable insight into priorities:</p>

<blockquote>
	  Should you start with high-profile users likely to be targeted by spear-phishing or "whaling" attacks? 
		 Should you start with remote workers and VPN users authenticating via the open internet? 
		 Or should you start with the group that, for whatever reason, requires inordinate support to reset and rotate their passwords? Or the one that requires detailed auditing to solidify compliance? 
	 </blockquote>

<p>There may be no one right answer, but there is at least one solid best practice to follow: don't tackle too much too soon.</p>

<p>"The implementation of passwordless login doesn't need to happen all at once; it can be something you roll out over time and get there incrementally," says Kost.</p>

<p>For example, the first phase might include entering a username and having that trigger a prompt for passwordless authentication that helps users become accustomed to logging in using biometrics. The next step might be taking the username and password out of the user workflow, and the final stage getting rid of passwords completely.</p>

<p>"The greatest successes we see are when customers choose one or two applications to start with and get those done within the first year," says Kost. "Where we see projects go sideways is when companies try to do something for everybody all at once and the whole project gets derailed. Initially, we advise taking things in bite-size increments."</p>

 Security, simplicity, and savings — in time to meet new mandates 

<p>Together, ForgeRock and SDO deliver enterprise-class security with consumer-grade simplicity. The combination may be the key to surviving pressure from cybercriminals and regulators alike.</p>

<p>"We're already seeing Zero Trust mandates from the Biden administration and other governments worldwide specifically calling for phishing-resistant MFA," SDO's Zambrano says. "It's only a matter of time before most if not all security standards and frameworks do the same and acknowledge that phishing-resistance requires a passwordless approach to authentication."</p>

<p>ForgeRock's Kost concurs. "Companies that upgrade now or go directly to passwordless will be lightyears ahead of the game compliance-wise. More importantly, they'll be far less likely to get hit with ransomware and other attacks that put data at risk and companies out of business."</p>

<p>By Sheridan Johns, co-founder of <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, and Leonard Dorlöchter, co-founder at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peaq.network/">peaq</a></p><p>Let’s play a game: We give you the setup, and you come up with a punchline. Here we go — what does Italy have in common with Twitter’s ex-Chief Twit and the creators staging an online protest at ArtStation? “They all know how to make a statement that goes&nbsp;viral!”</p><p>The above punchline was proudly brought to you by none other than ChatGPT, everyone’s favorite AI overlord, but this questionable sense of humor is not what got the model a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406">temporary ban</a> in Italy. The country restricted access to the application due to the concerns over user privacy and data. Rome lifted the restrictions after tweaks that allowed users to opt out of letting OpenAI use their dialogues with ChatGPT to help train&nbsp;it.</p><p>Data, or rather its allegedly <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1648784955655192577?s=20">illegal</a> usage, was also what prompted Elon Musk to lash out at Microsoft, accusing it of using Twitter’s data to train an AI model. After all, user data is a crucial pillar of the business model embraced by today’s social media platforms and Big Tech in general. By harvesting user data, they can hyper-personalize the ads they feed to their users to the point where it sometimes feels like they know us better than we know ourselves.</p><p>And, as you have correctly guessed it, data was at the heart of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/">ArtStation protests</a> against AI-generated imagery. Art is also a type of data, the kind you need to train a model with hardcore applied statistics to approximate an artist’s genius. The same goes for literature, music, and pretty much anything else. If it can be created, it can also be turned into data, and if it can be turned into data, you can train a model that can generate more data of the same&nbsp;sort.</p><p>So yes, data is the punchline. But as the age of AI takes off, this punchline will draw only a few laughs — and a ton of&nbsp;turmoil.</p><p>New oil, new&nbsp;clashes</p><p>In the age of AI, data is indeed the new oil, as old as this Big Data-era wisdom may sound. It’s the fuel that drives machine learning, the core technology powering AI, and scale is the name of the game: In most cases, the more data you throw in the machine-learning furnace, the better the model you&nbsp;get.</p><p>And much like oil, again, data isn’t just a resource, but a source of power. Whoever controls the spice, controls the universe, and whoever controls the data, controls the future of the AI&nbsp;boom.</p><p>While we hopefully won’t see data being a factor in actual wars, the age of AI will surely see its fair share of spats and arguments over who gets to do what with data. Even though it’s not regarded as a finite resource, and is easily replicated with a good ol’ copy-paste, there is a zero-sum game element here. If Alice owns the data Bob needs to train his BobGPT, she has a vested interest in making sure he’s not doing that for&nbsp;free.</p><p>While she’s at it, though, Alice may want to seriously consider another piece of this puzzle:&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>At a first glance, there’s an inherent tension between AI and privacy. While training an AI model takes vast amounts of data, the way this data is being harvested often infringes on our privacy. In some cases, as it apparently happened with <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/privacy/ftc-facebook-broke-terms-5b-data-privacy-settlement">Meta</a>, this violation is more clear-cut, and in others, as with the artists’ protest, it is more nuanced. Part of the dataset that StableDiffusion was trained on came from the publicly-available art on ArtStation, and its result is a model that you can use for commercial and non-commercial purposes alike… with some terms and conditions. So it’s not too difficult to see why the creators were outraged.</p><p>AI’s privacy struggles are indicative of a larger and more deep-seated issue. The digital economy’s business model is predicated on surveillance and monetization of user data. This model, often referred to as “surveillance capitalism,” goes against privacy if not in the letter, but definitely in the spirit. The advent of AI will only kick this problem into a whole new&nbsp;gear.</p><p>So while data is growing more valuable by the day, all the disputes we’ve seen so far are just the tip of the iceberg, in terms of companies and platforms clashing over data ownership, as well as users and regulators protesting the infringement on privacy. But what if there was a way to reconcile AI’s insatiable hunger for data with the need for&nbsp;privacy?</p><p>Enter Web3, the next evolution of the internet, where users, not tech companies, are in control of their data, and enter the second part of this blog post, published by peaq, the Web3 network powering the Economy of Things (EoT).

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 12th September to 25th September <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope Crypto Regulatory Newsletter, your trusted source for the latest regulatory developments shaping the global cryptocurrency space.</p><p>In this edition, we will navigate through the evolving regulatory frameworks in the European Union and the United Kingdom, touching on significant legislations like the DAC8 and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill and highlighting the collaborative endeavors of regulatory bodies with crypto enterprises.</p><p>We will also glance at Malta’s alignment with the MiCA regulation and scrutinize the broader international call for harmonized cryptocurrency oversight.</p> Emerging EU Regulations Set Global Precedence <p>European Union: The crystallization of crypto regulations within the European Union is casting ripples through the global financial waters.</p><p>Recently, DAC8, a directive empowering tax authorities, received robust backing in the European Parliament, indicating a united front in the enhanced oversight of crypto transactions to curb tax evasion and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>This directive aligns itself with the overarching MiCA legislation and the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), forming a cohesive monitoring network for all EU-based crypto transactions.</p><p>However, the critics argue that DAC8 barely differentiates itself from CARF, potentially impacting individual member states’ autonomy in digital oversight.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1702377358898962724?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The United Kingdom: Parallelly, the United Kingdom is on the cusp of endorsing the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill.</p><p>This legislation, sharpened over time, is aimed at addressing financial crimes related to digital currencies. It underlines the necessity for precise modifications to maintain focus on illicit funds while upholding corporate integrity.</p><p>Additionally, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK is actively seeking collaboration with crypto businesses. Their ambition is to forge balanced and conducive guidelines that foster growth while ensuring a stronghold on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing protocols.</p><p>Malta: Venturing south, Malta’s Financial Services Authority (MFSA) is aligning its stance with MiCA, illustrating a worldwide movement towards unified regulatory frameworks.</p><p>This adaptation is critical for establishing orderly transition and operational stability in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1704505385430695991?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>International Perspective: The concerted movement towards comprehensive regulation is reflective of a wider international push for harmonized oversight.</p><p>The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) advocates for such harmonization, spotlighting the disjointed policies prevalent in the U.S. and spotlighting potential risks inherent to varied regulatory actions across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>These unfolding regulatory developments depict a balanced interplay between innovation and governance in the crypto realm, raising pivotal questions about the convergence of international crypto norms and the future trajectory of the digital financial ecosystem.</p><p>The repercussions of these regulatory symphonies will inevitably sculpt the crypto landscape, defining its global resonance and directional flow.</p><p>Now, let’s analyze two of these major developments and look into their possible impact on the broader crypto ecosystem.</p> UK Nears Crucial Legislative Milestone: A Closer Look at the Impending Crypto Regulations <p>The UK’s meticulous legislative journey around cryptocurrency regulation is poised at a critical juncture, with the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill inching closer to becoming&nbsp;law.</p><p>Initiated last September, the legislation aims to alleviate financial crime concerns linked to cryptocurrencies, having evolved through extensive evaluations.</p><p>The bill seeks to preserve the focus on funds accrued from illicit activities while clarifying corporate integrity guidelines, especially for foreign entities operating within the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also articulated its willingness to work with crypto enterprises to formulate a holistic regulatory framework, emphasizing mutual cooperation and adherence to Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing protocols.</p> The Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects:   Enhanced Trust and Legitimacy: The collaborative approach between regulators and industry could elevate trust and legitimacy within the&nbsp;sector.  Market Stability: Clear, well-defined guidelines could contribute to greater market stability and reduced fraudulent activities.   Negative Aspects:   Operational Constraints: Strict adherence to the regulatory framework may impose operational constraints on crypto entities, potentially impacting innovation.  Market Participation: The stringent regulatory environment might deter new entrants and could influence market dynamics, impacting both consumers and businesses.   EU Urges Non-EU Regulators for Tighter Crypto Oversight <p>The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) has underscored the critical need for cohesive regulation in the global cryptocurrency market, especially beyond the European Union, as the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) Act progresses towards its December 2024 enactment.</p><p>The EPRS report warns of potential risks to the EU’s financial system and autonomy, citing divergent policies in the U.S. and anticipated regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU, which could lead to a lack of legal clarity and regulatory certainty.</p> The Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects:   International Cohesion: The EPRS’s emphasis on unified regulations could propel a movement toward international cohesion in crypto policies, potentially fostering a harmonized global environment for crypto development and investment.  Enhanced Legitimacy: The pursuit of regulatory alignment can elevate the legitimacy of the crypto sector, possibly resulting in increased trust and participation from both individual and institutional stakeholders.   Negative Aspects:   Regulatory Overreach: The call for tighter oversight may spur stringent and inflexible regulatory frameworks, possibly imposing barriers to entry and constraining the dynamism inherent to the crypto industry.  Divergent Compliance Burdens: The varying pace of regulatory evolution across different jurisdictions may place inconsistent compliance burdens on crypto enterprises, potentially affecting market diversity and competitive balance.

<p>Amid the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global data privacy crisis</a>, where <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">concerns</a> about online <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and safety continue to grow, individuals and businesses are increasingly turning to <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/safe-browsing/">safe browsing</a> and <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/virtual-private-network/">virtual private networks</a> (VPNs) for protection. In fact, over the past few years, global advisory companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">McKinsey</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Cisco</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trusted-tech.html">PwC</a>&nbsp;have identified that:<br>&nbsp;</p>



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p><br>None of this is a surprise: we’ve said for a while now that privacy is a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue</a>&nbsp;of this decade, which means it makes good business sense to offer powerful privacy and security tools wherever you can. We believe one of the most lucrative product combinations is safe browsing and VPNs and here are 4 reasons why:</p>







<p></p>



 1. Safe browsing and VPNs safeguard user data and build a foundation of trust for your brand 



<p>Safe browsing and VPNs go hand in hand for protecting user data from malicious threats and unauthorized access. A safe browsing product gives access to private browsers, ad and tracker blockers, and site reputation services, while a VPN encrypts the user’s internet traffic and activity and keeps it safe from prying eyes. Offering both products sends a clear privacy-first message to your customers and employees, can attract new customers from the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">growing cohort</a> demanding strong privacy protection, and sets a foundation of trust and security that promotes brand loyalty and more revenue.</p>



 2. Offering safe browser and VPN expands your target markets 



<p>With incidents of data breaches and other privacy infringements growing annually, more <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are actively seeking</a> secure online experiences. By integrating safe browsing and VPNs into your online business model, you could reach those <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">target markets</a> whose concerns for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy and security</a> are high and growing. And, typically, the more customers the more revenue, right?</p>



 3. Your brand can monetize its VPN service, which is especially attractive in some key industries 



<p>Many VPN providers offer subscription-based models, giving users access to enhanced privacy features, region-restricted content, and faster internet connections. By partnering with a reputable VPN provider and offering their services as part of your business package or as an upsell, you could create an additional revenue stream. This is particularly relevant for businesses operating in industries where data privacy and secure online communication are paramount, such as finance, legal services, and healthcare.</p>



 4. Brands that get privacy and safety right will disrupt the market 



<p>It’s a clever move to decide that data privacy will be your brand’s competitive advantage. The 2020 PwC Trusted Tech&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trusted-tech.html">report</a>&nbsp;put it like this: Brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. In fact, nine out of 10 business leaders said that building and maintaining customer trust will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;competitive advantage of this decade. The <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy actives</a> first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Cisco</a>&nbsp;see respect for privacy as central to the brands with whom they want to do business. Brands that take conscious, positive steps to protect their customers’ privacy and safety and put privacy tools in their hands will come out the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">winners</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>So, it makes good business sense to build the products that consumers want. Leading brands are already building <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a> into consumer applications, and delivering products and services that offer security and privacy by default. You can too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a perfect world, there would be no ransomware, phishing, or unauthorized access. Every resource you need is right at your fingertips. Security is a given, regardless of user identity, device, or location. And here’s the best part: Your organization would be safe and sound, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Sounds perfect, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, this dream scenario is exactly that — just make-believe. In the real world, bad actors are targeting your sensitive data in leaps and bounds. They’re evaluating your organization’s defenses, testing its network security, and taking note of every weakness. All the while, insider threats and unwitting employees are leaking credentials, exposing the organization to potential attacks from the open web.</p>
<p>So, how can you be sure your users are who they say they are? The answer is strong and continuous authentication. As one of the basic building blocks of a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> architecture, your enterprise must have a series of user verification strategies at its disposal.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to begin, don’t worry. Read on to learn how you can start implementing Zero Trust throughout your organization with a series of strong authentication procedures.</p>
 The role of user authentication in enterprise security 
<p>In simple terms, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/authenticators">authentication</a> is the process of identifying users who request access to a system, network, data, server, application, device, or other company asset.<br>
The goal is simple: Ensure a user is who they claim to be. Once authenticated, the user encounters an authorization process that determines whether they can access whatever resource they requested.</p>
 Why is strong authentication important? 
<p>Authentication is foundational to cybersecurity in general. It enables your security team to ensure that only authorized users can access protected network resources, such as applications, databases, and more.</p>
<p>Although authenticating users has always been critical, it’s even more important given the rising demand for remote access. It’s becoming increasingly difficult for classic security tools to verify identities now that people are requesting access across a sprawling and distributed environment. From Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies to cloud applications, the authentication process is more complex than ever before.</p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, strong authentication is essential to Zero Trust security (but more on that later).</p>
 How does authentication work? 
<p>Traditionally, most organizations deploy password-based authentication processes. Users type in their credentials, the system checks them against a directory, and if it finds a match the user is granted network access.</p>
<p>However, for many enterprises, this is merely a one-and-done process. The user identity is confirmed once and assumed to be trustworthy for the duration of the session. That’s a problem, and here’s why:</p>
<p>If a hacker manages to get hold of a user’s credentials, they’d gain unfettered and unauthorized access to any number of critical applications, allowing them to exfiltrate, manipulate, or destroy sensitive data with ease. And in fact, that’s exactly how the majority of cyber incidents begin. According to Verizon’s 2021 Data Breach report, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-2021-data-breach-investigations-report">stolen or compromised credentials</a> are the most common attack vector, accounting for almost two-thirds of all breaches.</p>
<p>One way to mitigate this risk is to use more granular access control policies. This means restricting permissions based on user identity and other parameters, thereby reducing the impact of a compromised credential. Whereas some people may have the authority to open one resource, others may not have the same permission.</p>
<p>However, even with strict access management policies, organizations may still be vulnerable to attack. Bad actors don’t take their foot off the gas; they simply get more focused, homing in on “high-value” credentials as their primary targets.</p>
<p>Simply put, privileged accounts open more doors than the average identity. Hackers consider users with privileged access especially high-value targets, as these accounts have more access and typically are authorized to use an organization’s most critical assets. When the locks on these doors are cracked, there’s almost nothing stopping bad actors from using a wealth of corporate information for nefarious purposes. For instance, a cybercriminal may leverage stolen data in exchange for ransom payment or sell it to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Worse yet, these attacks are often successful. Roughly <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/about-26-million-fortune-1000-employee-credentials-available-on-the-dark-web-password-reuse-rampant/">540 million assets</a> associated with Fortune 1,000 employees were circulating the internet in 2021 — a 29% increase compared to 2020. This total included over 133,000 C-suite credentials, marking an average of almost 26,000 stolen passwords per organization.</p>
 Challenges of traditional authentication 
<p>Organizations are likely to be more vulnerable to attack if they stick with their security status quo. Traditional authentication and secure access tools are falling short of the mark. Why? Because they’re running into several obstacles that have rendered them inadequate:</p>
 
 Implicit trust: Classic network security tools and authenticators run on a policy of implicit trust, meaning they assume all users, devices, and so on are inherently trustworthy once they’ve been authenticated. 
 Lack of visibility: Legacy methods are often siloed and aren’t scalable. This makes it difficult to enforce a comprehensive access policy across the entire enterprise. 
 Weak password security: Many authenticators are still password-based. This is worrisome given that <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/06/10/employees-reuse-passwords-across-multiple-work-accounts/">over half of employees</a> reuse passwords for multiple accounts across applications and services. More often than not these are weak passwords that are easy to break or guess. If they fall into the wrong hands, it could spell disaster. 
 No context or risk signals: Traditional tools may not be context-aware or take important risk signals into account, such as device security, location, and so on. 
 
<p>It should also be noted that some authentication strategies are burdensome on the user experience. They may derail productivity or require employees to jump through hoops, so organizations should bear this in mind when designing authentication schemes.</p>
 What is strong authentication for Zero Trust? 
<p>The Zero Trust security model assumes all users, devices, applications, and resources are vulnerable at any given time. It considers all connections potential threats, even after they’ve already been verified. By eliminating implicit trust, this framework mandates strong and continuous authentication and reduces the risk of a stolen credential compromising the rest of your security posture.</p>
<p>Generally, there are three concepts fundamental to a Zero Trust architecture. They apply to all areas of cybersecurity, including access control and authentication. These include:</p>
 
 Continuous authentication: The Zero Trust framework advocates for explicit verification based on multiple risk signals, including user identity, device, location, workload, sensitive data classification, and more. Moreover, organizations must constantly evaluate these signals every time a request is made to access a resource or data — not just once at the beginning of a session. 
 Least privilege access: This extremely granular access policy limits user access only to the specific network resources required to do someone’s job or complete certain tasks. 
 Assume Breach: With inevitable breaches, it is critical to minimize the blast radius during a cyberattack through strong encryption and segmentation of users, devices, and networks. 
 
<p>When organizations apply Zero Trust principles to user access, they’re effectively creating a Zero Trust authentication process. This includes three basic steps:</p>
 
 Once a user requests access, they must verify their identity through <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA). In its simplest form, this involves providing a combination of identity factors such as a username, password, or one-time passcode. A truly robust Zero Trust architecture will deploy more advanced MFA techniques, such as phishing-resistant MFA with continuous risk assessment (but more on that later). 
 The device in use must also be authenticated to ensure it complies with the requisite security policies. 
 Once both are authenticated, they are then authorized to access the desired resource — but no more. Because the Zero Trust model advocates for continuous authentication, the user is continuously evaluated and verified in the background during every access request to ensure their identity hasn’t been compromised during a session. Additionally, this helps the organization enforce the principle of least privilege. 
 
 Benefits of strong authentication for Zero Trust 
<p>Implementing the Zero Trust framework has plenty of advantages. For example, strong authentication allows you to:</p>
 
 Prevent lateral movement through continuous authentication, thereby minimizing the attack surface. 
 Expedite threat detection by increasing visibility across the corporate network as well as public and private cloud environments. 
 Improve security policy enforcement through repeated, continuous authentication. 
 
 Supporting Zero Trust with layered authentication strategies 
<p>Zero Trust security draws upon a range of identity and access management (IAM) technologies, including cloud security, identity protection, and encryption.</p>
<p>The more effectively organizations implement these solutions, the more mature their security posture. However, it’s impossible to truly advance your place on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> without strong authentication.</p>
<p>There’s a vast ocean of authentication options available, ranging from basic to advanced. Each operates a bit differently, but all serve the same purpose. Rather than choosing just one, your security may deploy a combination of the following methods:</p>
 Single sign-on (SSO) 
<p>SSO allows the user to authenticate once across multiple applications or services with a single identity. The benefit of this approach is that you don’t have to remember a mixed bag of login credentials, making it exceptionally easy and user-friendly.</p>
<p>SSO helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access. On the downside, it can create a single point of failure, which is why it’s wise to implement multiple layers of authentication.</p>
 Multi-factor authentication 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-factor authentication</a> requires a user to provide at least two verification factors to receive access to a particular resource. These factors include:</p>
 
 Knowledge 
 Possession 
 Biometrics 
 Location 
 
<p>There are many types of MFA, but phishing-resistant passwordless MFA is considered one of the safest. This method doesn’t require a static password, instead using a combination of biometrics and digital certificates or security keys to act as verification.</p>
 Device authentication 
<p>The Zero Trust model recognizes the fact that remote access is greatly lengthening the classic network perimeter. Therefore, it encourages authentication strategies that account for all levels of risk, including those at the device level.</p>
<p>Organizations can deploy a variety of authenticators to verify device security. These may involve provisioning digital certificates on each device, evaluating its reputation, and more. Combining user and device certificate-based authentication provides the highest level of assurance for identities and protects against phishing and MFA bypass attacks.</p>
 Risk-based authentication 
<p>Also known as risk-based step-up or <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a>, this strategy evaluates the risk associated with a user or device. If the risk is deemed to be too high, it issues another challenge or denies the request outright based on the risk levels configured by the administrator.</p>
<p>This method is context-aware, meaning it factors various attributes into the authorization decision. It monitors user activity and dynamically adjusts authentication requirements, thereby “stepping up” security when it’s needed most.</p>
 Challenges of implementing Zero Trust 
<p>Unfortunately, embarking on a Zero Trust journey is easier said than done, especially as it relates to authentication. There are several roadblocks you may face that could complicate the process, including:</p>
 
 Complexity: Implementing Zero Trust can be difficult, especially in large and expansive IT infrastructures. Integrating a robust authentication framework requires careful planning and execution. 
 User experience: It can be challenging to strike the right balance between security and a frictionless user experience. Ideally, organizations want to enforce policies and authenticate identities without hindering productivity and only adding friction to the process when necessary. 
 Legacy technology: Custom or legacy applications and systems may not integrate well with modern methods. Adapting legacy systems to fit within the Zero Trust architecture could require significant effort. 
 Scalability: Growing organizations need IAM solutions that will evolve alongside them without skipping a beat. Scaling up Zero Trust technologies to accommodate new users, devices, and applications can be difficult without the right guidance.

			 The APAC Tokenization Region is Heating Up 
 
<p>Compared to many other regions around the world, the APAC region has consistently been one of the leaders at the forefront of technological advancement. This is a familiar concept to us as most of Tokeny’s initial clients were domiciled here.</p>
<p>With boots on the ground once again, we were pleasantly surprised by some of the discussions we were having in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>While many crypto-centric events over the years have often sidestepped tokenization topics, our recent engagements at Korea Blockchain Week, Token2049, and Digital Assets Week in Singapore suggested a positive shift. The momentum seems to be swinging back in our favor, evidenced by our substantive conversations with leading financial institutions and banks.</p>
<p>We particularly observed a consistent sentiment among the region’s leading financial players, one that resonated with our longstanding vision:</p>
<p>To develop a standardized, shared, and open-source protocol tailored for permissioned use-cases, with an emphasis on tokenized securities.</p>
<p>Many are realizing that for true sustainable liquidity and to harness the full potential of blockchain, relying solely on private blockchains and siloed ecosystems isn’t the optimal approach.</p>
<p>Although these private systems offer a foundational understanding of tokenization, their inherent limitations could counteract the advancements made.</p>
<p>One driving factor behind institutions’ preference for private blockchains is the apprehension about compliance enforcement on public blockchains. In response, Tokeny initially developed the open-source ERC3643 to address this. When integrated with ONCHAINID, it ensures on-chain compliance enforcement.</p>
<p>It’s clear to us that the global capital markets are on a steadfast journey towards comprehensive on-chain operations in a compliant environment, bringing the vision of tokenization closer to fruition.</p>
<p>A special acknowledgment goes to our new partners, the Klaytn Foundation in South Korea, for their immense support and hospitality. We eagerly await the opportunity to return the gesture when you join us in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>During our time in Asia, we had the honor and pleasure to speak on panels and participate in collaborative conversations with other tokenization leaders.</p>
<p>Here is a recap of some of our photos in South Korea:</p>

  Have you ever experienced a major IT outage caused by issues with directory services such as Microsoft Active Directory? If not, you surely have heard about others that came into trouble here. Directory Services, with the Microsoft Active Directory still forming an essential part of the IT backbone in about 90% of medium-sized to large organizations, are critical for a working IT. If they fail, authentication fails (or, at best, stumbles). If data gets “corrupted”, this even can lead to the propagation of erroneous changes to other systems. SAP systems not working anymore because mass deletions from AD were propagated to SAP are not a one-of-a-kind disaster.

Directory Services must work. And if they fail, you must be able to put them back to work again rapidly. This requires a plan. This is where DR (Disaster Recovery) comes into play. It is not just about a tool for backup and for restore. DR is about a plan on how to restore, about defined responsibilities, about exercises, etc.

It also is aligned to monitoring of systems and to ITDR (Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response): When do you need to act?

<p></p><p>Web5 prescribes that users maintain control of their content by <a>decoupling their identity and data</a> from the applications that they use. I'm frequently asked why major companies, who have made billions of dollars off of our data, would buy into this model.</p><p>I challenge you to think of this from a different perspective. In the ever-evolving technological landscape, Web5 is not a call to convince the giants to relinquish control over our data, but about expanding what's possible on the web.</p><p>A decentralized app model might not immediately grab the attention of today's market leaders, but it opens up exciting possibilities for the innovators of tomorrow, particularly around open data models.</p> The Incentive<a title="Direct link to The Incentive">​</a> <p>Web5 enables a web that eliminates the traditional barriers of centralized data control. Developers who resonate with this philosophy, or those intrigued by the many advantages of a decentralized approach, will find Web5 to be a vast playground.</p><p>Let's take AI-driven applications as an example. Through today's lens, it may appear that data equates to unparalleled value and thus, retaining control of that data would be attractive. However, as AI technologies evolve, they increasingly depend on rich, diverse, and open datasets — the kind that are best obtained by participating in a more open, decentralized data ecosystem.</p><p>But this shift isn't limited to AI. Web5 creates an ideal setting for innovation for all sorts of companies from many different verticals. Up-and-coming apps, unburdened by legacy systems and the status quo, can fully embrace the benefits of Web5, paving the way for a new era of web applications. This unique advantage allows them to immediately offer something that top companies don't: the ability for users to take their data with them.</p> Consumer Expectations<a title="Direct link to Consumer Expectations">​</a> <p>Here’s where things get interesting. As early adopters interact with and understand the value of applications built on Web5, their demands will shift. They'll start to expect more portability and interoperability of their data between applications across the web. In time, this change in expectations will exert pressure even on larger players to adapt or offer similar flexibility.</p><p>We’ve seen this unfold with products like Google Search and StackOverflow in the wake of <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>. These players have dominated their respective markets for quite some time. Not even a year ago, the thought of a new app threatening these business models seemed improbable... comical even. And yet, almost overnight, we saw consumers’ expectations change. All of a sudden, asking a question and clicking through multiple links to get to the answer felt outdated. Dealing with snarky users in order to get technical help no longer seemed worth the trouble.</p><p>This new expectation forced these companies, who are the market leaders in their spaces, to reassess their business models and innovate accordingly in order to appease their user base.</p> The Journey to Adoption<a title="Direct link to The Journey to Adoption">​</a> <p>Here’s how I envision the journey of Web5 adoption.</p><p></p> Evolution<a title="Direct link to Evolution">​</a> <p>It’s worth emphasizing that Web5 isn’t about replacing the old with the new, but an invitation to explore a new application model. It's about enabling a world where data isn't hoarded, but shared, and where developers can create applications free of traditional restraints.</p><p>In this unfolding story of the web's evolution, it's not the dominant players who will dictate the narrative. Instead, the stage is set for those who see beyond the status quo, for applications that redefine what's possible, and for consumers who champion their own data rights.</p><p>Web5 is less about disruption and more about evolution; the future awaits those brave enough to embrace it.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>
 SelfKey ENS subdomain: Definition and Benefits 
<p>When developing new technologies, SelfKey prioritizes the concept of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity (SSID)</a>, and the SelfKey ENS subdomain is a prime example of this approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the creation of a subdomain, SelfKey is aiming to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. This technology is centered on empowering users and it may provide them with greater control over their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey’s goal is to bring a positive change to the way people operate in the digital world. To make it more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>
 What is SelfKey ENS subdomain 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is an innovative subdomain that aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly domain name resolution system. Given this, users might not have to pay recurring fees for their subdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is likely to be a subdomain of key.eth. This means that users may register their preferred subdomain by adding their name or any other word of their choosing, such as yourname.key.eth. This naming convention is similar to email addresses. And, by providing an easier way to identify and interact with Ethereum addresses, it may bring self-sovereign identity closer to mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as DNS made the internet more accessible to the masses by providing a simpler way to access websites than using IP addresses, key.eth may do the same for Ethereum addresses. It replaces long, complex addresses with a human-readable format that is easy to remember and share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may improve the ease of use of the blockchain and help resolve one of the challenges to widespread adoption. Because of this, key.eth may be a step towards a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain ecosystem.</p>
 What are the benefits of SelfKey ENS 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is designed to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. By putting user accesibility first, SelfKey is aiming to create a more inclusive domain name resolution system that builds on the strengths of ENS while adding to its advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach might make SelfKey ENS subdomain a compelling choice for anyone who values privacy and security, and wants a more user-friendly way to manage their digital identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain provides several benefits to its users:</p>
 
 One of the primary advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that every verified SelfKey iD holder may receive a free key.eth subdomain on the Ethereum Mainnet that is longer than seven characters. This free subdomain may allow users to experiment with SelfKey ENS subdomain and explore its features without having to make extra financial commitment. 
 Once users have their free subdomain, they may buy more subdomains using any of the supported tokens. Users may utilize these subdomains for various purposes, such as getting payments or creating aliases for use in games. Users may buy as many subdomains as they like and use them to streamline their online activities. 
 Another significant benefit of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that users may sell their subdomains.&nbsp; Any marketplace that supports ENS trading, such as OpenSea, is a good place to start. This feature may offer users the freedom to experiment with different subdomains. And, if they decide to change their online identity or activities, they may sell them. 
 
<p>Overall, SelfKey ENS subdomain may provide great benefits to its users. It may enable individuals to not only manage and own their domains, but also boost their visibility online. These features might make SelfKey ENS an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their online identity and activities.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and ownership of personal data. However, the traditional centralized systems we rely on for managing our digital assets and domains may compromise these rights. This is where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in as part of an ideal decentralized future.</p>
<p>ENS allows individuals to own and manage their own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and secure. This means that no central authority has control over the domain name. A feature which gives individuals complete ownership and control over their online identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS may be one such solution that offers individuals the opportunity to manage and own their own domain names without the limitations of traditional domain names. This may not only give users more control over their online presence but also provide greater privacy and security.</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>Have you ever seriously considered the negative impacts of a data breach? Are you aware of the digital safety risks that lurk around the corners of the internet? And, did you know that cyberattacks may produce life-long consequences?</p>
<p>Nowadays, applications and websites have become so common that we consider them an integral part of our daily lives. And, because we have normalized it, individuals blindly share their private information with little thought given to the implications of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We rarely ever stop to consider what happens to our personal data once we share it with large technology corporations. And that’s because we live with the illusion that our valuable or sensitive private information is safe. That cyber attacks cannot possibly reach us.</p>
<p>However, some serious privacy violations have occurred in the past several months. And they have exposed the severe effects of sharing personal information without proper caution to safety and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite data breaches occurring on a daily basis, they aren’t discussed as often as they should be. Individuals who have not experienced such incidents may assume that they are immune to them. But anyone can fall victim at any time, and the consequences of a data breach can be irreversibly harmful.</p>
<p>In this article, SelfKey aims to provide an in-depth analysis of data breaches, recent events, and the potential aftermath for individuals whose personal information is compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly important to spread awareness about the possible consequences of data breaches. To attempt to prevent them from happening at all. With SelfKey’s decentralized solutions, a safer digital future may await us.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate on these crucial aspects in the paragraphs below.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>
 How can Data Breaches affect you?&nbsp; 
<p>Individuals can be affected by data breaches in two different ways:</p>
 
 At a large scale, when a centralized system is hacked, which can affect millions of people.&nbsp; 
 On a personal level, when an individual's personal online accounts are hacked. In this case, the breach may only affect one person, but it can still have severe consequences, such as financial loss or identity theft.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In both cases, it's crucial to take steps to protect yourself and your personal information. SelfKey advises using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and regularly monitoring your financial accounts for suspicious activity.</p>
 Large Scale: Attacking Businesses 
<p>Large-scale data breaches can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond the immediate victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While companies, institutions, and organizations are often the primary targets of such attacks, individuals can also suffer the consequences on a personal level. Even if the attack was not personally directed at them, they could still become collateral damage if the company they have trusted their PII with falls victim to a data breach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of this kind of data breach can be severe and long-lasting, for instance:</p>
 
 Companies can face financial losses, damage to their reputation, and even legal action. 
 Institutions may lose the trust of their stakeholders and customers, leading to a decline in business.&nbsp; 
 Organizations may find it difficult to attract and retain talent if they cannot demonstrate that they take data security seriously. 
 
<p>Furthermore, large-scale data breaches can lead to a loss of trust in the digital economy. If people cannot trust that their personal information is secure, they may be less likely to use online services and conduct transactions digitally. This could lead to a decline in e-commerce and other digital industries, negatively impacting the overall economy.</p>
<p>All in all, the consequences of large-scale data breaches are not limited to the immediate victims. Companies, institutions, organizations, and individuals can all suffer the effects of these attacks.</p>
<p>Below, we will examine some of these negative impacts more thoroughly.</p>
 Temporary Shut Down 
<p>Data breaches can have a significant impact on companies, not only in terms of the immediate costs but also in terms of long-term consequences. When a company experiences a data breach, it may be forced to halt its activity temporarily, which can result in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>According to industry surveys, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a> concludes that the cost of operational downtime can be around $5,600 per minute, which translates to $300,000 per hour. This can add up quickly, especially if the breach is not resolved promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the financial costs, a data breach can also damage a company's reputation and erode the trust of its customers, leading to long-term consequences.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-cyberattack-forced-a-logistics-company-to-temporarily-halt-operations-dde27a19">Expeditors International</a> is still dealing with the aftermath of a data breach that occurred in February 2022, which forced it to halt its activity temporarily. The company is likely to experience long-term consequences as a result, including a potential loss of business and damage to its reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is therefore crucial for companies to take proactive steps to prevent data breaches from occurring and to have a solid plan in place for responding to them if they do occur.</p>
 Financial Loss 
<p>Financial losses can arise from two main sources following a cyberattack:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ransomware 
 Legal actions 
 
<p>Ransomware attacks can result in significant financial losses for organizations, as hackers can demand large sums of money in exchange for unlocking access to their encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The growth of ransomware attacks is a cause for concern, with experts predicting that the total cost of ransomware damages worldwide could reach <a href="https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/ransomware-payouts/">$265 billion by 2031</a>.</p>
<p>Legal actions can also result in substantial financial losses for organizations. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html">The Equifax data breach</a> in 2017 affected over 145 million people worldwide and has already cost the company more than $700 million in compensation to affected US customers. The breach also affected an estimated 15 million customers in the UK, who have launched their own separate legal action in the high court seeking £100 million in compensation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal actions can be costly and time-consuming, and the reputational damage caused by a data breach can have long-term consequences for an organization's financial performance.</p>
 Reputational Damage 
<p>Reputational damage is a major concern for companies that experience large-scale data breaches. Such damage can lead to revenue loss and have long-term impacts on the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a company's reputation is tarnished due to a history of data breaches, people are less likely to trust the company with their payment information, and they may choose to take their business elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loss of trust can be difficult to overcome. Therefore, companies must take steps to protect themselves and their customers from data breaches. Additionally, they must try to maintain their reputation and ensure their long-term success.</p>
 Loss of Private Data 
<p>Sensitive data and intellectual property are two key areas that hackers target in a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensitive data can include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Personal information belonging to customers, patients, and employees. 
 Private company emails that contain personal health history, home addresses, and payment information.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When this type of data is breached, it can lead to significant financial losses and reputational damage for the company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is another target of hackers, particularly designs, strategies, and blueprints. When intellectual property is stolen, the competition can take advantage of the leaked information. And this, in turn, may cause long-term damage to the company's competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Businesses within the manufacturing and construction industries are particularly vulnerable to these types of cyber threats. Therefore, many small businesses believe that they are unlikely to be targeted by hackers, but this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, 60% of all hacks target small businesses because they are often easier to attack. It is therefore crucial for businesses of all sizes to take proactive measures to protect their sensitive data and intellectual property from cyber threats.</p>
 Personal Level: Targeting the Individual 
<p>Data breaches at a personal level often occur due to a lack of caution when operating in the digital world and inadequate security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People may accidentally share sensitive information, such as their social security number or credit card details, on unsecured websites. Alternatively, they could fall victim to phishing scams that trick them into revealing their login credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, using weak passwords and not updating software and operating systems can leave personal devices vulnerable to hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey’s decentralized solutions are centered around the individual’s privacy and security, with a strong emphasis on individuality. It is highly important for individuals to be vigilant when using digital platforms and take appropriate security measures to protect their personal data from cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
 Identify Theft 
<p>Identity theft is a serious crime that can have devastating consequences for its victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When criminals gain access to a victim's personally identifiable information (PII), such as their full name, Social Security number, and birthday, they can wreak havoc on their financial and personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims can have their bank accounts emptied, credit histories ruined, and valuable possessions taken away. <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh241/files/archives/factsheets/ojpfs_idtheft.html#:~:text=Identity%20theft%20has%20profound%20consequences,crimes%20they%20did%20not%20commit.">In some cases</a>, victims have even been wrongly arrested for crimes they did not commit. This is because the criminal may use the victim's identity to commit cybercrimes or other illegal activities, leaving the victim facing legal action and potentially a criminal record.</p>
 Notable examples of identity theft 
 
 The case of <a href="https://www.homesecurityheroes.com/famous-identity-theft-cases/#nicole-mccabe-identity-theft-and-assassination">Nicole McCabe</a>, an Australian woman suspected of murder after her passport was compromised and her identity stolen.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www2.texasattorneygeneral.gov/identitytheft/real-stories-of-identity-theft">Several victims</a> of identity theft had to struggle with proving they were not responsible for the withdrawal of large amounts of cash from banks, or illegally attempting to obtain loans worth thousands.&nbsp; 
 The terrifying story of <a href="https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294978560">Andorrie Sachs</a>, whose medical identity was stolen by a pregnant woman who gave birth in Sachs' name and left the baby at the hospital, resulting in a $10,000 hospital bill.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Local authorities mistakenly reported Sachs as an unfit mother and threatened to take her children away. This could also have lifelong implications for Sachs as the perpetrator had a different blood type, and uncorrected medical records could result in Sachs' death if she ever needed a blood transfusion. A healthcare provider could even prohibit Sachs from reviewing her own medical records as they might not be in her name.</p>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why SelfKey strongly encourages individuals to take proactive steps to protect their personal information, such as:</p>
 
 Using strong passwords. 
 Regularly checking their credit report. 
 Being cautious when sharing personal information online.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By being vigilant and taking appropriate security measures, individuals can reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft and the devastating consequences that can follow.</p>
 Personal Health Information 
<p>The theft of personal health information (PHI) is <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">highly valuable on the Dark Web</a>, as it can be worth more than 200 times stolen credit card information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This type of identity theft can have serious consequences, including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 Obtaining illegal medical treatments or prescription drugs. 
 Altering the victim’s medical history. 
 Using up the victim’s medical benefits.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Hackers can also sell stolen PHI to other criminals, who can use it for a range of illegal activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given these horrifying facts, SelfKey strongly advises individuals to take steps to protect their medical identity, such as:</p>
 
 Regularly checking medical records for errors. 
 Checking for signs of fraudulent activity. 
 Ensuring that their healthcare providers have proper security measures in place to protect their PHI. 
 
 Financial loss 
<p>Once malicious individuals obtain your PII, they could potentially use it to <a href="https://www.aura.com/learn/dangers-of-identity-theft">damage your credit</a> score and commit financial fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lowered credit score can make it challenging for the victim to:</p>
 
 Obtain a personal loan. 
 Secure a mortgage. 
 Even impact job prospects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, individuals who commit identity fraud can open new bank accounts in your name, drain your existing accounts, and commit check fraud. They can also apply for credit using your information, and engage in a variety of other banking scams. All things considered, it’s important to be vigilant in safeguarding your PII. The long-term financial consequences of a data breach can be severe.</p>
 Impersonation on Social Media 
<p>Cybercriminals can use your digital identity to carry out various malicious activities that can cause significant harm. Here are only a few terrifying examples:</p>
 
 They can use your digital identity to phish for credentials from your friends and family, leading to further attacks.&nbsp; 
 They can ruin your reputation by posting obscene or profane content online, damaging your personal and professional relationships.&nbsp; 
 They may look for sensitive photos and videos in your account and use them to extort you, leading to emotional distress and financial loss.&nbsp; 
 
<p>As horrifying as this may sound, there are ways to prevent this kind of disaster from causing irreparable damage to your digital identity. For instance, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> methods may be the key to protect individuals against identity theft.</p>
 Emotional and Mental impact 
<p>A personal data breach can lead to significant mental and emotional distress. The harm caused can take a long time to recover from, depending on the extent of the damage done by the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with reputational damage, victims may also have to spend a considerable amount of time and money to mitigate the fallout. And, the steps towards recovering from such a cyberattack could be draining in themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victims may have to spend endless hours or days:</p>
 
 Contacting their bank, lenders, and creditors. 
 Securing all their online accounts. 
 Replacing stolen identification documents. 
 Canceling and replacing bank accounts and credit cards. 
 Dealing with criminal charges made in their name.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Victims will also need to remove malware and viruses from their devices, while constantly proving their identity and showing that it was stolen. A process which can be emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausting in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, if affected individuals fail to repair compromised information or remove malware from their devices, they will risk falling victim to the same attacks over and over again.</p>
<p>The long-lasting consequences of a data breach can be devastating, particularly if your PII or PHI end up on the Dark Web. The information could be in circulation there indefinitely, making you vulnerable to further harm.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>

 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention. Although it is currently limited in scope, it has the potential to encompass endless possibilities in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, cyberspace can serve as a parallel existence alongside the physical world, or it can strive to provide a fully immersive virtual environment. This leaves room for many opportunities for individuals to explore and share knowledge in the metaverse.</p>
 The Benefits of Metaverse 
<p>At its core, the metaverse has tremendous potential to revolutionize various aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its capacity to serve as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, it may completely revolutionize the way we work, study, and socialize. It could facilitate many activities, such as virtual reality gaming, education, business meetings, social networking, and even virtual tourism.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the metaverse is the possibility for users to create and design avatars. This aligns with SelfKey’s idea of <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">customizable avatars</a>, which may enable individuals to design avatars in any ways they please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These avatars may enable interaction with other individuals or virtual objects in the metaverse. Furthermore, they may facilitate the creation of digital spaces that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual stores, events, and even entire cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and adoption of the metaverse may offer many potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Improved Connectivity&nbsp; 
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
 Increased Accessibility 
 Virtual Education 
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
 Streamlined Efficiency 
 
<p>Below, we will further elaborate on these advantages.</p>
 Improved Connectivity 
<p>Cyberspace allows for real-time communication and collaboration between individuals from anywhere around the world. Because physical distance is no longer an issue, individuals are able to build connections and easily collaborate on projects.&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
<p>The metaverse may offer amazing opportunities for people to engage in virtual tourism. This means that individuals may delve into virtual recreations of amazing locations from the real, physical world. Additionally, they may be able to experience completely new, fascinating fictional realms which they’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p>
 Increased Accessibility 
<p>Through the power of digital tools and endless creativity, the metaverse may become accessible from anywhere around the world. As long as there are stable internet connections, and with the proper devices, anyone could be part of this immersive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is particularly important, as it may facilitate participation for individuals with disabilities or mobility constraints.&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Education 
<p>The internet has provided access to information which surely must’ve made learning much more accessible than ever before. However, cyberspace can bring education to the next level by allowing the creation of immersive, virtual classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, individuals may be able to build realistic, interactive learning environments. This could prove to be incredibly helpful in terms of accessibility and education for young people all around the world.</p>
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
<p>By utilizing the potential of cyberspace, individuals may be able to experience unique scenarios and activities which may not be practical or possible in the physical world. For instance, they could participate in fantasy-based virtual reality games and simulations.&nbsp;</p>
 Streamlined Efficiency 
<p>The metaverse holds potential to streamline and enhance various business and organizational processes. This includes anything from meetings, training, and customer service, and it could facilitate debugging and solving particular technical issues much faster.</p>
<p>All in all, cyberspace represents a transformative landscape with far-reaching implications. It could potentially reshape the way we interact, learn, and engage with the world around us, and beyond. In spite of all these wonderful benefits, though, there are downsides to the metaverse which are worth mentioning.</p>
 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Metaverse Experience 
<p>Given the multitude of benefits cyberspace offers, it comes as no surprise that malicious actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, SelfKey proposes several decentralized solutions which may enhance security and prevent identity theft and other privacy concerns. These methods put a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The end goal is to empower individuals to confidently navigate the digital world.</p>
 SelfKey iD 
<p>An innovative online identity verification method, <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> was designed with the aim to safeguard user privacy and security. By utilizing ZK filters and AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, it strives to prevent unauthorized access to personal online accounts and systems by bots or identity thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">ZK filters</a> is to limit the amount of personal information shared when individuals interact with and engage with other individuals in digital spaces. If the shared data is limited, it may be insufficient for bad players to compromise. And this may enhance overall security and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> is utilized with the aim to deter identity thieves from accessing a user’s online accounts with the latter’s stolen digital information. Thanks to AI’s ability to detect duplicates or fake, AI-generated images, SelfKey iD may be able to combat and prevent these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may be able to enjoy the wonders of metaverse with confidence. Even more, they may ensure the privacy and security of their online persona.</p>
 SelfKey's Customizable NFTs 
<p>In the pursuit of a safer and decentralized future, SelfKey recognizes the importance of individuality. To this end, SelfKey may offer the means for individuals to embrace their uniqueness and make a mark in the metaverse through customization.</p>
<p>Through SelfKey's Customizable NFTs, also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">Normies</a>, users can attach these digital assets to their SelfKey iD. And this may allow them to express their originality and gain access to exclusive features.</p>
<p>Normies are composed of Base NFTs and Wearables, offering users countless combinations and possibilities for customization. This provides users with an ideal opportunity to create digital representations that truly reflect their own identities.</p>
 SelfKey's ENS subdomains 
<p>Last, but not least, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-ens-mass-adoption-of-self-sovereignty-on-blockchain/">SelfKey's ENS subdomains</a> strive to offer equal opportunities for individuals to own and personalize their domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of these subdomains aims to make them affordable for everyone. And to possibly ensure that each person has the opportunity to be the owner of their own digital presence.</p>
<p>By implementing these online identity security solutions, and aiming to create a secure digital environment, SelfKey is striving to contribute to a much safer digital future. The potential of cyberspace and modern technology is immense, and it’s worth being used for the good of the people.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Every day, technology reaches new heights, unlocking doors to unimaginable opportunities. However, like any innovation, there are those who will exploit it for their own gain, regardless of the harm caused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the right tools and knowledge, we may be able to prevent such occurrences.</p>
<p>The metaverse holds the power to revolutionize society and provide virtual access to knowledge like never before. But, it is essential to be aware of the accompanying risks. This way, we may navigate these remarkable digital realms safely.</p>
<p>SelfKey’s primary focus revolves around security and privacy. And every individual deserves these fundamental rights. People shouldn't have to risk their privacy and security in the pursuit of convenience or the use of modern-day technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By prioritizing security and privacy, SelfKey strives to empower individuals to embrace technology without sacrificing the safety of their digital identity.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 What is Online Identity? 
 A brief definition 
<p>The concept of online identity refers to a persona which people establish for themselves on the internet. Also called internet identity, online personality, or internet persona, it may be used in online communities and websites. It can also be a way of intentionally showing and representing oneself.</p>
<p>Although some people choose to use their real names online, some internet users prefer to be anonymous. They identify themselves by means of pseudonyms, which reveal varying amounts of personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, an online identity may even be determined by a user's relationship to a certain social group they are a part of online.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Identity vs Digital Identity 
<p>Even though online identity and digital identity are often found in the same context, there is a notable distinction between them. The difference between online identity and digital identity lies in their scope and focus.</p>
<p>Online identity specifically pertains to the persona and representation of a person in the online realm. It encompasses the social identity an individual establishes in online communities, websites, and social media platforms.</p>
<p>It includes elements such as:</p>
 
 Usernames and profiles. 
 Personal information. 
 Digital footprints. 
 
<p>All in all, it is the perception others have of the individual based on their online presence.</p>
<p>Digital identity, on the other hand, is a broader concept that encompasses the information and attributes associated with any entity, not limited to individuals. It extends beyond just personal online presence and encompasses a wider range of entities and their attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes organizational identities, system identities, device identities, and more. It focuses on how entities are identified, authenticated, and represented in the digital domain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, online identity refers to how a person appears and acts online, while digital identity is a broader concept that includes representing any entity in the digital world, such as people, organizations, apps, and devices.</p>
 Digital Footprints 
<p>While navigating the internet, it's important to remember that our online actions can have lasting effects on specific websites. These effects are referred to as digital footprints.</p>
<p>Digital footprints are the marks or records of our online activities and interactions that remain after using digital devices and platforms. They can include different types of data, like personal information, online behaviors, communications, and contributions.</p>
<p>Some examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Social Media Posts 
 Web Browsing History 
 Online Purchases 
 Email Communication 
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
 
 Social Media Posts 
<p>Any content shared on social media platforms, including photos, videos, comments, and likes, contributes to a person's digital footprint. These posts can provide insights into their interests, opinions, and activities.</p>
 Web Browsing History 
<p>Every website visited and the search queries made leave a digital trace in the form of browsing history. It can include information about the types of websites visited, articles read, products searched for, and online services used.</p>
 Online Purchases 
<p>When making online purchases, individuals leave a digital footprint through transaction records. This can include payment information, shipping addresses, and product preferences. This data can be collected and analyzed to understand consumer behavior and tailor personalized advertisements.</p>
 Email Communication 
<p>Emails sent and received, including attachments, provide a digital trail of personal and professional conversations. The content of these emails can reveal information about relationships, affiliations, and communication patterns.</p>
 Online Profiles and Accounts 
<p>The creation and maintenance of online profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, dating websites, or gaming communities contribute to a person's digital footprint. These profiles often contain personal information, employment history, educational background, and connections. And they form a digital representation of an individual's identity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that digital footprints can have implications for privacy, security, and reputation management. The data accumulated over time can be used for various purposes, including targeted advertising, data analysis, and even potential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s vital that individuals take extra caution when browsing the internet, especially when sharing private information. Even websites that appear trustworthy may be at risk of data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
 How Online Identity Works 
<p>On a daily basis, individuals rely on their online identities to access various applications. Certain websites play a pivotal role in everyday work, communication, and education. However, there are also online domains that serve as sources of entertainment or offer delightful distractions.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples in which people make use of their online identities:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Media 
 Online Gaming 
 Professional Networks 
 Online Communities and Forums 
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
 
<p>Now, let's take a moment to briefly discuss them.</p>
 Social Media 
<p>On platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, online identity is built through the creation of profiles. This may also include sharing personal information, posting content, and engaging with others. For example, a person's online identity on Instagram might include their username, profile picture, bio, and the photos or videos they share.&nbsp;</p>
 Online Gaming 
<p>In the realm of online gaming, players often create unique usernames, avatars, and profiles that represent their gaming persona. Their online identity in this context is influenced by their gaming achievements, playstyle, interactions with other players, and reputation within the gaming community.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Networks 
<p>Platforms like LinkedIn focus on professional networking and career development. Online identity on LinkedIn is shaped by an individual's professional experience. This can include work experience, education, skills, recommendations, and professional achievements. It allows professionals to establish their expertise, connect with colleagues, and showcase their qualifications.</p>
 Online Communities and Forums 
<p>Though online communities and forums centered around specific interests or hobbies, individuals have the opportunity to participate in discussions, ask questions, and share knowledge. Online identity within these communities is built based on the content contributed, expertise demonstrated, and the respect gained from other community members.&nbsp;</p>
 E-commerce and Online Shopping 
<p>When engaging in online shopping, individuals create accounts and profiles on e-commerce platforms. Online identity in this context involves personal information, purchase history, reviews, and ratings given to products or sellers. It influences the trustworthiness and credibility of an individual as a buyer or seller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In each of these contexts, online identity is constructed through the information individuals share, their online activities, and the interactions they have with others. It plays a role in shaping how others perceive them and how they navigate various online spaces.</p>
 The Benefits of Having an Online Identity 
<p>Because the wide majority of the world has already adopted modern technology, having an online identity has become a necessity. However, there are a multitude of benefits which come with having an online identity, namely:</p>
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
 Professional Opportunities 
 Networking and Collaboration 
 Personal Branding 
 Access to Resources and Information 
 
 Expanded Reach and Influence 
<p>Having an online identity allows individuals to extend their reach beyond physical boundaries. It provides a platform to share ideas, expertise, and creativity with a global audience. And this may potentially lead to increased influence and impact.</p>
 Professional Opportunities 
<p>An online identity can open doors to various professional opportunities. It allows individuals to showcase their skills, accomplishments, and qualifications to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It acts as a digital resume, making it easier for others to discover and connect with them.</p>
 Networking and Collaboration 
<p>An online identity facilitates networking and collaboration by connecting individuals with like-minded people, professionals in their field, or communities of interest. It provides a platform to engage in meaningful discussions, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects, fostering valuable connections and relationships.</p>
 Personal Branding 
<p>Online identity enables individuals to shape and manage their personal brand effectively. They can curate their online presence to reflect their values, expertise, and unique qualities. This branding can help individuals stand out, establish credibility, and create a positive perception among peers, potential clients, or collaborators.</p>
 Access to Resources and Information 
<p>Having an online identity grants individuals access to a vast array of resources, information, and opportunities available on the internet. It allows them to tap into online communities, educational platforms, industry-specific websites, and research databases.

 Online Identity Risks and Challenges 
<p>As with any innovation, having an online identity does not come without risks. It’s important for people to be aware of these negative aspects and to take precautions to avoid becoming victims. Even more, it’s equally important to spread awareness and educate as many people as possible about these matters.</p>
<p>If proper security measures would be in place, the following situations could be prevented:</p>
 
 Identity Theft 
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
 Online Reputation Damage 
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
 
 Identity Theft 
<p>Online <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> occurs when someone gains unauthorized access to personal information and uses it for fraudulent purposes. For example, a hacker might gain access to an individual's online banking account and use their identity to make unauthorized transactions or steal funds.</p>
 Phishing and Social Engineering 
<p>Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive individuals into sharing sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity. For example, a person may receive an email appearing to be from their bank, asking them to click on a link and provide login credentials. Hackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.</p>
 Online Reputation Damage 
<p>In the digital age, a person's online reputation can have significant consequences. Negative or inappropriate content shared online, whether by oneself or others, can harm one's personal or professional reputation. For instance, a controversial tweet or a compromising photo shared online without consent can damage an individual's reputation and have long-lasting consequences.</p>
 Data Breaches and Privacy Breaches 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> occur when sensitive information is accessed, stolen, or exposed due to security vulnerabilities in online systems. This can lead to the compromise of personal information, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, or financial data. An example is when a major retail company experiences a breach, resulting in the theft of customer credit card information from their database.</p>
<p>These risks and challenges highlight the importance of maintaining strong online security practices, being cautious with personal information sharing, and being vigilant about potential threats to online identity.</p>
