<p>In this blog post, you’ll learn how to record SSH sessions on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VSI in a private VPC network using in-built packages. The VPC private network is provisioned through Terraform and the RHEL packages are installed using Ansible automation. Additionally, you’ll learn how to set up a highly available bastion host.</p>



 What is session recording and why is it required? 



<p>A bastion host and a jump server are both security mechanisms used in network and server environments to control and enhance security when connecting to remote systems. They serve similar purposes but have some differences in their implementation and use cases. The bastion host is placed in front of the private network to take SSH requests from public traffic and pass the request to the downstream machine. Bastion host and jump servers are vulnerable to intrusion because they are exposed to public traffic.</p>



<p>Session recording helps an administrator of a system to audit user SSH sessions and make sure they comply with regulatory requirements. In the event of a security breach, the administrator will want to audit and analyze the user sessions. This is critical for a security-sensitive system.</p>



 What is a private VPC network? 



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpc">virtual private cloud</a> is completely private if there is no public ingress or outgress network traffic. In simple technical terms, it’s private if there are no public gateways on the subnets (private subnets) and no floating IPs on the Virtual Server Instances (VSIs).</p>



 How do I connect to the private VPC network? 



<p>Client-to-site VPN for VPC is one of the two VPN options available on IBM Cloud, and it allows users to connect to IBM Cloud resources through secure, encrypted connections.</p>



<p>The client-to-site VPN is highly available, with two VPN servers that are created in two different availability zones in the same region. The bastions are highly available as well.</p>







 Prerequisites 



 
 <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&amp;interface=ui#create_user_key">Create an IBM Cloud API key</a> 



 <a href="http://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-client-to-site-authentication">Create and copy a certificate’s CRN from IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a> 



 Use <a href="https://openvpn.net/client/">OpenVPN Client</a> to connect to client-to-site VPN from your local machine 



 <a href="http://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-getting-started">Install and set up Terraform</a> 



 <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Install and set up Ansible</a> 
 



 Provision the private VPC network using Terraform 



 
 Once you have the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/secrets-manager">IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a> secret with the certificate, launch your terminal and set the following Terraform variables: 
 







 <code>export TF_VAR_ibmcloud_api_key=&lt;IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY&gt;

export TF_VAR_secrets_manager_certificate_crn=&lt;SECRET_CRN&gt;</code> 



 
 Clone the <a href="https://github.com/VidyasagarMSC/private-vpc-network">GitHub repository</a> with Terraform and Ansible code: 
 



 <code>git clone https://github.com/VidyasagarMSC/private-vpc-network

cd terraform</code> 



 
 Run the Terraform commands to provision the VPC resources (e.g., subnets, bastion hosts (VSIs), VPN, etc.): 
 



 <code>terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply</code> 



 Connect to client-to-site VPN 



 
 Once the VPC resources are successfully provisioned, you need to download the VPN client profile by navigating to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/vpnServers%20">VPN servers page on IBM Cloud</a>. 



 Click the Client-to-site servers tab and then on the name of the VPN: 
 







 
 Download the profile from the Clients tab. 



 The VPN provisioned through Terraform uses certificates. Follow the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-environment-setup%20">instructions here</a> to connect to the OpenVPN Client. 



 You should see the successful connection on your OpenVPN Client: 
 







 Verify the SSH connection 



 
 On a terminal, add the SSH private key to the SSH agent with the following command: 
 



 <code>ssh-add &lt;LOCATION_OF_PRIVATE_SSH_KEY&gt; </code> 



 
 Example: <code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/&lt;NAME_OF_THE_PRIVATE_KEY&gt;</code> 



 Run the following command to SSH into the RHEL VSI through a bastion host. You will be using the private IP address of the bastion in Zone 1: 
 



 <code>ssh -J root@10.10.0.13 root@10.10.128.13</code> 



 
 Remember, you should be connected to the client-to-site VPN to access the RHEL VSI through the bastion host. 



 After SSH, You should see instructions to enable SSH session recording using the TLOG package on RHEL. 
 



 Deploy session recording using Ansible 



<p>To deploy the session recording solution, you need to have the following packages installed on the RHEL VSI:</p>



 
 <code>tlog</code> 



 <code>SSSD</code> 



 <code>cockpit-session-recording</code> 
 



<p>The packages will be installed through Ansible automation on all the VSIs—both bastion hosts and RHEL VSI.</p>



 
 Move to the Ansible folder: 
 



 <code>cd ansible</code> 



 
 Create <code>hosts.ini</code> from the template file: 
 



 <code>cp hosts_template.ini hosts.ini</code> 



 
 Run the Ansible playbook to install the packages from an IBM Cloud private mirror/repository: 
 



 <code>ansible-playbook main_playbook.yml -i hosts.ini --flush-cache</code> 







<p>You can see in Figure 1 that after you SSH into the RHEL machine, you will see a note saying: ATTENTION! Your session is being recorded!</p>



 Check the session recordings, logs and reports 



<p>If you closely observe the messages post-SSH, you will see a URL to the web console that can be accessed using the machine name or private IP over port 9090. To allow traffic on port 9090, in the Terraform code, change the value of <code>allow_port_9090</code> variable to <code>true</code> and run <code>terraform apply</code>. The latest <code>terraform apply</code> will add ACL and security group rules to allow traffic on port 9090.</p>



 
 Now, open a browser and navigate to <code>http://10.10.128.13:9090</code>. To access using the VSI name, you need to set up a private DNS (out of scope for this article). You need a root password to access the web console: 
 







 
 Navigate to Session Recording on the left-hand side to see the list of session recordings. Along with session recordings, you can check the logs, diagnostic reports, etc.:

<p>The supply chain sits at the core of every trade. Smooth and efficient supply chain management is a must for any enterprise. Orders, shipments, and payments have to be in sync for each transaction for smooth supply chain management. Although supply chain activities appear to be straightforward, they are significantly complex. Such complexity has further increased with the world becoming a marketplace. Many corporations have to handle their supply chain on a global scale on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasingly, technology is being leveraged to solve multiple problems in the supply chain space. Labelling of inventory with RFID tags or digital product identifiers, and connecting the inventory movement with the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) to remove execution problems including inaccuracies in inventory data, missing shipments, and duplicate payments among others are prevalent now in the supply chain space. Despite such interventions, the scope for improvement exists and blockchain technology can be impactful. It can create complete, transparent, tamper-resistant records of all the information flow, inventory flow, and financial flows of every single transaction through its decentralised ledger system. Other distinct features like tamper-proof ledgers with complete traceability make blockchain-powered solutions ideal for streamlining supply chain management. Many specialised players like Dhiway Networks are enabling several organisations to improve their supply chain by leveraging blockchain.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Blockchain in Supply Chain:&nbsp; 



<p>Blockchain technology is bringing rapid transformation in the supply chain space. Through providing increased transparency, security, and efficiency, this technology holds the potential of revolutionising the supply chain process in multiple ways.<br><br></p>



 Smart contracts: 



<p>Supply chain management involves the process of planning, coordinating, and executing the flow of goods and services from the enterprise to the end user. This process involves multiple stakeholders including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. At the time of execution, multiple parties enter into several agreements. Blockchain technology transforms these contracts into smart contracts through automation. With smart contracts, every transaction and movement of goods can be recorded and tracked on a shared ledger, which is visible and verifiable by all participants. Therefore, trust, accountability, and traceability are established. Using automation, manual processes are eliminated. This reduces cost and the chances of fraud and error. Moreover, much of the paperwork can be eliminated, saving both time and resources. Smart contracts can execute predefined actions based on defined conditions. For instance, payments to vendors, transferring ownership, or triggering alerts can be accomplished through these smart contracts. Thus, manual interventions are mitigated, which reduces manual errors, delays, and fraud.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Ease in trade financing:&nbsp; 



<p>Smooth supply chain management can’t be achieved without an efficient trade finance process. And for trade finance to be efficient, document processing has to be seamless. Blockchain plays an important role in making document processing and administration visible across the supply chain through its decentralised ledger system. For instance, each stakeholder exactly knows where the goods are in transit in case of a shipping or air transport mode. Moreover, blockchain-based solution does away with any paper-based documentation and needs for its transportation to relevant parties. Such ease of documentation boosts the trust in the entire system and provides financial institutions the comfort of granting several trade financing facilities such as LCs (letters of credit), overdraft, and bank guarantees among others. Improved trade financing eventually leads to business growth across the spectrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Quality control &amp; Product authentication:&nbsp; 



<p>For a manufacturing concern like an automobile company or a pharmaceutical firm or a retailer, ensuring the quality of the product is of prime concern. In many instances, it has been seen that counterfeit products swamp the market, making a dent in the reputation of the original manufacturer. In this perspective, blockchain can be leveraged to verify the authenticity of products and prevent counterfeiting by enabling secure and tamper-proof records of a product’s origin and movement throughout the supply chain. As the movement through the whole supply chain is traced, quality is ensured by faster identification and subsequent removal of defective products.&nbsp;</p>



 Food safety: 



<p>For any food manufacturer, the safety of the food material is of prime importance. Because, any compromise on food quality not only brings reputational risks for a company but also puts the firm into many legal obligations. Therefore, tracing the food manufacturing process becomes important. Blockchain can be leveraged to track and monitor food safety, ensuring that food products are safe for consumption by providing a transparent and traceable record of the product’s journey through the supply chain.<br><br></p>



 Inventory management: 



<p>Inventory is the single most important thing that determines the outcome of any production process. A high level of inventory depresses profit, while a low level of inventory has the potential to disrupt the production process. Therefore, maintaining an optimum level of inventory of raw materials, finished products, and intermediary goods is critical. Enterprises have started adopting many innovative methods in inventory space of late. For instance, many enterprises have started adopting ‘Just-In-Time’ inventory method. Under this approach, corporations maintain only that much inventory as required. So, visibility over the complete inventory becomes essential for smooth production and sales. Blockchain can be used to track inventory levels and optimise inventory management processes. This reduces inventory costs and improves supply chain efficiency.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Sound financial management coupled with compliance: 



<p>Supply chain finance is a complex process and runs through several parties. Recording, tracking, and reporting financial transactions across the supply chain are important aspects that an enterprise has to take care of. Blockchain technology enables enterprises to achieve all the desired outcomes in supply chain finance. It provides secure and transparent records of transactions between suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. Similarly, an enterprise dealing with a global supply chain has to deal with the compliance norms of various nations. Blockchain technology can be used to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by providing a transparent and auditable record of supply chain processes. It reduces the risk of non-compliance and costs associated with it.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Unlocking efficiency in India’s supply chain with Blockchain: 



<p>India’s foreign trade is likely to exceed $1.6 trillion in FY24. While the country’s share of merchandise exports is around 2 per cent of the total exports, services exports are more than 4 per cent. The country is also one of the fastest-growing markets for ecommerce, which is likely to reach $163 billion by 2026. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector is witnessing rising investment- domestic and global- as China plus one theme picks up momentum. Many manufacturing concerns including Apple are increasing their production footprint in India. Against this backdrop, the scope for improving supply chain management through leveraging blockchain technology is enormous. Technology partners like Dhiway Networks with the right amount of experience and expertise can enable enterprises to devise a robust supply chain management framework and execute it with maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>App adoption is witnessing an exponential rise across the globe. India is no exception. Rising penetration of the internet, mobile-first culture, and a high young population are the driving factors behind this trend. From buying of grocery to purchasing apparel; from booking an air ticket to fixing appointments with doctors; apps have penetrated our lives in a big way. According to digital intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Asia will see the highest growth in mobile app adoption with a CAGR of 6.2 per cent to reach 88.3 billion first-time downloads by 2026. Within the Asian region, India is expected to lead with 40.2 billion new downloads by 2026. As the access to the internet rises, usage of apps in our daily lives is set to rise further. Apps can be centralised or decentralised in nature. While centralised apps are very popular in the current context, more and more apps are getting built in decentralised format.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 What are Decentralized Applications (dApps): 



<p>Decentralized applications, or dApps, are those software programmes that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of on a single computer. Unlike centralised apps, which are controlled by a single authority, dApps stay outside the purview and control of any single authority. dApps are often built on the Ethereum platform. Currently, dApps are in use for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media among others.<br><br></p>



 Advantages of dApps: 



<p>As users flock to apps, the safety and privacy of users’ data face increasing threats from cyber attackers. In several instances, users’ personal data have been breached, creating huge personal and financial liabilities. Similarly, the world is increasingly worried about the power of centralised apps (like Facebook and Twitter) over various world events by controlling the narrative. In this context, dApps due to their decenralised nature come with distinct advantages over centralised apps.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;</p>



 Safety &amp; privacy of users’ data: 



<p>Unlike centralised apps, decentralized apps do not require personal data to access their features and functions. Therefore, there is no fear of data breach as no personal data is shared. Users can use these apps quite confidently without experiencing any privacy issues. This is significant as the world has seen many instances of data breach in centralised apps. For instance, Facebook (now Meta) faced a major data breach in which the personal data of 533 million users got leaked. In a similar attack on hospitality major Marriott International, close to 400 million guests’ personal data including phone numbers, passport details, email addresses, and other sensitive information got leaked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 No central authority: 



<p>dApps ensure smooth transactions between two parties securely without involving a centralized authority. This feature allows dApps to grow in popularity as users don’t face any censorship from a central authority. Moreover, decentralised nature of dApps ensures transparency and accountability. In the last decade, many social media apps, which are centralised apps, have become very powerful in moulding and influencing public opinion. The world is now replete with stories where active censorship by centralised authorities of these apps has changed political discourse in many countries. Apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Whatsapp, and many others have been alleged abetted many controversial events across the world by posting or sharing contentious material. Against this backdrop, dApps get rid of such centralised authorities. Therefore, the scope of censorship doesn’t exist with more accountability.in case of dApps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Scaling up with multiple use cases:&nbsp; 



<p>Decentralized apps are known for their flexibility. Such flexibility allows us to build apps for different sectors like gaming, banking, ecommerce, retail, and many others at ease. Moreover, scaling up is rather easy in the case of dApps. So, huge numbers of users can transact through the interface which are dApps. Such inherent ability to scale up makes it fit for consumer-facing businesses, which usually see millions of customers transacting over a period of time.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Low cost of maintenance:&nbsp; &nbsp; 



<p>As decentralised apps use a shared network, a vast amount of data can be maintained without much cost. In centralised apps, data storage and retrieval require demand for both spaces for storage and specialised staffers. Therefore, the maintenance cost of centralised apps is usually higher than the dApps. Such affordability makes dApps fit for multiple use cases across sectors.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Less disruption, more stability: 



<p>Compared to centralised apps, dApps are more stable in their flexibility. The robustness of dApps also comes from the fact that it relied on a centralised server to function. As these apps operate on a blockchain network, such apps hardly see any interruptions. For any consumer-facing business, such stability and robustness make a compelling case for using dApps.&nbsp;For instance, India has seen many instances where consumer data has been leaked from ecommerce apps that are centralised in nature. If such apps become decentralised in nature, such risks can be mitigated to a large extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Challenges: 



<p>Despite these positive features, the process of developing dApps also faces some challenges. Firstly, dApps are relatively new. While the traditional apps market runs into a multi-billion dollar market, dApps is a multi-million market. After a surge in the use of dApps, the design, and development of such apps have been on a decline since 2018. This is because it being a relatively new concept, which will go through its own evolution cycle. Secondly, design, development, and maintenance of dApps are more expensive than the traditional apps. Research shows a functional dApp cost in the range of $50,000-$200,000 for an enterprise, which is way higher than a traditional app. Therefore, small and medium enterprises are staying away from the design and development of such apps despite their several advantages over centralised apps. Moreover, user experience is not up to expectations in dApps. With sound user experience being the key to better adoption of any app, dApps have to go a long way in this aspect. Hence, it has to match the centralised apps in terms of network demand, and user-friendliness. Though this can be overcome by working with the right technology partner, many enterprises shy away from developing dApps because of their initial perception. In the case of dApps, the network is evenly distributed among millions of nodes and computers. This makes maintenance, debugging, and updates a difficult task. Moreover, the ability to modify the code and data published on the blockchain network comes as another challenge. However, the limitations seen in dApps can be overcome through many means, and partnering with a blockchain-focused firm is one of them. &nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Partnering with the right blockchain developer: 



<p>Designing and developing dApps comes with complexity. It requires the right set of experience with deep expertise in the blockchain domain. Therefore, collaborating with a blockchain-focused technology company that has already executed such projects for various sectors is a must. It not only improves the efficiency of the development process but also alleviates stress and uncertainty. As dApp is a new technology area, emerging blockchain firms with prior experience ease the process to a great extent. Enterprises should also look at blockchain development firms that can deliver superior customer experience in the dApps like centralised apps. Specialised players like Dhiway Networks have prior experience and deep domain expertise in the design, development, and maintenance of dApps across multiple sectors. Collaboration with Dhiway Networks, therefore, will provide a definitive competitive advantage to enterprises in the dApps space.<br><br></p>

 Introduction 



<p>Reputation and trust are the key drivers of transactions in digital commerce. With the fast-paced growth of online markets, it is vital to establish credibility to secure customers’ confidence. Ratings are an essential aspect of trust-building elements buyers use when undertaking transactions.<br><br></p>



 Why it matters? 



<p>Consider an online marketplace where buyers broadcast their interest in a specific product or service, and a collection of sellers respond with suitable offers. In the absence of in-real-life interactions and in-person communication, the buyers rely on available evidence to evaluate the reliability of the seller and the quality of products and services offered. Ratings serve as this form of social proof, often providing the deciding factor of insights that aggregates the outcome of previous transactions. Higher ratings, positive feedback ease the doubts and reinforces the transaction decision.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Social Proof 



<p>Higher ratings act as a signal of approval from a group of similar buyers, and this drives potential buyers to feel more confident about their upcoming purchases – this is social validation, and the proof is a powerful psychological phenomenon.&nbsp;<br><br></p>



 Credibility 



<p>Ratings are a quantifiable representation of the seller’s credibility and the quality of their offerings. Positive ratings elevate the seller’s authority in that specific product range or niche – they are recognised as a reputable supplier with a solid customer base. This has a direct impact on sales numbers as well as the ability to launch new products on their shelves.<br><br></p>



 Impact on search results&nbsp; 



<p>Sellers with higher ratings are often present near the top rankings of a search engine query. This increases buyer traffic for these storefronts by establishing customer trust and loyalty. The visibility provides a significant advantage to sellers, as increased exposure leads to more traffic, conversions, and, ultimately, higher sales.<br><br></p>



 Some Concerns with Ratings 



<p>In online commerce, ratings act as a great leveller of information asymmetry – it bridges the gap between buyers and sellers by providing easily understandable methods that address the risks in an online transaction. However, since ratings are such a powerful marketing tool, there is an incentive to game the system, so ratings’ authenticity and trustworthiness have often come under scrutiny. The online commerce platforms weathered some challenges from deceptive practices around ratings.<br><br></p>



 Manipulation of ratings 



<p>A well-known concern around the credibility of the rating system is the prevalence of rating manipulations through fake reviews and other means. Unscrupulous sellers game the system by submitting highly positive or negative ratings to boost or tarnish the sales potential of products.</p>



<p>Given the volume of submissions detecting the fake ones is an arduous task, and often online platforms need more tools to detect and prevent such manipulation.<br><br></p>



 Unverified ratings submissions 



<p>The absence of solid verification mechanisms for ratings creates a situation where platforms cannot determine the authenticity of the submissions. This causes a significant negative impact on sellers, who are left scrambling to mitigate the losses originating from fake ratings and feedback.<br><br></p>



 Review and rating bombing 



<p>Coordinated efforts to boost or deflate the ratings for a product are common on online platforms. The absence of verification incentivises such methods where the ratings can originate from entities who might not even be actual product purchasers.<br><br></p>



 Reimagining rating systems with CORD Network 



<p>While ratings and reviews in e-commerce are designed to assist consumers in making informed decisions, deceptive practices often undermine trustworthiness. Ratings are an essential asset for a seller. It is necessary to address the trust deficit between sellers and buyers simply because online platforms cannot do so using traditional approaches.</p>



<p>The CORD Network from Dhiway is a tokenless distributed ledger built to handle data transactions at scale. The blockchain comes with the modularity of pallets – or microsystems which can be designed to address specific use cases. CORD enables persistent and unique identifiers that can address the unique challenges online platforms face around transaction ratings.</p>



<p>As a data infrastructure for an online commerce platform, CORD enables the sellers to receive a journal of ratings only for the transactions with the possibility of coordinated action on ratings being removed. At any point when the seller initiates a rating request, the ratings received are anchored on the blockchain. Over some time, the seller can obtain a ratings score as individual scores or aggregated values. This creates a significant change in experience for the participants on the online platform. Now, the ratings can be reviewed and audited for authenticity and correctness as the immutable data stream of the CORD blockchain brings this capability.<br><br></p>



 Secure, portable ratings 



<p>A well-known problem with online platforms is that the seller’s credibility is pinned to the platform. As credibility is built around the transaction feedback cycle – more transactions can lead to better ratings. However, this also raises the bar for any seller to seek out newer platforms to position themselves. The high cost of rebuilding credibility from the ground up is an economic and operational barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A rating system using the CORD blockchain addresses this by disintermediation – it unshackles a seller’s ratings from the platform. It transforms it into a secure, portable and verifiable score that can cite the transaction records which led to the score. At the same time, enable the seller entity to treat this as a documented portfolio of trustworthiness. Today, as we see open networks around commerce being established, it is necessary to apply the design thinking of decentralization to these network parts. From the perspective of a platform where the value is in the locked-down data silos – to the concepts of a network with the value in the data exchange – CORD brings about the attributes of data provenance, allowing secure sharing.</p>



<p>Such unbundling of data allows a seller to use the data payload of authenticable ratings to seek new opportunities, lines of credit and financing, and other available opportunities in digital ecosystems.<br><br></p>



 The Future 



<p>Ratings started as an easily understood measure of evaluating sellers in online transactions. But today, with innovative approaches – the rating data can be viewed in terms of a powerful asset which empowers the seller organizations to design the opportunities available to them. The way ahead is to deliver on this promise by using secure digital identifiers, which refer to provenance-embedded data streams with privacy-by-design approaches and selective disclosure. The idea of “data ownership” can be transformed into “data exchange” by reimagining the points of control and flow. And the CORD blockchain is just there to make this possible.</p>

<p>Globally, there has been an uptick of landmark regulations forcing companies to address sustainability issues like climate change, and to disclose the work they are doing to address these issues. On July 31, 2023, the European Union (EU) adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and published them as “<a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7ed31526-d025-4cc7-866d-1c5fc4c2b104#:~:text=On%20July%2031%2C%202023%2C%20the,Sustainability%20Reporting%20Directive%20(CSRD)">final rules</a>” for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the most far-reaching set of disclosure requirements companies have to comply with, covering 12 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220620IPR33413/new-social-and-environmental-reporting-rules-for-large-companies">CSRD will affect large US companies that have over 250 employees in the EU</a>, and €40 million in net revenue or more than €20 million in total assets. For the first wave of companies affected, <a href="https://ccc.bc.edu/content/ccc/blog-home/2023/04/what-is-csrd-overview-esg-reporting-requirements-for-companies.html">sustainability reports will be required as soon as fiscal year 2024</a>.</p>



<p>In parallel, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in the process of <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/sec-eyes-october-for-climate-disclosure-regulations-release">finalizing climate related disclosure requirements</a>. These requirements will likely mandate publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint, climate-related goals, and progress, as well as climate-risk related financial impact and expenditures. These disclosures will need to be filed as part of the company annual 10-K statements, potentially as soon as the 2024 fiscal year if the final ruling is published by October 2023 as currently expected.</p>



<p>Moreover, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released the final versions of its <a href="https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2023/06/issb-issues-ifrs-s1-ifrs-s2/">first two global sustainability disclosure standards for financial reporting</a> (the ISSB Standards) at the end of June 2023. These standards have wide support and are expected to be adopted by a significant portion of the <a href="https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2023/06/ten-things-to-know-about-the-first-issb-standards/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=website-follows-alert&amp;utm_campaign=immediate">countries and jurisdictions</a> that follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) across the world.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/33-11042-fact-sheet.pdf">proposed regulations and standards</a> represent a significant shift from today’s largely voluntary climate disclosures, requiring companies to adhere to regulated disclosures. For example, the regulated disclosures could be anything from estimates around Scope 3 emissions, to investor-grade data. In many of these cases, the outcome could be no assurance to limited assurance and then reasonable assurance over time.</p>



<p>While most companies have historically published annual Environmental Social Governance (ESG) reports long after their annual financial statements, it is likely that the SEC will require companies to disclose ESG data with financial statements. The process will accelerate the pace at which ESG data will need to be collected, verified, and incorporated into these financially material investor disclosures. Similarly, the ISSB and CSRD requirements, if adopted by member countries, will require sustainability disclosures in American multinational companies’ authoritative financial filing for those countries.</p>



 Key challenges in meeting Sustainability disclosure requirements 



<p>For most companies today, meeting this wide range of requirements will force accelerating the maturity level of ESG data quality, data management, and governance controls, as well as streamlining the ESG reporting processes to ensure auditability. This is because the proposed regulations mandate a higher level of (a) Transparency, (b) Analytical and Process Rigor, and (c) Assurance, than most voluntary reporting frameworks have required to date.</p>



 Transparency 



<p>CSRD requirements are based on “double materiality,” meaning that any covered company must report both on how its business is affected by sustainability issues and how its activities impact society and the environment. In 2021, the EU stated that the CSRD proposal “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1804">aims to ensure that companies report reliable and comparable sustainability information needed by investors and other stakeholders</a>.” Similarly, when the SEC announced the proposed regulations in 2022, SEC Chair, Gary Gensler indicated that the intention of the regulation was to “<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46">provide investors with consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information for making their investment decisions</a>.” The regulations mandate a level of transparency and consistency that will build upon what is only sometimes reported on in today’s ESG reports, including disclosing the level of total emissions, before offsets, as well as disclosing any offsets. Additionally, the SEC proposal requires any company that has announced climate-related goals to disclose the scope and structure of the goal. This includes discussions on how the company intends to meet its goals, whether progress has been made and if not already in place, plans to meet stated goals.</p>



<p>The overall recurring theme in these regulations is that companies can no longer pick and choose what they disclose or use ESG disclosures to paint the company in the best light. It is about accountability and driving comparability for real impact. Companies will therefore need to ensure constant data hygiene and data management controls to enable visibility and transparency for investors, sustainability activists, raters and rankers. Moreover, they will need to disclose ESG current state, as well as committed future state, with traceable progress.</p>



 Analytical and process rigor 



<p>The high level of analytical rigor required by the various regulations has increased from previous standards. For CSRD, ISSB and SEC, this is especially apparent in the requirements to assess climate-related risks and related business resilience. For example, the SEC could require companies to describe any analytical tools, such as scenario analysis, that they use to assess the impact of climate-related risks on their business and consolidated financial statements. They would also need to disclose processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and whether any such processes are integrated into their overall risk management system or processes. Furthermore, companies would need to disclose the price and rationale for internal carbon prices. To add to the complexity, different regulations may define boundaries differently, which means emissions and other sustainability impacts from direct and indirect business relationships will need to be analyzed and reported differently for these regulations.As such, there is a need for companies to ensure they utilize strong analytical skills and tools, as well as streamlined processes to address climate risk assessments and other sustainability disclosures.</p>



 Assurance 



<p>Both the CSRD ruling and SEC <a href="https://www.accountancyeurope.eu/publications/sustainability-assurance-under-the-csrd/">&nbsp;proposal</a> mandate some limited assurance to begin with, moving to reasonable assurance after a period of time. Today, sustainability information may be rife with human error, mostly driven by the complexity of data calculations (e.g., for emissions inventories) and the multitude of data that needs integration and conversion. To move to limited then reasonable assurance, companies must be ready to subject their sustainability data and processes to extensive testing of controls, data verification, assumptions validation and analytical methodology scrutiny. Companies must therefore move towards more automation, streamlined workflows, and systems integration. This will quickly combine and transform source data, and ensure traceability while eliminating human error in reporting, therefore enabling attestation.</p>



 How to address the reporting challenges 



<p>It will be critical for companies to establish systems and processes that enable high quality data, continuous data hygiene and data management with embedded quality controls and governance. At IBM, we have been helping companies prepare for the upcoming regulations by beginning with an inventory of existing data, systems, and disclosures. We then perform a gap assessment to help clients understand the processes, data, automation, and systems integration changes needed to meet the many regulatory requirements based on the scope of their operations. Lastly, we help clients create and execute data and process automation and integration roadmaps to enable investor-grade, accessible, and usable ESG reporting.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Common challenges our clients face at the beginning of this journey include siloed data and processes with different owners in the organization, inadequate ESG expertise and staffing, as well as the cost of adoption. As a leading systems integration company and a leader in sustainability services, we are helping our clients automate processes and integrate ESG data systems. This provides clients with our ESG expertise backed by decades of experience across the globe and helps them minimize the costs to change by accelerating insights and speed to value. Preparing for global disclosure requirements is a core imperative in future-proofing the business for increasing regulatory as well as investor and customer-driven ESG disclosures.&nbsp; More importantly, it enables companies to join peers and competitors in addressing the real risks posed by climate change, social issues and other sustainability initiatives to business resilience and continuity.</p>

  <p>Businesses have a certain responsibility to disclose how consumer data is being used, and if they don't, they face hefty fines and hits to their reputation. In fact, many consumers find personal data sharing to be a particular point of contention. So what can organizations do to respect consumer data privacy and avoid negative outcomes? The answer lies in a consent management plan.</p>
	
 What is consent management? 
<p>Consent management is a process that allows consumers to decide how much of their information will be accessible to the companies with which they interact. Many people are aware of the importance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identity management</a> and want to protect their sensitive information online. Consent management gives them the autonomy to do so.</p>

<p>Companies practicing proper consent management will put a <a href="https://getsitecontrol.com/blog/how-to-add-cookie-banner-to-your-website/">cookie banner</a> on their website. You've likely seen this pop up countless times, with a choice of "consenting to" or "rejecting" the use of cookies. Whether you're banking, shopping, or scrolling on social media, companies are duty-bound to inform you if they are tracking your online behavior.</p>

<p>Through consent management platforms, businesses keep tabs on users accepting or rejecting cookie tracking. They also keep track of marketing communication preferences, such as whether or not people are interested in receiving emails from the company.</p>
	
 Why does consent management matter? 
	
<p>Public concerns about data privacy are nothing new and will continue to expand along with online services. Consent management is there to dispel some of these concerns for consumers. Corporations have a responsibility to adhere to consent management best practices — and there are regulations all over the world that make it a legal requirement as well, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>), the California Consumer Privacy Act (<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>), and the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (<a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/">PIPEDA</a>), to name a few.</p>
	
 Changing public concerns and corporate best practices 
	
<p>Internet users have grown savvy regarding consent management and there is a growing public concern over data privacy. There are proposed adjustments related to consent management from <a href="https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/press-release/coalition-privacy-self-reg-orgs-launch-uniform-approach-cmp-specific-controls-and">privacy self-regulatory organizations</a> such as the Digital Advertising Alliances (DAAs). In February 2023, the DAAs launched a uniform approach for brands and publishers to offer privacy controls on sites through Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) and the AdChoices program. Collectively called the CMP Complement, the specifications:</p>

  Allow corporations to work with participating CMPs to direct consumers to a dedicated module that provides them with only relevant marketing advertisements 
   Allow consumers to use the <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/2695279?hl=en">AdChoices Icon</a> through participating CMPs 
   Provide more information, disclosures, and choices to consumers regarding their personal information sharing 
   Allow consumers to use the AdChoices Icon to access a CMP dashboard along with the current DAAs' information and choices regarding personalized ads 
 <p>Further corporate best practices related to consent management include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a>: Allowing only specific users access to specific platforms and information online 
   Consent preferences: Giving consumers the option to customize their level of consent to share their personal data 
   Subscription options: Giving consumers the option to opt-out fully or partially from marketing communications 
   Timeliness of data: Keeping personal data for only an allotted period of time and then deleting it or asking for continued consent 
 <p>Corporations typically keep consumer information on an <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">identity cloud</a> platform, allowing them to manage consent preferences in accordance with laws and proper business ethics. Giving consumers access to these platforms and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">control over data privacy</a> is becoming increasingly important — and easier to do with new and improved tools available.</p>
	
 Tracking user consent and preferences 
	
<p>Keeping track of user consent and preferences is integral to success in today's digital landscape. Users are more keen to have control over their data privacy and access to consent preference platforms.This is a great way to build trust and customer loyalty, but can create additional work. Organizations can utilize CMPs to keep up with this increased demand.</p>

<p>CMPs are important in the present <a href="https://www.playwire.com/blog/adtech-landscape">AdTech landscape</a> — an ever-changing and expanding encyclopedia of tools for business advertising. CMPs allow businesses to consolidate all of their consent management information from all of this AdTech into one place, making it easier to track user consent and preferences.</p>
	
 The need for digital identity management 
	
<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">Digital identity management</a> is important for today's users due to the increasingly sophisticated nature of cyberattacks. All users should be given the option to consent for their private information to be shared with third parties. The level of consent should be as transparent as possible. That way, if there is a data breach, a company has already done everything in its power to let consumers know how their data was being used.</p>

<p>Consumers are concerned with data privacy and will research a company's safety record before deciding to consent to sharing personal information or receiving marketing communications. For example, if a company just underwent a business split-up, there's a greater chance that <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-protect-your-digital-assets-following-business-split">digital assets may be compromised</a>.</p>

<p>Consumers are also tuned in to prior data breaches. They are able to research a company's previous data privacy failures and incident responses to see if they feel comfortable sharing their sensitive information with them presently. In addition, internet users typically don't want to be inundated with personalized ads. <a href="https://amlegals.com/targeted-advertisements-an-invasion-of-privacy">Targeted advertisements</a> can feel like an invasion of privacy, especially if the user didn't consent to their data being monitored to inform those ads.</p>
	
 New regulations and best practices 
	
<p>All businesses, regardless of industry, should stay aware of the new regulations, best practices, and advanced tech specifications for digital privacy management. If companies fail to protect their consumers' digital privacy, it can result in a ruined reputation and significant financial loss, as the average <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">cost of a data breach</a> in the U.S. in 2023 is $9.44 million.</p>

<p>CMPs manage user consent well, but they are best managed in conjunction with other digital privacy tools. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-ciam">Customer identity and access management</a> (CIAM) platforms typically incorporate everything businesses need to keep up with data privacy best practices. They keep everything in one place — from facilitating online registration, login, and account management tools to managing customer identities at scale.</p>

<p>Users want autonomy over their digital assets. To meet this demand for digital autonomy, consent management best practices and modern CIAM tools can be the key for businesses to stay in compliance and in their customers' good standing.</p>

<p>The term digital transformation gets so much play these days that it’s almost become a cliché. But experts from <a href="https://www.frost.com/">Frost &amp; Sullivan</a> believe that for most organizations, there’s a sizeable gap between dream and reality. Digital transformation drives many IT investments, with a focus on adapting to new work models and customer expectations, increasing capacity to respond to higher demand, managing growth with fewer resources, enhancing eCommerce capabilities, and supporting security and compliance requirements. Yet most companies are unhappy with the level of success they’ve seen to date.</p>



 Integrating data to improve customer interactions and employee experiences 



<p>As organizations move toward a digital future, they must confront a vexing problem: enterprise applications reside in a large network of complex systems, with enormous amounts of structured and unstructured data that require processing to deliver meaningful insights and enable informed decisions. Organizations can mitigate this scenario by leveraging advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to build next-generation capabilities today.</p>



<p>This is especially important in customer interactions. For example, when a customer contacts the business via chat, email or social media, that text or voice recording is unstructured data that needs to be collected and analyzed as part of the interaction. At the same time, the customer’s history with the company is likely stored in a structured system. Only by merging the two data sets can companies deliver a complete, 360° view of the customer to agents (or automated systems), and only by acting on the two data sets can they deliver a truly personalized experience.</p>



<p>We see something similar in the supply chain, which has gone from a one-way, linear behemoth to an interdependent and intelligent web. That makes it more responsive and less prone to disruption, but only if your employees have real-time access to information and communication.</p>



<p>The best way to capitalize on the new technology is to let users access the new capabilities right from within the tools they use to do their jobs every day. That kind of frictionless integration makes it easy for employees to take up the new software and services, seeing the benefits without having to break stride or recreate their own business processes.</p>



<p>As companies embrace digital transformation, they are moving their enterprise applications to the cloud.&nbsp; Frost &amp; Sullivan has found many IT decision-makers (who maintain responsibility for their company’s infrastructure and application management) consider moving to the cloud a key initiative, with some saying it is the top priority. Overall, they have seen clients consider the cloud to be one of the most important factors in helping them achieve their business goals.</p>



<p>But not all cloud solutions are created equal, and it’s important for IT and line-of-business teams to work together to find a partner that offers the services their business needs.</p>



 Helping companies accelerate business transformation and growth 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/microsoft">IBM Consulting™ and Microsoft</a> bring out the best of SAP and modernize the enterprise.</p>



<p>Dublin-based <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/glen-dimplex/">Glen Dimplex</a> has sales, manufacturing and distribution facilities around the world. Before engaging IBM Consulting, Glen Dimplex had each of its facilities running its own systems to drive day-to-day operations. The company decided to embark on a digital transformation by moving to a single, integrated set of business processes and data using SAP S/4HANA. To maximize the business value of its investment, Glen Dimplex engaged <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/">IBM Consulting</a>.</p>



<p>Now Glen Dimplex is putting real-time insights into the hands of its employees, enabling them to make better decisions, faster. Customer service teams have <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/glen-dimplex">reduced the manual workload in the order-entry process by 43%, and new streamlined processes have contributed to a 20% increase in on-time and in-full deliveries.</a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/omv-ibm-consulting-sap/">OMV</a> (one of Austria’s largest listed industrial companies) produces and markets oil and gas, innovative energy and high-end petrochemical solutions. Its three divisions had highly customized SAP ERP systems for daily operations, but when the company moved to SAP S/4HANA, it needed to tailor its deployment methodologies to each business unit. IBM Consulting recommended using a hybrid approach. For example, for the corporate business, a greenfield methodology building a new SAP S/4HANA environment made sense. For the downstream deployment, IBM Consulting leveraged its Rapid Move methodology, powered by CrystalBridge, to reduce the cost and complexity of bringing custom SAP ECC retail solutions into SAP S/4HANA.</p>



<p>By defining standardized, integrated processes, OMV is building a digital core that will make it easier to bring new acquisitions onboard. Moving to SAP solutions in the Azure cloud has reduced the company’s IT maintenance spend, improving cost-effectiveness and efficiency.</p>



<p>With the right support and guidance, it is possible to maximize business value and realize the dream of digital transformation.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF54 rewards. DF55 runs Sep 14–21,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 54 (DF54) has completed. 150K OCEAN was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Sep 07, 2023 and ended 12:01am Sep 14. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF55 is live today, Sep 14. It concludes on Sep 21. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF55   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.

<p>Organizations are wrestling with a pressing concern: the speed at which they respond to and contain data breaches falls short of the escalating security threats they face. An effective attack surface management (ASM) solution can change this.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a Data Breach 2023 Report</a> by IBM, the average cost of a data breach reached a record high of USD 4.45 million this year. What’s more, it took 277 days to identify and contain a data breach.</p>



<p>With cybercriminals evolving the sophistication of their attack tactics, there is an increasing need to speed up detection, response, and neutralization of security breaches.</p>



 The role of attack surface management in data breach containment&nbsp; 



<p>Despite employing an arsenal of cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data, many organizations find themselves in a relentless race against time, as they strive to bridge the gap between the moment a data breach occurs and when it is effectively contained. As data leaks on the dark web continue to make headlines, organizations face heightened pressure to reinforce their breach containment strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incorporating an effective <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface-management">attack surface management</a> tool into your security strategy can significantly help you mitigate the risks of data breaches. In fact, according to the Cost of a Data Breach study, organizations that deployed an ASM solution were able to identify and contain data breaches in 75% of the time of those without ASM. The breach containment was also 83 days faster for organizations with ASM than those without.</p>







<p>Figure 1 — Comparison of the mean time to identify and contain a data breach for organizations with and without an attack surface management solution</p>



 5 ways IBM Security Randori Recon helps build resilience to data breaches 



<p>Businesses can proactively reduce their vulnerabilities to a range of cyberattacks like ransomware, malware, phishing, compromised credentials (resulting from poor password policies) and unauthorized access, employed by hackers. They can achieve this by actively managing and reducing their attack surface. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/randori-recon">IBM Security® Randori Recon</a>, an ASM solution performs an important role in your data protection strategy.</p>



 1. Finding unmanaged systems and high-value assets 



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvPc3_wivA8">Shadow IT</a>&nbsp;and orphaned IT hide more workloads, servers, applications, and other assets from security teams than they know. Because hackers don’t limit their&nbsp;surveillance efforts to what’s in your inventory, these unknown assets put you at risk.</p>



<p>To help you find and secure high-value assets that are most tempting for attacks, Randori Recon identifies your organizational exposures in a high-fidelity and low-impact manner, keeping false positives under control and reducing alert fatigue.</p>







<p>Figure 2 — Defending the US Open digital platforms starts months before the tournament begins</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/us-open">US Open</a>, one of the most highly attended sporting events in the world, leverages the IBM Security Randori Recon solution to defend their digital platforms—which are on the receiving end of more than 40 million security incidents over the course of the tournament. Using Randori, the team conducts a comprehensive attack surface analysis, scanning the entire network for vulnerabilities, including third-party or adjacent networks. Following this security reconnaissance, Randori then ranks those vulnerabilities by their attractiveness to hackers, allowing the team to prioritize its response.</p>



 2. Identifying exploitable vulnerabilities and misconfigurations 



<p>Poor visibility into your external risk posture can prolong your attack remediation process. Finding misconfigured management panels, expired access permissions, and other unexpected vulnerabilities can be impossible with manual processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-benefits-of-automated-attack-surface-management/">Automated ASM tools</a> like Randori Recon provide organizations with a comprehensive view of their entire digital attack surface, showing potential entry points—including attack vectors that can bypass antivirus, firewall or other security defenses—that cybercriminals might exploit.</p>



 3. Prioritizing your cyber risk 



<p>While all vulnerabilities are important, not all of them are immediately dangerous or likely to be compromised during a breach of your digital perimeter. Shifting your focus away from the patch management whack-a-mole game and concentrating on the vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk to your organization can help.</p>



<p>Randori Recon uncovers attack patterns and techniques that are more likely to be exploited by a real-world attacker. It flags high-value assets with its risk-based prioritization engine and creates a stack-ranked list of your most risky targets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>By understanding your attack surface, your organization can prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential business impact.</p>



 4. Ensuring adherence to security processes&nbsp; 



<p>From access management protocols to VPN configurations and firewall audit workflows, security processes can fall behind as your organization grows or adapts to the needs of a remote workforce.</p>



<p>You can gain insight into whether your security processes are keeping pace with your expanding attack surface through continuous attack surface monitoring. Randori allows you to get real-time insight into whether your security processes are applied uniformly and improving your resilience. &nbsp;</p>



<p>ASM provides visibility into potential weak points and helps you implement layered security controls. By strengthening the various layers of your defense, such as network security, endpoint security, and access controls, you can reduce the risk of a successful data breach.</p>



 5. Providing remediation guidance 



<p>Randori Recon helps you improve your cyber resilience by suggesting remediation steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It provides in-product guidance on how to address specific vulnerabilities and detailed write-ups of strategies to help reduce your overall exposure.</p>



<p>With this enhanced knowledge, you can distribute your resources more efficiently and focus on critical vulnerabilities that pose the highest risk of a data breach.</p>



 Best practices for data breach prevention&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>To enhance your cyber resilience, it is vital to build security in every stage of software and hardware development.&nbsp;You can strengthen your data breach prevention strategy by:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Safeguarding assets with a zero-trust approach and understanding your company’s potential exposure to relevant cyberattacks &nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Conducting app testing, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/penetration-testing">penetration testing</a>, vulnerability assessments, and social engineering scenarios from an attacker’s perspective to identify and patch vulnerabilities before they result in a data breach&nbsp; 



 Using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication">multifactor authentication</a> and strong passwords to strengthen the protection of personal data and personally identifiable information (PII) to prevent identity theft&nbsp; 



 Training employees to increase their security awareness&nbsp;and enabling them to make informed decisions in protecting sensitive information 



 Maintaining offline data backups to prevent data loss and recover quickly in case of emergencies&nbsp; 



 Rehearsing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response">incident response</a> (IR) plans and establishing a team well-versed in IR protocols to reduce costs and breach containment time 
 



 Mitigate data breach costs with Randori&nbsp;Recon 



<p>An effective ASM solution like Randori Recon can help businesses identify and mitigate potential risks before they can be exploited by malicious actors. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52201">The Total Economic Impact™ of IBM Security Randori</a> study that IBM commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct in 2023 found 85% reduction in losses due to an external attack totaling $1.5 million. According to the study, by reducing the amount of time an exposed asset is left “in the wild,” financial and brand impacts from an attack can be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While security measures should extend beyond attack surface management to include practices like encryption, strong access controls, employee training and more, by proactively managing your attack surface, you can significantly enhance your security posture and reduce the likelihood and impact of data breaches.</p>

He is approaching the end of his Ph.D. dissertation, which focuses on building an Indigenous Computing Framework. <a href="https://pinnguaq.com/stories/cree-coding/">Cree#</a> is a graphical and generative programming language based on C# that uses nehiyawewin syllabics and Cree metaphors. &nbsp; </p><p>In this episode, you'll hear:</p>  How Ramsey and Jon each approached creating non-Latin alphabet-based programming languages  The challenges they experienced in trying to find the right words to express their desired inputs and outputs when their respective languages didn't have words for those concepts  The delightful surprises they encountered when putting their programming languages into practice        EP03: Alternatives to Modern Programming Languages with Ramsey Nasser and Jon Corbett  0:00 /78:41 1×   <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [4:50] Ramsey Nasser studied computer science at the American University in Beirut and earned his MFA in Design &amp; Technology at Parsons. His work sits at the intersection of art + tech. &nbsp;   [6:50] Ramsey taught Processing at Parsons to non-programmers. Unity and Open Frameworks were also being taught, and these tools were touted as a way to democratize programming for everyone. However, Ramsey, whose native language is Arabic, realized that this couldn't be the case because these languages are all based on English, and most of the world doesn't speak English.  [12:50] Ramsey shares how different Arab cultures have different words for the names of the months, so even beginning to standardize an Arabic programming language falls apart pretty quickly. This is different from many Western cultures.  [15:05] Approaching Alb as an art practice widens the scope of exploration and questions that can be asked, whereas approaching it from an engineering perspective would involve building all the tools we use to program from the bottom up.   [16:50] Culture cannot be separated from names. Therefore, we are forced into a linguistic collaboration with programmers who came before us. If you want to consume any software written in the last 50 years, you need to be able to engage with English language names.   [20:20] Zeeshan asks Ramsey if there was a point in the history of computing that we could point to where, if we'd thought about language earlier, we could have changed our current predicament. &nbsp;  [24:20] Jon Corbett joins us and talks about reclaiming his ancestral language, Cree. When he learned that there is no word for "computer" in Cree, it sent him down a challenging path where he had to find new ways of articulating computing experiences.  [27:40] Jon explains how there aren't if...then statements in Cree, which made it difficult to work with conditional statements.   [28:20] His breakthrough came when studying the work native Hawaiians are doing as they create a Hawaiian programming language.   [32:00] Jon and Ramsey share their takeaways from working with their languages in programming.  [37:20] Ramsey explains how Arabic is a cursive language, meaning you can stretch the words. Alb takes advantage of this.  [40:20] Brooklyn points out that language changes how we think. She asks Ramsey and Jon if it has changed how they approach engineering problems.  [44:20] Jon discusses incorporating "digital smudging" into his coding practice.  [47:40] Ramsey and Jon explain the trouble they had translating "true" and "false."  [55:20] An audience member asks about directionality and how Ramsey and Jon would approach Ancient Egyptian, which can be written left to right, right to left, and top to bottom.  [1:08:20] An audience member asks Ramsey about the phrase "inshaAllah" and how that can be expressed in code.  [1:13:40] Jon and Ramsey share what they are working on now. &nbsp;  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Co-Host: Brooklyn Zelenka - CTO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editor and Producer: Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guest: Ramsey Nasser is a game designer, media artist, computer scientist, and educator.

<p>As we commemorate International Identity Day in 2023, we reflect on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its profound impact on our lives. Last year, we discussed the need for inclusive identity solutions in “<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/international-identity-day-the-need-for-inclusion-by-design/">International Identity Day: The Need for Inclusion by Design</a>.” This year, we continue this crucial conversation with a focus on enabling access.</p>
<p>With increasing conflicts, such as the crisis in Ukraine, and the devastating effects of climate change leading to famine, fires, and floods, more people find themselves displaced and in need of secure identities that grant them access to essential services and opportunities. The need for identity solutions that transcend borders and cultures has never been more evident − identity must serve as a bridge rather than a barrier.</p>
<p>However, as we strive for identity done right, we must also confront the escalating challenges brought about by the digital age. Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep fake technologies have blurred the lines between reality and deception. <a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/synthetic-identity-fraud-what-is-it-and-how-to-combat-it/">Synthetic identity fraud</a> is on the rise, posing a significant threat to individuals and organizations alike.</p>
<p>In this ever-evolving landscape, the importance of identity protection and verification cannot be overstated. Encryption with high assurance identity verification can help ensure identities are robustly secured against fraudulent activities. However, there’s another looming threat on the horizon: <a href="https://partners.wsj.com/entrust/the-post-quantum-cybersecurity-threat/prepare-your-organization-and-your-data-for-quantum-computers/?utm_source=LinkedIn&amp;utm_medium=social-post&amp;utm_campaign=2309-COR-Brand-WSJ-PQByline-LI-1&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044WeIQAU">quantum computing, which will break conventional cryptography</a>. Bad actors are already on the prowl with “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks.</p>
<p>Interoperability emerges as another key theme in the quest for equal access to identity. We must strive to create identities that are not confined by geographical boundaries or fragmented by siloed systems. Imagine a world where your identity is as universal as your fingerprint is unique – a world where your digital identity seamlessly carries across local and international borders.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230302STO76818/european-digital-identity-easy-online-access-to-key-services#:~:text=It%20allows%20EU%20citizens%20to,their%20national%20electronic%20identity%20card.">European Union’s Digital Identity</a> initiative stands as a testament to the potential of governments stepping up to facilitate secure and interoperable identity solutions. By championing such initiatives, governments play a key role in shaping the identity landscape for the betterment of society.</p>
<p>Yet in a landscape where governments may lag in their response, the role of big tech corporations like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/business-will-be-able-to-accept-ids-in-apple-wallet-with-ios-17-among-other-changes/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJh6CuGrjFwkFGIetqc6gHFbfdrURvpAebSeN8u6A7YPJ0rXuiKyr5LTdAOBP8ADU0fPCJcDZGbwPsVAYrC6yGUth6LmxUl2PERToxiI7X4Ec3UPRk9uIbIqLiEZfrc0QxbDLnTJmse_a_wo-63x_fOtL8f3KJVl_uMT9ixm2hEJ">Apple</a> becomes increasingly significant. They possess the technological prowess and global reach to foster transformation in identity ecosystems. We must consider the responsibilities and opportunities that lie with these industry leaders…and hold them accountable.</p>
<p>So, on this International Identity Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to inclusive and accessible identity. In a world where access to services, opportunities, and safety is vitally important, we must ensure that identities are a force for inclusion and empowerment. To achieve this, we must address the challenges of identity protection, embrace interoperability, and engage in constructive dialogue with both governments and technology leaders. By working together, we can harness the potential of identity to create a more inclusive and secure world.</p>
<p>At Entrust, we remain committed to driving these conversations and innovating secure, interoperable, and inclusive identity solutions that truly enable access for all.</p>

Figure 1: IBM Cloud connected to other clouds and enterprise networks.



<p>As enterprises modernize and migrate workloads to IBM Cloud, they often run into requirements that certain components of their application workloads to run on other cloud service provider networks. These requirements create a technical challenge for enterprises—especially in regulated industries (e.g., insurance, banking, healthcare, etc.)—to establish secure and reliable connectivity between the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> application components and services.</p>



<p>To help address the challenges, this blog post attempts to answer some common questions by providing a summary of key concepts and approaches that enterprises adopt for connecting IBM application workloads to other clouds. Use the article as a guide to evaluate and determine the best options and connectivity offerings that fit your use case:</p>



 
 Why are regulated workload components spread across multiple clouds? 



 What are the typical workloads that require multicloud connectivity? 



 How are IBM Cloud regulated workloads set up and connected to other clouds? 



 What are the different ways multicloud workloads can connect and communicate? 
 



 1. Why are regulated workload components spread across multiple clouds? 



<p>Enterprises in regulated industries have complex business processes (e.g., insurance underwriting, claims processing, payment processing, fraud detection, medical data processing, etc.) and numerous other automated and semi-automated workflows that drive business functions. Modernizing these processes typically requires a combination of specialized best-of-breed vendor services or application offerings that may not all exist on the same cloud.</p>



<p>Many home-grown custom applications continue to operate on-premises on private cloud networks, separating them from dependent components running on other clouds. Additionally, enterprises often partner with managed service providers that have a centralized cloud location but must access resources distributed across multiple clouds. Utilizing different clouds for running the workloads is also often a strategic choice to meet compliance requirements, reduce vulnerability to outages and lower the risk of vendor lock-in.</p>



 2. What are the typical workloads that require multicloud connectivity? 



<p>Workloads that require multicloud connectivity can be categorized based on high-level use cases and types of data that are exchanged across clouds. Broadly, the categories include the following:</p>



 
 Application data exchange: Client/server communication between application components across clouds (e.g., via RESTful APIs) to exchange data and complete synchronous or asynchronous transactions. 



 Batch data transfer: Ad-hoc or scheduled batch data transfers between clouds for analytical processing, archiving, AI training or data migration. 



 Administration access: Administrative remote access and communication between hosts on a cloud network and managed systems residing on other clouds, often part of managed services and third-party administration contracts. 



 Monitoring and tooling data transfer: Real-time or non-real-time transfer of logs and/or performance and security monitoring data from systems across multiple clouds to a centralized collection and management system on a different cloud. 



 Data replication: Real-time or non-real-time batch exchange of data between systems and components for replication for HA, DR, etc. 
 



<p>Depending on the complexity of the application, the enterprise deployments have a combination of the above workloads. Knowing the use cases and characteristics of the data exchanges across clouds are key factors for evaluating viable options for connecting the workload components.</p>



 3. How are IBM Cloud regulated workloads set up and connected to other clouds? 



<p>On IBM Cloud, enterprises with insurance and banking workloads often follow the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about">VPC-based reference architecture</a> from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a>. IBM Cloud for Financial Services provides security and controls built into the platform, automates security and compliance posture, and simplifies risk management for regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Multicloud application workloads running on IBM Cloud for Financial Services VPCs connect and exchange data with applications or services running on VPCs or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings on other clouds. To enable this connectivity, enterprises choose from the cloud provider’s service offerings to enable access to and from VPCs to other clouds or networks:</p>



Figure 2: High-level VPC reference architecture for IBM Cloud for Financial Services showing Direct Link and VPN connectivity.



<p><a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started">IBM Cloud VPC</a> connectivity service offerings are <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-faqs-framework#financial-services-validated">Financial Services Validated</a>, ensuring compliance to the controls of the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-overview">IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services</a>. The <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn">Site-to-Site VPN</a> offering provides secure connectivity over the public internet, while <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about#ibm-cloud-connect">Direct Link Connect</a> and <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about#ibm-cloud-dedicated">Direct Link Dedicated</a> offerings provide secure and private connectivity leveraging existing partnerships with over 45 global service providers. These capabilities from IBM Cloud build trust and enable a transparent public cloud ecosystem with the features for security, compliance and resiliency that financial and other regulated institutions require.</p>



 4. What are the different ways multicloud workloads can connect and communicate? 



<p>There are three main approaches to establish connectivity between workloads running across different cloud providers:</p>



 
 Over the public internet. 



 Through connectivity partner networks. 



 Direct connectivity at the data center facility. 
 



<p>Below is a description of the approaches and the associated IBM Cloud offerings:</p>



Figure 3: IBM Cloud connectivity options and offerings.



<p>Connectivity over public internet using public interfaces: One of the most common ways is application-to-application communication and connection by using secure public interfaces on the internet (e.g., public API endpoints or TCP host/ports exposed from custom applications, SaaS public API endpoints, etc.). While limited in the scope of use cases it can support, this approach is simple and frequently used because it requires no special networking resources other than public internet connectivity to and from the VPC. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-public-gateways">IBM Cloud Public Gateway</a> and <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/apiconnect?topic=apiconnect-getting-started">API Connect</a> offerings provide the capabilities to utilize public interfaces and establish connectivity with services on another peer cloud:</p>



Figure 4: High-level view of the cloud-to-cloud connectivity between IBM Cloud and other peer cloud using public interfaces on internet.



<p>Connectivity over the public internet using virtual private networks (VPNs): Another connectivity option over the public internet is virtual private network-to-network connectivity (i.e., virtual private networks (VPNs)). <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-client-to-site-overview&amp;interface=ui">IBM Client-to-Site VPN</a> enables connecting a host running on any cloud to an IBM Cloud VPC. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-using-vpn&amp;interface=ui">IBM Site-to-Site VPN</a> enables connectivity between an IBM Cloud VPC to a VPC on another peer cloud:</p>

<p>Connectivity through provider networks: A more comprehensive approach that provides private network-to-network connectivity is connecting the cloud VPC networks through a connectivity provider partner network. The <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl#get-started-with-direct-link-connect">IBM Cloud Direct Link Connect</a> offering has pre-established partnerships with various network service providers that are also connected to the other clouds. It is a multi-tenant offering and provides secure and private connectivity of IBM Cloud VPCs to other peer cloud VPCs:</p>

<p>Direct connectivity at co-location data center facility: The most direct option for connecting the workloads is direct physical connectivity of the networks at a data center facility provider that has co-located IBM Cloud and another peer cloud. The <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-get-started-with-ibm-cloud-dl#get-started-with-direct-link-dedicated">IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated</a> offering has pre-established partnerships with various co-location facilities and provides direct, secure and private single-tenant physical connectivity with other cloud networks.</p>

<p>An important step in adopting one or more of the above approaches for an enterprise multicloud workload is to evaluate the offerings available from IBM Cloud and the peer cloud providers. Selecting a viable offering requires an evaluation of various factors in terms of short- and long-term strategic goals and technical requirements.</p>



 Wrap up 



<p>To conclude, enterprises in regulated industries can adopt the&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-vpc-architecture-about">VPC-based reference architecture from IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a>&nbsp;to securely connect multicloud application workloads on IBM Cloud to other clouds and on-premises networks.

<p>Space AI leader <a href="https://ubotica.com/">Ubotica Technologies</a> is partnering with IBM to leverage IBM cloud infrastructure and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a> components, intending to simplify the process for a developer to get their application running onboard a satellite. With a single click, mutual customers will be able to securely deploy their AI models directly to satellites that use the Ubotica CogniSATTM platform. These space-borne AI models are then used to generate insights from data in space. The new approach offers considerable CapEx and OpEx savings for satellite constellation operators, and increased autonomy and decision-making capabilities at the edge with reduced dependence on ground systems.</p>



 The industrialization of space AI applications 



<p>Several decades ago, only government-sponsored space programs could credibly deliver technology capable of withstanding the rigors of a rocket launch and the space environment. Today, entire industries are looking to leverage the availability of complex space technologies and insights — from reusable rocket launchers to the use of open-source machine learning pipelines — to accelerate a new era of commercial space applications. More recently, commercially available off-the-shelf technology, or “COTS,” has been adopted. Using COTS further reduces the cost of computing in space for a wide variety of applications, including near real-time detection of forest fires (Earth Observation) and space debris removal (In-Orbit Servicing).</p>


 
 


<p>Ubotica is delivering its CogniSAT space AI compute platform on-board satellites so that AI inference can be performed on data in space. Earth Observation companies collect many petabytes of data per day. The data is stored and processed on the ground, presenting a very large-scale data challenge. To generate timely application-specific value from all this data, customers need to create insights using edge-based data processing analysis. Like all data and AI use cases, it is critical to address and solve the challenge of analyzing and managing data in these quantities. Ubotica has partnered with IBM to streamline customer’s space AI applications deployment and ground-based cloud data processing operations to help manage this data challenge.</p>



<p>This industrialization of space AI requires an enterprise approach with fit-for-purpose deployment, data storage, and governance capabilities that are secured, scalable and easy to use. It is the commitment to these principles, and IBM’s enabling technologies, that underpins this partnership with Ubotica.</p>



 The future of satellites is powered by AI and hybrid cloud 



<p>Previously, satellites rotated around the earth with rudimentary capabilities to know when, for example, to open the aperture on the onboard imaging equipment, or when to transmit and receive data based on its position and time in orbit. This was done with almost no ability to interpret other situational or environmental circumstances.</p>



<p>Since 2020, Ubotica has been providing space AI capabilities to the European Space Agency and NASA JPL. In 2023, Ubotica announced CogniSAT-6, the first satellite to use space AI to autonomously schedule image tasking and generate insights onboard using image sensor data. They are building on their major orbiting successes, which includes the <a href="https://ubotica.com/satellite-successfully-applies-ai-to-process-earth-observation-imagery-in-flight-in-historic-first-for-space/">European Space Agency Phi-Sat-1 Mission</a> and an award-winning contribution to <a href="https://ubotica.com/ubotica-technologies-presents-with-nasa-jpl-at-ieee-igarss-2022/">NASA JPL’s ISS Space AI research platform</a>. By optimizing these technologies to run on small satellites, they will undoubtedly impact every aspect of the Space industry.</p>







<p>As part of this leadership, Ubotica has partnered with IBM to build several services on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud">IBM Cloud</a>. The goal is to provide customer developer teams with the ability to directly deploy their AI inference models to Ubotica’s space AI platforms on LEO satellites.</p>



<p>The initial install is a <a href="https://ibm.github.io/workshop-setup/ROKS/">Red Hat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS) cluster</a>, on which Ubotica will be deploying components to create a hybrid cloud AI platform. Ubotica’s initial architecture will also include components from the <a href="https://opendatahub.io/">Open Data Hub</a> reference architecture and aligns with the underlying implementation of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>. Ubotica will also explore the use of other services from IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">Cloud Pak for Data</a> portfolio for integration into their operations over the next year.</p>



<p>The IBM Cloud automated deployment system, auto-scaling capabilities and access to over 170 platform services will provide Ubotica with the flexibility to create and amend specific resources based on customer requirements.</p>



 Leaning into the IBM Ecosystem for growth 



<p>Through <a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus">IBM Partner Plus</a>, Ubotica is accessing IBM technology, as well as business and developer expertise and co-creation support. As a new member of Partner Plus, the IBM New Partner Accelerator has helped Ubotica leverage IBM’s market demand engine, go-to-market collateral and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud">IBM Cloud</a> credits to help develop its customer space AI model deployment process.</p>



<p>The companies are now collaborating to develop an enterprise AI model management system integrated into industry standard source control resources and targeting Ubotica’s bespoke emulator and hardware technologies. Automation and observability are provided to remove potentially error-prone and tedious manual steps in the end-to-end delivery of an AI model to an in-orbit asset. The solution will be run on multi and hybrid cloud deployments with minimum reconfiguration.</p>



<p>This approach is positioning Ubotica and IBM to help mutual customers rapidly deliver AI models for deployment in space applications.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with the Zero Trust framework, its principles may seem simple enough in the context of network security. Nobody — not even your most senior leaders — can be granted user access without first being checked at the gate.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: Traditional perimeters are a thing of the past. Today, with remote access and hybrid work a mainstay of the modern enterprise, cyber threats are challenging your organization like never before. That’s why the most forward-thinking businesses are implementing Zero Trust.</p>
<p>However, two questions remain. How do Zero Trust principles work in a cloud environment? And, more importantly, how can they help you safeguard your sensitive data?</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through the convergence of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and cloud security. From why it’s important to how it works, we’ll help you identify all the tools and technologies you need to create a Zero Trust cloud for safe and secure access.</p>
 What is Zero Trust for the cloud? 
<p>IT professionals are well-versed in the art of Zero Trust security. Since its inception in 2010, this innovative approach has quickly ushered in a wave of support for modern network access.</p>
<p>However, what’s not so crystal clear is how this security policy will translate to an increasingly cloud-first landscape. What does “Zero Trust for the cloud” even mean and how does it work? Let’s connect the dots.</p>
<p>According to Forrester, a Zero Trust architecture is built upon <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-definition-of-modern-zero-trust/">three fundamental concepts</a>:</p>
 
 Explicit authentication: The security team must leverage all available data points—context, device, user identity, location, data classification, and so on — to continuously verify, authenticate, and authorize a user or entity. 
 Least privileged access: User access is limited based on a just-enough and just-in-time security policy. In other words, least privileged access ensures only the right people are authorized to use the specific resources they need to do their job — no more, no less. 
 Assume breach: All entities are potential threats and must be treated as such. It’s no longer a matter of “if” an organization will be breached, but a question of “when.” So, businesses must put controls and safeguards in place to minimize the impact of a data breach when one inevitably occurs. 
 
<p>These tenets form the core of the Zero Trust framework and can be applied to any cloud environment — whether it’s a public, private, hybrid, or <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/multi-cloud-security">multi-cloud</a> infrastructure.</p>
 Advantages of Zero Trust for cloud security 
<p>Contrary to a traditional security posture, which assumes a condition of implicit trust, the Zero Trust model believes all endpoints, users, and applications are potential cyber threats. Organizations that embrace the Zero Trust approach — especially in the cloud — can unlock a host of significant benefits:</p>
 
 Better visibility into data, assets, and risks: Zero Trust requires you to implement tools that continuously monitor your cloud environment. This affords your security team an early line of sight into emerging threats, allowing them to thwart any in their path. 
 Enterprise-wide secure access: Empower internal and external users and devices to leverage critical applications with confidence — whenever and wherever they need them. Enabling a safer approach to remote access allows you to maximize productivity without sacrificing security or interrupting the user experience. 
 Reduced financial and reputational damage: The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">average cost</a> of a data breach is over $4.4 million per incident — and that’s not counting the damage done to your brand name and industry reputation. Mitigating threats with a Zero Trust security model will help your organization avoid these costly repercussions. 
 Simplified compliance and risk management: Lower your liabilities and keep sensitive data under lock and key through phishing-resistant authentication, strong encryption, cryptographic asset management, and continuous monitoring. 
 
<p>The further you more effectively implement Zero Trust principles, the sooner you’ll realize these key advantages. Not sure where to start? Check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-maturity-model/">Zero Trust Trust Maturity Model</a>.</p>
 Why you need Zero Trust in a cloud environment 
<p>Traditionally, Zero Trust security is predicated on an enterprise’s ability to manage the network itself. In turn, the security team can establish access control policies and other mechanisms — and more importantly, it can enforce them.</p>
<p>But now, with more organizations hosting information in cloud environments, there is concern over whether or not enterprises lack this level of control. Cloud domains are owned/operated by cloud providers and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) vendors, meaning a company’s network security policy doesn’t automatically carry over to the cloud environment. Consequently, sensitive data that is stored or transmitted is at risk of being spread out across an unprotected attack surface. And, because these safeguards don’t automatically carry over, many businesses might have little to no insight into:</p>
 
 Who or what is accessing their data 
 What device they’re accessing it from 
 How the information is being used/shared 
 When their corporate assets are involved in a data breach 
 
<p>In simple terms, they’re sitting ducks. Worse yet, threat actors have taken notice. IBM reports that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">82% of all breaches</a> in 2022 involved data stored in the cloud, suggesting cybercriminals are targeting cloud-hosted assets and virtual infrastructure.</p>
 Use cases for implementing Zero Trust in a cloud environment 
<p>More than a buzzword, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/zero-trust-for-virtual-infrastructure/">Zero Trust architecture</a> has its fair share of enterprise applications. Strengthening a Zero Trust security posture can help you manage:</p>
 
 Remote workers: Even as employees return to office, hybrid setups are here to stay. Zero Trust provides distributed workforces the means to stay connected despite their distance and increase efficiency without cost to the user experience. 
 Machine identities: Machine identities are digital keys, secrets, and certificates that establish the validity of digital transactions. They’re important for secure communication between machines, such as servers, workstations, bots, applications, and more. According to Gartner research, devices and workloads are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erik-wahlstr%C3%B6m-98bba117_the-number-of-machines-workloads-and-devices-activity-6910611797771235328-Gast">outnumbering human users</a> by an “order of magnitude,” rendering it exceptionally difficult to manage these transactions. Implementing a Zero Trust model can help mitigate their associated risks through enhanced visibility and control across an increasingly vast array of machine identities. 
 Third-party vendors: Cloud providers are another entry point into your extended perimeter. They have access to data processed through their applications, which means a security breach on their end could cascade into a bigger problem on yours. Eliminating implicit trust ensures that even third-party vendors are vetted properly through strong authentication. 
 Shadow IT and BYOD: Employees may be accessing corporate resources from an unprotected personal device. Likewise, individual users or departments may install tools and apps without proper authorization. Zero Trust enhances visibility, allowing you to spot and mitigate these potential threats in real-time. 
 
 Applying Zero Trust principles to the cloud 
<p>It’s clear there’s much to gain by adopting a Zero Trust model. But how do you actually do it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no such thing as a silver-bullet Zero Trust solution. However, there are several technologies and techniques that help you navigate the Zero Trust journey:</p>
 1. Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) 
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/the-critical-role-of-clm-for-zero-trust-today-and-pq-tomorrow/">Certificate lifecycle management</a> is essential to implementing Zero Trust at scale. Digital certificates are issued to people and devices so that organizations can verify their identities and authorize requests, whether it be to access the network or a specific corporate resource. Digital certificates are also used for strong encryption and access control. With so many certificates in use for so many purposes, CLM allows you to ensure no certificates go unmanaged, and enables you to enforce the principle of least privileged access.</p>
<p>There are three important steps in the certificate lifecycle:</p>
 
 Issuance, renewal, and revocation: Certificates can’t be forgotten about, or else you risk opening up a backdoor into your cloud environment. So, security teams must seamlessly manage their lifecycle from start to finish, renewing any that have been authenticated and revoking all that have not. 
 
 2. Key and Secrets Lifecycle Management 
<p>Keys and secrets underpin the security of cryptographic processes. Managing their complete lifecycle is critical for comprehensive security.</p>
 
 Key Lifecycle Management: Generate, deliver, and distribute cryptographic keys to a range of supported applications through multiple standard interfaces, including KMIP. Provide access control to keys and enable automated capabilities including key rotation, key expiration, and key revocation. 
 Secure Root of Trust: As a foundational element of Zero Trust’s data protection pillar, this enables FIPS-certified cryptographic key generation and lifecycle management with dual controls and separation of duties. 
 Decentralized Vault-Based Architecture: Distributed key storage ensures that keys and data are kept within the geographical areas where they are supposed to be maintained to facilitate compliance with geo-fencing and data sovereign regulations. 
 Centralized Compliance Management Dashboard: This process enables the documentation of keys and secrets based on templates for continuous compliance assessment using built-in or custom policies. 
 
 3. Identity and access management (IAM) 
<p>User identity is the heart of post-perimeter cybersecurity. A robust, feature-rich IAM portfolio is key to securing identities and keeping your most valuable assets protected from compromised credentials, phishing attacks, and other threat vectors. Essential capabilities include:</p>
 
 Strong authentication: Checking all requests against all possible data points ensures the user identity is verified without any risk signals falling through the cracks. An effective Zero Trust architecture will leverage both risk-based and adaptive authentication methods to provide high assurance and phishing-resistant verification.  
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA leverages numerous authenticators — tokens, facial recognition, mobile push notifications, and more — to ensure users are who they claim to be. However, not all MFA is the same, as some are vulnerable to bypass attacks. For high-assurance identities, organizations should use certificate-based passwordless authentication for both users and devices. 
 Passwordless security: Traditional usernames and passwords are prone to repetition and are much easier to crack when tied to personal information. Zero Trust advocates for passwordless security, which uses cryptographic keys to enable temporary access without burdening users or your IT department. 
 Single-sign-on (SSO): <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-single-sign-on">SSO</a> is an access management function that allows a user to login with a single set of credentials for multiple resources. With the right combination of cloud security tools, organizations can build a strong authentication foundation beneath this process, ensuring SSO can’t be taken advantage of for nefarious purposes. 
 
 Best practices for implementing Zero Trust 
<p>Now that you know why creating a Zero Trust cloud is important and the tools it takes to get there, let’s talk about the actual implementation process.</p>
<p>Be warned: It’s not happening overnight. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/how-to-implement-zero-trust-a-comprehensive-guide/">Zero Trust journey</a> could turn out to be a multi-year endeavor, so it’s best to take a phased approach. You can implement the foundations early, but as an ongoing process, reaching Zero Trust maturity will require continuous effort.</p>
<p>Here is one approach to how you can start your journey to Zero Trust maturity:</p>
 
 Application and asset discovery: Before you can adequately secure your environments — in the cloud or otherwise — you need to identify everything within its reach. This step involves taking inventory of your most sensitive data, where it resides, and where it goes. Then, inventory your cryptographic assets, including all hardware, software, and credentials. 
 Map transaction flows: Understanding the relationship between cloud applications, systems, servers, networks, devices, users, and third-party cloud providers is important. This step helps you chart how data moves between these elements, how they interact with each other, and determine areas that need the most attention. 
 Architect boundaries: Once you’ve figured out where your most crucial assets are, you can isolate them with additional controls to prevent lateral movement. 
 Establish access control policies: Define context-based rules for how assets can be used, shared, manipulated, etc. A solid access management plan will explicitly outline permissions based on the principle of least privilege. 
 Monitoring and maintenance: You can’t set and forget cloud security. Even after you’ve built a robust Zero Trust framework, your security team must regularly monitor user activity for anomalous behavior. More importantly, it should search high and low for vulnerabilities before hackers have a chance to exploit them.

<p>Supply chains are under enormous stress. As supply chain leaders, we’ve seen unprecedented levels of disruption, challenges with our ecosystem trading partner networks, tariff wars, real wars and tremendous turnover in human capital. Senior supply chain leaders are retiring in record numbers. Welcome or not, large scale change is afoot in our profession. And just when we thought things were on their way back to a new “hybrid” normal, a curious new technology in generative AI seems poised to upend the world of operations yet again.</p>



<p>Across media headlines, we see dark warnings about the existential risk of generative AI technologies to our culture and society. Yet as supply chain innovators, we know there is a rich history of applying technologies to continuously optimize operations. Is generative AI likely to drive an “extinction event” for supply chains as we know them? We think not. The fundamental nature of supply chain is evolutionary, and it has been that way since our craft was born out of the Toyota Production System in the 1950s. In supply chain, we take intentional but measured risks; we don’t swing for the fence.</p>



<p>As our profession looks to apply generative AI, we will undoubtedly take the same approach. With that mindset, we see the potential for step change improvements in efficiency, human productivity and quality. Generative AI holds all the potential to innovate beyond today’s process, technology and people constraints to a future where supply chains are foundational to delivering operational outcomes and a richer customer experience. But we must choose to embrace this new technology and make it part of the fabric of everything that we do.</p>



 A new and exciting wave of disruption 



<p>Let’s get one thing clear right from the start: generative AI is unlike any technology we’ve ever seen before in supply chain. It’s a game changer. Do not be tempted to discount generative AI as another Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Blockchain or other “hype cycle” technology. Over the next five years, generative AI will fundamentally change the way we work in supply chain. It will automate out the dull, menial and transactional work that consumes an enormous amount of low value add time for our professionals. Far from eliminating human value, it will elevate the role of our people and empower them to run the business on a predictive, proactive and forward-looking basis.</p>



<p>Despite the tremendous investment our supply chains have received over the last several decades, today they still demonstrate the need for significant reinvention. Many supply chain structures remain functionally siloed and struggle to execute predictably end-to-end. Applications and data are often trapped within departmental boundaries. Multiple ERP instances create challenges with fragmentation of orders and commitments across disparate systems. These combine to create unnecessary costs, increased execution latency and a suboptimal customer experience. There simply isn’t enough time or investment to uplift or replace these legacy investments. It is here where generative AI solutions (built in the cloud and connecting data end-to-end) will unlock tremendous new value while leveraging and extending the life of legacy technology investments. Generative AI creates a strategic inflection point for supply chain innovators and the first true opportunity to innovate beyond traditional supply chain constraints.</p>



 Pivoting from ideation to action 



<p>A leading supply chain needs to be orchestrated across the value chain. Internal and external stakeholders need fast and accurate information at their fingertips to plan, manage and direct supply chains. To drive personalized actions, insights and visibility, large volumes of data (ERP, WMS, RFID and visual analytics) need to be ingested, normalized and analyzed at high speeds. The need for agile, resilient and competitive supply chains has never been greater than today.</p>



<p>Addressing these challenges requires a platform that enterprises can own, shape and scale per the business needs. At IBM we have embraced a hybrid cloud, component-based architecture that is built on open technologies. Ingesting high volumes of data at speed and contextualizing them to each persona is a given. The “machine” learns, thinks and executes repetitive tasks while allowing supply chain professionals to focus on high impact business events.</p>



<p>The advent of generative AI will transform the ways we think and work. Traditional solutions constrain users in how to engage, utilize and investigate the large volumes of enterprise data. Frequently, the data is hard to even access. While chat bots have attempted to make it easier to get information, they rely on extensive model training and are frequently limited to “how to” questions. Generative AI brings the force of machine learning to everyday tasks by leveraging foundation models that allow users to interact with structured and unstructured data like never before. What took months of training takes just days now. Our supply chain digital assistant allows users to interact with data conversationally to interrogate vast transaction data, such as hundreds of thousands of documents and visual images. Users can go from getting an overall picture of the health of the supply chain to understanding a specific transaction by just asking. They get contextual information as well as factual data (PDFs, visual images, RFID tags information). A question from a supply chain manager (“Where do I have excess inventory?”) or a buyer (“How is my vendor performing?”) becomes a simple question rather than a complex exercise in bringing disparate reports together.</p>



<p>By establishing a common platform for all stakeholders, orchestrating the supply chain becomes intrinsic to everyday tasks and processes. Building on the core foundation, enterprises can deploy generative AI-powered use cases, allowing enterprises to scale quickly and be agile in a fast-paced marketplace.</p>



 IBM’s supply chain AI journey 



<p>A few years ago, in IBM’s own infrastructure supply chain, we decided that conversational AI could help overcome boundaries between different supply chain domains and provide a collaboration platform with our sales teams, suppliers and partners. On this platform, any authorized user could access critical information in an intuitive way, using natural language. We were able to achieve an easy-to-access, real-time, single view of truth with immediate insights to manage the client experience, operate with resilience and react to market disruptions. Despite major disruptions and dislocations in the COVID and post-COVID worlds, IBM’s supply chain fulfilled 100% of its orders and delivered on its promises.</p>



<p>Integrated generative AI accelerates intuitive conversations between supply chain decision makers and virtual assistants, enabling fast and fact-based actions. These innovations empower supply chain professionals to focus on complex problem resolution, the continuous improvement of our workflow designs and augmenting AI models. Adding generative AI and the power of foundational models to the existing solution is a natural step in the evolution of our supply chain capabilities.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Have you ever considered how identity verification is handled? Do not look other than eKYC. The complexity of eKYC will be unlocked with this article. Join us as we dive deep into this cutting-edge area where security meets technology to learn how eKYC is changing the face of identity verification.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Adopt eKYC for Greater Efficiency: Implement eKYC to speed up customer onboarding, reduce fraud risk, and enhance user experience. Evaluate your current KYC processes and select an eKYC solution that suits your business needs. 
 Prioritize Data Privacy: Ensure your eKYC solution is robust regarding data privacy, incorporating secure data storage and encryption while adhering to relevant privacy regulations. 
 Invest in Training: Facilitate the transition from traditional KYC to eKYC with adequate staff training and clear, user-friendly guidance for customers to maximize the benefits of this digital transition. 
 
 What is eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer)? 
<p>Electronic Know Your Customer, or eKYC is a remote and digital technique used by companies to confirm the identity of their clients. This approach is a digital rendition of the conventional KYC process, which entails time-consuming paperwork and verification processes. With cutting-edge digital technology, like biometrics, facial recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, eKYC offers a quick, effective, and user-friendly method for client verification procedures.</p>
<p>The fundamental essence of eKYC lies in its ability to mitigate risks associated with identity theft, fraudulent transactions, and other malicious activities. EKYC plays a pivotal role in financial crime and safeguarding businesses and their customers by swiftly authenticating customer identities.</p>
 Why are e-KYC important? 
<p>With the proliferation of online transactions, cybercrime has become more common; eKYC is a potent security precaution against this. It lets companies quickly confirm a customer’s identification, lessening the likelihood of identity fraud, theft, and illegal activities.</p>
<p>eKYC’s benefits to the customer experience extend well beyond its security benefits. It’s an efficient digital replacement for the cumbersome, time-consuming, paper-based KYC procedure. Customers like the simplicity of remote verification, while companies benefit from having fewer barriers to onboarding new customers.</p>
<p>The compliance function that eKYC provides is also essential. Companies must follow international laws designed to prevent and punish money laundering and the funding of terrorism. By providing a transparent audit trail of transactions, eKYC makes it easier for businesses to comply with regulations and lessens the likelihood of legal disputes.</p>
 What is the difference between eKYC and traditional KYC? 
<p>Traditional KYC procedures, although practical, have always been criticized for their time-consuming and tedious nature. The process usually involves the physical presence of customers, the manual submission of documents, and a long waiting period for verification. The advent of eKYC revolutionized this process.</p>
<p>eKYC introduces a digital, remote, and speedy alternative to traditional KYC. Leveraging digital channels, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, eKYC can validate a customer’s identity quickly and accurately without needing their physical presence. This digital approach eliminates geographical limitations, reduces operational costs, and significantly enhances the customer experience.</p>
 The Benefits of eKYC for Businesses and Customers 
<p>eKYC is a win-win for both businesses and customers. It translates into a faster, more efficient customer verification and process for businesses, leading to quicker customer onboarding and increased customer acquisition. It reduces the risk of human errors, ensures real-time compliance, and substantially reduces operational costs. The seamless verification process also instills trust and builds customer loyalty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for customers, eKYC simplifies the otherwise lengthy verification and identification process further. It eliminates the need for physical paperwork and allows for remote verification, which is particularly beneficial in the current global scenario where digital interactions are preferred. eKYC also ensures enhanced security and data protection regulations, thereby less fraud risk and instilling greater trust in the business.</p>
 Types of eKYC 
 Biometric Verification 
<p>The biometric verification component of eKYC is important as it employs a person’s distinctive biological traits, such as fingerprints, iris or retinal patterns, and face features, to confirm their identification. This high degree of security is made feasible by the biometric data and characteristics’ near-impossible duplication.</p>
 Digital Identity Verification 
<p>Verifying a person’s digital electronic identification entails authenticating the digital information related to them. Email addresses, phone numbers, social media accounts, and digital signatures are examples of id verification of electronic identity. Businesses may demonstrate the legitimacy of their clients in a non-intrusive way by authenticating their digital IDs.</p>
 Video-based Verification 
<p>In eKYC, video-based verification video identification is a developing trend. It uses recorded or live video calls to verify the customer’s identification. The client may be required to show their ID documents to the camera or respond to specific questions. Some companies use AI-based tools to examine video conversations for more precise identification document verification.</p>
 Document Verification 
<p>Verifying identity using physical documents is a critical component of eKYC. However, eKYC employs technology to scan and validate digital versions of official papers like passports, driver’s licenses, and national ID cards rather than physically reviewing paper counterparts. This speedier digital verification procedure eliminates the danger of losing or damaging physical documents.</p>
 The eKYC Process Explained 
<p>Understanding the process of eKYC is essential to appreciate its benefits and effectiveness fully. Here’s a simplified version of how the process generally works:</p>
 
 Customer Enrollment: The eKYC process begins when a customer initiates a relationship with a company, usually by filling out an online application form. This application includes basic information such as their full name, address, and contact information. 
 Document Submission: The customer must submit digital copies of their identification and proof of address. This could be a passport, driver’s license, or government-issued ID for identification, utility bills, or lease agreements for address proof. 
 Data Validation: Next, the eKYC system uses AI and machine learning algorithms to verify the authenticity of the submitted documents. It checks for inconsistencies, tampering, or false information. 
 Biometric Verification: In some cases, the system may require biometric verification, especially for high-risk transactions. This might involve facial recognition, iris scans, or fingerprint scanning, leveraging the individual’s unique physical characteristics for secure identification. 
 Customer Database: Once all the information is verified, the customer’s data is stored securely in the company’s database. This database can be accessed for future transactions, making the process quicker and more efficient for returning customers. 
 Continuous Monitoring: The eKYC process doesn’t end after the initial verification. Companies continue monitoring transactions for suspicious activity, leveraging AI and machine learning to identify potential red flags and fraudulent activities. 
 
<p>By making the process digital, eKYC reduces the time and resources required for customer verification, enhancing the customer experience while ensuring a secure transaction environment.</p>
 What are the documents required for e-KYC verification? 
<p>According to the specific rules and criteria of each nation, sector, or service provider, different papers are needed for e-KYC verification. They often include a certificate of identification and proof of residence. A government-issued ID card, passport, or driver’s license might be used as identification, while a utility bill, a bank account statement, or a lease agreement could be proof of speech.</p>
<p>It’s vital to remember that customers often must produce digital versions of these documents as part of the eKYC procedure. Some organizations could demand that the documents be verified electronically, notarized, or attested.</p>
 What Are the Limitations of Electronic Know Your Customer? 
<p>Although eKYC has many benefits, it also has certain drawbacks. The difficulty of protecting data privacy and security is one of the significant issues. Businesses must implement strong security measures to protect sensitive client data and stop data breaches.</p>
<p>Additionally, only some consumers are tech-savvy; other customers could find the digital procedure intimidating. Businesses must provide clear instructions and user-friendly interfaces for eKYC to be successful.</p>
 Challenges with eKYC 
<p>There are even more difficulties with eKYC in addition to the restrictions above. These concerns include the possibility of system mistakes, the high initial cost of eKYC technologies, and the need for ongoing updates to keep up with the development of technology and the danger from cyberspace.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies have to traverse intricate regulatory frameworks in several nations. Multinational corporations that do business across several countries may need help finding this.</p>
 How can eKYC Help Prevent Fraud and Identity Theft? 
<p>By a digital process for swiftly and precisely validating consumers’ identities, eKYC aids in the prevention of fraud and identity theft. It prevents identity theft by using hard-to-fool technology like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and biometrics, making it difficult for fraudsters to pass themselves off as others.</p>
<p>eKYC creates a digital trail that enables firms to track and look into shady activity. Additionally, real-time verification allows businesses to identify and stop fraudulent activities swiftly.</p>
 What are the Data Protection and Privacy Measures in Place for eKYC? 
<p>To prevent identity theft and safeguard client data, businesses use a variety of data protection laws, including <a>encryption</a>, secure data storage, electronic identity, and stringent access restrictions.</p>
<p>Most nations also have strict laws governing data privacy, requiring companies to get their clients’ permission before collecting and using their data and to alert them in case of a data breach. Data retention regulations, which specify how long businesses may keep consumer data on file and when to delete it, must also be followed by firms.</p>
 How Can Companies Implement eKYC? 
<p>Companies can implement eKYC by understanding the specific KYC regulations applicable to their industry and jurisdiction. Next, they can choose an eKYC solution that best fits their needs. This could be an in-house solution built from scratch or a third-party solution.</p>
<p>Implementing eKYC requires changes to existing processes, staff training, risk assessment, due diligence, and customer education. Companies also need to regularly review and update their eKYC processes to ensure they comply with evolving regulations and new services and are effective against new types of fraud.</p>
 Is eKYC Mandatory? 
<p>Whether eKYC is mandatory depends on each country’s regulations, regulatory requirements, and the specific industry. In some cases, businesses are required by law to conduct KYC procedures, and eKYC can be a more efficient way of fulfilling this requirement. However, companies can implement eKYC or stick with traditional KYC procedures in some countries or industries.</p>
 Who Can Use eKYC? 
<p>eKYC can be used by any business that is required to verify the identity of its customers. This includes banks, financial institutions, trust services, insurance companies, telecom companies, and online marketplaces. eKYC can also be used by government bodies for citizen services.</p>
 Future of eKYC 
<p>As technology advances and digital transactions become more commonplace, the role of eKYC in identity verification is set to grow. With AI, machine learning, and biometrics advancements, the eKYC customer identity verification processes will likely become even more secure and efficient.</p>
<p>At the same time, as data privacy becomes an increasing concern, businesses must ensure their eKYC verification processes are transparent and comply with data privacy regulations. We can also expect more standardization in eKYC regulations across different countries, making it easier for multinational businesses to implement eKYC.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>eKYC is reinventing identity verification by integrating innovative technology such as biometrics and artificial intelligence to provide companies and consumers with a safe and fast solution to validate identities. With speedier onboarding, lower fraud risks, and a more seamless experience, eKYC is positioned to play an important role in establishing trust and protecting identities in the future.</p>

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos VP of Product Marketing, Robert MacDonald, is joined by the VP of Solutions, Vikram Subramanian to discuss inserting identity into your SSO implementation.</p>
  
<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Hi, everybody. Welcome to our vlog today. My name’s Robert MacDonald. I’m vice president of Product Marketing here at 1Kosmos, and I’m joined by Vikram today. Vikram, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Hey. Great. I’m doing great, Rob. Hello, everyone. Vikram Subramanian, vice president of Solutions at 1Kosmos, and really excited to be talking to you today.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
All right. Listen, it’s a pleasure having you. Today we’re going to talk about single sign-on implementations and inserting identity into an SSO implementation, like an Okta as an example. So Vik, let’s jump right into it. How do you view the balance between risk and convenience when it comes to single sign-on?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
This is a question that has been plaguing our industry for so long, right? I mean, obviously we all know, everyone’s talking about passwords are bad. And so what did we do? We just came up with another way of authenticating the user, which is put MFA in its place and you’re going to ask them to put a code in or have another device on the person or try and get something else out of them just to make sure, because the assurance that is there within the username and password is not there.</p>
<p>So what do we do? We also add on other risk factors. We evaluate 50 other things and 100 other things and all those signals, put them in together and then say, “Okay. With a reasonable amount of confidence, the user is who they say they are. Let them in the door.” Right? So that’s the state of SSO today, and this is where it actually brings up the conversation, really, what is the question that we are trying to answer with SSO, with authentication, with MFA? Are you really who you say you are? That is the question that needs answering. So we, I think, can help answer that question and add on to that experience with SSO.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Okay. Well, let’s talk a little bit more about that. So when you look at Okta or ForgeRock, Ping, whatever, how can organizations do more to protect themselves from cyber attacks? We talked about getting rid of passwords and MFA, right? Should they get rid of single sign-on platforms completely or is there something that they can do to try to augment, obviously keep the investment that they have but still become more secure as a net result? What is it that organizations could do?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Absolutely. I mean, think about it. The organizations have invested so much money in really integrating applications or migrating from their legacy solutions to solutions like Okta, Microsoft, ForgeRock, Ping, I mean, all of our partners in the industry. And there are tons of applications that are out there. For us to go in and then say, “You’re going to have to migrate to another solution,” is going to be extremely irresponsible, which is where we want to enhance that experience and really give the users the ability to prove their identity as part of that authentication channel.</p>
<p>So when the users want to go in, we have a multitude of ways where organizations can enhance the user experience. We’ve been talking about risk. We’ve been talking about passwords. We’ve been talking about anything that just from a pure security standpoint, something that is troubling a particular seesaw. But more and more users and more and more users have begun to expect the user experience out of even enterprise IAM solutions. They want the experience. They want the consumer-like experience. They want to get in, they want to do their work, they want to get out, and that’s it. Don’t bother me with all the 10 other factors that I have to list down. That is where I think we should be able to come in and really help our organizations there.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Okay. Well, listen, on that note, let’s be a little bit more poignant in terms of what we’re talking about here. What is it that 1Kosmos can do to help augment a platform like Okta? So you said that replacement’s not an option, and you’re right. I mean, there’s too much money already invested in all that stuff. What can we do to come in and stand alongside an Okta or another single sign-on provider and provide value? What is it that we can do?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
See, this is where the true meaning of identity would come into play and that’s where the 1Kosmos architecture of really saying an identity is a person comes into play for the authentication and the SSO experience or the authentication experience. So 1Kosmos, what we are able to insert into the equation of really answering the question, “Are you really who you say you are?” is biometric-based authentication and identity-based authentication.</p>
<p>So what is identity-based authentication? Let’s talk about that. So if I really need to go prove myself in the digital world, I am bringing out my government IDs, like my driver’s license, passport, any of those national IDs, and I’m able to execute a transaction in the physical world.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
That’s right.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Now, what if we just translated that to the digital world? That is exciting. So this is where the concept of the digital identity comes into play, and we are able to create a digital identity for a user by really taking a look at their government issued documents and then verifying them with the issuing authorities and creating a digital identity for the user.</p>
<p>Now, with this digital identity, now there are a lot of solutions that stop with just proofing, now this is where 1Kosmos makes it special, we are able to take this proofed identity or proofed document, create an identity for the user, and help them store that identity within the wallet. With this identity in the wallet, they’re able to execute transactions. This could be authentication transactions, this could be other transactions like approving a particular transfer or money transfer or anything like that. And really, our wallet is made to enable identity-based transactions, which include authentication.</p>
<p>So when a user comes in to a website and they want to prove who they say they are, they’re able to take their wallet and inject their identity into that authentication scenario and truly prove who they say they are by use of, number one, the government issued documents, and number two, by using biometrics. It’s not mandatory to use government issued documents, but biometrics makes it very easy for the user to go ahead and prove who they say they are. All of us are used to doing face ID with the iPhones today. Everyone wants to just look at something and, “Hey, you know who I am. I mean, you just see me. Then authenticate me.” So that’s what we are inserting into the equation. This is how we can compliment the experience that organizations have with Okta and other SSO solutions today.</p>
<p>Right. Now, Rob, you may want to ask, “Okay, what else can we do, right? There’s got to be more, Hey, does the user have to go through identity proofing every time?” Well, not really. They don’t have to go through identity proofing every time, which is why we have the concept of the wallet. And what also that we have is the ability to issue verifiable credentials. This is something that a bunch of companies are already investing in and we are already compliant with the W3C standards to issue verifiable credentials, to create a presentation, and also to go ahead and use that in a particular transaction. So now we’ll talk about verifiable credentials as a part of the roadmap for something that companies can consider, but very simplistically in today’s world, like I mentioned, we can insert identity into an authentication and we can do this at every layer that the user is interacting with a particular organization.</p>
<p>So let’s start, anything that is logical, which is their laptop. So if they want to go in and really log into that Windows system on the operating system, they’re able to do that. It doesn’t matter which version of Windows they’re on, we’re able to support a bunch of versions, which is true for many organizations that not all of them are upgraded and not all laptops are made the same, which is where we are able to digitize that authentication, include biometrics, and the users don’t need to remember their username and password. Then we are able to translate that onto the web and interact with the systems like Okta and ForgeRock and go ahead and insert identity into the equation. You can go ahead and take these signals that we can send or even take a look at what is the identity assurance level of the user then make a decision, do you really want to let them into your applications or not?</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Okay, that’s fair. So listen, that was a great explanation in terms of what users or what organizations can do to try… Or what we provide organizations to augment or improve the security of their single sign-on. Give me an example of what the experience looks like. So you did a very good job at explaining in terms of what happens, but talk about, well, how does it work, right? So you talked about logging into Windows. I’m assuming you can do it with Mac too. Obviously, there’s the single sign-on providers. And then I’m assuming, Vik, we work outside of just the single sign-on stuff. There are other areas that we can cover too. Just quickly talk about what that experience looks like from an authentication standpoint for the user when they come in the morning. What does that look like?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Oh, wow. Yes. We were talking about the user experience. Yes. So let’s remove ourselves from technology and really look at the experience. From an experience standpoint, what we bring to the table is something that all of us are used to when we go to restaurants today, which is to scan a QR code. So, user comes in and they’re opening up their laptops. They can be presented with a QR code, scan the QR code, authenticate using biometrics, show their face or… you know what? … with our LiveID. We’re the only solution in the market that brings a smile to people’s faces, right? The only security solution that does that, right? So smile, get in, get to work, right?</p>
<p>And that same experience is carried over onto the web. They can go scan a QR code and they are logged in. Or… you know what? … depending on the system they’re logged into, many other solutions can calculate the risk. Are you coming in from the same device? All of those things can come into play. And they’re not forced to log in when they log into web applications, right? So that is the experience that we can give to the user. The other thing that we can also do is we can also interface with the webcam, and all that you need to do is take a look and then you’re logged in. So those are all things that we bring to the table and enforce situations where your mobile phone is not allowed, you don’t have a webcam. What do you do? This is where our support for passkeys comes into play, right? People can utilize their passkeys, their synced passkeys, and go ahead and authenticate across the entire stack and move forward.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So we do more than just the biometric, I guess. Well, I guess we do more than just a facial biometric is what you’re saying there. So we have other ways that users can authenticate, whether that be via an app, appless, FIDO, passkeys, all of those things are all built into the app is what you’re saying, and users can authenticate in any of those ways? Yes?</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Yes, absolutely. Right. Like I mentioned already, you go to a restaurant, you scan a QR code, you get the menu. You go to your enterprise, you scan a QR code, you get a menu of options that you can choose from. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Very good. All right, Vik, thanks very much for coming in today and telling us a little bit about how organizations can inject identity into securing their single sign-on implementation. I look forward to talking to you again soon. And everybody that’s watching, please make sure to take a look at our data sheet. We’ve got a Single Sign-On Better Together With 1Kosmos data sheet that’s available on our website that you can get a little bit more information in terms of what we’re talking about today. Thanks again, Vik.</p>
<p>Vikram Subramanian:<br>
Thanks, Rob. Great being here.</p>

  <p>In a previous <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/apply-zero-trust-principles-to-authentication-session-management/ba-p/3615343">blog</a>, we introduced <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> (CAE) - a product that brings Zero Trust principles to session management. Today we would like to discuss securing cross-tenant access with a focus on preventing data exfiltration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s impossible to imagine a successful modern organization that doesn’t collaborate with partners across organizational boundaries. While cross-company collaboration empowers employees and enables partnerships, it also lowers barriers for both accidental and malicious data exfiltration. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview">Microsoft Cross-Tenant Access Settings</a> is designed to address security of cross-company exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outbound and Inbound Cross-Tenant Access Settings offer fine grain security controls for cross-company collaboration using user’s home identity, while Tenant Restriction v2 (TRv2) can be used to prevent data exfiltration using foreign identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the hardest-to-prevent data leaks happen when users inside your organization use foreign identities to connect to external tenants. Let’s consider one such attack. A malicious insider creates a Microsoft Entra tenant. Then they authenticate to their malicious tenant from your organization’s device. Now the attacker can leak your files via email using the Exchange Online account of the malicious tenant. These types of attacks can be described as creating a “USB dongle in a cloud.” Regular security methods do not work against such attacks. Your tenant’s policies do not apply to external identities that attackers use. Blocking Microsoft Entra ID or Exchange Online URIs in the firewall would block your legitimate users along with the attacker. These types of attack need special defenses that TRv2 provides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRv2 works by sending special signals to Entra ID, Microsoft Account and other Microsoft resources. These signals point to Cross-Tenant Access Settings’ TRv2 policy that you created. Microsoft resources evaluate the policy and block unsanctioned access.&nbsp; We have two major flavors of TRv2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auth Plane TRv2 can block logins with external identities based on policy. To configure it you need to deploy a network proxy in your organization and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/tenant-restrictions-v2#step-4-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy">configure that proxy to set TRv2 signals</a> on all traffic to Entra ID and Microsoft Account. In the above example of a malicious insider leaking data over external email, the attacker will not be able to login to their malicious tenant and therefore will not be able to send email. Auth Plane TRv2 is now generally available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Universal TRv2 as part of Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Entra Global Secure Access</a> goes one step further to protect against more sophisticated attacks where an attacker bypasses authentication by allowing anonymous access to the malicious tenant’s apps, such as anonymous meeting join in Teams. Or the attacker can import to your organizational device an access token lifted from a device in the malicious tenant. All these attack vectors bypass login to Entra ID. Since Universal TRv2 sends TRv2 signals on authentication plane (Entra ID and Microsoft Account) and data plane (Microsoft cloud applications), these attacks will be prevented. Universal TRv2 is currently in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have another flavor of TRv2 in public preview – TRv2 on Windows. It’s a partial solution that protects the authentication and data planes but only for some scenarios. It only works on managed Windows devices and does not protect .NET stack, Chrome, or Firefox. We have heard from customers that it is difficult to deploy and does not provide adequate security. The Windows solution was meant to provide temporary protection until Universal TRv2 is released and we’re planning to retire it after Universal TRv2 is generally available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the digital revolution gains momentum, we’ve seen that businesses worldwide are intensifying their efforts to deliver intelligent and seamless digital experiences by leveraging data-driven automation. I have seen how the gradual pace of digital transformation over the past decade has now given way to a comprehensive, large-scale digital reinvention.</p>



<p>Consequently, a new approach to IT becomes inevitable—one that enables organizations to prioritize business outcomes while accelerating the impact of new technologies. However, most struggle to harness the rapidly evolving “digital technology flywheel,” where data fuels digital businesses, hybrid cloud enables data democratization, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> unlocks innovation, and XaaS drives outcomes.</p>



 The four core imperatives for a future-ready business 



<p>IBM is assisting clients in making informed architectural decisions to future-ready their businesses, allowing for the creation of sustained value in the long run—where possibilities can be limitless. These architectural decisions are grounded in four core imperatives:</p>



 
 Create freely by simplifying <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> landscapes, giving clients the strategic freedom to distribute, run and connect workloads and IT where they are needed. 
 



 
 Create quickly by delivering “fit-for-purpose” IT solutions on-demand, composed from the services of their choice and consuming only what is needed, when its needed. 
 



 
 Create securely by prioritizing data fluidity across digital-value chains, enabling clients to access and integrate with built-in security and compliance controls. 
 



 
 Create intelligently by architecting AI for scale, helping clients to train and run compute-intensive AI designed for greater performance, agility and sustainability. 
 



<p>Progressing with these imperatives necessitates a fresh approach to digital transformation, freeing businesses to focus on outcomes by transcending the constraints of current data, cloud and IT infrastructures. By designing a digital services platform, clients can help simplify value creation, leveraging a flexible as-a-service experience that allows easy configuration and deployment of “fit-for-purpose” solutions tailored to specific workload requirements. When architected appropriately, this approach can empower organizations with strategic freedom in determining the placement of data, workloads and the technologies they work with, fostering innovation on their own terms while maintaining control over risk and cost.</p>



 A roadmap for your business 



<p>When we work with clients, they are already on this transformative journey, albeit at different stages of maturity. For example, our client <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ecogas-power10">Ecogas successfully deployed SAP HANA 2.0</a> in a hybrid environment based on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/power">IBM Power10</a> servers, extending high-quality digital services to over one million people.</p>



<p>We hope that clients will also move their business systems to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/power-virtual-server">IBM Power Virtual Server</a> and use IBM Power Enterprise Pools 2.0 to dynamically and cost-effectively flex its on-premises compute resources to accommodate peaks in business volumes.</p>



<p>I also encourage you to explore this IBM-sponsored Moor Insights research paper that provides a roadmap into the future. </p>

<p>The global digital payments ecosystem continues to evolve as new and incumbent financial institutions, payment networks, central banks, governmental agencies, businesses and other market players push for innovation. They all work toward the common goal of creating secure, compliant, real-time, ubiquitous and low-cost payment rails.</p>



 Payment rails are the most critical element when thinking about payments 



<p>No matter their size, scope or sector, all businesses that handle transactions and transfers deal with payments—and this means dealing with payment rails.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, a payment rail is a platform or network infrastructure that allows all digital money transfers to be made between payers and payees, regardless of country, currency, payment method, channel or persona (whether the payer or payee is a business or consumer). Each rail differs in how it carries out this payment workflow based on the payment type, speed, technology, settlement network or geographical location.</p>



 Using IBM Cloud to transform global payments rails 



<p>The need for continuously available payment processing requires a rethinking of end-of-day cycles and introduces the need for stand-in processing for the times when host applications are down for end-of-day cycles or unavailable due to system outages or maintenance. Liquidity must be managed 24 hours a day to ensure the availability of funds for both customers and the bank’s real-time payments, alongside clearing and settlement systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a huge opportunity for banks to work together to reinvent the way that payments operate across the financial infrastructure.</p>



<p>IBM Cloud for Payments provides a secure foundation for global growth in payments that opens new revenue streams, maintains positive customer experiences and ensures secure transactions (while maintaining the highest compliance standards). IBM Cloud for Payments offers end-to-end, as-a-Service solutions for check payments, cross-border payments and real-time payments.</p>



<p>When the payments infrastructure is digitized, payments management, cash forecasting and other payment operations improve. As clients further digitize legacy infrastructure, they start to get data faster and&nbsp;more consistently (even in real-time). That improves the clients’ overall cash forecasting, which results in their ability to move funds around and make liquidity decisions faster for innovation and growth.</p>



 Leveraging AI and machine learning to combat payments fraud 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">Cyberattacks</a>, fraud, payment processing and fraud detection are all constantly innovating and clients expect the speed of their payments to keep up. Having integration with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/safer-payments">IBM Safer Payments</a> (a real-time payment fraud monitoring solution) will help clients to improve fraud detection, manage through false positives and stay on top of new threats, without slowing down their transactions.</p>



<p>IBM Safer Payments on the IBM Cloud platform comes with an array of statistical, modeling and model-support tools to help financial crime professionals build models that can rapidly recognize and stop new/episodic payment fraud attacks across all cashless payment systems. Clients can also leverage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio">IBM Watson Studio</a> to develop new or revised models with considerably less data and realize faster model update cycles.</p>



 Building a cyber resilience strategy for critical payments infrastructure 



<p>Cybercrime costs are growing exponentially, with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">10% increase in average total cost of a breach</a>.</p>



<p>The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (<a href="https://www.swift.com/">SWIFT</a>) provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure, standardized (ISO20022) and reliable environment. SWIFT linked more than 12,000 financial institutions (20,000 entities in total) across 200+ countries and territories—all of which are exchanging ~50M financial messages per day (10B/year).</p>



<p>To achieve frictionless cross-border payments requires a community effort; no bank can achieve this in isolation. The inability to communicate financial messages between systems disrupts the international market, especially in the event of a cyberattack where we have ripple effects on the overall world economics. This is putting payment providers under pressure and requires banks to rethink the strategy about digitizing their payment infrastructure with resiliency and regulatory compliance to modernize payment mission-critical workloads.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-resilience">Cyber resilience</a> is more than security—it’s a component of operational resilience, which is the primary focus of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/applying-cyber-resilience-to-dora-solutions/">DORA</a> and other regulations. IBM offers a cyber-resilient SWIFT environment independent from SWIFT users’ nominal environments. In the event of a cyberattack, the SWIFT user can continue flowing messages through this SWIFT resilience environment. The solution is built on IBM Cloud for Financial Services, leveraging its built-in security and compliance framework.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>When making or receiving a payment, extra time, lack of predictability and visibility, and loss of information can all have costly consequences. That’s why when it comes to reducing friction in payments—whether it’s check, wire, real-time or cross-border payments—financial institutions have no time to waste.</p>



<p>It’s essential to rethink old approaches by moving from transactional to cross-functional thinking. You can eliminate silos by modernizing payments infrastructure, establishing interoperability between payment rails messaging formats with ISO20022 compliance, and adhering to evolving regulatory and compliance legislation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, IBM has continued to offer innovative technologies—from building a check processor to launching <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM wat</a>sonx. We help financial institutions modernize their payment systems with the highest level of security and cyber resiliency on IBM Cloud for Financial Services. We also provide access to real-time innovation, enabling our clients to capitalize on new payment rails as they come to market with the same rigor of security and compliance. </p>

Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p>SpruceKit is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit/SSI  TreeLDR  Provides access to Kepler and Rebase   <br>SSX <p><br></p><p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Work is currently in progress to add support for signing in to services using <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">WebAuthn</a>. This will allow users to sign in and manage their SSX-based tools using their devices' Passkeys, as an alternative option to Ethereum wallets.   Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  SIWE-py: We recently upgraded to pydantic 2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/releases/tag/v2.3.0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-py@v2.3.0</a>) and improved typing, linting, and CI (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/releases/tag/v2.4.0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">siwe-py@v2.4.0</a>)  We've updated the Discourse plugin to add support for ENS names (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/discourse-siwe-auth/pull/24?ref=blog.spruceid.com">discourse-siwe-auth#24</a>)   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  Work is underway to add support for authorization tokens signed with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">WebAuthn</a>. This will allow users to access and manage Kepler orbits on any modern device using their Passkeys, as an alternative to an Ethereum account.   <br>DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Major refactor: We are working on a major refactor to integrate with TreeLDR and improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized ID specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#508</a>). We are currently in the testing stage in order to improve the user experience prior to release.  New Library: We’ve created a new library for (de)serialization of Linked-Data types (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/linked-data-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">linked-data-rs</a>) that will help to define credentials.   Rebase   We are working to add session key-based issuance for all attestation-based credentials. This enables users who sign a SIWE message with an embedded ReCap delegation to not have to sign for the creation of these credentials, greatly improving UX for social media-style apps (<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">like the Sprouts</a>). The final credential includes the delegate key’s DID so that the creator can track what credentials were issued by a particular session, but includes no identifying information about what site was used to create the credential.   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.

 In 2022, the revenue generated from UK’s gambling industry reached an <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-kingdom/market-size/gambling-betting-activities/">eye-watering £14.7 billion</a>; an 18.1% increase on 2021. But what was the real&nbsp;cost? We explore how financial risk checks can help protect players, and prevent problem gambling. 



 



<p>Almost half (44%) of UK adults have gambled at least once this year, and there are approximately <a href="https://www.finder.com/uk/gambling-statistics">14 million active players gambling online</a>. This is a 78.4% increase on the number of active online gamblers (10 million) in April 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the vast majority of those who gamble do so recreationally, spending an average of just £2.70 per week, there are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age">300,000 people</a> estimated to be engaged in problem gambling.&nbsp;In the recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK gambling white paper</a>, the UK government defined ‘problem gambling’ as “gambling to a degree which compromises, disrupts, or damages family, personal or recreational pursuits.” A further 1.8 million were considered gamblers at “elevated levels of risk.”</p>



 What is problem gambling? 



<p>When does gambling become a problem? What may be too much for one person may not be for the other. In this sense, isn’t problem gambling subjective? &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the UKGC, here are <a href="https://consult.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/author/remote-customer-interaction-consultation-and-call/supporting_documents/CI%20consultation%20call%20for%20evidence.pdf#page=18">some examples of “clearly unaffordable gambling”</a> from 2020.</p>



<p>“A customer lost £54,000 within a month of signup despite the operator not having established affordability for the customer. Shortly after joining, the customer’s account was suspended due to Safer Gambling concerns. When a successful call was made, the customer said they had “had a shocker over the weekend’ but were happy to lose £20K a month. The customer said they would be happy for the operator to set a deposit limit for them, but this was not done.”</p>



<p>UKGC case study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A customer lost £24,800 within three days. The operator had not carried out any affordability assessment for the customer.”</p>



<p>UKGC case study.</p>



 New approach to a growing problem. 



<p>Considering the dramatic increase in active online gamblers, and the startling numbers of problem gamblers, the UK government will, for the first time, mandate operators to conduct financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks) on customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, operators who fail to protect their customers run the risk of not only being complicit in the devastation to customers’ lives, but also liable to fines and irreparable brand damage. In fact, there was a total of <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gambling-companies-hit-with-105m-in-fines-after-crackdowns-by-global-regulators-9lfspx7b2">£44.6 million of fines issued by the UKGC in 2022</a>, which was a 76% rise from 2021. For example, in March 2022, <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/gbp9-4m-fine-for-online-operator-888">online operator 888 was fined £9.4 million</a> following social responsibility (also known as responsible gambling) and money laundering failings.</p>



<p>Failings included:</p>



  Not effectively identifying players at risk of harm because their policies determined financial checks should only be carried out after a customer had deposited £40,000.<br>  Not carrying out a customer interaction with a customer who had lost £37,000 in a six-week period during the pandemic.<br>  Giving an NHS worker earning £1,400 a month a monthly deposit cap of £1,300.<br>  And much more…&nbsp;  



 Responsibility vs risk. Is it worth it?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), which is largely responsible for organizing consultations and then implementing regulatory changes in the UK’s gambling market, is <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">currently investigating four areas</a>:</p>



  Remote game design;&nbsp;  



  Strengthening age verification;&nbsp;  



  Improving customer control over advertising;&nbsp;  



  Financial risk and financial vulnerability.  



<p>For more information on the UKGC’s plans, read <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">‘From policy to paper: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector.’</a></p>



 What is an affordability check in gambling? 



<p>With the UKGC’s proposed changes, operators are now required to conduct financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks) to assess whether a customer’s gambling activity may be harmful to their financial circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the benefit of mandating financial risk checks is certainly plain to see, what constitutes risk; what the check involves; and who would be subjected to checks was not immediately clear from the UK government’s early materials and messaging. Similar criticisms of lack of clarity were levelled against its stats on problem gambling, which resulted in many media think pieces and articles with somewhat colourful interpretations of numbers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2023, the <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/08/14/ukgc-problem-gambling-stats/">UKGC condemned</a> what it saw as the misuse of statistics to push agendas and further arguments. Just one month later, in September 2023, Andrew Rhodes, Chief Executive of the UKGC felt compelled to release a video and in-depth blog to clear up <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/blog/post/your-questions-answered-on-the-financial-risk-checks-consultation">confusion and provide further clarity on the topic of financial risk checks.</a></p>

 What is a financial risk check? 



<p>The UKGC’s consultation is seeking feedback on two proposed forms of financial risk checks. The first is described as “light touch financial vulnerability checks using publicly available data.” The UKGC considers these unintrusive checks.&nbsp;The government and UKGC are proposing these checks be conducted at £125 net loss within a 30-day period, or £500 within a rolling-year period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that some larger gambling operators already perform this check, either at onboarding or during the customer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second financial risk check is referred to as a financial risk assessment, which is considered a more detailed financial risk check. According to the aforementioned blog, these will be trigged “at unusually high loss levels where it seems proportionate to understand more about the potential risk of harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These assessments will be from credit reference agency data and will&nbsp;kick in at losses of more than £1,000 within 24 hours, or £2,000 within 90 days. The consultation is also gathering feedback on the potential for lower triggers for those aged 18-24.</p>



 How will financial risk checks impact the player experience? 



<p>One of the major concerns for operators and players alike was how these checks would impact upon the player experience, and who exactly would be subjected to checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As clarified above, the checks would be proportionate and therefore only the high spending [and losing] customers would ever be impacted. According to the UK government and UKGC:</p>



  Light touch financial vulnerability checks to be carried out on 20% of accounts.<br>  Only 3% of accounts would undergo the more in-depth financial risk assessments. Of these assessments, approximately 80% would be carried out through credit reference agencies and therefore be frictionless. <br>  A further 10% of assessments would be done through data-sharing through third party open-source technology.<br>  Perhaps the most important clarification came with the estimation that just 0.3% of account holders would ever be asked to provide additional financial information.  



<p>Well, that clears that up, doesn’t it…&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the blog, the UKGC reassured operators that they would not mandate operators to implement checks at the above levels until they could be sure that they were being delivered frictionlessly.&nbsp;What constitutes an acceptable level of friction will, I imagine, will be a topic for consultation…</p>



<p>The UKGC is proposing that a customer be subjected to a financial vulnerability check every 12 months. For the more in-depth financial risk assessment, it is proposing a period of every 6 months.</p>



 Why must gambling operators conduct a financial risk check? 



<p>Arguments against mandatory financial risk checks include the fact that customers aren’t subjected to similar checks when buying cars or clothes, so why should there be one for gambling. Addressing these comments, Andrew said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>While most people enjoy gambling and don’t experience harm, the Government has determined that gambling should be a regulated industry partly because of the harm that gambling products can cause.</p>Andrew Rhodes, Chief Executive at the UKGC.</blockquote>



 Will financial risk checks force players to black market gambling platforms? 



<p>As mentioned by our Roger Redfearn-Tyrzrk, our Director of Global Gambling and Sales at IDnow in a r<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-trends-2023/">ecent interview</a>, the dangers of using an unregulated, black-market platform far outweigh the positives.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>If you’re using a black-market operator, your winnings are totally in their hands. For example, if you hit a jackpot of €1 million, they don’t have to pay you out, because there is no consumer protection.</p> Roger Redfearn-Tyrzrk, Director of Global Gambling and Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Other concerns regarding black-market gambling platforms revolve around a higher propensity for fraud and other illegal activity. In addressing concerns that customers would simply just gamble elsewhere, thereby circumnavigating any checks or regulation, the UKGC said: “We will never accept the argument that because an illegal online option exists, this should mean that the regulated gambling sector should have lower, less fair or less safe standards. Britain is, and must continue to be, a world leader in providing consumers with a fair and safe gambling market.”</p>







 Why 6 financial risk check indicators are better than 2. 



<p>IDnow offers the most comprehensive financial risk check in the industry. Historically, identity verification providers have relied on just two indicators for affordability checks: geo-affordability and postcode data, but we utilize six distinct data checks to offer the most accurate and holistic assessment of a player’s affordability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how IDnow’s financial risk check solution works:</p>



 1. Geo-affordability. 



<p>The most commonly-used data set to conduct affordability checks, geo-affordability data enables you to understand regional spending patterns and potential financial risks associated with specific areas and players.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Application data. 



<p>According to the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/data/financial-lives-2022-early-survey-insights-vulnerability-financial-resilience">Financial Lives 2022 Survey</a>, 24% of UK adults have low ‘financial resilience,’ potentially making them unable to absorb financial shocks, such as losing their main source of household income for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Application data aggregates information from 2.5 million of the most financially vulnerable consumers in the UK, approximately 750,000 financially stressed individuals reapplying for short-term high-cost loans every month, and 90,000 new loan enquires made each month. This data will help you identify financially stressed individuals by, for example, leveraging data from high-cost, short-term loan enquiries (payday loans).</p>



 3. Vulnerability data. 



<p>The FCA’s survey also found that 47% of adults display one or more characteristics of vulnerability. These data checks allow you to protect your players and understand their ability to gamble responsibly by leveraging the <a href="https://www.vulnerabilityregistrationservice.co.uk/">Vulnerability Registration Service</a>.</p>



 4. Mortality data. 



<p>In modern-day parlance, ‘ghosting’ refers to the disappearance of a suitor, who may not return texts, phone calls, or dating app messages. Rather less known is the ghosting that refers to stealing a person’s identity after they have passed away, and then using the data for financial gain, or, for example, signing up for a gambling platform. By plugging into mortality data, you can leverage data from 12 million deceased individuals (85% of all UK deaths), with 40,000 new records added each month to ensure your players are not using details from a deceased person.</p>



 5. Property data. 



<p>Although property data tends to be used predominantly by real estate agencies and real estate investors to predict trends, and monitor the market, it can also be used to gain insights into a player’s residential circumstances, from council tax band and housing type to property values, to better assess the affordability risk associated with a player.</p>



 6. Derogatory financial score. 



<p>With access to the derogatory financial score data, you can identify which players are likely to enter arrears and default credit agreements with a dynamic score that assesses the financial quality of a player.</p>



 



 

 



 Reduce risk. Prevent problem gambling. Play on.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Welcome back to Season 5 of the Let’s Talk about Digital Identity podcast. In this series opener I am joined by Drummond Reed and Andy Tobin, from Gen Digital, joining us to delve into vLEIs and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Oscar: Today, we are very happy to have two expert guests, Drummond and Andy. And today, we are going to discuss vLEIs and what is the connection with self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>First of all, we have Drummond Reed. He is Director of Trust Services at Gen, previously Avast after their acquisition of Evernym, where he was the Chief Trust Officer. He is co-author of the book Self-Sovereign Identity, published by Manning Publication in 2021. And he’s co-editor of the W3C Decentralised Identifiers, DID 1.0 Specification. At the Trust Over IP Foundation, Drummond is a member of the steering committee and co-chair of the Governance Stack Working Group and the Concepts and Terminology Working Group. At the Sovrin Foundation, he serves as a co- chair of the Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group for five years. Hello, Drummond.</p>
<p>Drummond Reed: Hello, Oscar. It’s very good to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome Drummond. Our second guest is Andy Tobin. Andy Tobin leads European and eIDAS strategy for Gen Digital’s Trust Services Business. He is one of the pioneers of self-sovereign identity and helped to establish Evernym, as a world leader in this field. He is a well-known public speaker and writer on the topic of digital identity and has delivered some of the largest SSI projects to date. His career has spanned the three rapidly converging sectors of identity, mobile, and payments. He has written code to control cash machines, built the world’s first mCommerce server, run a £1.2 billion mobile messaging network, and been the CTO for Europe’s first fully mobile bank. Hello, Andy.</p>
<p>Andy Tobin: Hi, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome as well. I’m very happy to have both of you, Drummond and Andy.</p>
<p>So, let’s talk about digital identity, and as usual in this show we want to hear a bit more about our guests. So please, both of you tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Drummond: Oh, the journey. I don’t think we have long enough in this podcast to cover the whole journey. Yes, I’ll just say, originally, I was very interested and focused on solving problems of what we’d now call decentralised data exchange, and how people can share data, sort of directly peer to peer over wide area networks, like the internet, when it was first getting going. And I had no idea that to do that you actually had to solve the problem of digital identity and trust. And so, working on that led me over into this area.</p>
<p>We didn’t even call it identity when first working on it, we just said, “Hey, there’s this challenge that you have to be able to establish a trust network.” And turned out that the problem there was identity. And doing that on a decentralised basis. And at that time, I was working on it was really centralised identity. Where you have an account with every different system you were interacting with. That was the norm, and it was – the pain was such that we had to have some solution to that. And so we thought it was federated identity, where you could take one account and reuse it in a whole bunch of other places. And in the end that’s what most people, encounter with social login. The login with Facebook, or Google or Twitter now X, whatever.</p>
<p>And so, we spent 15 years and three generations of standards developing a federated identity. And it seemed like we could get there and then it just – we hit the ceiling. It just – federated identity by putting an intermediary in there made it – you could solve certain problems, but you couldn’t solve others. And then blockchain came along and sort of taught us, “Oh, there’s a way to make this fully decentralised that actually simplifies things tremendously.” And so that era, I really, market starting in 2015, 2016 that’s when Evernym came together, which is where Andy and I met. And we’ve been working on decentralised ever since. Over to Andy to talk about his journey.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. Thanks, Drummond. I think the thing I like to look at most frequently, and that gets me most engaged is – seeing how megatrends that emerge affect existing businesses and capabilities. So, I’ve seen, for example, the digitisation of payments happening. And then digitisation of telephony happening and the emergence of mobile phones. And then the digitisation of commerce through the internet.</p>
<p>And with the digitalisation of identity, we’re seeing really something a little bit different, which is – we need to have the ability as people to identify ourselves or prove things about ourselves – it doesn’t need to be identity, it could be anything – without having to rely on anyone else to help us really to do that. So really, we’re looking at a return, if you like, to the world we used to inhabit where you could go along with a piece of paper and show it to someone, like a passport, for example, and say, “Hey, look, this is me.” We don’t have a digital way of doing that.</p>
<p>And so, there’s lots of, what I call, work around solutions in place and Drummond’s just talked about a bunch of them that fudge the problem. The problem is solved properly by giving people digital versions of the paper documents they’ve got and giving them to those people in a way that enhances their privacy and security online. And when you have that capability, you can apply equally to companies who find it very difficult to prove who they are online, and also to things as well.</p>
<p>And as we move into the next megatrend of artificial intelligence. Underpinning artificial intelligence is – how do you know who or what is at the other end. And as it gets much easier to fake everything, there’s going to be an explosion of trust issues. And if we can solve that with some of the techniques that we’re working on, which we can, artificial intelligence gets a lot less scary.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, through your life, I could see the reasons why this topic of self-sovereign entity had to happen. But just a few years ago it is getting, mainstream finally in these very recent years. And now we talk also about the future, there’s a lot, a lot of problems to solve still.</p>
<p>In this conversation, let’s go into much more specific topic related to self-sovereign identity. This is going to be about vLEIs. But to give a bit of concept, if one of you could throw a simple definition. What is an LEI?</p>
<p>Drummond: The LEI, that’s pretty straightforward. In fact, what’s ironic, is an LEI is really a classic, what we would call federated identifier, it fits into that second category. And that’s because – so it’s, to be very, very concrete, it’s a 20-digit identifier of a legal entity. And it’s important to clarify that term legal entity, because it can – in some legal jurisdictions, a legal entity is either a person or a corporation. They call it a legal person.</p>
<p>But what LEI means are – the legal entity in LEI means – a legal entity that’s not a person. So, anything that’s legal entity that’s not a person – a corporation, a partnership, government agencies, whatever it is, it’s to identify what we would generally call an organisation.</p>
<p>And so, the LEI is 20-digit identifier, and then it is issued. GLEIF, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, is a public-private partnership that operates the GLEIF LEI system. And they’re based in – it’s a Swiss nonprofit, it’s headquartered in Frankfurt. And they oversee I think it’s roughly in the mid-30s, the number of, they’re called Local Operating Units or LEI issuers around the world.</p>
<p>They have to be qualified, and when a business or organisation wants an LEI, they have to apply for it. They have to basically go through what we call identity proofing for individuals, but this for an organisation. You have to prove yes, you whoever supplying is a legal representative of that organisation. They have to provide their local business identifiers, like identifiers that they’ve registered like a corporation ID or a tax ID in one or more jurisdictions, and some other what they call reference data. And that entry, the reference data entry is then associated with the LEI. It’s all verified and then the LEI is issued. It’s good for a year. You have to renew it every year and it goes into a global database, a public database, anyone can check to verify the LEI for an organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very, very good explanation. And so, something that caught my attention, you mentioned that it’s still the federated model, right? So, which it is –</p>
<p>Drummond: Yes.</p>
<p>Andy: There’s a central body that is in charge of the governance of the whole LEI capability. And there are, as Drummond said, regional bodies that do the actual certification. But they’re all approved by the central body as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Drummond: Right. So that makes it a federated identifier system, which is going to setup this wonderful conversation we have about how that fits into the SSI model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now let’s move to – what is vLEI?</p>
<p>Andy: So vLEI is a digital equivalent of an LEI, so Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier. Now, when I was contacted by Stephan Wolf, the Chief Exec of GLEIF years back now, six years ago probably. Who had been following this emergence of SSI very, very closely and thought there’s something in this. Because underpinning self-sovereign identity is a technology called verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>And verifiable credentials are packets of data, they can contain anything that can be passed from an issuer to a holder. So, an issuer, like an LEI issuance body, to a holder, like your company. And that holder can then present that data and it can be verified by a verifier, which could be a tax authority, a government and other company, instantly as being authentic and the integrity of the data is preserved. So that’s the technology underneath it.</p>
<p>And what Stephan wanted to know was – how these verifiable credentials could be used for LEIs. Because he could see the direction of travel, of the digitisation of identity documents and paper identity information. And he saw that if LEIs were digitised in a way that could be instantly verifiable, it could transform company onboarding for bank accounts, for example, supply chain management, et cetera.</p>
<p>So, we sat down and included also Karla and Stephan from GLEIF, I think it was in an office in Canary Wharf, and we designed the way the vLEIs would work.</p>
<p>We designed a cascading chain of authority that allowed a local LEI issuance body to be certified by GLEIF and have a credential themselves that says they are a certified LEI issuer. And they were then able to issue these vLEIs to companies. It’s essentially a very similar set of information, but a bit more detail in there, than in the LEI. But issue that as a verifiable credential to a company, and the company would keep that in a digital wallet that the company runs.</p>
<p>But enhanced on top of that is that then employees of that company could prove that they work for that company. And those employees could themselves have verifiable credentials saying, “I’m an employee of Gen, and Gen is this business with this vLEI. And you can check the vLEI is authentic, because it came from this vLEI issuer. And you can check the vLEI issue is authentic because it came from GLEIF.” So, you can run all the way back up the chain.</p>
<p>And then you can also add the ability to provide employees with – for example, confirmation they’re allowed to submit accounts to the tax authorities. So, it could be – “Andy Tobin, who’s a member of Gen is allowed to do X”. So, you end up with a cascading hierarchy, which is driven by the vLEI as the identifier for the company and then that being chained into lots of other relationships relating to that company and to the employees of that company.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how do the vLEI use the self-sovereign identity principles?</p>
<p>Drummond: OK so, as I mentioned earlier, the definition of a federated identity system is it has one or a relatively small group of organisations that almost – in fact, I’ve never heard of federated identity system with an individual that run it, they are always organisations or governments that run it at the centre. And then there, it’s federated around them. So, for instance, when we we’re using social login, it’s Google, Facebook, X, LinkedIn, they’re the – called the identity providers. You have an account there, and then you go use it in other places.</p>
<p>And so, the GLEIF LEI system, as we said earlier, it’s a federated identifier system. GLEIF is at the centre, they authorise a set of the LEI issuers around the world, and they issue the LEIs. And that’s how you can sort of trust the whole thing. So, some folks look at that and say, “Ah, well, that’s a federated identifier system, how is this self-sovereign?”</p>
<p>So, with self-sovereign identity, as Andy said, it’s all about the entity that is being identified that needs to prove their identity to anyone else. Having a digital wallet, and a set of credentials they can use to prove their identity.</p>
<p>What GLEIF did with the vLEI was say – Hey, we are a federated identifier system. But we can provide verifiable credentials as one issuer, one hierarchy of issuers to organisations around the world, any place that can in turn, as Andy explained, then issue the next credential in the chain to their employees, or their contractors or their alumni or anything to prove their relationship with the legal entity that then can prove its relationship to the issuer and all the way up to GLEIF.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, what Stephan Wolf and Karla McKenna and the GLEIF team saw was, we can take a federated identifier system, and actually bring it into the world of self-sovereign identity credentials, digital credentials, from hundreds, thousands, to maybe eventually, millions of different issuers, that all serve as what we call Root of Trust, right? And, yes, GLEIF is one Root of Trust, and the whole GLEIF, what we call digital trust ecosystem, it may end up being one of the largest in the world. And it’s very important, I think, to note that it is adjacent to – it doesn’t replace government issued identifiers to organisations, but it’s adjacent to it, and it’s worldwide.</p>
<p>It is – the G is global. So, you can get an LEI and any entity in the world, any legal government or other entity can recognise it, and then translate it to the local identifiers that it might need. But that credential, once it’s issued into a digital wallet, is just like any other credential in that digital wallet. It can be used for that entity, in this case, an organisation, to prove its legal identity any place that’s needed. That is exactly what self-sovereign identity is about.</p>
<p>Andy: And I think it’s really worthwhile here describing the incentive. So why is this interesting, right? Why is a vLEI interesting? And at the moment, it’s very, very difficult for a company to prove that it’s a legitimate company and it has a bunch of certifications, it’s got the right ecological credentials, it’s got the right qualifications in place to operate as a company in the business it does. And that causes huge problems for supply chains.</p>
<p>As an example, I was talking to some very large pharmaceutical companies, we call them big pharma in Switzerland about this very problem. And they spend millions and millions and millions and millions of Swiss Francs trying to work out who is in their supply chain. And they kicked off something called Pharma Ledger, which was an initiative to use this concept of digital identity for companies and the qualifications and certifications they have, to allow an onboarding of a new supplier in a few seconds rather than weeks and weeks and months.</p>
<p>And the same thing with banking, it’s very, very difficult for a company to get a bank account. You’ve got to supply lots of pieces of paper, you got to send them in, they’re going to be notarised and signed by somebody. It’s horrendously complex, and very, very slow and very costly. So, the dream here is instantaneous, you know, a few seconds verification that a company is legitimate, and the person acting for that company is legitimate. And the potential savings are in the billions and billions and billions of dollars worldwide. So that’s why people are interested in it. And I think people get a bit hung up on the tech under the skin. And this term, self-sovereign identity, which I kind of wish we’d never promoted in a way because it’s about…</p>
<p>Oscar: Scary.</p>
<p>Andy: … the credentials under the skin, rather than yeah.</p>
<p>So, this ability for an organisation to have verifiable data about itself digitally, which anyone can check is authentic. Without that company having to go back to GLEIF and say, “Hey, please give me a new version of this that I can use today.” That’s the sort of self-sovereign, the company has this information, they can use it wherever and whenever they want, for whatever reason they want. And the verifier can, or the recipient can check it’s authentic, instantaneously. Even if GLEIF cease to exist, you could still do that.</p>
<p>So that’s the big picture here. And the vLEIs are one aspect, but a very important aspect of this new digital ecosystem for organisations. There’s an anchoring credential that says this company is this company. In some jurisdictions, you legally have to have an LEI – vLEI makes things a lot easier. So, it’s the anchoring credential that says this company is this company, and then you can hang lots of other verifiable credentials on the back of it as well.</p>
<p>Drummond: I want to make that point that Andy just did. So, the LEI, because of its cross jurisdictional characteristics is legally required in certain jurisdictions for certain kinds of transactions. For instance, in Canada, if you’re involved in the financial services industry, you have to have an LEI. The regulators, and GLEIF has a board of I think it’s roughly 72-75 regulators from around the world. It’s called the ROC, the Regulatory Oversight Committee. Those regulators are now – the next step is to start to mandate the vLEI. Because the regulator is saying, “Hey, it’s really expensive for us to have to, verify, audit companies and the records and everything when we have to manually process papers.” So, they’re basically saying you must do these things digitally. The Securities and Exchange Commission here in the United States requires electronic submission of reports.</p>
<p>So, the emergence of the vLEI as a credential, for example, digitally signing those submissions to regulatory authorities is starting to be mandated by regulators. And I expect it’s just going to grow and grow and grow. And so, in certain places, organisations, as part of their formation and maintenance they’re going to get maintained vLEIs in order to be – handle their regulatory documents. At a minimum of this many other uses.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you explained very interesting cases, problems that are being solved by this concept. And also, when you put it in numbers, it also sounds very convincing. Indeed, to understand a bit more what is – how does it work in practice, I think you have explained pretty well.</p>
<p>But let’s say, if I want to visualise, ‘so what is the vLEI?’ So vLEI is – will be registered in an app? So where can I see if my company has registered a vLEI, where can I see it? </p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. So, vLEI, we need to introduce here the concept of an organisational wallet. So, you’ll be familiar with digital wallets that you might have on your phone at the moment as a person, so an Apple wallet and a Google Wallet. Gen has launched its own digital wallet called MyD and there are others that are being launched as well.</p>
<p>So digital wallets are going to be huge. And there’s going to be a big fight about who’s going to have the best digital wallet. And a digital wallet is a container that you put these verifiable credentials in. And in the case of you, as a person, that might be a digital version of your passport. In Europe, it might be the new personal identity data credential from eIDAS. They could be a driving license, a boarding pass, et cetera.</p>
<p>Imagine the same thing for a company, rather than sitting on a phone, it’s going to reside probably in a server somewhere. I guess it could sit on a phone. But it’s the same concept. It’s a secure container that will hold a company’s credentials, including a vLEI. And that’s just like your own wallet, you control that wallet yourself, and you have a fingerprint or something else.</p>
<p>Access to the organisational wallet will be most likely controlled by a number of people who have credentials that they can use, that will prove that they work for that company, and they have the right to access and execute transactions from that wallet. So, you can see the way the personal credentials and organisational credentials come together. And a vLEI will sit in an organisational wallet, it could manifest in many different ways. It could be embedded in the enterprise planning software that that company has. It could be in a cloud-based software facility that company is using, well, names like SAP workspace, that kind of thing might do something like that. I don’t know if they have or not, but it would be logical for them to do so.</p>
<p>So that’s how the vLEI would manifest. And it would be used when a business transaction requires the company to prove something, prove who they are, prove their legitimate organisation. And a lot of those interactions at the moment are handled fairly manually, something will pop up into somebody’s queue. And then they will have to go off and do something and then they’ll go in and fax some document that they’ve had signed by some notary or whatever it might be.</p>
<p>In this new world, all that gets digitised and happens in milliseconds. So, requests will come in digitally saying, “Hey company, please prove who you are.” The organisational wallet will respond back immediately saying, “Here’s my vLEI. You can go verify it.” And that will be verified instantly. So, the business process improvement you get from this, this is what this all comes down to is optimising and digitising business processes that so far had been too expensive or complex to optimise. There’s been no good way of doing it. vLEIs are the key enabler that helps you to get those digitised business processes working.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. The concept of organisational wallets I think it’s something that yeah, it’s – well, it’s new in this equation of the LEIs as compared to how we see it today.</p>
<p>You have already explained some examples of some industries in which vLEI will help tremendously. But if I ask you what are the top industries or sectors that will benefit the most, which one would be?</p>
<p>Drummond: I’ll start out with one of – what has become one of my very favourite examples. And I’m going to do that by reading you some texts that I have recently received. The first one is, “Hello, are you the dentist that Candy introduced me to? When do you have time?” The next one is, “Your Amazon – spelled with a little accent in it – your Amazon has been locked. Click here to fix all your bills”. My Netflix subscription is on hold. I have to renew that one. And then “Hi, it’s Hillary, can you join me for lunch as you promised?” OK? I get – I don’t know about anyone else. I’m getting several of these a day now.</p>
<p>It’s called smishing. Right? It’s SMS phishing. They’re just trying to get me to respond, to click a link, to do whatever. So, once you know spam and phishing attempts have moved into our phones. And of course, they’re also, they’re hitting me now on iMessage, on WhatsApp. We’re getting to a level where yeah, we’ve learned to live with spam in email. But when it starts hitting our phones and our most intimate ways of communicating, it’s not just a pain. All right, a lot of money is lost that way, and it erodes confidence in our most important communications infrastructure.</p>
<p>So, my personal favourite use of LEIs, vLEIs – well both actually. Because if we’ve never said it, we want to make it clear, the vLEI credential contains the LEI as one of the pieces of the data in it. So that’s how it all ties together. It is going to be used for signed, digitally signed text messages. Initially it will be used by the telcos themselves that deliver that message. They will do the filtering out of the spam because they will be able to basically differentiate and say, “Oh, this is a digitally signed message from a legitimate company, and we can deliver that.” Give it the green light to the consumer and anything else is going to be suspect.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that suddenly you’re going to stop getting any smishing attempts. But it’s going to introduce a fundamental solution that over time will, I think, essentially stamp out that industry. And this is not theoretical, there are several companies working on putting this in place. I think it’s going to start going operational in 2024. So that’s one example.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah, I think I’d add in any regulated industry, banking, particularly, especially corporate banking, where you need to know who the corporation is, and there’s so many rules, they are coming in about identifying which corporate you’re dealing with. This was one of the main use cases when we were designing vLEIs in the first place with GLEIF, which was if you’ve got a corporation, you need to find the ultimate beneficial owner of that corporation in order to give that corporation a bank account.</p>
<p>If that corporation has a bunch of shareholders and those shareholders of other corporations and those, some of those corporations have shareholders at the other corporations. You get an exponentially worsening problem of trying to work out who everybody is, because they all have to provide information about who they are and who their shareholders are.</p>
<p>And this is the case with Evernym when we set little Evernym in the UK in 2017, I needed to get a bank account. And to get that bank and I had to prove who Evernym UK was and the ultimate beneficial owner of Evernym UK was Evernym, Inc. in the US. And Evernym, Inc. had a bunch of shareholders. And I then had to prove who all those shareholders were. And this involved getting the largest shareholders over 10% to provide documentation about who they were and notarised certificates and so on and so on. And the ones that were corporates then had to give me their shareholders. And I think, eight months to get their bank account setup, which is insane. So, you can imagine the potential benefits there.</p>
<p>I’d also point as well to the European eIDAS program. Which is the eIDAS 2.0 it’s the next evolution of the European digital identity scheme. There’s a consortia and there are four consortia working on large scale pilots now. One of them that Gen is in called EWC has two use cases for people, which is travel and payments, and a use case for organisational identity as well. And that’s been championed by the governments of Sweden and Finland. And has got a lot of traction now, because the same technology that is being used for credentials, for people and personal wallets can be used for organisations as well.</p>
<p>So, I see a lot of potential for vLEIs and other organisational credentials, like VAT number and tax identity and Companies House type information. To be provided digitally in that way to transform business processes with corporate to corporate. But also in our human use cases with people. If I’m using my eIDAS wallet to book travel, the vLEI or organisational credential will allow me to check the travel agency I’m booking it with is legitimate. And if they’re ABTA based and certified and are they the right company, all of the problems that Drummond outlined, these scammers pretending to be companies, those will go away because I’ll be able to instantly verify if a company is authentic or not.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you have listed at least three very important sectors, industries, in which it’s very clear the benefit that will come. We know that vLEIs are available now, you have explained pretty well the cases, how they can help to solve these problems. When do you estimate that the full benefits will be realised? So, we are still in 2023, what we say it’s a time in which, OK, it is a massive impact the vLEI have done.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah, it’s good question actually. I think in Europe with the eIDAS program running, I think that’s going to be a big catalyst. And we’ll see how that evolves, these large-scale pilots are going to run for two years. And the actual eIDAS regulation when it comes into place, the governments of the EU will have two years to implement it and get wallets issued.</p>
<p>I think we need to look back at the incentives and companies move quickly when the incentives are big enough. So, there’ll be a number of market proving pilots that happen and the output that comes from those will say, “Hey, this is actually real. It really works. And here’s how much you can save.” When the suppliers of software, that businesses used to run their operations start embedding vLEIs into their businesses just like email, or just like, you know, web pages. It’s going to be completely transformational at that point.</p>
<p>Drummond: Exactly. It really depends on the industry and the use case. I compare the adoption of SSI digital wallets and credentials, there’s a precedent, the adoption of the web, right? It won’t happen everywhere all at once. OK, that’s not how these things ever happen. Right? It’ll be particular, just like you had certain websites, it started out with physics websites, right? And then authors got involved and said, “Hey, this is a great way to publish.” And eventually we had blogs and things like that. And then pretty soon the web is pervasive.</p>
<p>We’re working the same way. There are pockets, as we said that, you know, like the smishing problem.&nbsp; I think one of the important things to keep an eye on is governments are, you know, they’ve inherently been in the identity industry. They always are, because they’re foundational issuers of identity. And some governments, forward leaning governments that have gone straight, or are seeing the benefits have already moved into. One of the ones I’m closest to here in Seattle, is the province of British Columbia in Canada, which already has a digital wallet that’s all based on open-source code that’s in market and they’re starting to issue credentials to British Columbia citizens. And they’re already using vLEIs for organisations.</p>
<p>Another of my most favourite example is the small but very influential country of Bhutan, which has basically said they just adopted a National Digital Identity Act, implementing or mandating a self-sovereign identity infrastructure for the whole country. And that will require LEIs for every legal entity that is signed up and going to be part of that SSI ecosystem. Every organisation, every bank, travel agency, grocery store, it doesn’t matter, if you’re in the Bhutan SSI ecosystem, as an organisation, you sign up and have to get an LEI and a vLEI to participate in that. So that’s the kind of thing that can really generate large adoption.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, yes, super interesting discussion about vLEIs and the state of the self-sovereign entity. I’ll ask you a final question for both of you. For all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Andy: I think that one would be to get up to speed on vLEIs and verifiable credentials, generally. Not to worry too much about the technology under the skin and keys and encryption and DIDs and so on. But to understand the business implications of digitising processes that they haven’t been able to digitise so far, and the benefits to them of doing that.</p>
<p>There’s a significant competitive advantage to a business, to digitise processes that a vLEI will enable you to do. And the companies that do that soonest, or a bank, for example, if a bank can onboard a corporate customer in 10 seconds, instead of 10 months, they’re going to have a massive, massive advantage competitively against the other banks in the market. So that’s where the prize is. So, they need to understand the implications.</p>
<p>And generally, I think, what would be the word, get into the program. That’s probably not the right way of saying it, but it’s about understanding what is coming down the line. And if they don’t move fast, then somebody else will out compete them very, very quickly. It’s a bit like the early days of the web, get online, get digitised and if you’re not, you’re not in the game.</p>
<p>Drummond: Yeah, I think we clearly saw with the web, those companies that got a website early and started to have a digital presence, they significantly expanded. In some cases, they completely dominated new industries, because they went fast.</p>
<p>I’m going to provide a very, very concrete step. If your organisation doesn’t have an LEI today, just a regular LEI, just go check out the GLEIF website. You’re going to find very easily how you can get one and go through that process. It doesn’t necessarily take very long, but it will educate you about that. And then ask your LEI issuer, whoever you choose, “Are you issuing vLEIs? When will you be issuing it? Educate me about that.” And you know, just start to climb the path.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, very actionable. Thank you very much, both Drummond and Andrew. It was a fascinating conversation with such experts in this topic. So finally, tell us if someone would like to follow you or continue this conversation with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Drummond: For me, yeah, @drummondreed on X. It’s the first time I’ve ever had to say that on a podcast, and it just doesn’t sound like the same.</p>
<p>Andy: Does that still exist?</p>
<p>Drummond: Yeah, I’m really seriously worried about it. I, you know, I’m finding it degrading and I’m not sure how much longer I’m going to use it. Or Drummond.Reed@GenDigital.com. You can contact me via email too.</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah. And I’m Andrew.Tobin@GenDigital.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: And are you at X, formerly known as Twitter?</p>
<p>Andy: I am but I’m broadcast only because it’s just too much hard work. LinkedIn is kind of interesting. You can find me on LinkedIn as well. I write on the topic of digital identity and verifiable credentials and eIDAS quite frequently and I know Drummond does as well.</p>
<p>Drummond: Yeah, yeah, we do. And I’m more and more paying attention to LinkedIn that way.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Again, thank you very much for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Andy: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Drummond: Thank you, Oscar. You bet.</p>

 Metadium Version 0.10.0.testnet Upgrade <p>Dear Metadium Community,</p><p>The Bokbunja hard fork and Metadium Version m0.10.0.testnet upgrade will be implemented in the testnet. We are pleased to unveil the intricate details and enhancements they will bring to the Metadium network this&nbsp;time.</p> Testnet Hard&nbsp;Fork   Expected date of implementation: 2023–09–26 12pm KST (2023–09–26 03:00:00&nbsp;+UTC)  Block number: #44671396   Details   m0.10.0.testnet: to apply Bokbunja hardfork to METADIUM&nbsp;TESTNET  Please note that this update is ONLY MANDATORY for Gmet TESTNET&nbsp;nodes.  This release enables the Bokbunja hardfork in fixed block #44671396 on the METADIUM&nbsp;TESTNET.  The expected date for this transition is 2023–09–26 03:00:00&nbsp;+UTC.  Gmet m.0.10.0.testnet is a scheduled feature release containing several significant improvements and new features to METADIUM&nbsp;TESTNET:   1. The Bokbunja hard fork will be implemented at block #44671396 on the Metadium&nbsp;testnet.   Introduction of a fee delegation function and related RPC API, allowing users to delegate transaction fees to another&nbsp;account.  To verify the block miner’s signature, the verification nodes use the miner’s public key registered in the governance contract.  To decentralize mining, the miner selection strategy has been changed to use etcd lockable&nbsp;tokens.   2. New features added to&nbsp;Gmet.   Implementation of Verifiable Random Function (VRF) verification functionalities through pre-compiled contracts, offering a more secure and transparent method of generating random numbers on the blockchain.  Added ‘eth_getReceiptsByHash’ JSON-RPC API. Returns all the transaction receipts for the given block&nbsp;hash.  Added to Gmet CLI flags to allow changing the value of ‘triesInMemory’  Changed to create blocks by sorting transactions in descending order of gas&nbsp;price  Increased the default value of ‘TxLookupLimit’ flag from 2350000 to&nbsp;31536000  Ethereum Ploitari release(v1.10.17) was&nbsp;applied  Ethereum Sharblu release(v1.10.18) was&nbsp;applied  Block interval is fixed to 2&nbsp;seconds.  Network members can make more types of decisions through improved governance contracts.   3. Other bugfix and&nbsp;upgrades   Improved gmet.sh&nbsp;script  Improved performance using go&nbsp;routines  Upgraded etcd library version&nbsp;(v3.5.2)  Changed websocket default&nbsp;port  Changed the OS version used for ‘docker-build’ to Ubuntu&nbsp;20.04  Upgraded golangci-lint library version&nbsp;(v1.49)  Changed the ‘Fee’ data type of `ExecutionResult,` which receives EVM execution results, to BigInt to prevent overflow.  To prevent integer overflow, some variables have been changed to&nbsp;BigInt.  Fixed issue related to ‘make&nbsp;test’  Fixed issue with coinbase&nbsp;setup  <p>Metadium looks forward to ushering in a new era of efficiency, security, and growth within the ecosystem, solidifying its position as a pioneer in the blockchain industry.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요, 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>복분자 하드포크(Bokbunja Hard Fork) 및 Metadium Version m0.10.0.testnet 업그레이드가 Testnet에 적용될 예정입니다. 메타디움 네트워크에 반영될 업그레이드 세부사항을&nbsp;공개합니다.</p> Testnet Hard&nbsp;Fork   일정: 2023년 9월 26일 오후 12시 KST 예정 (2023–09–26 03:00:00&nbsp;+UTC)  블록 넘버: #44671396   세부사항   m0.10.0.testnet: METADIUM TESTNET에 복분자 하드포크를&nbsp;적용합니다.  해당 업데이트는 Gmet TESTNET 노드에만 필수적으로&nbsp;적용됩니다.  이 릴리즈는 METADIUM TESTNET의 고정된 블록 #44671396에서 복분자 하드포크를&nbsp;활성화합니다.  예상 일자는 2023년 09월 26일 03:00:00 +UTC&nbsp;입니다.

<p>In her CoD Summit 2023 presentation, Fission co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka discusses the need for location-independent compute, and how content addressing and open protocols are making it possible.</p> We're Living in a Server-Centric World <p>Since the invention of the LAMP stack in the '90s, we've been working with a server-centric model. It has led to developers specializing in front-end, back-end, DevOps, Kubernetes, Docker, and more. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become more difficult to train and maintain this complex system.</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft, and Google control the majority of data centers, which has led to further centralization. In places like South America, Central America, and Africa, the lack of compute infrastructure means that users in these areas have less access to resources.</p><p>IoT, compute over data, and LLMs cannot work long-term if we keep sending data to a small number of data centers. It's an overwhelming, massive amount of data. &nbsp;</p><p>We have to bring compute to where the data is produced, closer to the user.</p> Building a New Compute Stack <p>We know we need location-independent compute and data, but to do this in production, you first need location-independent auth.</p><p>A capability-based model like <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-ucan-decentralize-auth/">UCAN</a> removes the authorization server, simplifying permissions handling. We no longer need pristine APIs for everything and can pass around auth as necessary.</p><p>The direction and the layout of the requests become the flow of authority.</p><p>Not only is it more efficient and energy-saving, but it's also more resilient because there is no central server that can bring the rest of the network down if it goes offline.</p><p>Now that auth is handled, we can solve for location-independent compute.</p><p>We started with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> because you can write in any language you want, and it runs anywhere and deterministically. </p><p>When running a computation, we take arguments and apply them to a Wasm function. This outputs a <a href="https://proto.school/content-addressing/04">CID</a> or content identifier. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. </p><p>This means we can compute over that content-addressed data without needing a centralized server! &nbsp;</p><p>We can roll all of this and a scheduler up into a task and run it, and when it executes, it returns a receipt. The receipt includes pure values (EX: 1 + 1 = 2), effects (something you want to happen next that needs to take resources off the network, like sending an email), and metadata.</p> Input Addressing <p>With content addressing, we take data, hash it, and use that data as the key value. </p><p>Here, we're introducing input addressing, where we get a receipt as the value, and the input is the hash of the instruction (the description of what you want to have run).</p><p>Instead of validating with a hash, we validate with a receipt, making it fully deterministic!</p><p>Finally, we use an invocation (a signature) and build a workflow (by authorizing multiple computation requests at once). </p> Benefits of Wasm Compute   The distributed runtime can decide the most efficient way to run tasks in the network by handling the matchmaking for the user.  The more returned receipts, the fewer computations we'll need to run. We can skip steps and reuse receipts because they've been deterministically run already. &nbsp;  If the system crashes, you can always pick up where you left off by following the CID trail.  Reverse lookup allows the user to check if a certain input ID has been entered. If it has, they can retrieve the computed result without running the task again.

 What is Open-World Compute? <p>Serverless computing has been promised as the next big thing™ in computing. There are many advantages: not needing to build and manage complex backend code, and granular billing per invocation means that you only pay for what you use. Many of these systems have adopted workflow systems (e.g., AWS Step Functions, GitHub Actions) on top of batch requests. Unfortunately, the systems to date have serious limitations: they’re locked into cumbersome proprietary APIs, have a finite number of integrations, and often don’t handle partial failure elegantly (e.g., can leave a database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong in another step). Furthermore, many of the compute offerings today lock developers into an ecosystem, making it difficult to switch to other solutions in the future.</p><p>A more principled generation of workflow systems has developed to address some of these problems. They typically depend on the developer writing their code “correctly” and not doing things that make their code repeat work on multiple calls. This doesn’t play well with many common functionalities: what about when developers want to access time or random numbers? They also often don’t handle rollback out of the box. In short: they’re closed systems that depend on the programmer working hard to ensure that abstract properties are respected. This is a real problem: networks can (and do!) fail. Developers write buggy code (we all do it). It’s an extremely high bar.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, brings content-addressed computation to IPFS using Wasm, PKI, and capabilities. IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability. </p><p>IPVM (and Homestar) takes a different approach. Instead of depending on the developer to be careful, it restricts their programming environment. For example, WebAssembly (Wasm) can be limited to deterministic computation: any code that you compile to Wasm has to have these properties that we want by definition. IPVM also acknowledges that failure happens and pulls from recent <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/a-m-b-r-o-s-i-a-providing-performant-virtual-resiliency-for-distributed-applications/">research</a> about hiding that as much as possible by leveraging content addressing and Wasm.</p><p>Fission's vision for open-world compute is highly usable and collaborative. We want an open, multitier system that runs everywhere, connects all the world's users and services, and is substantially better than Web 2.0. Anyone will be able to broadcast a task type on the network, and it will be automatically usable without having to fork the project or ask permission.</p> Key Characteristics <p>There are several key characteristics we're considering as we build IPVM. As mentioned earlier, idempotence and determinism are key to reliable computing, but they can be challenging to understand and implement. </p><p>Wasm allows developers to bring their own language, run computations on a server, in their browser, or even on their phone, and run them in a deterministic environment so that the same inputs always produce the same outputs. </p><p>Furthermore, when we run computations with CIDs, the results output more CIDs. The CIDs do not get recomputed and reproduced each time we run them - they are essentially cached in IPFS. When someone applies that same input, it simply calls back that cached result. No new records are being created, making it idempotent. This comes for free on Merklized data, but we can also Merklize data that's read from anywhere and cache it for later use. </p><p>While pure computation is useful for many applications, you still need mutability in many cases. There are queries (reads) and pure computations, and these can go back and forth as long as we end with mutation. Because we are not giving users the ability to define the order of execution, we can reorder computation so that the mutations happen at the end.</p><p>If we bring these three properties together - determinism, idempotency, and purity, we can achieve virtual resiliency. This gives the developer peace of mind, knowing that, eventually, the computations will work no matter what crashes or curveballs are thrown at the system.</p><p>We also want replayability. The cached computations, or receipts, never have to be re-run. And when we need to make non-deterministic requests or work with time of day or random, instead of losing out on the guarantees of deterministic compute and having to use client libraries, the node can call itself, store the information, and run the RPC call. Then if we run it again, we can have replayability because those previous computations were already saved. This creates a "run once, never run again" system, making it more efficient and scalable. Using capabilities based on UCAN, we can determine who can run different computations. Perhaps one job is better for Bacalhau, another for Fastly, etc. Maybe you only want computation to happen on a cluster of machines that you and your friends run and no others. We let IPVM handle the matchmaking and authorization checking so that different systems can work together to complete the job.</p><p>And the best part is this is all happening behind the scenes! The developer doesn't need to set any of this up. 👍</p> Compute over Data Summit 2023 Presentation <p>Fission Staff Research Engineer <a href="https://github.com/zeeshanlakhani">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> gave a presentation on IPVM and his work on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">Homestar</a> implementation at the Compute Over Data Summit.

  <p>Passwords have gotten a lot of attention lately. Why? Because they pose a double threat with hackers and users. According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">Verizon 2023 DBIR</a>, 86% of breaches involve stolen, weak, or default passwords. Of those breaches, 74% involve the human element, which includes social engineering attacks, errors, or misuse.</p>

<p>Passwords were never the ideal security solution for the modern, interconnected world. Much of what we do today is online — work, school, citizen services, shopping, and more. And what's the first thing users are hit with every time? The dreaded username and password prompt before the journey can continue.</p>

<p>Furthering the problem is the fact that the average internet user has <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/blog/global-password-health-score-report-2022">240 online accounts</a> that require a password. Are we really expected to have a unique password to remember for each account? Hackers know all too well the answer is no, making passwords a ripe opportunity for hackers but a significant threat to everyone else.</p>

<p>Some of the challenges passwords create for users are directly responsible for their security shortcomings, and include:</p>

<p>Complexity: Many systems require complex passwords, which make them more difficult to crack — and more difficult to remember. As a result, users rarely change their passwords — if credentials are scraped in a data breach, they may be exploited again and again.</p>

<p>Reuse: Consumers have numerous online accounts, and many people use the same passwords again and again. This means that if one account has been compromised, attackers may have access to multiple accounts.</p>

<p>Password resets: When users forget their passwords, they must endure a time-consuming reset process, resulting in lost productivity, account lockout, and high rates of abandonment. The fact that most password reset requests send a link to a user's email address makes them vulnerable to interception.</p>

 How passwords are stolen 

<p>Attackers have a range of tools at their disposal, some of which have been around for years and some that are emerging. In particular, the use of generative AI has the potential to crack passwords and develop new methods of attack far faster than humans ever could.</p>

  Social engineering and phishing 
 <p>Social engineering techniques or phishing attacks often trick users into revealing their passwords through fake emails, websites, text messages, and phone calls, and it is becoming difficult to distinguish fake messages from legitimate ones. Business email compromise, for example, involves impersonating executives within an organization to convince employees that the email is legitimate and to follow its instructions, which may include exposing intellectual property and other sensitive data.</p>

  Brute-force attacks 
 <p>In a brute-force attack, attackers systematically try all possible combinations of passwords until they find the correct one. With the tools and software programs available today, including generative AI, sophisticated attackers can rapidly attempt billions of password combinations, making weak passwords especially vulnerable.</p>

  Credential stuffing attacks 
 <p>Attackers take advantage of people who reuse passwords across multiple accounts by using stolen credentials to gain unauthorized access to other accounts. This type of attack relies on the fact that many users — half, according to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/exclusive-most-people-still-make-up-their-own-passwords-and-reuse-them">TechRadar</a> — use the same password for multiple accounts.</p>

  MFA prompt bombing 
 <p>Not even multi-factor authentication (MFA) is immune to attacks. One of the most sophisticated authentication attacks over the last couple of years is known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>. This social engineering attack relies on inattentive users absentmindedly approving mobile push notifications set off by bad actors, allowing the attackers to essentially defeat MFA.</p>

  Malware 
 <p>There are several types of malware created specifically to steal usernames and passwords along with other sensitive information. Keyloggers, for example, record a victim's keystrokes so the attacker can steal login credentials. If clipboard hijacking malware is installed on a user's device, it can monitor the clipboard for sensitive information, which it sends to the attacker. And a credential harvester is a malicious extension to a website or application — once installed it records any information users enter during the login process.</p>

  Generative AI 
 <p>Attackers have begun training AI engines to crack passwords, perform<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover"> account takeover</a> (ATO), and develop and automate new malware. They can use generative AI to create more sophisticated and targeted phishing attacks that appear far more convincing than those of the past.</p>

<p>Because generative AI makes it much easier to impersonate others, malicious actors are using it to deliver attacks known as “deepfakes” and create synthetic identities. Synthetic identities combine a real identifier, such as a Social Security number or date of birth, with falsified personal information (name, contact information) to create a new, fictitious identity. These fake identities can be used to apply for and obtain loans and credit cards, open accounts, or submit false claims for unemployment or medical care.</p>

 It's time to go passwordless 

<p>There are multiple ways to make it harder to steal passwords, but the only way to eliminate the threat completely is to eliminate passwords. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> removes the need for a password and minimizes the threats related to credential-based attacks, including <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> (ATO), fraud, and data breaches. Not only are data breaches costly in the short term, but they can have long-term consequences. A recent survey, for example, showed that <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/11/26/how-consumers-feel-about-retail-data-breaches/">78% of Americans</a> are wary about doing business with a retailer that has experienced a breach.</p>

<p>By going passwordless you not only get better security but you can also increase workforce productivity and customer satisfaction by removing access barriers to systems and online services. The result? A secure business with happy users and less time and money spent on helpdesk support.</p>

 How to go passwordless 

<p>When it comes to passwordless, one size does not fit all. That's true for the enterprises that implement passwordless and it's true for users — people want choices. No matter where you are on your passwordless journey, there are steps you can take today to eliminate passwords.</p>

  Offer a passwordless factor: Various methods can be used as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) factor, such as push notification, one time passcode (OTP), or emailed magic links. A passwordless factor reduces friction and improves on the security of a standard login, but cannot be characterized as passwordless because it relies on usernames and passwords. A passwordless factor is a great choice for applications where passwords cannot be eliminated completely. Consumer-facing sites and applications may offer several approaches, depending on their customers' devices and preferences. 
	 Provide a passwordless experience: The password is still present for those legacy apps that require it, but it's handled securely in the background, so users don't have to enter or even see it. This experience further reduces friction in MFA and improves security. Since the user doesn't interact with a password, you eliminate many of the risks associated with social engineering and generative artificial intelligence (AI) that can compromise something that users know — their passwords. 
	 Deliver complete passwordless: In this scenario, authentication occurs without the use of passwords. Instead, users can employ biometrics and private-key cryptography. Passkeys give users a simple and secure way to sign in without passwords by relying on Face ID or Touch ID. Since the user doesn't have a password — no password even exists — you eliminate all of its security risks and usability issues. Apple, Google, and Microsoft — the makers of so many popular devices, browsers, and operating systems — have rolled out support for the FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard and passkeys, making it even easier to adopt passwordless authentication. 
 <p>From better security to reduced costs and increased revenues, the elimination of passwords should be a board-level priority for every organization.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Passwords have been around for a long time, so long that many of us have just accepted them as part of everyday life. This wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing — if not for a history of password misuse leading to disaster for both end users and organizations alike. While people are aware of the issue, with <a href="https://www.security.org/resources/online-password-strategies/">less than half of Americans</a> having confidence that their passwords are secure, familiarity has led to indifference: breaches just happen, they’ll be&nbsp; headline news for a few days, and then they’ll disappear. The solution is not to keep reminding people to follow good password practices and maintain cybersecurity vigilance; it doesn’t work. The solution is to get rid of passwords and go passwordless.</p>
<p><a href="https://download.pingidentity.com/public/assets/misc/en/3637-workforce-survey-passwordless-future.pdf">65% of IT leaders</a> reported that their organizations were likely if not certain to adopt passwordless security in the near future. There are a multitude of reasons to do so, not the least of which being reducing security costs, the need for support, and the time employees spend logging in to each different system everyday. It is estimated that the average employee has over <a href="https://lp-cdn.lastpass.com/lporcamedia/document-library/lastpass/pdf/en/LastPass-Enterprise-The-Password-Expose-Ebook-v2.pdf">190 different logins</a> and can spend <a href="https://download.pingidentity.com/public/assets/misc/en/3637-workforce-survey-passwordless-future.pdf">28 minutes per day</a> just getting into their accounts. So, once you’ve decided to switch your organization to passwordless login how do you go about implementing it?</p>
<p>There are a variety of options for creating passwordless login for your organization, including badges, fobs, USB devices, and tokens. A common and inexpensive option offering a pseudo-passwordless experience is password managers. While “passwords” or digital keys are still created for services like these, they are often hidden from the end user, and instead tied to the badge, fob, or other object the user possesses or their password manager account. This is, typically, more secure, as the object or password manager tends to create very complex passwords, which being unknown to the user protects them from phishing.</p>
<p>While these options work very well for some organizations, there are some limiting factors. For example, anything physical like badges or fobs can be misplaced or stolen, and password managers still rely on an account with a master password.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we believe the better option is verifiable credentials. These credentials can be thought of as similar to the physical-object approach in that they are stored with the end user in an app on a mobile device; but unlike badges or fobs, these app-based credentials can be biometrically bound to the user through the app and the phone.</p>
<p>The credential completely removes the need for any kind of password, instead relying on secure connections created through verifying credentials. When credentials are presented for verification, they provide mutual cryptographic authentication: The user proves they are the credential holder when contacting their employer, and their employer, in their response, proves that they are in fact the user’s employer. See <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">A Beginner’s Guide to Decentralized Identity</a> for a deeper explanation of how this works.</p>
<p>The net result is a powerful way to enable passwordless login, one that has multiple defenses against fraud, while also providing the capacity for much richer interaction. And verifiable credentials can be for more than just employees and employers, any organization could implement them for customers, citizens, or anyone that wants to interact with their systems. No more passwords, no more multi- factor authentication, no more captchas (which AI can now defeat), no more recovery questions, or helpline calls; instead, you have quick, frictionless authentication, which in a business context can be easily configured to orchestrate identity and access management to hundreds of cloud-based applications, and save a lot of time and money. To see how this works in practice, watch our demonstration of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ">Proven Finance</a> to see how a verifiable credential can change the way you access your bank account or financial institution.</p>
<p>With over <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/privacy/password-statistics">24 billion passwords</a> exposed by hackers in 2022, your organization can’t afford to put implementing a better solution on the back burner.

<p>In our blog series, we’ve debunked the following observability myths so far:</p>



 
 Part 1:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/debunking-observability-myths-part-1-why-you-cant-skip-monitoring-and-rely-only-on-logs/">You can skip monitoring and rely solely on logs</a> 



 Part 2:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/debunking-observability-myths-part-2-why-observability-is-important-for-everyone-not-just-sres/">Observability is built exclusively for SREs</a> 



 Part 3:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/debunking-observability-myths-part-3-why-observability-works-in-every-environment-not-just-large-scale-systems/">Observability is only relevant and beneficial for large-scale systems or complex architectures</a> 



 Part 4: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/debunking-observability-myths-part-4-observability-is-always-expensive/">Observability is always expensive</a> 
 



<p>In this post, we’ll tackle another fallacy that limits the potential of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a>—that you can create an observable system without observability driven by automation.</p>



 Why is this a myth? 



<p>The notion that you can create an observable system without observability-driven automation is a myth because it underestimates the vital role observability-driven automation plays in modern IT operations.</p>



<p>In today’s complex and dynamic environments, traditional manual approaches fall short in delivering the agility, accuracy and scalability demanded by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/site-reliability-engineering">site reliability engineering (SRE)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> practices.</p>



<p>Observability-driven automation leverages real-time insights from monitoring and telemetry data to inform <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/intelligent-automation">intelligent automation</a> processes. This synergy enables teams to detect anomalies, predict issues and respond proactively, ensuring continuous service availability and reliability. By automating incident responses, resource scaling and configuration adjustments, organizations can streamline operations, reduce human error and achieve the rapid iteration and deployment essential to SRE and DevOps philosophies.</p>



 Fact: Automation plays a crucial role in observability (and in any modern IT organization) 



<p>High-performing IT departments tend to release software more frequently, and trying to keep up manually is neither sustainable nor scalable. The variety of technology in use also means you won’t always have a subject matter expert (SME) on hand to assist in the setup and configuration of new applications. The fact is, automated setup and installation eliminates manual errors, reduces deployment time and improves consistency across different environments.</p>



<p>Automation streamlines the root-cause analysis process with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a> algorithms, anomaly detection techniques and predictive analytics, and it helps identify patterns and anomalies that human operators might miss. Automated analysis reduces the time required to pinpoint the root cause and improves the accuracy of detection, leading to faster resolution times. The following are some benefits provided by automation:</p>



 
 Real-time insights: Many observation and monitoring tasks require real-time analysis to detect issues and respond promptly. Manual observation cannot match the speed and accuracy of automated systems in identifying anomalies and performance degradation in real-time. 



 Reduced human error: Manual observation introduces a higher risk of human error. Observing and interpreting data manually can lead to inconsistencies and oversight, potentially causing critical issues to be overlooked. 



 Cost-effectiveness: Manual observation may require dedicated personnel, leading to increased labor costs. Automation, once set up, can operate continuously and efficiently without incurring additional human resource expenses. 



 Historical data and trends: Automated systems can efficiently store and analyze historical data, enabling trend analysis and pattern recognition. This information is vital for capacity planning and performance optimization. 



 Integrations: Automation allows for easy integration with various tools and platforms, facilitating a more comprehensive and cohesive observation ecosystem. This level of integration is challenging to achieve through manual efforts. 
 



 IBM’s approach to enterprise observability 



<p>IBM’s observability solution, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana</a>, is purpose-built for cloud-native and designed to automatically and continuously provide high-fidelity data—one-second granularity and end-to-end traces—with the context of logical and physical dependencies across mobile, web, applications and infrastructure. </p>



<p>Our customers have been able to achieve tangible results using real-time observability.</p>



<p>“Our team is able to dedicate more time towards new features and roadmap planning instead of smashing bugs all day.” – Eddie Castillo, Head of Marketing, ExaVault Inc.</p>



<p>The team also noted that since <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/exavault-inc">ExaVault started using Instana</a>, the mean time to resolution (MTTR) for customer-impacting bugs dropped by 56.6%. In addition, the platform’s slowdowns and downtime decreased substantially. It was at 99.51% uptime before, and it’s now at 99.99%. “We’re accomplishing the goal that we set out to do,” Fite explains. “The reason we were able to do that is we had better visibility into our problems.”</p>



<p>“We love how easy it is to deploy and maintain the agent. There’s no operational overhead” &nbsp;–Grégory Schiano, Chief Technical Officer, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/altissia">Altissia</a></p>



<p>If you want to enhance your observability practices with full-stack visibility and the ability to monitor your cloud dependencies in real-time, we invite you to request a demo.</p>

<p>Holochain’s 0.1.x series has a new release which fixes some breaking changes in a well-known dependency called <code>serde</code>. The Launcher has a new release for the unstable Holochain 0.2.1 release as well. After those release notes, I’ll give an update on the state of Holochain 0.2.x.</p><p>But first! A reminder about the upcoming dev training.</p> Holochain Developer Training Oct 2023 <p>In case you missed it, we’re co-hosting another app dev training course with our education partner Mythosthesia, online, from 2 to 7 October. This is a very hands-on, very cooperative, and fairly intensive crash course on hApp development, led by Marcus Philips, a veteran of world-class dev school Hack Reactor, and Guillem Cordoba, a knowledgeable and friendly hApp developer. Registrations are closing very soon, so <a href="https://www.holochain.org/holochain-developer-training-oct-2023/?ref=blog.holochain.org">apply now</a> so we can guide you through the intake process and get you prepared to take the course! If the registration cost is a challenge for you, please reach out to us on Discord — there are scholarships available.</p> Holochain 0.1.6: Fix <code>serde</code> issue <p>Release date: 28 August 2023<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.x</p><p>Recently the maintainers of <code>serde</code>, a crate that provides support for serialising and deserialising Rust types, accidentally introduced a breaking change to the way enums are serialised. Our core dev team has decided to pin <code>serde</code> at an earlier version to avoid that change from breaking our APIs as well. (We’ll be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2675?ref=blog.holochain.org">introducing</a> that breaking change in the 0.3.x series.)</p><p>This issue isn’t likely to affect you unless you had run <code>cargo update</code> on your hApp in the time window between the change in <code>serde</code> and the release of HDI 0.1.4 and HDK 0.2.4 (both from the Holochain 0.1.6 release). If this is the case, you can run <code>nix flake update</code> on your project and then run <code>cargo update</code> again.</p><p>We discovered and patched the issue in the scaffolding templates pretty quickly after discovering the issue, so if you’ve used the scaffolding tool to generate a zome you’re probably safe.</p><p>Here are the full release notes:</p>  Maintenance: Pin <code>serde</code> to 1.0.166 to roll back a breaking change to enum serialisation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2674?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2674</a>)  Maintenance: Update <code>lair</code> to 0.3.0, which introduced no substantial changes but pinned <code>serde_derive</code> to 1.0.166. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2668?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2668</a>)  Removed: A compile-time feature to include support for <code>tx5</code>, Holochain’s new WebRTC-based networking protocol, has been removed.   Launcher 0.11.0: Holochain 0.2.1 support, new DevHub <p>Note: This Launcher is bundled with an unstable Holochain version. For those of you who are testing and deploying hApps at small scale, this is an opportunity to try your hApp with Holochain 0.2 and use the newest App Store and DevHub.</p><p>What’s new about these two features? Let’s back up a bit and talk about what DevHub is first. It’s a package manager hApp that lets devs distribute zomes, DNAs, hApps, and UIs. It comes preinstalled in the Launcher and powers both the App Store feature and the DevHub UI. And in the future it will be integrated into the Holo suite to allow ‘hApp managers’ — either developers or people forking a hApp for their group’s personal use — to get their hApps onto HoloPorts.</p><p>The original DevHub had a few DNAs that worked together as one to provide all package data — both blobs and metadata such as manifests. Everyone who installed the Launcher ran this DNA, which meant everyone had to store app packages — and in a small DHT where everyone stored everything, that meant that you had to wait until someone had gossiped a package or its metadata to you before you could install an app. This caused long load times and failures, making it seem like there were no hApps in the store and then making it seem hApps couldn’t be downloaded.</p><p>The new DevHub is broken into two hApps with multiple DNAs:</p>  The original DevHub DNA(s) live in one hApp, which is only activated if you turn on the ‘developer mode’ switch in the Launcher settings.  An App Store DNA which only contains manifest files for hApps deemed ready for public use (sort of like a release tag on GitHub) is in another hApp, which is activated for all users.  A portal DNA is bundled with both of the above hApps, and it handles communication between the two of them.  <p>If a peer belongs to the DevHub DHT, they’ll advertise that fact on the portal DHT. You could call them a package host, because they’re participating in the storage of package blobs. Anyone who wants to download a package can look up that list of hosts, choose a random one, and ask it for the package data.</p><p>This is a great example of a multi-DNA architecture that breaks up responsibility according to needs, abilities, and roles in the community. The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/portal-dna?ref=blog.holochain.org">portal DNA</a> is a generic DNA that you can drop into your hApp to provide the bridging between a DHT of hosts and a DHT of clients. In the future, Holochain will support ‘deferred DNA provisioning’ which will eliminate the need to split this sort of functionality into two separate hApps, allowing you to bundle the host DNA and only activate it for those who want to be hosts.</p><p>There are a few things to keep in mind:</p>  This release is bundled with Holochain 0.2.1, which is unstable.  Because of an upgrade to the Lair keystore, installing this Launcher will be similar to a factory reset. You’ll need to reinstall hApps. (This is a breaking change, not a bug.)  hApps may be visible in the App Store, but installation will fail if there are no available DevHub peers that are storing the requested package. This isn’t a bug but a side effect of small DHTs. We’re testing the deployment of persistent DevHub and App Store nodes on the Holo network, and that will help with this issue in the near future.  There are a few known issues, which you can read about in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.11.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a>.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.11.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">Download Launcher 0.11.0 (unstable) from GitHub.</a></p> Holochain 0.2 progress: building comprehensive diagnostic capacities <p>tl;dr: While Holochain 0.2 is working just fine for hApps used by small groups of people, we’re seeing bottlenecks when networks and their data loads grow. We’re nearing a stable 0.2.2 release which tackles some of the biggest performance issues, but further improvements will still come after that point.</p><p>As a developer, you’ve probably had the experience of polishing up your application, running it through CI tests one more time (all green!), cutting a release, and… getting a bug report from someone who hit some obscure corner of your code or tried to use it in OS or networking conditions you’d never dreamed of. Even the most well-tested code is vulnerable to the kind of creative challenges the real world likes to throw at it.</p><p>Holochain’s CI test suite has checks for performance regressions — it generally has to pass a certain level of responsiveness before a release can be cut. These tests exercise the conductor fairly aggressively. Even still, when we released it to the world, it struggled to keep up with real-world usage scenarios, as my colleague <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">Eric wrote about recently</a>.</p><p>Why did this happen? Simple: the real world is messy. It’s hard to write tests that anticipate the issues you’ll see out there. Many of them will be ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory?ref=blog.holochain.org">black swans</a>’ — situations that are inherently impossible to predict. For example, our automated tests didn’t anticipate the performance issues that could happen when network communication is thin and unreliable.</p><p>And that, of course, is exactly the kind of situation you encounter in the real world. It turned out that, in large networks with lots of data, network latency and bandwidth caused gossip bottlenecks at unexpected moments. Aborted and restarted gossip sessions were creating race conditions, causing network connection pool saturations that took a while to clear out.</p><p>So of course the core devs are tackling these specific bottlenecks. But they’re also building their capacity to respond to future issues of this kind. You can’t predict the next black swan, but you can work on your ability to respond to the unexpected. This is happening in two ways:</p>  Application architecture is getting streamlined so that it’s easier to reason about the flow of control and data through a node. This will make it possible to find out exactly what’s happening during a bottleneck, capture the inputs, outputs, and system state, and replay the scenario.  As real-world applications encounter issues, the applications and the scenarios that cause the issues will be integrated into our CI suite to catch similar issues in the future.  <p>This is just boring engineering stuff — stages two and three in Agile pioneer Kent Beck’s advice to “make it work, make it right, make it fast”. We’ve already made it work, from proof of concept to first stable beta. Holochain now correctly implements a very large portion of its roadmap. The task now is to make it right — which is not about fixing fundamental defects but instead refactoring the code to make it easier to test.</p><p>And that in turn will allow us to make it fast. Holochain is a framework for building everyday apps that serve real human needs through good times and bad. In order to do this, it needs to feel good to use. In ideal situations Holochain already feels fast enough — we’ve already been using hApps like <a href="https://acorn.software/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Acorn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/kando?ref=blog.holochain.org">KanDo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">TalkingStickies</a> for months in our daily work. Now it’s time to make it work well in all those non-ideal situations.</p><p>The core devs have already made a lot of progress. We’re anticipating a release of 0.2.2 soon, which we’ll declare the next stable release after 0.1.6. It will include fixes for a zome call timeout issue, along with various improvements they’ve already made to the networking layer. The first release candidate is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.2-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">already cut</a>, and our next step is to stress-test it with a few flagship apps before deciding if it’s ready. 0.2.2 won’t fix all possible performance issues, but it will be an incremental-yet-noticeable improvement.</p><p>You can hear Eric and the core devs talk more about our findings and plans in the recording of our first Developer AMA:</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@thisisengineering?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> ThisisEngineering RAEng</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/LTrGLoaQBWI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

Its testnet is live now, mainnet soon, and incentives program soon&nbsp;after.</p> 1. Motivation <blockquote>Tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming. — David&nbsp;Bowie</blockquote><p>Accurate predictions are valuable. With them, one can take action and create value. Conversely, inaccurate predictions can be problematic. Predictions have value because they’re the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">final step in a data supply chain</a>, right before action is taken by the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Prediction feeds are a stream of predictions for a given time series. This could be predicting the price of ETH every 5 minutes, or the sea temperature daily. A feed may be binary, i.e. whether a time series changes up or down: ↑↓↓↓↑↓↑↑. Accurate prediction feeds are valuable.</p><p>Alas, accurate predictions are *hard*. Worse, typical prediction feeds have no accountability on accuracy. If the weatherman says “no rain for today” and then it rains, a farmer could get stuck in the mud, wrecking a portion of his crops. The weatherman doesn’t feel the impact of wrong predictions, but the farmers sure&nbsp;care!</p><p>Imagine if there was accountability. Accuracy would go up; the farmer would be stuck less. Imagine accountable prediction feeds for not only for rain, but also wind, sea temperature, road congestion, train delays, ETH prices, NVID prices, housing prices, and more. Imagine tens of thousands of prediction feeds with accountable accuracy. Imagine them globally distributed, and censorship resistant. Imagine accuracy improving with&nbsp;time.</p><p>This is the dream, that became a goal, that got built. This is Ocean Predictoor.</p> 2. Introduction to Predictoor <blockquote>Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin. — A&nbsp;mother</blockquote> 2.1 What is Predictoor? <p>Ocean Predictoor is a dapp and a stack for prediction feeds. It has accountability for accuracy, via staking. It’s globally distributed and censorship-resistant, by being on-chain. We expect its accuracy to improve over time, due to its incentive structure. Its first use case is DeFi token prediction because users can close the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">data value-creation loop</a> quickly to make tangible&nbsp;$.</p>Conceptual overview of Predictoor<p>Prediction feeds are crowd-sourced. “Predictoor” agents submit individual predictions and stake on them. They make money when they’re correct and lose money when not. This drives accurate prediction feeds, because only accurate predictoors will be making $ and sticking&nbsp;around.</p><p>“Trader” agents buy aggregate predictions, then use them to take action like buying or selling. The more accurate the predictions, the more easily they make $, the longer they stick around to keep buying prediction feeds from trading&nbsp;profits.</p><p>Predictoor is built on the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/architecture">Ocean Protocol stack</a>, including contracts for <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/datatokens">tokenized data</a> and middleware to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/metadata">cache metadata</a>. To keep predictions private unless paid for, Predictoor uses <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a> privacy-preserving EVM&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The initial dapp is live at <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">predictoor.ai</a>. It’s for up/down predictions of BTC, ETH, and other tokens’ prices. The dapp helps users build a mental model of Predictoor behavior. Predictoors and traders’ main workflow is to do run predicting / trading bots with the help of the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">Py SDK</a>. We have seeded Predictoor with bots that have AI/ML models of accuracy comfortably above 50% — a precondition to make $ trading&nbsp;[0].</p>Screenshot from <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">predictoor.ai</a> 2.2 Predictoor Structure <p>The image below gives an overview of Predictoor structure.</p><p>In the image top left, predictoors, traders, or anyone play with predictoor.ai to build an understanding how predictoor works. One feed is free; the rest are available for purchase. At first, only the free feed is visible. Users can connect their web3 wallet and buy another&nbsp;feed.</p><p>In the image top middle, predictoors graduate to building &amp; deploying Python “Template Predictoor bots” (agents), which submit predictions every 5 minutes. Now, predictoors can see how to make $ from making predictions, with plenty of room to improve AI/ML modeling accuracy and make more&nbsp;$.</p>Overview of Predictoor structure<p>In the image top right, traders graduate from predictoor.ai to building &amp; deploying Python “Template Trader bots” (agents), which grab the latest prediction every 5 minutes, as soon as it’s available, then trade using that prediction (and other info). Now, Traders can see how to make $ from buying predictions, with plenty of room to improve trading strategy and make more&nbsp;$.</p><p>In the image bottom is the Oasis Sapphire chain, with Predictoor feed contracts deployed to it. There’s one contract deployed for each {pair, exchange, timescale} such as {ETH/USDT, Binance,&nbsp;5m}.</p> 2.3 Predictoor Behavior <p>We just covered Predictoor structure. Let’s now layer on some Predictoor behavior, with the help of the image below. We’ll walk through actions by Predictoors and Traders related to predictions for time slot “epoch t+1”, and show how they make&nbsp;$.</p><p>We assume predictions on BTC, and where epoch t ends at 5:00pm, t+1 ends 5:05pm, and t+2 ends 5:10pm. We assume that Traders already purchased a subscription via predictoor.ai, Python, or otherwise. When we discuss an action by a Predictoor or Trader, we recognize that it’s typically executed by their agent&nbsp;(bot).</p><p>Epoch t. This is left 1/3 of the image. It starts at 4:55pm and ends at 5:00pm. Predictoor 1 (pink) predicts that BTC close price for epoch t+1 will be higher (“↑”) than close price for epoch t. He submits a tx to that chain with that prediction, and some OCEAN stake of his choice (higher stake = more confident). Predictoor 2 (dark green) does the same. Predictoor 3 (light green) predicts “↓” and stakes. The chain stores these prediction values, privately.</p>Predictoor Behavior<p>Epoch t+1. The middle 1/3 of the image covers epoch t+1. It starts at 5:00pm and ends at 5:05pm. The BTC Predictoor contract computes the aggregated predicted value (agg_predval) as stake-weighted sum across individual predictions.</p><blockquote>agg_predval = (stake1*predval1 + stake2*predval2 +&nbsp;…) / (stake1 + stake2 +&nbsp;…)</blockquote><p>The contract then makes agg_predval visible to its subscribers. The predicted value is the stake-weighted sum across predictions. Smart traders may take the information and act immediately. A baseline strategy is “if it predicts ↑ then buy; if it predicts ↓ then sell or&nbsp;short”.</p><p>Epoch t+2. This is the right 1/3 of the image. It starts at 5:05pm and ends at 5:10pm. Both traders and trueval agent take action (and, predictoors get&nbsp;paid).</p>  Actions by Traders. Typically, traders exit their position immediately, exactly 5 minutes since they got the 5-minute-ahead prediction and acted [1]. If the prediction feed was accurate enough and trading fees &amp; slippage weren’t too high, then the trader makes money on&nbsp;average.  Actions by Trueval agent; predictoors get paid. The trueval agent is a process that grabs price feeds from e.g. Binance and submits it to chain, inside the smart contract [2]. The “submit” transaction also takes the opportunity to calculate each Predictoor’s reward or slashing, and update their OCEAN holdings in the contract accordingly. (Funds aren’t sent per se, they’re made available via ERC20 “approve”, for the predictoor to transfer at some later point). Predictoor 3 got his OCEAN slashed because he was wrong; predictoors 1 and 2 receive that as income, in addition to receiving income from prediction feed sales to traders. Predictoors can claim their balance&nbsp;anytime.   3. Predictoor Parameters  3.1 Roadmap <p>Predictoor will roll out in three phases: Testnet → Mainnet → Data&nbsp;Farming.</p>  Tue Sep 12, 2023: Predictoor Testnet is ready for community. This means Ocean Predictoor smart contracts, middleware, and frontend running on Oasis Sapphire&nbsp;testnet.  Tue Oct 3 [4w later]: Predictoor Mainnet is ready for community. This is like testnet but tokens have real value. There will be bridges as appropriate.  Thu Nov 2 [4w 2d later]: Predictoor Data Farming starts counting. There will be 37,000 OCEAN weekly rewards to incentivize predictoors. The appendix has&nbsp;details.   3.2 Feeds Published <p>For testnet, there are 10 feeds: X/USDT pair for each of the top-10 coins by market cap (ignoring stablecoins), 5m timescales, on Binance, &gt;0% fees on Binance. Paid feeds. The coins are: X = BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, DOGE, SOL, LTC, TRX,&nbsp;DOT</p><p>For mainnet, tentatively, there will be 20 feeds: 10 at 5m timescales like above, plus 10 at 60m timescales.</p> 3.3 Pricing <p>The price to subscribe to one feed for 24 hours is 3.00 OCEAN. This includes all&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Fee details:</p>  0.1% community swap&nbsp;fee  20% fee to Ocean Protocol Foundation. (Will be used to further drive Predictoor, and to burn&nbsp;OCEAN.)  For reference, price without fees is 2.49791840133 OCEAN. To calculate this: Let x = price without fees. Then x * (1 + 0.20 + 0.001) = 3.0 → x = 3.0 / (1 + 0.20 + 0.001) = 2.49791840133  <p>Pricing is subject to change based on learnings, and feedback from community.</p> 4. How to&nbsp;Earn  4.1 How to Earn as a Predictoor <p>If you have background in AI, ML, data science or statistics (and these overlap!) then you’re well suited to become a predictoor to make&nbsp;$.</p><p>Typical steps as a predictoor:</p>  Play with predictoor.ai. Go to <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">predictoor.ai</a> to build intuition: observe the free feed, perhaps buy a few feeds, and watch them change over&nbsp;time.  Do Challenge DF: one-off predictions. Then, practice making accurate AI/ML based predictions via <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/user-guides/data-farming/how-to-challengedf">Challenge Data Farming</a>. Submissions are due Wednesdays at midnight, for ETH price predictions 5 min, 10 min,&nbsp;…, 60 min ahead. Every week, 5000 OCEAN prize money is distributed to the three lowest-error submissions.  Run a predictoor bot: continuous predictions. Follow the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor README</a>. You’ll start by deploying a bot locally that submits a random prediction every 5 minutes. Then you’ll add AI/ML model predictions. Then you’ll do it on a remote testnet staking fake OCEAN. Finally, you’ll do it on mainnet staking real&nbsp;OCEAN.  Optimize the bot. Improve model prediction accuracy via more data and better algorithms. Extend to predict &gt;1 prediction feeds (Predictoor has many). Wash, rinse,&nbsp;repeat.  <p>The actions as a predictoor give the following ways to&nbsp;earn:</p>  Feed sales. At an epoch, sales revenue (minus fees) for that epoch goes to predictoors. It’s distributed pro-rata by stake among the predictoors who predicted the true value correctly. The revenue for an epoch is the fraction of sales, spread uniformly across subscription length. A price of 3 OCEAN, 5m epochs, and 24h (1440m) subscriptions gives a revenue of (# subscribers) * (3 OCEAN) * / (1440m /&nbsp;5m).  Stake reshuffling. At an epoch, incorrect predictoors have their stake slashed. This slashed stake is distributed to the correct predictoors pro-rata on their&nbsp;stake.  Predictoor DF. The third phase of Predictoor rollout will have an incentives program that amounts to additional earning for predictoors. 37,000 OCEAN/week rewards.  <p>Don’t expect to be 100% accurate in your up/down predictions. Marginally better than 50% might be enough, and be skeptical if you’re greatly above 50%, you probably have a bug in your&nbsp;testing.</p><p>Predictoors can earn even more, via complementary actions:</p>  Challenge DF. Predict accurately for weekly prizes, as discussed earlier.  Passive DF &amp; Volume DF. Lock veOCEAN for OCEAN, then point the veOCEAN to data assets with high data consume volume (DCV). Predictoor feeds are great candidates for high-DCV&nbsp;assets.  <p>Every week there’s 150,000 total OCEAN rewards for Ocean Data Farming. This will increase in early 2024, and more yet later. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#:~:text=Data%20Farming%20(DF)%20incentivizes%20for,2023%20in%20DF%20Round%2029.">Here are&nbsp;details</a>.</p><p>⚠️ You will lose money as a predictoor if your $ out exceeds your $ in. If you have low accuracy you’ll have your stake slashed a lot. Do account for gas fees, compute costs, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this blog is financial advice.</p> 4.2 How to Earn as a&nbsp;Trader <p>You can make $ by buying prediction feeds, and using it as an input — as “alpha” — to your trading approach.</p><p>Typical steps:</p>  Play with dapp, and trade. First, go to <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">predictoor.ai</a> to build intuition: observe the free feed, perhaps buy a few feeds, and watch them change over time. In a second window, have Binance open. Employ a baseline trading strategy: when a new Predictoor prediction pops in, buy if “↑”, and sell or short if “↓”; exit the position 5 min&nbsp;later.  Run a trader bot. Follow the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/trader.md">Trader README</a>. You’ll start by deploying a bot locally that follows the baseline trading strategy: when a new Predictoor prediction pops in, it buys if “↑”, and sells if “↓”. Then you’ll do it on a remote testnet with fake tokens. Finally, you’ll do it on mainnet with real tokens on a real exchange.  Improve &amp; extend. Improve trading performance via more sophisticated trading strategies. This is a universe all of its own! Extend to &gt;1 prediction feeds (Predictoor has many). Wash, rinse,&nbsp;repeat.  <p>The actions as a trader offer a single yet powerful way to earn: trading revenue. Buy low and sell high! (And the opposite with shorting.)</p><p>Traders can earn even more via a complementary action: Volume DF. Lock veOCEAN for OCEAN, then point the veOCEAN to data assets with high DCV. Predictoor feeds are great candidates for high-DCV&nbsp;assets.</p><p>⚠️ You will lose money trading if your $ out exceeds your $ in. Do account for trading fees, order book slippage, cost of prediction feeds, and more. Everything you do is your responsibility, at your discretion. None of this blog is financial advice.</p> 4.3 How to Earn as a Data&nbsp;Farmer <p>Even if you’re not active as a predictoor or a trader, you can earn nonetheless. By simply locking your OCEAN for veOCEAN, you can earn passive rewards. Moreover, if you point your veOCEAN to data assets that have high data consume volume (Predictoor assets are a good choice), then you can earn “Volume DF” active&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4.4 From Earning, to&nbsp;Thriving <p>Why did we, at Ocean Protocol, build Predictoor? Why did we structure it around predictions, for predictoors and traders to earn? Can earning grow into thriving? We explain&nbsp;here.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to level the playing field for data and AI, by kickstarting an open data economy. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">We’ve asked</a>: How do people sustain and thrive in the emerging open data economy? Our answer is simple: ensure that they can make&nbsp;money!</p><p>However, this isn’t enough. We need to dive deeper. The next question is: How do people make money in the open data economy? Our answer is: create value from data, make money from that value, and loop back and reinvest this value creation into further growth. We call this the Data Value-Creation Loop.</p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">The data value-creation loop</a><p>If we unroll the loop, we get a data value supply chain. In most supply chains, the most value creation is at the last step, right before the action is taken. Would you rather a farmer in Costa Rica selling a sack of coffee beans for $5, or Starbucks selling 5 beans’ worth of coffee for $5? It’s the same for data. For data value supply chains, the most value creation in the prediction step.</p><p>Predictoor is a direct manifestation to make this happen. Predictoor aims to make it easy for people to make $ doing predictions (as predictoors), and taking actions against those predictions (as traders). If traders make $ with sufficiently accurate feeds, then they’ll keep buying the feeds, and then the predictoors will make $. As the predictoors pursue higher accuracy, they’ll buy their own data feeds, ie working backwards in the data supply chain. Over time, the whole data supply chain will flesh out with $ at each&nbsp;step.</p><p>And the starting point is predictions.</p> 4.5. Early Earnings Benchmarks <p>As discussed, Predictoor aims to make it easy for people to make $ doing predictions (as predictoors), and taking actions against those predictions (as traders).</p><p>Before we started building Predictoor, we first asked: can we predict ETH (etc) up/down with accuracy? Then we conducted intensive AI/ML research towards this question. The results of this investigation were positive 😎. TBH, we were surprised at the degree of market inefficiency.</p><p>Our next question was: with these predictions, can we make $ trading? Again, we conducted intensive AI/ML research, and again found positive results&nbsp;😎😎.</p><p>Here we share some results of that research — a glimpse of how deep the <a href="https://makeameme.org/meme/take-the-red-5c8af2">rabbit hole</a> goes — to inspire would-be predictoors and traders in their own work. The model was trained on data from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023, with simulated results the first 24 days of July 2023. A “baseline” trading strategy was&nbsp;used:</p><p>The image below shows simulated returns as a function of order size, for BTC/TUSD on Binance. Duration = 7000 ticks x 5m/tick = 24.3 days of trading. It simulates spread effects. It assumes 0% fees. Note how the size of the order affects the return. This is because BTC/TUSD is not very liquid; therefore larger amounts cause slippage.</p>Simulated returns vs time of BTC/TUSD trading on Binance. Trade size has an&nbsp;impact.<p>The image below has the same experimental setup, but for BTC/USDT pair. The size of the order does not affect the return, because BTC/USDT is more liquid than BTC/TUSD.</p>Simulated returns vs time of BTC/USDT trading on Binance. Trade size has little&nbsp;impact. 5. Predictoor Architecture  5.1 Privacy and Oasis&nbsp;Sapphire <p>Predictoor needs privacy&nbsp;for:</p>  Submitted predictions  Compute aggregate predictions; and  Aggregated predictions — only subscribers can&nbsp;see  <p>This could all be done on fully-centralized infrastructure. But doing so would fail on our other goals: being globally distributed, censorship resistant, and non-custodial.</p><p>Targeting these needs, we researched &amp; prototyped many privacy technologies. <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a> emerged as the best choice because, as the only privacy-preserving EVM chain in production, it could handle these needs cleanly end-to-end.</p> 5.2 Software Implementation <p>Most of <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">predictoor.ai</a> dapp is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-web">pdr-web repo</a>, with help from <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-websocket">pdr-websocket</a> to fetch feed data and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius">Ocean Aquarius</a> for metadata&nbsp;caching.</p><p>The template Predictoor bots, trader bots, trueval bot, and prediction feed publishing are all in the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> repo. Contracts are in the Ocean <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">contracts</a> repo.</p><p>Events emitted by contracts are indexed as Ocean subgraphs, to be consumed by predictoor.ai and the bots. The backend <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/subgraph.md">subgraph README</a> has more&nbsp;info.</p> 5.3 Backend &amp; Contract&nbsp;Details <p>The image “Overview of Predictoor structure” presented earlier showed much of the Predictoor architecture. The image below adds detail around the backend (bottom 1/3 of diagram). Let’s&nbsp;discuss.</p>Details of Predictoor structure (Architecture)<p>Smart Contracts. There’s one Predictoor contract for each prediction feed, at each exchange/timescale: BTC/USDT at Binance/5m, ETH/USDT at Binance/5m, and so on. Each contract is an <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/datatokens">Ocean datatoken</a> contract, with a new template for prediction feeds [3]. It implements ERC20, Ocean, and Predictoor-specific behavior as&nbsp;follows.</p>  ERC20 behavior. It implements the ERC20 interface and therefore plays well with ERC20-friendly crypto wallets, DEXes,&nbsp;etc.  Ocean behavior. Being part of Ocean, having 1.0 datatokens means you can access the underlying data asset for the duration of the subscription (once you’ve initiated the order). For Predictoor contracts this is 24h. Each datatoken contract has a parent <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/contracts/data-nfts">Ocean data NFT</a> with metadata, means to specify &amp; collect fees, and&nbsp;more.  Predictoor behavior. Each datatoken contract has additional methods specific to Predictoor: submitting predictions, submitting truevals, computing aggregated predictions, etc.  <p>Testnet. Predictoor is initially deployed to Oasis Sapphire testnet. Staking &amp; payment is in (fake) OCEAN tokens; gas fees are in (fake) ROSE tokens. Users get both (fake) tokens <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/testnet-faucet.md">via&nbsp;faucets</a>.</p><p>Mainnet, tokens, bridges. Predictoor will be deployed to Oasis Sapphire mainnet soon. In this case one must use real OCEAN tokens, which bridge from ETH mainnet; and real ROSE tokens, which bridge from Oasis Emerald chain. We’ll share more details when Predictoor officially becomes available on Sapphire mainnet (step 2 of Predictoor roadmap).</p> 6. Possible&nbsp;Futures <p>This first release of Predictoor is just the beginning. We anticipate adding many more crypto feeds: more coins, more exchanges (CEX and DEX), more timescales; and predictions beyond just coin&nbsp;prices.</p><p>We envision the Predictoor stack being used in other verticals like real estate, weather, climate, transportation, and agriculture. We envision refinements of the core Predictoor technology.</p><p>Predictoor’s predictions are the final step of the web3 data value creation pipeline, right before action is taken and $ is made. We anticipate that the $ made by Predictoors will filter upstream, into work to create feeds used by Predictoors, such as sentiment analysis, volatility, and information ticks.</p><p>Most interestingly, the agents of the Predictoor ecosystem may evolve. Starting as relatively simple agents running on the centralized cloud, Predictoor’s incentives can drive them to becoming decentralized and autonomous, while performing AI. Yes, <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ai-daos-and-three-paths-to-get-there-cfa0a4cc37b8">AI DAOs</a>. Swarms of sovereign agents: some predicting, some trading, and some providing support services along the data supply chain. It will feel a bit like <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nature-2-0-27bdf8238071">nature</a>, a bit <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kevin-Kelly/dp/0201483408">out of control</a>, and wholly exciting!</p>Left: a swarm/agent-based <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ai-daos-and-three-paths-to-get-there-cfa0a4cc37b8">AI DAO</a> architecture. Right: book cover for <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kevin-Kelly/dp/0201483408">Out of Control</a> by Kevin&nbsp;Kelly 7. Conclusion <blockquote>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be&nbsp;done.</blockquote><blockquote>— Alan&nbsp;Turing</blockquote><p>We dream of a world of 10,000 truly accurate prediction feeds, for everything from rain forecasts to sea level rise, or traffic congestion to ETH price. <a href="https://predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> is an on-chain, privacy-enabled, AI-powered application and stack that is bringing this dream to&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Predictoor’s testnet is live now, mainnet soon, and incentives program soon after. We anticipate Predictoor to extend beyond DeFi to other verticals like climate and agriculture. Predictoor agents may evolve into AI DAOs with emergent swarm-like behavior. This is the&nbsp;future.</p> Appendix: Predictoor Data&nbsp;Farming <p>There will be 37,000 OCEAN weekly rewards to incentivize predictoors.</p><p>Here are details. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">Ocean Data Farming</a> (DF) is an incentives program currently with <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">150K OCEAN</a> rewards per&nbsp;week.</p><p>DF streams &amp; sub-streams are:</p>  Passive DF. 75K OCEAN per week.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>Reshaping the future</p>
<p>The relationship between law and technology is a complex one. While law plays a crucial role in safeguarding public interests and ensuring checks and balances, it is also perceived by some as a potential impediment and a deterrent to innovation in the tech industry. Proponents of this idea argue that the tech industry has thrived in part because of its ability to respond to market demands. However, discussions around law and technology tend to yield valuable insights, often involving multiple stakeholders and featuring concerted efforts.</p>
<p>During my graduate studies in Estonia, I encountered a prevailing academic view that sees law as a constraint in the context of technological progress. Although it is widely believed that law struggles to keep pace with the rapid technological advancements and innovations of our time, this characteristic should not necessarily be viewed a drawback. Law, as a restraint in the midst of rapid technological change, provides a fertile ground for nurturing new technological solutions and ideas and allowing stakeholders to engage in meaningful debate and explore a wide range of possibilities.</p>
<p>In other words, its ability to slow down or restrain technological development can actually have positive outcomes by creating opportunities for resistance, reconstruction, and resilience. By imposing limits and requirements, it encourages stakeholders to explore more thoughtful and adaptive solutions. This generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters greater technological resilience, adaptability, and human agency.</p>
<p>Reinstating human agency </p>
<p>For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has set a global standard for data privacy and security. It has compelled tech companies operating in the EU to prioritize user data protection. In practice, this means that organizations constantly need to keep up to date on privacy and data protection regulations to ensure that their business operations remain in compliance. As a result, legal frameworks like GDPR can play a role in restoring human agency, or at least non-technical agency, in times of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence?&amp;at_campaign=20226-Digital&amp;at_medium=Google_Ads&amp;at_platform=Search&amp;at_creation=RSA&amp;at_goal=TR_G&amp;at_advertiser=Webcomm&amp;at_audience=ai%20legislation&amp;at_topic=Artificial_intelligence_Act&amp;at_location=DE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxs-2-MSkgQMVxZDVCh2TgwIKEAAYASAAEgIFOfD_BwE">rapid technological change</a>.</p>
<p>Human agency allows individuals to make ethical decisions regarding the development and application of certain technologies. It provides the capacity to consider the moral implications of technological choices, ensuring that technology aligns with our values and interests. Therefore, discussions about regulation and technology allow us to adapt to these changes and exert some control over the direction of our technological progress. These discussions are not meant to stifle progress but rather to ensure that technological advancements serve the greater good, safeguarding individual rights and societal values.</p>
<p>Regulations not only restore human agency, but also serve as valuable benchmarks and sources of guidance for other countries. By examining advanced and recently published regulations in forward-looking nations, individuals and organizations can proactively adopt practices and recommendations even before they are mandated as national standards in their own country. This approach promotes international collaboration and the harmonization of standards, culminating in improved cybersecurity and safety measures on a global scale.</p>
<p>While technology and law can be a tricky companions, it's up to us to make the most of this complex relationship. Here’s a brief overview of the latest EU regulations:</p>
 
 Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) 
 
<p>DORA came into effect in January 2023. It requires organizations in the European Union financial services sector to ensure that they can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related cyber disruptions and threats. The overall goal of the regulation is to strengthen the resilience and cybersecurity of EU financial entities by streamlining and improving previously existing rules and adding new requirements to improve cybersecurity and harmonize cybersecurity regulatory requirements. Check out my colleague Warwick Ashford's excellent report on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80843/eu-digital-operational-resilience-act-dora">Dora</a> for more info.</p>
 
 EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) 
 
<p>The CRA is a proposed cybersecurity regulation for the EU, introduced on September 15, 2022, by the European Commission. Its primary aim is to enhance cybersecurity and cyber resilience within the EU by establishing common cybersecurity standards for products containing digital components. By imposing cybersecurity standards, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act">CRA</a> helps protect consumers from new and emerging cyber threats. For example, it would guarantee “a framework of cybersecurity requirements governing the planning, design, development and maintenance of such products, with obligations to be met at every stage of the value chain”.</p>
 
 NIS2 Directive 
 
<p>The NIS2 Directive is the EU-wide cybersecurity legislation that came into force in 2023. It updates and modernizes the Directive on the security of Network and Information Systems (NIS), which was introduced in 2016, to address the challenges posed by increasing digitization and evolving cybersecurity threats. The directive aims to enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure operators and digital service providers. Key digital service providers, such as search engines, cloud computing services and online marketplaces,&nbsp;will have to comply with the security and notification requirements under the Directive. Check out this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">blog</a> post for more information.</p>
<p>Cyberevolution</p>
<p>The EU's approach to regulation in cyberspace is driven by the need to protect the rights and security of its citizens in the digital age and create a level playing field in the digital market. It emphasizes the importance of cooperation, transparency, and accountability while addressing the challenges posed by emerging technologies. Furthermore, the relationship between law and technology is one of the focal points of KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> event in Frankfurt from 14-16 November.</p>
<p>As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, organizations must proactively adapt their strategies and practices to meet these new standards. Stay up to date as we delve into the future of regulation and examine the far-reaching implications of recent regulatory developments, including NIS2, DORA, and CRA. Compliance with these regulations is essential for organizations operating in the EU to ensure the protection of critical infrastructure, safeguard against cyber threats, and maintain trust in digital services.</p>

<p>We know consumers are becoming <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">increasingly</a><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/"> concerned</a> about privacy. The International Association of Privacy Professionals’ recent <a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf">research</a> shows 68 per cent of consumers globally are either somewhat or very concerned about their privacy. In the US, at least <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/majority-americans-are-concerned-about-safety-and-privacy-their-personal-data">84 per cent</a> of consumers express some level of concern about the privacy and safety of their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a> and, according to <a href="https://civicscience.com/concerns-grow-over-consumer-privacy-and-facial-recognition-tech/">Civic Science</a>, the majority of Americans (51 per cent) are now very concerned about consumer privacy.</p>



<p>But we also know that despite understanding the risks to their privacy and safety from using their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a> online, most consumers fail to do anything about it—which is the crux of the famous <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818303031">privacy paradox</a>, that disconnect between&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer concerns</a>&nbsp;about privacy and their actions to protect it.<br></p>



<p>So many recommendations, so little time…</p>



<p>One reason consumers might fail to proactively protect their privacy is a lack of time, money or skill for implementing the advice offered to them. PC Magazine recently posted a list of <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">12 simple things</a> that consumers can do to be more secure online. But many of the recommendations are about using existing services on mobiles and desktops, modifying behaviors, or adding an extra technology or service to their online experiences. Typically, for these recommendations, “doing what’s right” would require:<br></p>



 
 Researching available technologies and services (spending time) 



 Buying the technology or services (spending money) 



 Implementing and configuring the acquired technology or services (spending time and skill) 



 Using the technology or services to its fullest extent to achieve maximum benefit (spending time and skill). 
 



<p>Every step in that process is a barrier to regular folks making the move. They may not know where to start researching the solution or even what questions to ask. They may doubt that the thing they are paying for will actually solve their problem. Or they may lack confidence that they can make it work or even use the thing they bought. The result is often a partial solution at best and inaction at worst.</p>



<p>But what if you could provide an easy to understand, acquire, implement, and use package that covers all the privacy and security bases for your customers?</p>



<p>What if you could make it easy for your customers – who already trust you for some pieces of the puzzle – to complete the picture?<br><br>It’s a no-brainer: You would offer additional value that increases stickiness, differentiation, and customer acquisition. And your customers would get what they suspect they’ve needed but haven’t had the motivation or courage to get.</p>



<p>In fact, enterprises are rapidly opening their eyes to the massive levels of customer trust and brand loyalty they can generate by better protecting their customers’ privacy. <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">Harvey Jung</a>, Cisco’s Chief Privacy Officer and Counsel, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">says</a>, ‘Privacy is a business imperative and ethical responsibility – not just a compliance requirement.’&nbsp;And&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">PwC</a> argues that brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. In fact, nine out of 10 business leaders told PwC researchers that building and maintaining customer trust will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;competitive advantage of this decade.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, do it but make it as easy as pie …</p>



<p>If we go back to <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">PC Magazine’s 12 simple things</a> list, here are five that you could easily offer to your customers as pre-packed services:</p>







<p>1. Use unique passwords for every login – While consumers can do this without help, it is rare that they actually do. A password manager (your password manager) removes the barriers to following this advice. A password manager will generate and securely store strong and unique passwords for every login, keeping your customers safer.</p>







<p>2. Get a VPN and use it – A virtual private network (VPN) gives your customers a private and secure online experience that insulates them from prying eyes and those who seek to sell or steal their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>. Your VPN would empower your customers to only reveal what they want to reveal.</p>







<p>3. Use different email addresses for different kinds of accounts – This is another recommendation that a consumer can do on their own but probably won’t. You can make it easy. Offering your customers a convenient way to <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalize</a> their email communications across their various online activities will dramatically increase their levels of privacy and security. Imagine making it easy for your customers to have entirely separate email within entirely <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">separate digital identities</a> for things like shopping, dating, social interactions, medical needs, and so on.</p>







<p>4. Turn off the save password feature in browsers – The same password manager that allows for unique and strong passwords for every login also removes the need for the user to remember their passwords or have to worry about turning off the save password feature in their browsers. The password manager automatically and securely enters passwords. Simple.</p>







<p>5. Don’t fall prey to click bait or phishing scams – Giving your customers a safe and private browsing capability will go a long way towards protecting them from themselves. The product you can offer includes mobile and desktop browsing experiences that block ads and trackers, evaluates the safety and reputation of visited sites, and even compartmentalizes browsing for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">separate online personas</a>.</p>

			<p>11th September, Luxembourg – &nbsp;Tokeny, the global leading tokenization platform, is thrilled to announce that they have achieved SOC2 Type I compliance, making them the first tokenization platform in the world to earn this esteemed certification. This certification underscores Tokeny’s dedication to top-tier security. While many companies tout their security measures, third-party validators truly reveal a tech stack’s integrity.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Tokeny has sought out third-party validators to back up their claims. Notably, the Tokeny-developed, now open-source, ERC3643 standard was audited by renowned Web3 code auditor Hacken, earning a perfect 10/10 score.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with SOC2, this report recognizes Tokeny’s commitment to creating the secured enterprise-grade solution that the market deserves. After a careful review conducted by a third-party independent auditor, Tokeny can now undoubtedly prove that all of their departments have the procedures and controls in place to meet the security requirements of the financial markets including:</p>
 
 HR (from hiring to management) 
 Production (covering code changes, security, and releases) 
 IT (handling data privacy and assets) 
 Customer Success Management (overseeing business continuity and incident communication) 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Securing this report marks the initial step in Tokeny’s “Security and Compliance” strategy. Tokeny plans to pursue further certifications, reinforcing its stance as the industry’s premier secure tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a massive leap forward for Tokeny’s platform and their organization for market credibility and to certifiably be recognized as an elite enterprise-grade solution.</p>
<p>CTO, Tony Malghem, who has been leading these efforts, voiced his excitement: </p>

		 
	 
    Being the first is always special, but what truly excites me is the assurance and trust this brings to our users and clients. At Tokeny, we’ve always aimed for excellence, and this certification is a testament to our dedication to deliver the most secure platform, in order to foster confidence and innovation to all who use our platform. Our journey is only just beginning.  Tony MalghemCTO of Tokeny

<p>The recent, numerous high-profile attacks targeting identity processes, like those by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/csrb-report-lessons-from-the-lapsus-threat-group">the Lapsus$ group</a>, underscore the need for strong identity security. New research by the Identity Defined Security Alliance found that 90% of organizations had an identity-related incident in the past year with two-thirds of those suffering direct business impact as a result. Identity verification and identity authentication are both essential elements of a comprehensive identity security strategy. While they sound similar, they serve very different, but interconnected, purposes. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the increased attacks on identity systems, it’s critical to understand identity verification vs. authentication to determine where your organization may be vulnerable and put in effective measures to address these weaknesses. In the most basic terms:</p> 
  
  Identity verification, also referred to as identity proofing, is the process of confirming if someone is who they say they are.  
  Authentication is the process of making sure that the person trying to log in is the same person whose identity was confirmed before.  
  
<p>Here, we take a closer look at identity verification vs. authentication, what each of the terms means, how they work, and what role they play in a broader identity security strategy.</p> 
 What is Identity Verification?  
<p>Verification connects an individual with an identity, validating that someone is who they claim to be. It proves that the personal information being used to establish identity is legitimate and isn’t forged or stolen. While this may involve manual checks, technological advances in secure data capture and processing have enabled fully digital identity verification methods. For example, digitally verifying government-issued IDs, matching PII against official databases or even taking a selfie.</p> 
<p>Identity verification is frequently used to validate customer identity, especially relating to financial processes, such as opening a bank account. It’s an important part of Know Your Customer (KYC) standards and other guidance and regulations aimed at stopping fraud, corruption, money laundering and other criminal activities. Increasingly, identity verification is being used for Know Your Employee (KYE) purposes, particularly for managing employee onboarding and access control.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Methods of Identity Verification  
<p>There are various ways to verify identity. The methods an organization uses will depend on the level of identity assurance they require and what works with their business processes. Typically you will use multiple methods together. Methods include:</p> 
  
  Document verification — This is typically a government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or passport. This could be a photo or scan of a physical ID or a digital ID such as a mobile driver’s license.&nbsp;  
  Biometric verification — This usually involves using a mobile phone to take a selfie, with the selfie then compared against an official ID to ensure a match.  
  Database verification — User-supplied information is compared against official databases, such as those managed by the DMV and IRS.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Some identity verification solutions include options for additional levels of assurance such as video verification through a live video feed or attestation from a manager.</p> 
 What is Authentication?  
<p>Authentication is the process by which a user proves that they are the holder of the verified identity. For example, to access an online bank account you may be asked to enter a username and password, plus answer security questions or click on a link sent by email or SMS.</p> 
 Common Methods of Authentication  
<p>Online authentication relies on the user presenting one or more factors from the following three categories:</p> 
  
  Knowledge — This is something you know such as a password, PIN or security question. It’s the least secure authentication factor, as it can be guessed, cracked or obtained by malicious actors through <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing</a>, social engineering and other attack methods.  
  Possession — This relates to something you have, such as a device or security key. It offers a stronger level of authentication since an attacker would need to steal or intercept the item in question. Some possession factors, such as an SMS OTP, have proven very easy to bypass.  
  Inherence: This is something you are such as your fingerprint or facial characteristics. Typically this is the most secure factor but that highly depends on how authentication is implemented.  
  
<p>Multi-factor authentication requires two or more factors from different categories. While most multi-factor authentication solutions use a multi-step process, there are some that combine factors into a single action. FIDO-based <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication</a> uses biometrics (inherence) to unlock a device-stored cryptographic key (possession) for login.</p> 
<p>Providing the necessary authentication factors is just the user-facing part of authentication. The factors must still be verified. The backend methods used for verification affect the level of security in authentication as much as the factors used. For instance, if biometric factors are verified by comparing them to ones stored in a central database, then they can be intercepted or stolen just like a password. Look for solutions that perform authentication verification through robust public-key cryptographic exchange protocols.</p> 
 Identity Verification vs. Authentication: Similarities  
<p>Identity verification and authentication both concern the confirmation of identity. They are frequently used in tandem to ensure that only a valid user can access systems and resources. Identity verification and authentication come in at different points in the identity lifecycle. Verification is used to establish an identity and, when necessary, re-confirm identity. Authentication is what verified individuals use for daily access. Both are necessary to identity security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Verification vs. Authentication: Differences  
<p>Although they sound similar and are often used in conjunction, major differences exist between identity verification and authentication. Verification involves establishing a legitimate, proven user identity. Authentication deals with preventing illegitimate users from entering a system on an ongoing basis. Below we compare them in key areas.</p> 
 Purpose  
<p>Verification confirms an individual is who they claim to be by verifying the authenticity of their proof of identity.&nbsp; Authentication determines if someone attempting to access an account is authorized to do so.</p> 
 Data Type Used  
<p>Identity verification usually involves some official form of documentation, such as government IDs, and/or a live photo that proves a person’s physical identity. Authentication may not be tied at all to the person’s physical identity; it can use information such as passwords or possession of a code or key.</p> 
 Identity Timeline  
<p>Verification is performed at a specific point in time, when first onboarding an individual to establish their identity. There may be reverification triggers at times of increased risk or other key events. Authentication is performed on an ongoing basis to continuously validate a person’s identity to grant access to systems and resources.</p> 
 Building a Comprehensive Identity Security Strategy  
<p>Stringent identity verification policies cannot protect your data and systems if that identity can be easily spoofed through insecure authentication methods. Similarly, strong authentication won’t help you if a bad actor has possession of legitimate authentication credentials.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s passwordless MFA eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication processes. Based on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/passkeys">FIDO passkey</a> standards, it provides the strongest authentication to form the basis of a comprehensive identity security strategy.&nbsp; To find out how HYPR passwordless authentication can protect your organization, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/contact">speak to one of our identity security experts</a>.</p>

<p>The Local-First Software Movement is a philosophy and approach to software development that strongly emphasizes prioritizing user control and ownership of their data. Unlike traditional cloud-based or centralized applications, which store data on remote servers, local-first software primarily operates on users' devices and ensures that data remains under their direct control. This movement seeks to empower users by providing them with the benefits of collaboration and connectivity while preserving privacy, security, and data autonomy. It challenges the dominant paradigm of centralization in the digital world and aims to redefine how software applications interact with and safeguard user data.</p><p>Personal data ownership is more important now than ever. Companies train their AI models on user data without compensating users or offering clear ways to opt-out. Platforms change leadership and direction, leaving users scrambling for ways to liberate their content from walled gardens. Centralized services are a target for bad actors.</p><p>Today, we'll dive into the history of the LoFi movement, notable local-first projects, and how to get started.</p><p>The Early Days of Computing and Data Localization</p><p>In the early days of computing, data was all stored locally. It was always physically stored on a floppy disc, a flash drive, the computer's disk drive, or even punch cards and magnetic tapes. Computers relied mainly on physical connections. There was a risk of data loss if the hard drive failed, limited accessibility due to the data being tied to a physical location, and version control issues, as users couldn't edit files simultaneously and had to rely on naming conventions to keep track of changes.</p><p>Then, with the emergence of the Internet and advancements in networking technologies, users could connect with other users across geographical distances and exchange information securely and reliably. The rise of personal computers and the introduction of the World Wide Web in the '90s allowed users to access and share data globally via servers and browsers.</p><p>Then, in the '00s, we saw a major shift to cloud computing. The big three were (and remain) Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. These service providers offer on-demand computing and storage resources at scale. Major companies embraced the cloud to reduce costs. It eliminated the need to build and maintain large on-premises data centers. There were also competitive advantages, such as speedier deployment of new applications. </p><p>The Rise of Cloud Computing and Centralized Services</p><p>The shift to cloud computing has a profound impact on software development. One of the big benefits is optimal resource utilization. Developers can scale up or down their resource needs depending on demand. This is also reflected in the pay-as-you-go model, which allows developers to pay for a tier or plan that best fits their needs.</p><p>Cloud providers offer various managed services, including databases, analytics tools, machine learning, and AI, allowing companies to build innovative features and applications without starting from scratch. </p><p>They also offer APIs for effortless integration and redundancies that ensure high data availability.</p><p>But with these benefits also come drawbacks. For example, data privacy is one of the biggest concerns users express. When storing data with a centralized provider, users have limited control over how it is handled, accessed, and even shared. As the saying goes, "There is no cloud. It's just someone else's computer." </p><p>This can be easy to forget until a data breach or security vulnerability exists. </p><p>Centralized storage creates a single point of failure, which is attractive to bad actors. If it is compromised, the results could be widespread and disastrous. &nbsp; </p><p>Vendor lock-in is another drawback. Once a company is so intertwined with a cloud platform's services, it can be time-consuming and challenging to make a change.</p><p>Cloud services are dependent on Internet connectivity. If there is an Internet outage, and the company is almost entirely cloud-based, business essentially ceases. This can lead to a loss of revenue and unhappy customers. </p><p>There are also additional costs that developers and companies need to be mindful of. For example, while pricing tiers can be a straightforward way to select a plan that suits the budget, going over the allotted storage can be pricy. The same goes for data transfer costs. </p><p>There are also legal considerations. Businesses must take additional security precautions to stay compliant when dealing with sensitive data, like healthcare and financial data. For example, access must be carefully monitored and data encrypted. </p><p>The Local-First Software Movement Takes Root</p><p>As a result of these growing concerns, some developers and users have shifted to a local-first approach. Local-first combines the convenience of cloud apps, including real-time collaboration and the ability to work on multiple devices, with the prioritization of local data storage and networks. </p><p>Local-first also shifts a key paradigm of version authority. With the cloud the file stored in the cloud is the primary copy. Any edits made offline don't matter until they are synced. With local-first, the local copy is the primary copy. </p><p>In the seminal paper, <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf">Local-First Software: You Own Your Data, In Spite of the Cloud</a>, by Martin Kleppmann, Peter van Hardenberg, Adam Wiggins, and Mark McGranaghan, the authors lay out seven ideals for local-first software.</p>  No Spinners: Your Work at Your Fingertips - Instantaneous modifications to files, not burdened by the speed of light!  Your Work Is Not Trapped On One Device - Users should be able to work on their computer, phone, and tablet.  The Network is Optional - Even without Internet connectivity, users should be able to do work and sync their changes later when connectivity is restored.   Seamless Collaboration with Your Colleagues - Cloud apps allow users to edit the same document, so should local-first apps.  The Long Now - Users should be able to access their data long after the company that created the app is gone  Security and Privacy by Default - End-to-end encryption protects sensitive data, whereas cloud services may not meet confidentiality requirements and offer an attractive target for bad actors.  You Retain Ultimate Ownership and Control - A centralized service can lock users out of their data, but users always retain ownership with local-first apps.  <p>Notable Local-First Software Projects and Initiatives</p><p>Several exciting projects have popped up recently in the local-first software space. <a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>, for example, is a privacy-first end-to-end encrypted workspace. Offering apps such as Skiff Drive, Skiff Docs, Skiff Calendar, and Skiff Mail, they provide a decentralized alternative to cloud-based collaboration tools. <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> is an application framework, development platform, and toolchain that enables developers to build local-first, multiplayer applications. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">WNFS</a> is a distributed file system that stores public and private data on IPFS while keeping it encrypted and controlling access via <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>. More examples of local-first applications exist and are on their way, and there has never been more <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/">interest in the movement</a>. </p><p>How Users Can Embrace Local-First Software</p><p>Users, developers, and businesses should all consider whether adopting local-first software solutions is the right fit for them. First, evaluate your data needs and sharing requirements. Do you need to store confidential information? How does the local-first tool handle encryption and access? </p><p>Local-first software builders should provide offline functionality and design with user control in mind. It should always be clear to users how to manage their data. There should also be data export and import features, with data in an interoperable format, so users can have a credible exit. </p><p>If you're interested in learning more about local-first software and you'll be in St. Louis on September 23rd, 2023, we invite you to join us for a LoFi Unconference! Sponsored by Fission, Ink &amp; Switch, and DXOS, the LoFi Unconference will bring attendees in small discussion groups to: </p>  Share best practices, help each other with the challenges we’re facing, and to figure out where we’re going in the future;  ​Get to know the people behind the core technologies for local-first software, such as CRDTs, client-side databases, and cryptographic security for local-first protocols;  ​Give you a chance to demo the software you’re working on or to give a lightning talk on a topic you want to share with the community.  <p> The event is sold out, but we have a waitlist.

<p>With the rise of two-factor authentication and age verification, we’re arming businesses with advanced tools to shield privacy and build confidence. This article will explore the evolution of customer and verification solutions, exploring their ins and outs and eyeing future trends.<br>
Key Takeaways:</p>
 
 Adopting New Verification Methods: Traditional ways of verifying customers are becoming less effective. Updated techniques such as identity verification, two-factor authentication, biometrics, and AI can help protect businesses from fraud. 
 Regulations and Compliance are Crucial: Keeping up with necessary legal and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, KYC, and AML, is not just good practice—it’s a requirement. It helps maintain trust with customers and avoid costly penalties. 
 Balancing Security and User Experience: A sound verification system isn’t just secure; it’s user-friendly. Businesses need to provide a verification process that safeguards information without creating a cumbersome experience for the customer. 
 
 Definition and Importance of Customer Verification 
<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/fighting-identity-theft-red-flags-rule-how-guide-business">Customer verification</a> is a critical step online businesses take to confirm the identity of their clients or customers. It’s a necessary process to reduce fraud, improve security, and comply with various legal and regulatory requirements. Customer identity verification also goes beyond just knowing who most customer verification services and applications of your customers are; it’s about ensuring that the person you’re interacting with is who they claim to be.<br>
Businesses can avoid costly penalties associated with fraudulent transactions and non-compliance with regulatory demands, protect themselves, and verify customers from potential identity fraud. It also aids in building customer trust, as they feel secure knowing their data is protected.</p>
 
Why Businesses Need Customer Verification 
<p>The need for customer verification varies across different sectors, but the primary goal remains to ensure the person you’re dealing with is genuinely who they say they are. Customer verification is part of financial institutions’ essential ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) protocols. Retailers must verify customers’ age and home addresses for certain restricted products and online services. For many online shopping services, businesses must ensure that the person signing up or making a transaction isn’t a bot or a fraudster.</p>
 
Exploring the Different Types of Customer Verification 
 
Passive Verification vs. Active Verification 
<p>There are two types of customer verification: passive and active. Passive verification is typically done behind the scenes without the customer’s knowledge. This could involve comparing the customer’s information against data from third-party databases. Active verification requires customer participation.</p>
 
Passive Verification 
<p>The passive verification method is less intrusive and doesn’t require customers to disrupt the customer experience, making it user-friendly. However, it may not be as secure as active verification because it often relies on public data, which can be outdated or inaccurate.</p>
 
Active Verification 
<p>Active name verification solutions can provide a higher level of security because it requires customers to provide personal information or evidence critical information that only the genuine customer would know or have. But, it can be seen as intrusive and may interrupt the customer journey, leading to potential customer drop-off.</p>
 
Detailed Look at Specific Customer Verification Methods 
 
Two-Factor Authentication (Multi-Factor or 2FA Authentication) 
<p>Two-factor authentication requires customers to provide two types of identifying information. This could be something they know (like a password), something they have (like a mobile phone or device to receive a one-time code), or something they are (like a fingerprint or facial recognition). It offers a higher level of security than single-factor authentication.</p>
 
One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication 
<p>OTP authentication involves sending a unique, temporary password to a customer’s registered device. The customer enters this OTP to either verify the customer’s identity and their identity. The password is usually valid for a short period, making it difficult for fraudsters to use.</p>
 
Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) 
<p>KBA involves asking personal questions to verify customer identity, to which only the customer will likely know the answer. These questions could be static (based on stored personal information) or dynamic (generated in real time from third-party databases).</p>
 
Online Document Verification 
<p>Online document verification involves customers submitting a scanned copy of a personal document (like a passport or driver’s license). Advanced algorithms or human verifiers then check the document’s authenticity.</p>
 
Credit Bureau-based Authentication 
<p>This method involves matching the customer’s information and bank account with data held by credit bureaus. It can help verify an individual’s financial history, making it useful for other financial institutions.</p>
 
Age Verification 
<p>Age verification is necessary when selling age-restricted products or services. It typically involves checking the customer’s age and date of birth against a trusted source, such as a credit card company or public records.</p>
 
Photo Verification 
<p>Photo verification usually involves customers taking a live photo or video of themselves, matched with a photo ID or identity documents of other users they provide.</p>
 
The Legal and Regulatory Landscape of Customer Verification 
 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Customer Verification 
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) plays a significant role in customer verification applications for online and retail services. It dictates how businesses should handle, store, and protect the personal data of EU residents. Verification processes operate online and must be secure and transparent and respect the privacy rights of individuals, including the right to access their data and request data deletion.</p>
 
Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations 
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer#:~:text=Know%20Your%20Customer%20(KYC)%20are,business%20relationship%20with%20a%20customer.">KYC regulations</a> are critical to financial institutions’ due diligence to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. They require businesses to verify the identity of their customers, understand their financial dealings, and assess the risk of illegal intentions.</p>
 
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance 
<p>AML rules globally require banks, organizations, and online merchants, especially those in the financial sector online retail, to verify the identity of their customers. The aim is to prevent criminals from using businesses for money laundering activities. It usually involves verifying the customer’s identity and address.</p>
 
Balancing Security and User-Friendliness 
<p>A secure business environment and a delightful user experience need not be mutually exclusive; they should be two sides of the same coin. The trick lies in finding that sweet spot where security measures are in full swing, yet the user experience remains smooth and pleasant. Let’s delve into this a bit deeper.<br>
Customer verification acts like an invisible security guard, protecting your business and customers, yet it’s unobtrusive. It doesn’t stop the flow; it doesn’t create unnecessary obstacles; it simply merges into the overall user experience. This integration is crucial to avoid frustrating your customers and ensure they’re not jumping through hoops to access your services.<br>
In this context, friction refers to any possible stumbling blocks that disrupt the customer’s journey. These could be lengthy forms, complicated verification methods, or requests for redundant information. Any such friction could deter your customers, causing them to abandon the process altogether. This could ultimately lead to declining customer satisfaction and conversion rates and even impact your business’s bottom line.<br>
While focusing on user-friendliness, we must pay attention to the elephant in the room of most customer verification applications – security. Cyber threats are a harsh reality today, making a robust and foolproof customer verification process more critical than ever. While maintaining a user-friendly approach, we must be prepared to combat these threats with advanced measures, such as multi-factor authentication, biometrics, or AI-driven verification methods.<br>
Our goal is to craft a customer verification experience that doesn’t compromise on either end of the onboarding process – ensuring a top-notch security level while keeping the user experience enjoyable and straightforward. A well-balanced, efficient process builds trust and fosters long-term customer relationships, driving your business’s success and growth.</p>
 
Ensuring Customer Trust through A Secure Verification Processes 
<p>Living in a world where personal information is shared with a simple click, fostering a strong bond of trust between businesses and customers becomes important. When customers share sensitive data, they’re handing over a piece of their trust to the business, fully expecting their information to be safeguarded and used appropriately. Solidifying this trust revolves around a reliable and stringent customer verification process.<br>
Think about it this way: when customers share their details, they say, ‘I trust you.’ Businesses are responsible for repaying that trust by ensuring their information is verified accurately and kept secure. All information- as simple as contact details and mailing addresses or as sensitive as financial data – should be protected with top-notch security measures.<br>
But there’s more to this than just security. Transparency about the customer identity verification process is key to further building that trust. Customers deserve to know what’s happening with their data. So, businesses should be crystal clear about why they collect data, what they’re doing with it, and how they’re keeping it safe. This straightforward communication can ease any potential customer concerns and foster a relationship based on trust and respect.<br>
For example, if a business needs to collect a date of birth for age verification, it should tell the customer exactly why they need this information, how they’ll use it, and how to keep it safe. Will it be encrypted? Stored securely? Compliant with any government laws and global data protection rules? These are all things that should be communicated to the customer.<br>
Additionally, businesses can embrace technology like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">BlockID</a> to boost security and transparency. Implementing advanced encryption for data storage or creating a customer portal where customers can manage their data are great ways to build that trust.</p>
 
Challenges and Limitations in Customer Verification 
<p>Data Quality: The verification process is only as good as the data used. If the data is of good quality or accurate, it could positively affect the verification results. For instance, even the most advanced verification process might flag the user as unverified if a user inputs their name incorrectly.<br>
Privacy Concerns: Striking a balance between security and privacy is a significant challenge. While businesses need certain information to verify the identity of their customers, they must also respect their privacy rights. Data collection and usage must be compliant with laws like GDPR, which might limit the data companies can use for verification.<br>
Technological Barriers: Not all customers are tech-savvy. Complex verification methods that require sophisticated technical understanding might alienate some users, leading to poor customer experience and possible churn.<br>
Cost of Implementation: Advanced verification methods, such as biometric verification and AI-based systems, could be expensive, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. Balancing the need for robust verification with budgetary constraints is a significant challenge.</p>
 
Best Practices for Implementing a Robust Customer Verification System 
<p>Implementing Multiple Verification Methods: Incorporating multiple verification methods, such as two-factor authentication, biometrics, and knowledge-based authentication, can enhance the robustness of your customer verification process. This not only ensures high-security standards but also caters to the varied technical proficiency of customers.</p>
<p>User Education: Regularly educate your customers about the importance of accurate data input and security practices. Make them aware of how to handle verification processes like OTP and two-factor authentication safely. This can reduce errors and increase the effectiveness of your verification process.<br>
Continuous Evaluation and Updates: Technology and cyber threats and your verification methods evolve quickly. Regularly review your verification processes, stay updated with the latest trends, threats, and best practices in verification, and adapt accordingly.<br>
Collaboration with Third Parties: Collaborating with third-party services specializing in customer verification can be beneficial. They have the expertise and resources to conduct the verification process more efficiently and effectively.<br>
Prioritize User Experience: While having a stringent verification process is crucial, it’s equally important not to alienate your customers. Ensure your verification process is user-friendly and keeps the customer journey intact. Feedback from customers can help in optimizing this aspect.<br>
Data Security Measures: Implementing advanced data security measures like end-to-end encryption, secure access controls, and firewalls can ensure customer data safety during and after verification. Regular audits and updates to security measures are also recommended.<br>
Remember, an effective customer verification system combines security measures, user-friendliness, and legal compliance.</p>
<p>Getting customer verification isn’t nice; it’s mandatory for businesses. It’s not just about ticking legal boxes and dodging fraudsters. It’s about forging an ironclad, trust-filled space where customers feel protected and appreciated. And achieving this sweet spot is about something other than drowning in high-tech jargon or rigid rules. It’s about blending security with user-friendliness, creating a frictionless, safe experience.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>This conversation revolves around two key elements that my esteemed guests consider pivotal for the adoption of self-sovereign identity: robust communication strategies and interoperable user experience elements.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity space, numerous communities are filled with individuals collaborating to establish and enhance unified sets of standards to underpin the principles of self-sovereign identity. These communities are also actively engaged in developing technical specifications and open-sourcing implementations. Their collective efforts are instrumental in promoting the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. A fundamental pillar in this journey is interoperability. It’s the key to preventing vendor lock-in and decoupling protocols from end applications. Just as we seamlessly exchange emails across various clients using standardized email protocols, we aspire to achieve a similar level of interoperability in the digital trust space. However, while we’re making significant strides in achieving interoperability, there’s one critical area that warrants more attention and collaboration: user experience (UX).</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Irene and Esther from <a href="https://gataca.io/">Gataca</a>, we focus around the challenges surrounding user experience and the need for greater standardization in this domain. Standardizing user experience elements is crucial for implementing solutions that are truly interoperable, preventing the emergence of proprietary obstacles.</p>
  
<p>For anyone interested in collaborating on designing interoperable user experience elements, Gataca is kicking off a new <a href="https://hs.gataca.io/ux4ssi">UX4SSI Working Group</a> on September 12, 2023. Feel free to register using the link I provided.</p>
<p>And for those interested, here is the link to <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23488/w23488.pdf">‘The Digital Privacy Paradox: Small Money, Small Costs, Small Talk’</a> paper that Irene refers to in the conversation.</p>
<p>I trust that you’ll enjoy this conversation as much as I did. Enjoy!</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Irene, Esther and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:25] Defining Adoption: How do we define adoption in the context of Self-Sovereign Identity, and what lens should we use when examining its various aspects and dimensions? 
 [02:21] Measuring Adoption: When measuring adoption, should we start within specific geographical contexts or industries? What key performance indicators (KPIs) and signals should we consider? 
 [12:07] Communication Challenges: Communication plays a vital role in SSI adoption. We explore why it’s challenging to communicate and market SSI compared to other technologies, like generative AI products. What are the unique hurdles in conveying the value of SSI? 
 [18:24] Simplifying Terminology: The conversation continues with a focus on the use of technical jargon and terminology that can bewilder potential adopters. How can we transition from technical discussions to emphasizing business solutions? 
 [23:17] Targeting Adopters: Is it more effective to target entities that serve as both issuers and verifiers or to focus on specific roles within the SSI ecosystem? What are the trade-offs? 
 [27:56] Building Brand Recognition: Given the open nature of the SSI ecosystem, how can organizations build strong brand recognition, and what role do trust marks and certifications play? 
 [31:47] Navigating Political Terminology: How do you address concerns surrounding the term “digital identity” being weaponized in political discourse when communicating about your SSI products? 
 [37:44] Learning from European Adoption: What lessons can be learned from early adoption of digital identity programs in Europe, and how does it compare to the North American market? 
 [47:29] UX Challenges: What are some of the key user experience (UX) challenges in the SSI space, and how can they be addressed to enhance usability and security? 
 [50:59] Interoperability Impact: How does user experience impact interoperability in the SSI ecosystem, and vice versa? What collaborative efforts are needed? 
 [53:22] Balancing Usability and Security: Balancing usability with security is a common challenge. How can the SSI community find the right equilibrium and enhance user adoption?

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF54 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>In today’s modern era of hybrid digital and physical banking experiences, financial institutions are seeking new ways to improve their new customer acquisition strategies while ensuring they are compliant with relevant regulations. Following a dramatic increase in the use of remote onboarding and expansion of digital banking in recent years, the sector is only set to develop further – the market size is projected to grow from USD $8.4 billion in 2021 to USD $19.2 billion by 2028, <a href="https://marketsnresearch.com/report/1592/global-digital-banking-market">forecasting a healthy compound annual growth rate of 14.80%. </a></p>
<p>Therefore, it’s become increasingly important for banks and credit unions to ensure their customers’ identities are genuine, and that they can lawfully use the services offered by the financial institution. The use of biometric identity verification and eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) checks have become essential, as they enhance security while simplifying the end-user’s journey.</p>
<p>To meet this growing need, Entrust and iProov – two industry leaders in digital identity verification and authentication – have partnered to deliver biometric identity verification and eKYC checks in one powerful, end-to-end solution. This solution revolutionizes how banks and credit unions onboard new users, ensuring a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience for customers and financial organizations alike.</p>
 What are eKYC Checks and How Do They Work?  
<p>eKYC checks are a digital alternative to the traditional KYC process, which is required by regulatory bodies to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. eKYC allows customers to open accounts remotely without the need for physical paperwork or in-person interactions. It’s the most effective way to speed up the onboarding process and improve customer and member satisfaction right out of the gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/">Entrust’s </a>identity solutions portfolio combined with iProov offers identity verification and eKYC services to financial institutions for account opening. It integrates iProov’s biometric solutions suite to provide a seamless and secure onboarding experience. Customers can use their smartphones to capture their biometric data, take a selfie, scan a government-issued ID, and submit the information for verification. The technology can process thousands of identity verifications in minutes, reducing the time and costs associated with manual identity checks.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Combining Biometric Identity Verification With eKYC? 
<p>By incorporating biometric verification into eKYC processes, banks and credit unions can reduce the risk of onboarding illegitimate users with stolen or synthetic identities. Additionally, eKYC checks enhanced with biometric technology have proven to be more efficient – McKinsey says that the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Innovation/The%20value%20of%20digital%20ID%20for%20the%20global%20economy%20and%20society/Digital-ID-a-key-to-inclusive-growth-January%202019.ashx">potential cost reduction</a> in onboarding costs by using digitally-enabled processes is 90%. Also, if a digital onboarding process takes longer than 20 minutes, <a href="https://www.visa.co.uk/dam/VCOM/regional/ve/unitedkingdom/PDF/vca-digital-onboarding-whitepaper-s8.pdf">70% of customers completely abandon</a> their attempt to open an account.</p>
<p>Ultimately the benefits of using biometric identity verification and eKYC checks include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Faster, more convenient, and more secure onboarding experience for customers and members 
 Support for compliance and regulatory requirements 
 Reduced risk of both synthetic and stolen identity fraud, as well as data breaches, which can be costly for financial institutions and damaging to their reputation 
 
 The Next Step in Customer Experience: Digital Payment Card Issuance 
<p>A critical objective of this joint solution is creating an effortless experience for users, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Following on from this, it’s important to prioritize delivering value to customers and members as soon as their account is created. One of the most meaningful milestones is debit card issuance, which provides customers with purchasing power and access to their newly deposited funds. Streamlining the issuance of digital payment cards as a part of the account opening process creates a seamless and valuable experience. By linking the onboarding process with the instant issuance of digital payment cards, banks and credit unions can provide a seamless and convenient experience for their customers and members.</p>
<p>This innovation in digital payment card issuance is part of the joint solution and is particularly valuable because it eliminates the urgency for physical card issuance. Customers can begin using their new accounts immediately, contributing to a more satisfying onboarding experience and increased time-to-value for the financial institution.</p>
<p>The partnership between Entrust and iProov is a game changer for the banking industry. It offers a cutting-edge solution that combines biometric identity verification and eKYC checks to provide a secure and user-friendly onboarding experience for both customers and financial institutions. As digital banking continues to grow, this technology will become increasingly important for financial institutions to stay ahead of the curve and provide their end-users with the best possible service.</p>

 Thrive in the open data economy by closing the loop towards speed and&nbsp;value The Data Value-Creation Loop Motivation <p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">core infrastructure </a>is in place for an open data economy. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Dozens of teams</a> are building on it. But it’s not 100% obvious for teams how to make&nbsp;$.</p><p>We ask:</p><blockquote>How do people sustain and thrive in the emerging open data&nbsp;economy?</blockquote><p>Our answer is simple: ensure that they can make&nbsp;money!</p><p>However, this isn’t enough. We need to dive&nbsp;deeper.</p> The Data Value-Creation Loop <p>The next question&nbsp;is:</p><blockquote>How do people make money in the open data&nbsp;economy?</blockquote><p>Our answer is: create value from data, make money from that value, and loop back and reinvest this value creation into further&nbsp;growth.</p><p>We call this the Data Value-Creation Loop. The figure above illustrates.</p><p>Let’s go through the steps of the&nbsp;loop.</p>  At the top, the user gets data by buying it or spending $ to create&nbsp;it.  Then, they build an AI model from the&nbsp;data.  Then they make predictions. E.g. “ETH will rise in next 5&nbsp;minutes”  Then, they choose actions. E.g. “buy&nbsp;ETH”).  In executing these actions, they data scientist (or org) will make $ on&nbsp;average.  The $ earned is put back into buying more data, and other activities. And the loop&nbsp;repeats.  <p>In this loop, dapp builders can help their users make money; data scientists can earn directly; and crypto enthusiasts can catalyze the first two if incentivized properly (e.g. to curate valuable&nbsp;data).</p><p>If we unroll the loop, we get a data value supply chain. In most supply chains, the most value creation is at the last step, right before the action is taken. Would you rather a farmer in Costa Rica selling a sack of coffee beans for $5, or Starbucks selling 5 beans’ worth of coffee for $5? Therefore, for data value supply chains, the most value creation in the prediction step.</p><p>To the question “How do people make money in the open data economy?”, the “create value from data!” almost seem like a truism. Don’t fool yourself. It’s highly useful in practice: focus only on activities that fully go through the data value-creation loop.</p><p>However, this is still too open-ended. We need to dive&nbsp;deeper.</p> Which Vertical? How To Compare Opportunities <p>There are perhaps dozens of verticals or hundreds of possible opportunities of creating and closing data value-creation loops. How to select which? We’ve found that two measuring sticks help the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Key criteria:</p>  How quickly one can go through the data value-creation loop?  What’s the $ size of the opportunity  <p>For (2), it’s not just “what’s the size of the market”, it’s also “can the product make an impact in the market and capture enough value to be meaningful”.</p><p>We analyzed dozens of possible verticals with according to these criteria. For any given data application, the loop should be fast with serious $ opportunity.</p><p>Here are some examples.</p>  Small $, slow. Traditional music is small $ and slow, because incumbents like Universal dominate by controlling the the back catalogue.  Large $, slow. Medicine is large $ but slow, due to the approval&nbsp;process.  Small $, fast. Decentralized music is fast but small $ (for now! Fingers crossed).  <p>We want: large $, fast. Here are the standouts.</p>  Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/defi/">DeFi</a>) is a great fit. One can loop at the speed of blocks (or faster), and trade volumes have serious&nbsp;$.  LLMs and modern AI is close: one can loop quickly, and with the right application make $. The challenge is: what’s the right application?   On Ocean Protocol&nbsp;Strategy <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">At Ocean</a>, we encourage our ecosystem collaborators to close the data value-creation loops, with maximum $ and speed. We follow our advice for internal projects too. Accordingly, a lot of our focus is on the DeFi and LLMs / modern AI. These are natural for us because Ocean is natively a Web3 and an AI&nbsp;project.</p><p>Loops, then scale. Once one or two fast &amp; high $ data value-creation loops have been established on Ocean, where people are sustainably making money, we’ll likely adjust our activities to scale those loops&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ubiquity. Our aim is to grow over the long-term, until Ocean is ubiquitous as a tool to level the playing field on data and&nbsp;AI.</p> Summary <p>To sustain and thrive in the open data economy: make&nbsp;money!</p><p>Do this by closing the data value-creation loop, in a vertical / opportunity where you can loop quickly and the $ opportunity is&nbsp;large.</p> Notes <p>This content was originally published in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Ocean Protocol Update || 2023</a>”, Mar 10, 2023.

  FATF Travel Rule compliance is now mandatory for UK-based Virtual Asset Service Providers.  The fragmented adoption of the Travel Rule globally poses significant compliance challenges.  Technological solutions like Shyft Veriscope are essential for seamless, cross-jurisdictional compliance.  <p>As of September 1st, the FATF Crypto Travel Rule has been implemented in the United Kingdom. Hence, for all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that are active in the UK, comprehending the nuances of the Travel Rule is no longer optional — it’s a business imperative.</p> The Implications of the FATF Travel Rule for&nbsp;VASPs <p>At the heart of the matter, the primary obligation for UK-based VASPs is to meticulously collect, verify, and share information about crypto-asset transfers. But what does this mean in practice?</p> Dealing with International Transactions <p>Suppose a VASP receives an inbound payment from a jurisdiction where the Travel Rule isn’t enforced. In such a case, it’s not just business as usual — the VASP is required to conduct a risk-based assessment before making the assets available to the recipient. By extension, similar protocols would apply to UK citizens initiating payments to foreign territories.</p> Regulatory Expectations <p>While planning to implement the FATF Travel Rule, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was clear in its expectations — VASPs are not merely encouraged but expected to exercise due diligence, even when they use third-party services to assist with compliance.</p> Keeping an Eye on Global Developments <p>VASPs must also make it a point to monitor how the Travel Rule is being implemented in other jurisdictions. This vigilance is particularly crucial when dealing with transfers to or from regions that have yet to adopt the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Transferring Crypto Assets to Jurisdictions Without the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Place <p>The VASPs are required to make sure they can receive the necessary information for each transaction. However, even if receiving this information isn’t possible, they are still obligated to collect and verify it in line with Money Laundering Regulations. This must be done before any crypto asset transfer&nbsp;occurs.</p> Receiving Crypto Assets from a Jurisdiction Without the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Place <p>UK VASPs must scrutinize the countries involved if a transfer comes in with incomplete or missing information. It’s essential to be aware of each country’s status with regard to the Travel Rule, especially given that only a limited number — like the United States, Germany, and Japan — have fully implemented it. Statistically speaking, as of March 2022, only 29 out of 98 jurisdictions had met the necessary requirements.</p><p>Given this fragmented FATF Travel Rule compliance landscape, VASPs are entering uncharted territory. Moreover, the crypto economy itself is still evolving, and compliance requirements like these are inevitably going to pose challenges, and the UK-based VASPs are no exception to these growing&nbsp;pains.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Concerns <p>Cross-border transfer of funds deals with the regulations of two different legal jurisdictions. The compliance mechanism in such transfers always has to be well-structured and well-laid-out, ensuring that the regulatory realities of two different political geographies are taken into account. This is why many crypto service providers believe that they need further guidance from the FATF while they work on compliance.</p> Heterogeneous Implementation of the Regulation <p>In June 2023, the FATF released an update stating that a whopping <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html">75% of 98 jurisdictions</a> were either partially compliant or not compliant with their requirements for virtual assets and&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>This discrepancy in compliance levels creates a challenge as transactions between compliant and non-compliant jurisdictions become fraught with legal complexities. The industry calls this the “Sunrise” issue, a problem Shyft Veriscope has found an innovative solution&nbsp;for.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope uses a “historic lookback” approach, allowing VASPs to pull information on any transaction, regardless of when it occurred or whether the receiving VASP was compliant at the time. This feature allows for seamless, compliant transactions across borders and regulatory landscapes.</p><p>In essence, Veriscope helps VASPs navigate the fragmented regulatory environment by retroactively generating the necessary compliance information, ensuring that every player can meet their obligations under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>More on Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report — Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p> Unequal Compliance Levels <p>Fraudulent actors are always active in exploiting cracks in the system, and one such vulnerability could arise from a transaction involving both compliant and non-compliant jurisdictions.</p><p>But it doesn’t end there — even within two compliant geographies, unequal levels of compliance could similarly present exploitable gaps.</p><p>For example, both Canada and the UK are travel rule-compliant. However, Canada requires VASPs to record the beneficiary’s postal address, while the UK does not. Such irregularities have to be streamlined to achieve an efficient implementation of the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Cryptocurrency’s Unique&nbsp;Features <p>The crypto-economy has facilities like self-custodial or unhosted wallets, where no service provider knows the wallet details. Only the holder possesses and controls the private key to that wallet. In such setups, it becomes difficult for VASPs to comply with the norms, including a requirement for firms to identify the names of people behind transactions.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>The implementation of the FATF Travel Rule in the UK signals a pivotal moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation. While the UK has taken proactive steps to embrace this global standard, the challenges for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are far from over. With a fragmented global adoption rate, issues like the “Sunrise” problem loom large, and even within compliant jurisdictions, nuances in the regulatory frameworks create additional layers of complexity.</p><p>As the regulatory landscape continues to mature, VASPs will need to keep several key considerations in&nbsp;mind:</p><p>Regulatory Harmonization: Given the patchy adoption of the Travel Rule, efforts to standardize compliance requirements across jurisdictions will become increasingly important. The crypto industry will benefit from greater cooperation among regulators globally.</p><p>Technological Solutions: Leveraging technological solutions like Shyft Veriscope can serve as a lifeline for VASPs struggling with cross-jurisdictional compliance. Such tools offer a real-time, scalable way to meet regulatory requirements without sacrificing operational efficiency.</p><p>Ongoing Monitoring: Regulatory compliance is a moving target. Keeping abreast of updates, whether from FATF or local regulatory bodies like the FCA, will be vital for continuous compliance. To stay updated on the latest developments and insights, <a href="https://shyft-network.beehiiv.com/subscribe">consider subscribing to our Veriscope recap newsletter</a>.</p><p>Fraud Prevention: As the sector evolves, so will the techniques used by fraudulent actors. VASPs must continually refine their risk assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, whether they arise from inconsistent compliance levels or inherent features of the crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Customer Education: As compliance requirements become more complex, so does the user experience. VASPs will need to educate their customer base on what these new rules mean for them and how they are being implemented to protect everyone involved.</p><p>Dialogue with Regulators: Open communication channels with regulatory bodies can help VASPs gain clearer insights into upcoming changes and possibly influence future&nbsp;policy.</p><p>The journey towards full compliance with the FATF Travel Rule is more akin to a marathon than a sprint.

				  Unlocking Success Through Minimum Viable Ecosystems and Ecosystem Governance Frameworks—As Seen in Project Catalyst  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Ever wonder why some projects soar while others struggle? The answer often lies in Minimum Viable Ecosystems and Ecosystem Governance, and <a href="https://projectcatalyst.io/">Project Catalyst</a> serves as a perfect guide. Based on <a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano</a>, it showcases how robust governance can fuel both innovation and community participation.

				 <p>One initiative in the rapidly growing field of blockchain and decentralized systems provides an excellent case study on how <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/what-is-a-minimum-viable-ecosystem/">Minimum Viable Ecosystems</a> (MVEs) and <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/ecosystem-governance-framework/">Ecosystem Governance Frameworks</a> (EGFs) can drive innovation and community participation: Project Catalyst. This Cardano-based community project organizes funding rounds to support ideas that answer set challenges, with proposals selected through a transparent and democratic voting process.</p>
 What is a Minimum Viable Ecosystem and its Role in Ecosystem Governance? 
<p>An MVE is the foundational layer of an ecosystem designed to be as simple as possible while still functional and able to grow. Much like Project Catalyst, which starts each funding round with specific objectives and involves its community in evaluating and selecting proposals, an MVE establishes the essential stakeholders and governance structures to create a sustainable, growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>The goal of an MVE is to attract and align the stakeholders that are needed to drive the entire value proposition. This isn’t the same goal as an MVP.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Understand that a Minimum Viable Ecosystem is not about doing the least amount of work possible. It’s about identifying and focusing on the most critical elements for success.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Key Components of Ecosystem Governance in a Minimum Viable Ecosystem 
<p>Drawing from the best practices of Project Catalyst, building an MVE involves several core elements:</p>
<p>Stakeholder Engagement: Every individual or entity involved—from users to developers—shapes the ecosystem. In Project Catalyst, community members are incentivized to review and evaluate proposals, making them passengers and co-pilots.</p>
<p>Data-Driven Decision-Making: Community sentiment and performance metrics guide Project Catalyst, and the same should be true for any MVE.</p>
<p>Value Proposition: In Project Catalyst, the value lies in community-driven innovation. Your ecosystem should similarly offer something compelling to its participants.</p>
<p>Ecosystem Governance Framework: Project Catalyst has a transparent voting and accountability system. Effective governance keeps an ecosystem fair, functional and aligned with its overarching vision.</p>
<p>Organizations can cultivate robust, adaptable ecosystems that innovate and drive sustainable growth by understanding and applying these principles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Conditional Access overview&nbsp;is a built-in dashboard that offers a comprehensive view of your Conditional Access posture. As an administrator, it provides a concise summary of your policies,&nbsp;identifies any gaps in your policy coverage, and provides valuable insights based on sign-in activity within your tenant. This feature enables you to swiftly pinpoint areas where you can enhance the enforcement of Zero Trust principles, ultimately bolstering your defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 1 Conditional Access overview
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard is now the default landing page of Conditional Access. As the first entry point into Conditional Access, the overview page lets you quickly create new policies using one of the Conditional Access templates which capture commonly used policies and best practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard also offers the following insights and reporting capabilities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 &nbsp;The “See all unprotected sign-ins” link under the Users tile helps you rapidly identify users that are signing in without the protections of a Conditional Access policy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 2 Sign-ins without CA coverage during the last 7 days
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The ‘See all non-compliant devices’ and ‘See all unmanaged devices’ links under the Devices tile help you identify device compliance gaps. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 3 Non-compliant devices
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can discover the top 10 most accessed apps without Conditional Access coverage using the coverage tab and go one step further and identify the users without coverage for that app by clicking on the numbers in the ‘Users without coverage’ column. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 4: Top accessed applications without CA coverage
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can discover security alerts generated based on sign-in activity in your tenant and take quick action on the alerts by deploying recommended zero trust conditional access policies using the Conditional Access templates. Speaking of which, let’s take a brief&nbsp;walkthrough of Conditional Access templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access templates&nbsp;are a pre-defined set of conditions and controls that provide a convenient method to deploy new policies aligned with Microsoft recommendations. Customers are assured that their policies reflect modern best practices for securing corporate assets, promoting secure, optimal access for their hybrid workforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access templates are organized across five scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure foundation 
 Zero Trust 
 Remote work 
 Protect administrators 
 Emerging threats 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can choose from 16 predefined Conditional Access templates based on their specific needs. Here is an example!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;“Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for admins”&nbsp;Conditional Access template, customers can reduce the risk of compromise and phishing attacks on privileged users. This powerful template uses&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/conditional-access-authentication-strength-is-now-generally/ba-p/3773134">Conditional Access authentication strengths</a>&nbsp;to help you choose the right authentication method requirements for specific scenarios, making it easier than ever for organizations to move their most critical users towards more secure, modern, and strong authentication.</p>

 How identified signing can make a difference. 
<p>In this 2-part blog series we provide an overview of the problematics around digitization, specifically on the challenges with remote signatures and some of the options available to limit risks of fraud and increase confidence in your signing process.</p>
<p>We previously explained the challenges around remote signatures for business-critical process, and which options are available to ensure secure and identity-verified signing workflows. Two of these options are digital signatures and eID schemes.</p>
<p>Digital signing: high-assurance signatures from trusted authorities</p>
<p>A digital signature is a specific type of electronic signature; it is not just a visual mark on a PDF document, but a cryptographic operation that binds the signatory’s credentials – in the form of a digital certificate – with the document they are signing. Because a copy of the digital certificate is embedded into the electronic document that is being signed, anyone can verify the signature and identity data in the document, without the need for a separate audit trail.</p>
<p>Digital certificates are issued to individuals and organizations by publicly trusted certification authorities (CAs) – or qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) in the European Union – after these authorities have proceeded with a standardized identity verification process. These digital certificates embed the identity details that were verified. They are only considered “trusted” if they are issued by an authority that is trusted itself. Public CAs and QTSPs such as Entrust follow strict guidelines and go through audits and certifications to earn and maintain the relevant accreditations and remain trusted.</p>
<p>The beauty of digital signatures on documents is that they not only embed verified identity details of the signatory but also provide tamper evidence. A digital signature does indeed bind a digital certificate to the exact content that is signed. A single change in the signed document, even on its metadata, will break the signature. Finally, most CAs and QTSPs also provide a timestamping service, to affix the exact date and time of a signature. This helps to ensure that the existence of a document and the signature cannot be denied.</p>
<p>eIDs and the role of eIDAS in streamlining identity verification processes</p>
<p>eIDs are a growing alternative to identification services, whether from a software or a Certification Authority. An eID schemes consist in a database of verified identities of a specific population that enrolled for the scheme and went through an identity verification process. The most significant benefit of an eID scheme is that, once an eID is created, it can be re-used for a multiple of use-cases, which removes the need for further identity verifications.</p>
<p>To be recognized and accepted everywhere, eID schemes require strong standards and protocols to define, for example, how the identity is verified, how it is stored, how one requests access to some of this data, how a person consents to sharing their data, etc. This is why some regulations are emerging, and perhaps the most notable one is eIDAS.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with eIDAS, it is the European Union’s regulation on the use of eID and electronic signatures across EU member countries, and it’s a global reference when it comes to eIDs and electronic signatures. eIDAS aims to encourage cross-border transactions by ensuring that all EU member countries have the same definition of electronic signatures – note the plural for signatures, because eIDAS doesn’t define one but three types of signatures based on the level of assurance they provide.</p>
<p>eIDAS was published in 2016, and since then all EU member countries have been relying on it for electronic signature standards, and because signatures are inherently linked to identity proving, eIDAS is also driving the deployment of eID schemes across industries and countries in the EU.</p>
<p>It’s worth knowing that there are “private” eID schemes, which are typically industry specific. For example, BankID is an eID scheme managed by a consortium of Scandinavian banks and recognized by governments. But more and more EU governments are also preparing or deploying their own national eID scheme, which allows citizens to enroll for a national eID that can be used to prove their identity online, and notably as part of a signing process.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>The digital transformation sweeping across the business landscape has made efficiency and security two sides of the same coin. User provisioning stands at this crossroads, orchestrating both aspects seamlessly. But what is it, and why should organizations care? In this article, we navigate the intricacies of user provisioning and underscore its pivotal role in today’s enterprise ecosystem.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 User Provisioning as a Business Enabler: Efficient user provisioning boosts operational efficiency, security, and employee morale. It accelerates the onboarding process, safeguards sensitive data, and sets a positive tone for new hires, increasing productivity. 
 The Importance of Continuous Oversight: Regular audits of access rights and systematic de-provisioning for departing employees are essential. This ensures maintained security, compliance, and seamless business continuity. 
 
 Understanding the Basics of User Provisioning 
<p>User provisioning can be seen as the backbone of user access management. It involves creating, updating, managing, and even terminating user accounts in systems and applications. This intricate process plays a vital role in Identity and Access Management (IAM) – a broader perspective that ensures people access only what they’re permitted to at the proper intervals.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, user provisioning isn’t just about granting access. De-provisioning, or stripping users of specific rights and access when no longer necessary, is equally crucial. This ensures that former employees or those changing roles do not retain undue access, guarding against potential vulnerabilities.</p>
 Benefits of Effective User Provisioning 
<p></p>
<p>Delving into user provisioning reveals more than just managing access; it’s a gateway to reshaping organizational dynamics. Here are the ways effective provisioning impacts an organization:</p>
 
 Streamlined Onboarding: An efficient provisioning system means quicker integration for new employees. Instead of waiting for days or even weeks, new team members can get started almost immediately. This enhances productivity and improves the overall employee experience, setting a positive tone from day one. 
 Enhanced Security: Security remains a top concern for enterprises, and rightly so. User provisioning mitigates risks by ensuring that only the right people can access the right resources. This proactive approach can deter internal breaches and ensure that sensitive data remains well-guarded. 
 Improved Compliance: Compliance standards, often seen as cumbersome, become more manageable with systematic user provisioning. Whether GDPR, HIPAA, or any other regulation, streamlined access management ensures that audits are smooth and violations are rare. 
 Reduced Human Errors: Automating user provisioning drastically reduces manual errors. These errors, often overlooked, can be costly in terms of both time and potential security breaches. 
 Optimal Resource Utilization: When IT teams aren’t swamped with access requests or troubleshooting access issues, they can divert their energy to more strategic tasks. This optimization can drive innovation and keep organizations ahead in the competitive curve. 
 
<p>With these benefits in mind, it’s worthwhile to delve deeper into the mechanisms and components that make such provisioning possible.</p>
 Components of User Provisioning 
<p><br>
User provisioning is an intricate system of interconnected parts. To grasp its full breadth, let’s explore these essential components:</p>
 
 Provisioning Policies and Rules: These aren’t mere guidelines but the foundational principles of user provisioning. They determine the criteria for granting or revoking access, ensuring a standardized approach. 
 User Roles and Entitlements: The focus shifts to organizational hierarchy and job functions. By categorizing access based on roles (like manager or analyst), it ensures that users only access what’s relevant to their job function, nothing more, nothing less. 
 Connectors: These technical integrations allow user provisioning systems to communicate with other applications and platforms. Whether cloud services, internal databases, or third-party apps, connectors ensure seamless data flow and user management. 
 Approval Workflows: Not all access requests are granted automatically. Some require managerial or departmental approval. An integrated workflow ensures these requests don’t get stuck in limbo and are either approved or denied promptly. 
 Notification Systems: Keeping users and IT teams in the loop is essential. Whether it’s an approved request, a revoked access, or a pending verification, timely notifications ensure transparency and prompt action. 
 
 The Role of Automation in User Provisioning 
<p>Automation isn’t just a tool; it’s a game-changer in the world of user provisioning. Delving into its role, we can uncover the transformative effects of automation:</p>
 
 Simplifying Tasks: Routine tasks, when automated, free up valuable time. It ensures that provisioning happens in real-time, reducing latency and enhancing productivity. 
 Benefits of Automated Provisioning: Beyond mere time-saving, automation brings consistency, efficiency, and scalability. It ensures uniformity in how access is managed across the organization, regardless of size or complexity. 
 Popular Tools: With the rise of digital transformation, numerous tools have sprung up, offering robust provisioning capabilities. These tools, tailored for diverse organizational needs, provide comprehensive solutions that make user provisioning more efficient and less error-prone. 
 
 Role-based Access Control in User Provisioning: 
<p>The nexus between roles and access rights defines a paradigm where security and functionality converge. To understand its transformative nature, let’s explore Role-Based Access Control in the landscape of user provisioning:</p>
 Defining Role-based Access Control (RBAC): 
<p>RBAC is a method where permissions are associated with specific roles rather than individual users. When a user is assigned to a role, they inherit the permissions that come with it. This methodology streamlines administrative tasks and reinforces the principle of least privilege.</p>
 The Alignment with User Provisioning: 
<p>RBAC is invaluable within the context of user provisioning. As organizations scale, manually assigning permissions to every new hire becomes untenable. With RBAC, predefined roles assigned during the provisioning process automatically dictate access levels, ensuring security without compromising efficiency.</p>
<p>Beyond general automation benefits, there’s a specific area worth exploring: the automated assignment of permissions and its profound advantages.</p>
 The Advantages of Automated Permission Assignment: 
 Eliminating Human Error: 
<p>Manual processes, by their very nature, are prone to errors. Oversights can lead to security vulnerabilities or operational inefficiencies. Automated permission assignment addresses these risks by consistently applying access rights according to predefined criteria.</p>
 Staying Current with Dynamic Roles: 
<p>In agile business environments, roles can be fluid. An employee might start in marketing and transition to sales within months. Automated permission assignment ensures that access rights remain relevant, secure, and efficient as these roles evolve.</p>
 Challenges in User Provisioning 
<p>Even the best systems face obstacles, and user provisioning is no stranger to challenges. As we dive deeper, here are some hurdles that need attention:</p>
 
 Complex IT Environments: Larger organizations or those undergoing mergers face a labyrinth of systems and applications. This complexity can make provisioning a daunting task, demanding more sophisticated solutions. 
 Changing Business Needs: Business dynamics shift. Whether it’s a new department, a change in hierarchy, or the adoption of new technology, user provisioning systems must be agile enough to adapt without hiccups. 
 Continuous Compliance: As governments and industries tighten regulations, staying compliant is an ongoing challenge. User provisioning systems must be updated regularly to accommodate these evolving standards. 
 Balancing Usability and Security: The tug-of-war between security and ease of use is accurate. Too tight a system can impede operations, while a lax one can open up vulnerabilities. Striking the right balance is crucial. 
 
<p>While these challenges are significant, adopting a set of best practices can act as a shield, guiding organizations toward success in user provisioning.</p>
 Addressing Employee Departures: The Imperative of Deprovisioning: 
<p>Employee transitions, while natural, bring to light crucial concerns in the realm of access management. Diving into this topic, we uncover the imperatives and nuances of deprovisioning:</p>
 Potential Risks of Neglect: 
<p>Unchecked access post-departure can have severe consequences. Beyond obvious security concerns, there’s a risk of non-compliance with regulations that mandate timely revocation of access. Furthermore, lingering access can lead to data breaches, either maliciously by disgruntled former employees or inadvertently.</p>
 The Process of Systematic Deprovisioning: 
<p>Deprovisioning is a multi-step process that involves more than just turning off access. It starts with an exit checklist, followed by the actual revocation of access across all systems. Then, a review ensures that no residual permissions linger. Additionally, critical roles and responsibilities held by the departing employee must be reassigned to ensure business continuity.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing User Provisioning 
<p>The journey of user provisioning is one of continual refinement. And anchoring this journey are the best practices that illuminate the path to both security and efficiency:</p>
 
 Regular Audits and Reviews: Periodically reviewing access rights can unearth anomalies. Whether it’s a user with excessive rights or outdated access, regular checks ensure a clean slate. 
 Clear Policies and Procedures: Ambiguity can be a system’s downfall. Clear, documented procedures ensure everyone knows the drill, from IT teams to end-users. 
 User Education: While systems do the heavy lifting, users are the first line of defense. Educating them about the importance of security and best practices can prevent inadvertent breaches. 
 Integration with Current IT Infrastructure: The best provisioning system fits seamlessly with existing setups, enhancing capabilities rather than adding friction. 
 Documentation: Documentation isn’t just bureaucratic red tape. It’s a vital record that tracks changes and reasons for access and provides a reference point during audits or reviews. 
 
<p>With these guidelines, organizations stand poised to make the most of user provisioning, ensuring a harmonious blend of security and operational ease.</p>
 Constructing a Business Case for User Provisioning: 
<p>Beyond its technical dimensions, user provisioning speaks a language that resonates with business outcomes. To discern its broader implications, let’s dissect the business case for this pivotal process:</p>
 Beyond Just Security: 
<p>User provisioning isn’t just a security protocol; it’s a business enabler. Beyond safeguarding assets, it streamlines IT operations, reduces overheads, and accelerates onboarding. Each of these factors translates to tangible cost savings and operational efficiencies.</p>
 Enhancing Productivity and Morale: 
<p>An indirect yet pronounced benefit of efficient user provisioning on employee morale exists. Their productivity soars when staff can access the necessary tools and data without bureaucratic delays. Furthermore, a smooth onboarding experience, free from access-related hiccups, sets a positive tone for their tenure.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Throughout our discussion, we’ve highlighted how user provisioning reshapes how organizations approach efficiency and security. The next step in this evolution is embracing tools that further enhance these strategies.

 While the global gambling industry holds its collective breath for the formal approval of Brazil’s regulatory framework, we investigate what operators can expect from Brazil’s upcoming gambling license structure… 



 



<p>Online gambling is already big business in Brazil, despite the absence of a fully regulated environment or licensing structure.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, while the industry <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2023/08/31/68571-deputy-arthur-lira-says-brazil-sports-betting-bill-set-to-be-approved-next-week">awaits final regulatory approval </a>on an online regulatory framework, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.</p>



<p>Brazil’s lack of online gaming and gambling regulations means Brazilian gamblers are either using foreign gambling platforms, or Brazilian-owned platforms headquartered abroad. It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back into the Brazilian economy.</p>



 History of Brazilian gambling regulation. 



<p>Gambling has enjoyed a long-standing place in the heart of Brazilian culture. Until the early 1940s, games of chance, like rolling dice, was a popular activity in Brazil until the then President introduced a blanket ban. The belief is that this was driven by his and his wife’s devout catholic views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This remained in place until the 1970s, when state-owned lotteries were permitted to run. In the mid-1980s, betting on horseracing was allowed, and in 1993, the Zico Act legalized commercial bingo and slot machines. However, the 1998 Pele Act (no relation to the football star) revoked commercialized bingo, leaving only non-commercial games permissible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only game that has remained legal in the Brazilian gambling market is poker, which has always been regarded as a game of skill rather than chance. Even now, poker remains completely unregulated, however this is likely to change with upcoming regulations.<br>In 2015, alongside the passing of <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/brazil">Law No. 13,155</a>, virtual and land-based instant lotteries (sweepstakes) were created.</p>



<p>Discussions regarding the regulation of Brazilian sports betting regulations have been ongoing since 2018, when Congress authorized the federal government to regulate online sports betting. A four-year timeframe was set for the government to implement a licensing regime, which expired in 2022. It was then&nbsp; decided that the regulatory regime should go through Parliament as a legislative bill, not as an emergency measure by the Ministry of Finance.</p>



<p>Further steps toward legalizing and maintaining a safe regulation of gambling in Brazil began in March 2023, with the formation of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/abradie/">Associação Brasileira de Defesa da Integridade do Esporte (ABRADIE)</a>. ABRADIE is a not-for-profit company founded and run by a wide range of sports and gambling legislation experts to provide a safe and secure environment for those partaking in online gambling in Brazil. The organization’s mission is to ensure the new Brazilian gambling licensing structure protects all relevant parties from fraud and other nefarious practices that can run rampant through this particular industry.</p>



 



 

 



 The current legal framework. 



<p>The current legal framework regarding gambling laws in Brazil remains largely uncontrolled. The only legalized forms of gambling are through state-owned means such as lotteries, horse racing, or non-commercial bingo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under current Brazilian gaming jurisdiction, poker, fantasy sports betting, and games of skill are legal but have no governing regulatory bodies and therefore offer no protection from fraud or other activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, the increasing popularity of online gambling in Brazil has called into question the effectiveness and logic of the ban, as the existing laws did not cover the concept of online gambling. </p>



<p>In 2018, the first steps toward change were made when fixed-odds sports betting was legalized through state-controlled means, and in 2020, non-commercial bingo was legalized. Unlike games of chance, games of skill like Fantasy Sports betting are legal but completely&nbsp; unregulated. Games of chance remain entirely illegal. However, the Brazilian gambling licensing structure will undergo a significant overhaul, alongside proposed gambling laws, overseen by ABRADIE.</p>



 The road to regulation: Brazilian gambling licensing. 



<p>Brazilian gambling regulations will add security and governance, and also, of course, permit the formation&nbsp; of new domestic-based companies. In fact, one of the core factors driving the need for licensing is monetary. It is worth noting that Brazil’s surge in online gambling has coincided with the decline of the Brazilian economy, which has dropped from being the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest economy to the 13th&nbsp; in just over a decade</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By introducing gambling permits and online betting licenses in Brazil, the authorities aim to cash in on the immense tax revenue potential.</p>



<p>Online gambling in Brazil is expected to grow by<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil"> around 20% by 2027</a>. These optimistic projections reinforce the importance and need for online gambling regulations and licensing practices in Brazil.</p>



 Categories of gambling licenses in the Brazilian licensing structure. 



<p>There is not one specific&nbsp; government agency that is responsible for issuing gambling licenses in Brazil. For example, the Secretariat for Competition Advocacy regulates lotteries and bingo events, while the Ministry of Agriculture regulates horse racing events. The formation of ABRADIE is the first step toward a comprehensive regulatory system that includes a comprehensive Brazilian gambling licensing structure.</p>



<p>The Ministry of Finance and ABRADIE will develop and regulate a licensing structure pending the finalization of the gambling regulations. This new structure will enforce<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/"> gambling compliance</a> and protect the industry from fraud and other illegal activities.</p>



 Eligibility and application process for Brazilian gambling licenses. 



<p>As there are currently no gambling licenses available in Brazil , there is no established eligibility criteria or application process. While the much-anticipated changes to the current laws will undoubtedly usher in new standards and application processes, nothing has been disclosed to hint at how this will work.</p>



 Compliance and regulatory standards. 



<p>A major challenge in opening up the Brazilian market to legalized gambling is to ensure the correct levels of compliance and protection are in place to keep everybody involved safe. While there are no such regulatory standards, the proposed Brazilian gambling licensing structure will be spearheaded by ABRADIE.</p>



<p>The key to establishing satisfactory regulatory compliance for Brazilian gambling will be to ensure that stringent fraud and anti-money laundering measures are in place. A vital part of this will be establishing strict and well-monitored checks for<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/"> fraud protection and identity proofing</a>.</p>



 Fees, taxation and revenue allocation. 



<p>While the Brazilian authorities currently enforce no taxation or revenue allocation requirements, the increasing likelihood of legislation changes has given rise to discussions on&nbsp; taxation rates. These discussions are <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2023/05/25/ibjr-calls-for-a-rethink-on-brazils-betting-tax-and-licensing-demands/">being led </a>by the IBRJ (Brazil Institute for Responsible Gaming) who are calling for negotiations over the proposed high tax and license rates.</p>



<p>Below is the current proposed structure for licensed gambling operators by the Brazilian authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rumored cost to obtain a gambling license will be <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/en/legislation-en/2023/03/22/licenses-for-betting-sites-in-brazil-will-cost-brl-30-million/">BR$30 million</a> (US$6.1 million) per operator for three years, and then it will need to be renewed. Operators that wish to qualify for a Brazilian gambling license must be headquartered in Brazil and have a minimum capital of <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2023/08/31/68571-deputy-arthur-lira-says-brazil-sports-betting-bill-set-to-be-approved-next-week">BR$100,000 (US$20,000) </a>At this time, there is no further information on whether there will be different tiers of license, depending on the different online gambling offerings.</p>



<p>Operators within the online gambling sector will be taxed at 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR), of which 10% will go directly into Brazil’s social security budget. A sub-fund will be set up as part of the National Fund for Public Security, which will receive 2.55% of the total tax revenue. This fund will ensure correct and effective measures are set up to combat money laundering, match-fixing, and other illegal activities that could threaten those working in the Brazil gambling market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For players, a proposed tax levy of 30% will be placed on any winnings over BR$2,112 (US$430).</p>



 Challenges and controversies. 



<p>Changing a country’s gambling laws and introducing new regulations for an already multi-billion dollar industry is understandably not without challenges, concerns, and controversies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the core concerns is the social impact of introducing a regulated Brazilian gambling licensing structure. The safety of players should be paramount to the Brazilian authorities. While legalizing gambling will open up the sector to increased numbers of operators and customers, it will also result in increased risk of fraud, match-fixing, and other fraudulent activities that could cause irreparable harm. Ensuring due attention is paid to creating and enforcing safety rules, and responsible gambling measures must come first and foremost in operators’ plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The economic boost created by gambling legislation in Brazil is understandably appealing for new and old operators alike. However, in the race to become licensed, it is important to strike a balance between maximizing profitability and ensuring the safety of all parties.</p>

 Successful gambling licensing models. 



<p>To introduce a successful gambling licensing model, the Brazilian authorities would be well served to study and learn from the experiences of other markets, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">Ontario</a> or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta</a>, as well as the <a href="https://iagr.org/">International Association of Gaming Regulators (IAGR)</a>. The IAGR consists of representatives from gaming regulatory organizations throughout the world, including ABRADIE, which meet and exchange knowledge on best regulatory gaming practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-get-uk-gambling-licence/"> UKGC gambling licensing structure</a>&nbsp; [which is also going through major revisions to bring it up-to-date with the online gambling era] provides a fantastic framework for successful licensing regulation and is a good case study for the Brazilian gambling licensing process. A clearly defined application process is crucial, as ensuring the correct level of information is provided for acceptance and ongoing protection creates a bubble of safety that encourages growth and attracts new business.</p>

 Technological advancements and future legislation. 



<p>With the rapid advancement of technology and the global expansion of online gambling, the future presents both lucrative opportunities and dangerous pitfalls. It is therefore essential to establish clear licensing structures that address emerging risks, ensure user safety, and prevent system abuse.</p>



<p>The rise in online gambling in Brazil began amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and has caused a groundswell pointing toward highly sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. Early predictions show expected growth from $2.1 billion to <a href="https://www.delasport.com/brazil-igaming-market-report/">£2.6 billion by 2026</a>. Of course, the forecast is based on the current landscape, which has no comprehensive regulatory framework. By introducing a well-managed legislation and licensing structure, the future of gambling in Brazil is even brighter, and would significantly boost its dwindling economy.</p>



<p>The proposed changes and introduction of a Brazilian gambling licensing structure will see gambling legalized and regulated for the first time since the 1940s. This will open up a world of possibilities for the emergence of new Brazilian-based gambling companies. The market would become instantly more accessible while also bringing a level of safety to all involved.</p>



<p>Online gambling is huge in Brazil, with&nbsp; <a href="https://tgmresearch.com/gambling-sports-betting-market-research-in-brazil.html">86,43% of sports fans</a> admitting to using online betting services. The current lack of active legislation and licensing for gambling in Brazil means other countries benefit from Brazil’s keen interest in the iGaming market. Although the potential impact of Brazil formally and legally entering the gambling market will benefit the iGaming industry on a global scale, it will likely impact the markets of the individual countries’ and gambling jurisdictions who are currently collecting Brazilian online gambling traffic.</p>



 Navigating the complex web of Brazilian gambling licensing. 



<p>Creating a Brazilian gambling license structure is no small task. Identity proofing and fraud protection will become two areas that are paramount in propping up and ensuring the new licensing structure survives in the Brazilian economy.</p>

 Brazilian gambling license FAQs. 


 
 
 
 What types of gambling activities are allowed under the Brazilian licensing structure? 
 

<p>The only forms of permitted gambling under the Brazilian licensing structure are state-owned, such as lotteries and horse racing. No non-state-driven operators are allowed to be active in Brazil. However, changes are in the works, with a finalized plan to issue gambling licenses in Brazil going through a final ratification process. This will see the introduction of purchasable gambling licenses and the revocation of a law in place since the early 1940s.</p>

 
 
 
 How does Brazil’s taxation system for gambling operators work 
 

<p>The Brazilian taxation system for gambling operators works by taxing operators approximately 18% of their GGR. This taxation will be spread across several government funds, primarily the Social Security budget, with an additional portion being appropriated to help track and prevent fraud and other illegal activities within the newly regulated space.</p>

 
 
 
 What responsible gambling measures are in place to address gambling addiction? 
 

<p>Under the final gambling regulation drafts, all gambling or iGaming operators in Brazil must point out the dangers of gambling addiction. Additionally, those currently listed as under the control of credit protection agencies or those with a poor credit rating are still prohibited from gambling through Brazilian-based iGaming companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An extensive campaign stresses the importance of self-control and responsibility when gambling to prevent people from getting into trouble.</p>

 
 
 
 Are foreign entities eligible to apply for gambling licenses in Brazil? 
 

<p>Yes, under the current proposal, foreign entities are eligible to apply for gambling licenses in Brazil. Under the new proposals for gambling permits in Brazil, both foreign and national operators will need to meet the same set of requirements that will be scrutinized by the Finance Ministry.</p>

 
 
 
 Does Brazil allow gambling? 
 

<p>For more than seven decades, Brazil has maintained a strict prohibition on the vast majority of gambling pursuits. Since the sweeping decree of 1941 that outlawed games of chance, the nation has permitted only two legal forms of gambling: state-controlled lotteries and wagering on horse racing events. To date, Games of chance remain entirely illegal. Nonetheless, the Brazilian gambling licensing framework is poised for a substantial transformation, aligning with impending gambling legislation and overseen by ABRADIE.</p>

 
 
 
 What is the legal gambling age in Brazil? 
 

<p>The Brazilian Civil Code classifies bets as contractual agreements, hence permitting only individuals aged 18 and older to engage in legal gambling activities.</p>

  <p>Somit werden auch kleinere Unternehmen innerhalb von digitalisierten Lieferketten von NIS2 betroffen sein. Da eine Lieferkette immer nur so stark wie ihr schwächstes Glied ist, müssen sich alle Player innerhalb der Kette gegen die Risiken von Cyberangriffen schützen. Schlimmstenfalls kann sonst Industriespionage dazu führen, dass vertrauliche Informationen gestohlen, Produktionsanlagen gehackt oder der Informationsfluss und der Produktionsablauf gestört werden und so ganze Wirtschaftszweige lahmgelegt werden. Deshalb müssen Unternehmen jedweder Größe jetzt tätig werden und die Umsetzung der NIS2-Richtlinie einleiten.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole Principal Analyst Martin Kuppinger wird einleitend erklären, warum es NIS2 braucht und weshalb Organisationen sich frühzeitig damit auseinandersetzen und eine Identity-Roadmap erstellen sollten.</p>
<p>Klaus Hild, Principal Identity Strategist bei SailPoint, wird anhand von Beispielen darlegen, warum sich Unternehmen Gedanken über den „Lifecycle“ eines Mitarbeiters machen sollten, auch wenn dieser womöglich bereits das Unternehmen verlassen hat und wie Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) Lieferketten beeinflusst.</p>

				  Indicio’s new open-source tool enables websockets to quickly manage large scale mediation without dropping messages  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Colton Watkins</p>
<p>Imagine the following&nbsp; scenario. It’s a Friday morning, the first day of a convention that only comes around once a year, and you’re extremely excited about attending. It’s one of the few yearly events that you’re willing to ask your boss for time off to attend. This year, the convention happens to be using a digital ticket system built on the new <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries Framework</a> technology, and they’ve issued a virtual ticket to a mobile app on your phone. Because the technology is so new, you chose the app that the convention’s website recommended you download.</p>
<p>The new ticket system is supposed to make the entire process of checking in and getting your badge quicker and more convenient than ever before. There’s no need to rush to be early as the lines should be pretty short. Getting ready for the day ahead, you grab your phone, leave your hotel room, and head to the convention center.</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>A short walk later, you make it to the convention center only to be greeted with slow moving lines. This new technology is supposed to be faster, so why are the lines moving as slow as or slower than the previous system?</p>
<p>Turns out, you weren’t the only one who went with the first phone app recommended to you on the convention’s website. Most everyone chose to do the same and, upon checking-in, the convention staff encountered issues retrieving the tickets from each person’s phone. The massive amount of people trying to enter the convention at the same time have overloaded the Mediator the app on their phone was using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Mediator is a service that allows software agents (such as those issuing or verifying credentials) to contact other agents that may not have a static IP address—such as mobile devices—or that may be behind a firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overloaded Mediator leaves&nbsp; the convention center&nbsp; struggling to communicate&nbsp; with conference attendee’s mobile wallets.</p>
<p>Introducing SocketDock</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a> is a new tool service created by Indicio that we’ve donated to the open-source community via the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>. In the world of fast and responsive technology, websockets are the go-to solution for quick and snappy applications; however, using websockets means that an online service needs to be able to maintain a continuous connection with the user’s application. Depending on the server architecture, this could spell bad news when it comes to creating clustered applications. A clustered application is when&nbsp; more than one server is used to service many more users than a single server can service on their own. In practice, there are many different ways to handle this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our scenario, if the mediation were to be clustered out to distribute the load, performance would increase and the slowdowns would disappear; however, we would then encounter an issue with missed messages. When the convention center asks you for your ticket, its system would send the request to one of the clustered mediators for your ticket information.&nbsp; But unless it&nbsp; talks to the same computer system that your phone happens to be connected to, the Mediator would have no idea where to send the message and it would be forced to store it for later retrieval — resulting in your phone needing to manually request the messages from the mediator. This is not a great user experience.</p>
<p>How can SocketDock Help?</p>
<p>When Mediators are running on multiple servers, messages to mobile agents need to be sent to the mediator server that the mobile agent is directly connected to. To get around this, we need to separate the websocket server from the Mediator’s application server. Doing so allows mediators to instantly forward messages to mobile agents without concern for which server an agent is connected to. That’s exactly what SocketDock was made to do. SocketDock can sit behind a load balancer, forwarding any messages that it receives to a mediation system (or any system that runs an HTTP/S server). When a message is forwarded to the mediator, extra information is included in the request informing the mediator as to where it can send replies to.&nbsp;<br>Now the convention staff can request your ticket from the mediator and the mediator doesn’t need to have an active connection to the mobile wallet. All it needs to know is which instance of SocketDock to send a message to, bringing back the speed and snappiness to the application and providing the user with a better experience. The lines leading to the convention center’s check-in stations should be moving a lot faster now that the mediator isn’t overloaded.</p>

				 <p>Where can I get SocketDock?</p>
<p>All of this sounds fine and dandy, but it’s not very useful unless it can be deployed in front of a clustered mediator system. Fortunately, all of the code is open-sourced over on GitHub in the Hyperledger organization, which you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock</a></p>
<p>How can I get involved</p>
<p>If you’re looking to learn more about SocketDock, or how you can help out, there are multiple ways to get involved. You can do so by joining the discord or the weekly User Group/Working Group meetings. Links to both of these are on the Hyperledger website.<br><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries</a></p>
<p>Another way to help out is by submitting any issues that you may find or submitting pull requests to contribute fixes over at the SocketDock repository. While it may not seem like it, users of the technology can have a larger impact than they realize, so don’t be afraid to lend a hand.</p>
<p>And if you have questions about implementing your own full decentralized solution don’t hesitate to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to the team at Indicio.</a></p>

<p>Embossed payment cards have been the industry standard since their inception in the 1950s, when point-of-sale terminals included carbon copy card imprinters. With growing innovation in payment card ecosystems, flat card formats are rapidly gaining momentum around the world, as financial institutions, issuers, and consumers recognize the value and opportunity they bring. Even though traditional embossing offers a robust, tactile look and feel, it continues to wane in popularity vs. newer trends. This evolution to an un-embossed card, or more commonly called flat card, continues to drive positive outcomes. In fact, a recent Entrust survey showed that 77% of issuers polled experienced higher transaction volumes after adopting flat cards. Let’s look at a few reasons un-embossed cards continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Aesthetic Appeal</p>
<p>Flat cards are, put simply, cool, hip, and trendy. They aren’t exactly new to the card issuance market, but they continue to dazzle consumers with a sleek, durable finish. In fairness, the acceptance of this alternative to embossing took time to adopt, as first impressions for some were that the “flatness” of these cards gave them a cheap feel. In hindsight, those first-generation flat cards used an identical design layout to their predecessors, giving the initial user interface a “substitution effect.” Account information and other personal identifiers were all located in the same place, but the embossed characters were absent, leaving consumers to question whether this switch was merely a cost consideration or sourcing exercise from their card issuer. Over the past few years though, banks, issuers, and marketers alike have flipped the script to shift paradigm with flat cards by trying new things to entice consumers. The result has been nothing short of demonstrable eye-popping design and card-orientation flexibility, giving flat cards top-of-wallet status today with a clean, modern look.</p>
<p>Brand-Building Opportunities</p>
<p>With the movement of personal information to the back of the card, the front has morphed into a blank canvas to bring a bank’s brand to life. Banks are even able to call out niche programs like eco-friendly, loyalty, or others that connect more meaningfully to consumers. In parallel, flat card designs offer an enhanced user experience (UX) by offering <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/central/financial-card/c/print-on-demand">print-on-demand</a> features like the ability to customize them with high-quality personal pictures directly printed onto a card (i.e., family portrait, kids, pets, sports, etc.). Additional options like vertical card orientation, stacked primary account number (PAN), and full edge-to-edge printing offer limitless opportunities to make the physical card experience exciting. Banks and consumers continue to connect with each other through these designs, while dynamic card verification value (CVV), embedded biometric sensors, and digital credentials also continue to surprise and delight customers throughout their financial credential journey.</p>
<p>Operational Efficiencies</p>
<p>Bureaus and card issuers continue to see shifts to flat card technology as their customers incorporate new requirements to capitalize on these enhanced benefits. In a recent Entrust survey, 60% of card-issuance respondents cited increased efficiency and/or reduced cost as a primary driver for switching to flat cards, in addition to market demands. As the scale of flat cards continues to ramp, so will operational gains, eventually leading to its place at the top of the preferred issuance technology list.</p>
<p>Overall, flat cards offer more flexibility and operational efficiency. Card marketers can simply go further with design, customization, and UX, and consumers like the look and feel of flat card technology. Banks can leverage flat card benefits to go further with top-of-wallet status, and issuers are citing improvements in their operating expenses.</p>
<p>Meeting the Moment</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support this movement by bridging the gap between personalization equipment, secure customer interactions, and the latest innovations in high-volume central and instant financial issuance for flat cards.

<p>In May 2023, Utah’s Governor <a href="https://governor.utah.gov/">Spencer</a><a href="https://governor.utah.gov/"> </a><a href="https://governor.utah.gov/">Cox</a> appointed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown">Steve</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown"> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown">McCown</a> (Chief Architect, <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>) to serve on the state’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission (PPOC). The PPOC was created in 2021 by the Utah State Legislature (see <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0243.html">H.B. 243</a>) in order to develop guiding standards and best practices for protecting personal data and to work directly with the Chief Privacy Officer to have those standards and practices adopted by government entities.</p>



 What is the Personal Privacy Oversight Commission (PPOC)? 



<p>The PPOC is comprised of twelve representatives from industry and government who collectively have expertise in cybersecurity, information technology, operational technology, law enforcement, data privacy law, civil liberties law, and prosecutorial / appellate law. Each of the members has been appointed by either the governor, state auditor, or the attorney general.</p>



<p>Government entities are required to collect, use, and share some personal data in order to provide public services. However, all processing of personal data by public entities must be done in a manner that protects privacy rights. Privacy and security principles and best practices must guide the way.</p>



<p>Utah has a pioneering history in privacy and security. In 1862, legislators in the Territory of Utah introduced the nation’s first communications privacy and security law, entitled An Act For the Regulation of the Telegraph, and to secure Secrecy and Fidelity in the transmission of Telegraphic Messages (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Acts_Resolutions_and_Memorials_Passed_by/Y2xLAQAAMAAJ">source</a>). Passed in January 1863, this forward-thinking law also established the legal standing and privacy requirements for electronic “Contracts”, “power of attorney”, “payment or delivery of money”, etc. when delivered by telegraph. Codifying a variation of e-commerce in the 1800s is pretty forward thinking!</p>



 Modern Challenges in Data Privacy 



<p>The expanding use of digital services experienced over the last few decades has changed the landscape for privacy and how it must be protected. Like most other governments, Utah’s data privacy and security practices grew organically in a time when personal privacy threats were rare and difficult to identify. Utah is responding to changing times, just as it did in 1862, by investing in proactive efforts to protect privacy rights. Rather than simply enacting data breach penalties, Utah is demonstrating a special concern for “the privacy implications and civil liberties concerns of the privacy practices of government entities” (<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0243.html">H.B. 243</a>).</p>



<p>In June 2023, Utah’s Office of the Legislative Auditor General published a report entitled “<a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_RPT.pdf">A Performance Audit of the Collection, Protection, and Use of Personal Information by State Agencies</a>” (<a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_SMRY.pdf">summary</a>, <a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_PRSNT.pdf">slides</a>). Leading up to this report, the state conducted a statewide self-audit and found numerous different data collection policies and handling procedures. Given the current and emerging threats to personal data, the reported found that “current data collection and sharing practices create data privacy risk.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to protect the personal data collected and held by state agencies, the report recommends “defining data privacy in statute for all state agencies” and “requiring government entities to adopt data privacy principles that include items such as: clear consent, notice, and the disclosure of data collection, use, and sharing”. The report went on to recommend that “Statutory data privacy guardrails could alleviate the risk.”</p>



 Privacy Guardrails: Defining the Future 



<p>What are the “privacy guardrails”? That is the central focus of what is being created in the very near-term. Defining and proposing specific actions and requirements is currently underway and is expected to include a cohesive combination of legislation, policy, and training, together with leading technologies and technology standards.</p>



<p>Utah’s efforts are not only vital to the protection of Utahans’ data but are foreseen to provide an example or blueprint for other states and governments to follow. The work of the PPOC gives the state government important insights from experts in several key legal and technology domains, which will ensure that Utah’s solution meets the state’s technical and legal requirements. Utah’s privacy efforts are expected to provide far reaching benefits to government and private organizations globally. Anonyome Labs is proud to support Steve McCown as he serves as a member of Utah’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission.</p>

 Platform solution fights underage gambling and bonus abuse, while preventing money laundering 



<p>Munich, September 5, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider, announces the integration of the Brazilian CPF database check (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas, Register of Natural Persons) into its multi-dimensional identity proofing and fraud prevention solution.</p>



<p>IDnow’s platform solution combines the new CPF database checks with automated document liveness capabilities, fully automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) services, the latter of which screen against multiple global Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) and Sanction lists. To detect single and serial fraud attempts, IDnow’s platform uses proprietary fraud prevention technology that collects risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources.</p>



<p>Issued by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Department, the CPF document provides name, date of birth, and situation of CPF, among others, and is needed to vote, enter university, or go into politics in Brazil. The newly added CPF checks provide an additional layer of identity assurance from a trusted, federal source within the IDnow onboarding process.</p>



<p>In addition to the CPF, Brazilian citizens carry numerous kinds of paper-based documents with no standardized or centralized ID scheme from the federal government. Historically, this has made the automation of document proofing challenging. IDnow’s new solution addresses this problem head-on.</p>



<p>“We have collaborated with government and industry experts to ensure our solution delivers high automation for Brazil’s paper-based documents, in addition to an integration with the CPF database. This provides <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/">holistic, scalable identity assurance to Brazilian gaming and gambling operators</a>. When designing our solution for the Brazilian market, we quickly realized that without the additional security step of the CPF checks, it would be easy for fraudsters to forge documents. Out of all document proofing solutions, IDnow’s is one of the only ones to implement this check into its document verification process without any extra costs to the operator. KYC should never be a burden, but an enabler and we will continue to focus on that for our customers and players”, explains Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow.</p>



<p>Seamlessly verify age and protect players, platform, brand and reputation</p>



<p>In light of <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/brazil-sports-betting/">the recent move of the Brazilian government to regulate sports betting</a>, the market is expected to grow further while operators will be looking for fully compliant solutions that stop money laundering and other financial crime in its tracks.</p>



<p>Redfearn-Tyrzyk explains: “One of the goals of the new regulation is to make sports betting safer for players and platforms by preventing fraud and underage gambling. IDnow’s automated solution with the integrated CPF checks can stop and protect underage individuals from engaging in gambling while still enabling a seamless and efficient onboarding that balances consumer demands for security and privacy without adding friction to their journey. Thanks to our high level of automation and orchestration, gambling providers can drive conversions and increase operational efficiencies while adhering to the new gambling regulations.”</p>



<p>An operator in the online gaming industry,&nbsp;<a href="https://eyasgaming.com/">Eyas Gaming</a>, is already partnering with IDnow in the Brazilian market. Andrejs Cuzans, Head of Fraud, Risk and Payments of Eyas Gaming, says: “Some new players who wish to sign up will go through an automated, AI-based document verification process. After having successfully partnered with IDnow in New Zealand, Eyas is expanding the collaboration to Latin America, by relying on the wide document coverage that IDnow provides.”</p>

			 Marçal Torà is a Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Marçal Torà, and I was born and raised in Barcelona. Before the age of 6, I always said, “when I am older, I want to be a firefighter!” — my father “ruined” that when he gave me a computer. From that moment on, I began experimenting with it in every possible way; I would install viruses disguised as regular software and then ask for his help to remove them. Then, at some point, I started playing online video games that were infested with cheaters, which led me to learn programming languages so that I could write my own, secure code and have a fair chance against them.</p>
<p>Being exposed to computers and technology at such a young age sparked a profound interest in me, and I was soon convinced that writing code was more interesting than extinguishing fires. I even forgot about video games completely to focus solely on personal projects. Later on, after finishing mandatory studies, I enrolled in a vocational degree program to continue learning in this field, and that’s how I became a Software Developer.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny, and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I was part of an emerging startup in Edinburgh. It is a very small team of four members, working on building an ad-free, privacy-preserving search engine. Working in such a recently-established and small company was enjoyable because we had a lot of freedom to shape the product to our liking.</p>
<p>At the time, however, I was looking for a change and came across an employment opportunity at Tokeny. I read about their modern and familiar tech stack, mission, and involvement in cutting-edge blockchain technologies. Since I have a keen interest in machine learning, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, I was very interested in getting involved in a project like this. So, I reached out to Xavi, Head of Product, and on the day of my birthday, we had our first introductory call.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Fantastic! Working at Tokeny is an authentic definition of WFH (Work From Home)! Although there is an office in Luxembourg and a co-working space in Barcelona, most of the time, everybody works in silence from their homes. The traditional physical office has been reduced to Slack, which suits all our communication needs.</p>
<p>It’s certainly good to see each other once in a while, so if you happen to be around the aforementioned cities, you have the option to meet up with some of the other members of the company. However, not needing to work in a physical office gives you the freedom to organize your day according to your personal needs while also managing to complete all your tasks by the end of the day!</p>
<p>I am very happy to be here, surrounded by other committed individuals who are making a shared vision a reality.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p></p>
<p>To be honest, I enjoy what I do — writing code. However, over the years, I’ve come to realize that there is nothing like the outside world, nature, sports, or anything that brings a sense of well-being. To me, one of the best ways to spend my time nowadays is outdoors. I have become very passionate about doing a little bit of everything: running, cycling, swimming, and in the warmer seasons, I tend to do hikes around the region, whereas in winter, I exchange that with ski mountaineering.</p>
<p>Engaging in so many disciplines is challenging but fun and entertaining. It has also revealed a lot about myself and made me more conscious of how I treat my body because injuries are setbacks, but they also force you to learn more about the anatomy of the body to find ways to overcome them.</p>
<p>It’s not all about sports and nature. One also needs to rest and nourish oneself properly, both physically and mentally. In the last few years, I have been learning a lot about nutrition and neuroscience, respectively. In summary, I would say that these topics have become my biggest interests, and my greatest passion has been putting all this knowledge into practice.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I would love to learn a language, travel to its country of origin, and sound like a native. This would be a dream come true and a very fulfilling experience!</p>
 What excites you about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Being part of a relatively small-sized company that has already become the leader in the industry is very exciting in itself! I think that we are all aware that Tokeny is bringing a unique and disruptive infrastructure solution for public markets. Besides, its standard, the ERC3643, has already become the industry standard for permissioned tokens and digital assets. It’s only a matter of time before traditional public markets migrate to the public blockchain, either by using the standard or by contracting our solutions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Operational Technology is comprised of the hardware, software, and networks that actuate, control, monitor, and analyze physical processes, machines, and infrastructure used in various industries such as manufacturing, transportation, health care, power generation and distribution, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, water treatment, etc. OT encompasses multiple categories including Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS) for civil and national interests, such as power generation and distribution, traffic control, water treatment, etc.; Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as SCADA nodes, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) that are in used in manufacturing, warehouses, pharmaceutical, agricultural, transportation, and oil and gas industries; and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which include commoditized IP-enabled sensors that are commonly used in CIS and ICS environments today.</p>
<p>OT systems face cybersecurity threats that are different from enterprise IT because the equipment, software, and communications protocols used in these areas are often not the same as found in IT environments. However, given the push for Digital Transformation and the benefits it offers, many OT-deploying organizations have connected ICS, IIoT, and even CIS networks to their IT infrastructure and cloud services. Moreover, many organizations have deployed common enterprise IT hardware and software as well as commoditized Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as temperature and lighting sensors, Wi-Fi cameras within their OT networks. This opens these OT environments, some of which had been physically air-gapped previously, to the ever-evolving threat landscape of IT.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, enterprise IT departments have developed management hierarchies for handling their sprawling technology estates. However, some organizations that have OT assets have not integrated OT management, particularly security, into that enterprise IT management array. In most cases, there are historical reasons for this separation of duties.</p>
<p>Why IT and OT are often not aligned at the enterprise level</p>
<p>Power utility companies: These organizations have highly specialized and critical OT hardware and software. In some jurisdictions, regulations mandate logical and physical separation of OT assets from the enterprise. Different teams have managed the OT and IT environments, and to this day their reporting structures are not combined. They may have different budgets and even different security policies.</p>
<p>Conglomerates with autonomous or semi-autonomous business units: Companies that have acquired others but without strong centralization of IT (not to mention OT) very often leave most of the management and infrastructure as it was prior to the acquisition. This means that there may be multiple CIOs and CISOs as well as OT security managers, and little impetus for alignment of security technologies and policies.</p>
<p>Security and safety: IT security departments seek to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and assets. Organizations with OT must also maximize human safety, which means that OT equipment must fail-safe to prevent worker injuries, prevent contamination of products and services, ensure national security, and protect the public at large from catastrophic incidents. These objectives may sometimes compete with enterprise IT policies; therefore enterprise IT security and OT security remain distinct in some of these organizations. For examples of security solutions for ICS, see our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80913/cybersecurity-for-industrial-control-systems">Market Compass</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), in their special publication <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r2.pdf">NIST SP800-82r2 Guide to Industrial Control Systems Security</a> (p. 45), states that:</p>
<p>The information security team should report directly to the information security manager at the mission/business process or organization tier, who in turn reports to the mission/business process manager (e.g., facility superintendent) or enterprise information security manager (e.g., the company’s CIO/CSO), respectively. Ultimate authority and responsibility rests in the Tier 1 risk executive function that provides a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to risk management. The risk executive function works with the top management to accept a level of residual risk and accountability for the information security of the ICS.</p>
<p>Though NIST recommends that ICS security responsibilities bubble up to enterprise CISOs, that is largely not the case in many enterprises with OT (of which ICS is a subset), as reflected in the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/maindam/PUBLIC/02_MARKETING/08_Report/report-2022-ot-cybersecurity.pdf">Fortinet 2022 State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report</a> (p. 9), which states that only 15% of organizations with OT have the security responsibility aligned through the enterprise CISO.</p>
<p>Aligning enterprise IT and OT security is certainly a best practice for risk management, considering the increasingly blurry lines of demarcation between the types of technology. Combining IT and OT security at the enterprise risk management level as well as at the technical integration levels present opportunities for synergies that can increase the overall cybersecurity posture of organizations with OT.</p>
<p>Recommendation: Enterprises with OT components must begin the journey toward centralizing security policies, technologies, and management under the purview of enterprise CISOs.</p>

<p>KuppingerCole is hosting our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution conference in Frankfurt, Germany on November 14-16</a>, where we will discuss leading edge topics such as digitalization, cybersecurity, and the impact of AI. There will be tracks for cyber resilience, securing the autonomous world, the cybersecurity fabric, supply chain security, and unified security for IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT. We hope you can join us for this one-of-a-kind event.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p>Operational resilience is essential for every organization embracing digital transformation to ensure that all business IT systems are able to resist and recover from any type of disruption, including cyberattacks. The European Union has put together a framework of requirements in the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which although aimed at the financial services industry, can be used by all organizations to benefit from digital transformation while reducing the risk of disruption to information and communications technology (ICT). This Advisory Note highlights the most important requirements of the regulation and provides recommendations on how to achieve compliance.

			<p>4th September, Luxembourg, and Seoul – Tokeny, the global leading tokenization platform, announces its strategic alliance with Klaytn Foundation, an EVM-compatible public blockchain developed by the renowned Korean IT giant, Kakao. This strategic alliance is set to catalyze the widespread adoption of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, empowering the Asian markets to embrace this cutting-edge financial evolution. A number of RWA projects relating to commodities, accounts receivables, and more are already live or in development on Klaytn.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of this partnership lies in the provision of a seamless infrastructure for companies to effortlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized RWAs via Klaytn’s robust network. Tokeny’s state-of-the-art tokenization platform adheres to the industry-standard ERC3643 for RWA tokenization, ensuring compliance and interoperability.</p>
<p>Diverging from the world of cryptocurrencies, fractionalizing RWAs requires issuers to establish investment vehicles, holding these assets. By issuing financial instruments such as shares or debts of the vehicles, issuers enable investors to participate in the RWA investment opportunities. Tokenized RWAs are the representation of these financial instruments on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complexity arises from the necessity to enforce compliance on the blockchain with existing regulations. This entails that only investors meeting predetermined criteria can qualify as asset owners, thereby mandating rigorous adherence to the stipulated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s platform elegantly resolves this intricate challenge by leveraging the ERC3643 token standard. Through reusable digital identities and verifiable credentials, this standard ensures that only qualified investors can engage in transactions involving tokenized RWAs. Their platform has been used to tokenize more than $28 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    RWA tokenization is rapidly gaining traction in the Asian market. Drawing from our six-year track record in Europe, we are thrilled to collaborate with Klaytn, extending our expertise to Asia to simplify the capital market through tokenization. As digitization takes center stage in Asia, in line with the efficiency seen in other aspects of daily life, investors are demanding real-time and user-friendly financial services. The time is ripe for Asian issuers to seize this market opportunity, and we're eager to accelerate their market entry with our platform, enabling them to retain current clients and attract new ones.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       In the world of RWA tokenization, ERC3643 reigns as the paramount standard. It is the catalyst that propels us towards a token-centered economy, where compliance harmonizes with interoperability. As this standard sweeps the industry across the globe, we're determined to extend its reach within our community, forging a new era for tokenization. Tokeny takes the center stage, an enabler that propels the Asian market into an era of massive adoption, meticulously crafting the most comprehensive platform atop this very standard.  Sam SeoRepresentative Director of Klaytn Foundation    
	 
		 
			<p>As a united force, Klaytn Foundation and Tokeny set out to dissolve barriers and digitize capital markets in Asia. Their shared goal transcends complexities, aiming to make value transfer as effortless as an e-commerce experience. Together, they forge an ecosystem that thrives on real-time interaction, peer-to-peer transactions, unwavering transparency, and seamless interoperability—a visionary financial realm sculpted by RWA tokenization.</p>

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Klaytn

<p>Traditional network security approaches that use legacy VPNs simply cannot scale to modern demands. Once your remote users connect to your corporate network through VPN, they are granted excessive access to your entire network, all it takes is a single compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to gain entry, move laterally, and access your most critical assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access, an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), reduces the operational complexity and cost of legacy VPNs, while eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. It modernizes access to private applications and resources, helping users quickly and easily connect to private applications from any device and any network, whether they’re at home, remote, or in their corporate office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Private Access unique&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of Microsoft’s SSE solution, Private Access is built on Zero Trust principles. It verifies every user and enforces least privilege, giving users access only to the private applications and resources they need. Private Access significantly expands Entra ID Application Proxy capabilities in Microsoft Entra to a complete ZTNA solution that shares the same connectors but offers so much more, it helps you simplify and secure access to any private resource on any port, and protocol. You can apply policies that enable secure, segmented, and granular access to all your private applications in your corporate network, on-premises, or in the cloud. For customers already using Application Proxy, they can seamlessly transition to Private Access – all existing use-cases and access to existing private web applications would continue to work with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create and enforce per-app, least privilege access controls based on the granular Conditional Access policies that are enriched with context about users, devices, and their locations. You can also terminate ongoing sessions in response to anomalies or changes in user context or device health. For example, if a user connects from one part of the world and then immediately connects from another part of the world (what we call “impossible travel"), you can enforce re-authorization or step up to a stronger authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access enables secure access to any application, on-premises or cloud-based, and it works across any port or protocol, including RDP, SSH, SMB, FTP, and anything else that uses TCP or UDP. In addition, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using SAML or http headers or even legacy Kerberos authentication for both web and non-web applications, without making any changes to those applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, your private applications are not only more secure, but your employees can also access them faster compared to legacy VPNs. The unmatched scale and vast global network edge presence enables you to optimally connect your users and devices to private resources, especially those who work in a hybrid or remote work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Private Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access can help you enable secure access to all your private applications and resources. Key capabilities include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access. Replacing legacy VPNs with an identity-centric ZTNA minimizes the risk of implicit trust and lateral movement. Using Quick Access, you can easily configure broad private IP ranges and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to quickly enable identity-centric, Zero-Trust-based access to all private resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications. With Private Access, you can create Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that require modern authentication for accessing any private application, even those using legacy protocols such as Kerberos and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This brings policies based on the sensitivity of the application, level of user risk, network compliance, and so forth to legacy applications. For example, you can easily require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device compliance checks for users trying to access remote desktop (RDP), secure shell (SSH) or SMB applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic private application discovery and onboarding. You can discover private applications, including existing App Proxy private web applications, whether the applications are hosted locally in a private network, in an on-premises data center, or in the cloud.&nbsp; You can then onboard them to Microsoft Entra ID, group them, and define granular access policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granular segmented application access. Instead of granting remote users access to your entire network, as traditional VPNs do, you can define granular segmented access policies for each application or group of applications based on user, device, or processes running on the endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Granular segmented application access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intelligent local access. Employees need a consistent security posture whether they’re accessing private applications remotely or on-premises. The intelligent local access capability enables fast and seamless ZTNA for users, whether they’re within the corporate network or connecting remotely from anywhere outside corporate network boundaries. For example, a user while on the corporate network can connect to on-premises private applications such as RDP or SMB while CA policies such as MFA are still enforced, and application traffic remains local on the corporate network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Getting started with Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Private Access. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them with the resources they need. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickAccess makes it very easy to get started with a minimum configuration for Private Access, especially when you are planning to move from legacy VPN to ZTNA. After completing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access">initial configurations</a>, and once you deploy a connector agent on-premises, to enable quick access all you need to do is specify the IP address, IP address range, or FQDN and port number. You can then assign specific conditional access policies, which QuickAccess applies to ALL app segments you configured. For example, you can create a “myRDP app” and assign it an IP address-based app segment. You only need to provide a name for the private app, then select the connector you wish to use with the app, and then specify the IP address/range and port number. You can then access your destination by simply launching an RDP session from your remote client machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This month, we're joined by the founders and organizers of Strange Loop and Papers We Love conferences. <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/about.html">Strange Loop</a> was founded by Alex Miller in 2009 and is regarded as one of the most prestigious multi-disciplinary tech conferences. Strange Loop talks span both academia and industry, covering a range of topics, including emerging languages, alternative databases, distributed systems, security, AI, the web, and more. </p><p>Papers We Love is a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> of academic computer science papers and a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/wiki/Creating-a-PWL-chapter">community</a> that loves reading them. Organized by Zeeshan Lakhani, Darren Newton, David Ashby, and Chas Emerick, Papers We Love was a collection of local meetups until it joined forces with Strange Loop as part of the pre-conference programming a few years ago.</p>     EP02: In Conversation: Strange Loop and PWL Organizers  0:00 /60:02 1×   <p>In this episode, you'll hear:</p>  How Strange Loop and Papers We Love conferences got their start  How having a background outside of computer science helps to gain perspective on new ways to explore technology  How opportunity grants have left a positive impact on both recipients and the Strange Loop Conference itself  Alex's thoughts on the future of conferences, including why he's bullish on hybrid conferences  <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [2:00] Alex Miller created Lambda Lounge, a meetup for folks interested in functional programming, dynamic languages, and no-SQL databases. He regularly had 50-100 people in attendance and realized he could turn it into a conference. The first Strange Loop had 300 attendees!  [4:30] David Ashby shares how he, Zeeshan, and Darren came together to read academic papers in New York City and started to get requests from folks in other cities who wanted to replicate what they were doing locally. Hence, the Papers We Love chapters were born! The number of chapters in existence at one time was 30.  [10:56] Alex shares his marketing strategy for Strange Loop, where he began with the Lambda Lounge audience and initiated a more grassroots effort to raise awareness.   [15:20] Alex talks about how he became acquainted with the Papers We Love crew and how it became part of the pre-conference track of Strange Loop.  [16:45] Zeeshan explains how Strange Loop was his first exposure to people from academia talking about obscure programming languages and how it inspired PWL.  [19:00] David shares how none of the PWL team had a background in computer science but rather came from the humanities. This drove them to read computer science papers to better understand their field. Alex expands on this by talking about technology's implications in various other disciplines, which is often something technologists forget about. They are so focused on solving interesting problems that they sometimes can't see the forest through the trees.  [32:30] Alex talks about how the Strange Loop opportunity grants started and the impact their recipients have had on the conference over the years.  [43:16] Alex talks about the emerging hybrid model for conferences and how it can help build community while reducing climate impact.  [46:40] Alex shares why he's sunsetting Strange Loop.   [53:40] Boris talks about unconference-style conferences  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Boris Mann - CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Organizer of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a></p><p>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editing by Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guests: Alex Miller, Founder of <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html">Strange Loop Conference</a>, and Zeeshan Lakhani, Darren Newton, David Ashby, and Chas Emerick, organizers of <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love Conference</a>.</p><p>Additional Links:</p>  <a href="https://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/">Theorizing the Web</a>  <a href="https://www.polyglotsoftware.com/">Polyglot Conference</a>  <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691208480/you-are-not-expected-to-understand-this">"You Are Not Expected to Understand This"</a>  <a href="https://github.com/bridgethillyer">Bridget Hillyer</a>  <a href="https://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays</a>

 Tokeny becomes the 1st tokenization platform to achieve SOC2 Type I Compliance 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in August 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>In the dynamic financial landscape, trust with your stakeholders and users is the lifeline of any successful organization. With fraud and theft in the blockchain space experiencing high activity, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure the security of users’ privacy and confidential data. While many companies advocate for their security and protection measures, without third-party validations, the true integrity of a tech stack remains uncertain.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we always took security at heart, starting with the evaluation of our software solutions and, today, with the audit of our whole organization.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have achieved SOC2 Type I compliance, making us the pioneering tokenization platform in the world to earn this esteemed certification.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with SOC2, this report recognizes Tokeny’s commitment to creating the secured enterprise-grade solution that the market deserves. After a careful review conducted by a third-party independent auditor, we can now confidently prove that all of our departments have the procedures in place to meet the security requirements of the financial markets including:<br>
<br>
HR (from recruitment to employee management), Production (change management, code security, release management, etc), IT (privacy controls and asset classification), Customer Success Management (BCP and DRP regularly tested, incident communication management).</p>
<p>In this review, we had no less than 99 security controls carefully reviewed amongst all departments making Tokeny the most secure tokenization platform on the market, allowing us to not only bring trust and confidence through our products and services, but also by the way we manage the company.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The standards and guidelines were provided by <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report">The American Institute of CPAs® (AICPA),</a> an organization that has been involved in the public interest for over 136 years.</p>
<p>Obtaining this report was only the first step towards the “Security and Compliance” pillar of our Technological Strategy, with plans to go even further than this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we are aiming to get ISO27001 certified in the coming months, completing the controls from SOC2 and making Tokeny even more secure. Then we will be pushing for the SOC2 Type II certification, confirming that all the hard work that has been done for the Type I report has been efficiently implemented next year.</p>
<p>Thank you for trusting us on this journey. We remain dedicated to advancing the frontier of secure, compliant, and efficient financial solutions in the digital age.</p>

			<p>The tokenization industry has seen interest blossom over the last few years, with many key financial incumbents jumping on the bandwagon. It unfortunately took longer than ideal, but that’s expected as some of the ‘low-hanging fruit’ blockchain use cases like NFTs and cryptocurrencies were in the limelight initially,</p>
<p>Once institutions finally understood the powerful ‘weapon’ that blockchain can be for their infrastructure, it didn’t take long to begin to experiment and engage with leading experts in the field</p>
<p>Prominent entities such as Invesco, KKR, Hamilton Lane, Aberdeen, Franklin Templeton, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of China, BlackRock, and more are now active participants in the tokenization space – a shift that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the first movers were small issuers tokenizing as a way to either fundraise and expand their investor base or to tokenize their existing cap table, but now everyone is seeing the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>In fact, Boston Consulting Group, anticipates that up to $16T of illiquid assets could be tokenized and unlocked by 2030.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is that according to a report from Bain &amp; Co, the real estate industry alone has a global value of approximately $330T.</p>
<p>In this two-part interview series conducted by CMS, Daniel Coheur, our Chief Commercial Officer had the pleasure to further expand and provide insights on the current status of the tokenization industry and where we are heading:</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>Main takeaways from part 1:</p>
 
 The momentum is building fast for tokenization 
 Smaller jurisdictions have been pioneering an attractive regulatory framework with larger jurisdictions lagging behind 
 The fraudulent actors have only shed more light on the opportunity to enforce compliance on-chain 
 Blockchain applied to real-world assets and securities is extremely powerful 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Main takeaways from part 2:</p>
 
 Institutions are moving from private chains to public ones&nbsp; 
 Tokenization isn’t as sexy as AI but it’s the essential ‘plumbing’ necessary to transform our financial system 
 AI and blockchain have potential to complement each other very well 
 How we tackle blockchain complexities for massive adoption

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF53 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>We have an important update to provide on MS Graph Device Registration Policy resource type currently in preview and available in beta API version. We are making some changes to resource type properties that introduce breaking changes. These changes are expected to happen in the week of September 25, 2023. To ensure continued support and functionality, and minimize impact, it’s very important that all customers take note of these changes and prioritize modifying their applications that depend on this resource type accordingly.   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Why and when are we making this change? &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we make the devcieRegistrationPolicy resource type generally available in our v1.0 API version, we need to align to MS Graph REST API best practices and design patterns. This change will be made to beta endpoint in the week of September 25, 2023, and then generally available to v1.0 endpoint later this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 What are the Required Actions?&nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 
  If you’re using Entra ID portal to configure device registration policy settings then no action is required.&nbsp; 
 If you’re crafting your own MS Graph API requests to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type, then you need to immediately update your application to start configuring the resource type with both the new and deprecated properties.&nbsp; 
 Once the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with new properties is deployed in the week of September 25, 2023, verify using GET call that you see the new properties and their values as being configured by your application. &nbsp; 
 At a later point in time of convenience, remove the deprecated properties from your application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the updates to MS Graph deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 
 The "multiFactorAuthConfiguration" property is changing from an integer to a string value. The old integer value of “0” represented "notRequired" and “1” represented "required". The new string property will now support the values of "notRequired" and "required".&nbsp; 
 The "appliesTo", "allowedUsers" and "allowedGroups" properties within "azureADJoin" and "azureADRegistration" are being deprecated. Instead, these will be replaced by the "allowedToJoin" and "allowedToRegister" properties, which are of the type microsoft.graph.deviceRegistrationMembership and contain one of the following values for "@odata.type":&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 "#microsoft.graph.allDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that all users are allowed to join or register devices.&nbsp; 
 "#microsoft.graph.noDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that no users are allowed to join or register devices.&nbsp; 
 "#microsoft.graph.enumeratedDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that a selected group or users and groups are allowed to join or register devices. Only for this value, the "allowedToJoin" or "allowedToRegister" values contain two additional properties, "users" and "groups", each being an array of user and group IDs which are allowed to join or register devices. 
 
 
 The changes will be deployed to MS Graph beta endpoint the week of September 25, 2023, at which point the deprecated properties of the resource type will stop working.&nbsp; 
 Customers should prepare to update their applications and start using the new properties of the resource type as soon as possible.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to applications if they don’t use the new properties of deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type the week of September 25, 2023? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The applications will encounter an error (Bad Request) as new properties will be expected when configuring the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Can I do something now to prepare my application for this change without waiting until the week of September 25, 2023? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you modify your application immediately to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with both new and deprecated properties. The resource type available in beta endpoint today will honor both the deprecated and new properties. It will stop honoring deprecated properties during the week of September 25, 2023. Here’s an example of how you’ll use PUT to configure both new and deprecated properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{ &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "@odata.context": <a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#policies/deviceRegistrationPolicy/$entity">https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#policies/deviceRegistrationPolicy/$entity</a>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "multiFactorAuthConfiguration": "notRequired", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "id": "deviceRegistrationPolicy", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "displayName": "Device Registration Policy", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "description": "Tenant-wide policy that manages initial provisioning controls using quota restrictions, additional authentication and authorization checks", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "userDeviceQuota": 20, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "azureADRegistration": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isAdminConfigurable": false, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedToRegister": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.allDeviceRegistrationMembership" &nbsp;</p>
<p>    }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "appliesTo": "1", &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedUsers": [], &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedGroups": [] &nbsp;</p>
<p>  }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "azureADJoin": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isAdminConfigurable": true, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedToJoin": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.enumeratedDeviceRegistrationMembership", &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "users": [ &nbsp;</p>
<p>        "a6aebac8-1faf-4ebd-9a68-727fa53376f4" &nbsp;</p>
<p>      ], &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "groups": [] &nbsp;</p>
<p>    }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "appliesTo": "2", &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedUsers": [&nbsp;</p>
<p> "a6aebac8-1faf-4ebd-9a68-727fa53376f4"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ], &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedGroups": [], &nbsp;</p>
<p>  }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "localAdminPassword": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isEnabled": true &nbsp;</p>
<p>  } &nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes: &nbsp;</p>
 
 "multiFactorAuthConfiguration" should always be sent as a string value ("required" or "notRequired").&nbsp; 
 users and groups list are only needed when you set&nbsp;microsoft.graph.deviceRegistrationMembership data type to enumerated.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 When should I remove configuring old properties from my application? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow our above recommendation to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with both new and deprecated properties, you can remove deprecated properties at any future time of convenience. Once the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type is deployed with the new properties during the week of September 25, 2023, deprecated properties will be ignored by the resourceType.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Can I selectively configure the new properties from my application? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not currently. The API supports PUT operation for update, which means you need to configure all properties of deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What will the GET call return? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type will return the deprecated properties until the week of September 25, 2023, after which the resource type will return the new properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With cybersecurity threats constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, organizations are grappling with the challenge of safeguarding their sensitive data and systems. The rise of AI-strengthened phishing attacks and vulnerabilities associated with traditional password-based authentication methods have pushed organizations to explore innovative and secure authentication solutions. In response to these pressing concerns, a dynamic partnership has emerged between two industry leaders: <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/yubikey">HYPR and Yubico</a>. This partnership offers a comprehensive solution that provides flexible and choice-driven passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA), effectively addressing the diverse needs of modern businesses.</p> 
 The Landscape of Security Challenges  
<p>As technology advances, so do the methods employed by cybercriminals to breach systems and steal sensitive information. Traditional password-based authentication methods have proven to be vulnerable to attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To counteract these threats, organizations need authentication solutions that are not only robust but also user-friendly. This is where the HYPR | Yubico partnership comes into play.</p> 
 The Power of Choice: Hardware vs. Software-Based Passwordless Security Keys for Authentication  
<p>The heart of the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-hypr-yubico">HYPR | Yubico solution</a> lies in providing organizations and users with the freedom to choose between hardware and software-based passwordless security keys; both support passkeys and are FIDO Certified. This unique approach caters to different use cases and user preferences, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience across diverse environments and devices, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and VDI workstations.</p> 
<p>Hardware-based authentication options are critical in scenarios where end-users may lack access to smartphones or may prefer not to use them for authentication. This includes sectors such as call centers, banking, retail, and remote locations, where mobile phones may be prohibited or impractical.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the other hand, organizations can opt for software-based authentication, where smartphone-based virtual FIDO-based tokens eliminate the need to purchase and provision physical tokens for each user. This streamlines the enrollment process and enhances user convenience.</p> 
 The Strength of the Partnership: Features and Benefits  
<p>The HYPR | Yubico partnership brings forth a host of features and benefits that contribute to an organization's security, compliance, and operational efficiency:</p> 
  
  User Choice: Users are empowered to authenticate securely in any environment, at any time, by choosing between hardware or software-based FIDO Certified passwordless security keys.  
  Complete Coverage: The joint solution seamlessly integrates with major identity technologies, including Identity Providers (IdPs), Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and Single Sign-On (SSO) services, providing comprehensive coverage adaptable to diverse environments.  
  Compliance and Regulatory Alignment: The availability of both virtual and physical passwordless security keys enables organizations to comply with varying security standards and guidelines across industries and jurisdictions, ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements.  
  Administrative Ease: Organizations can efficiently provision and manage both YubiKeys (physical security keys) and HYPR virtual FIDO tokens from a single console. This streamlines authentication management, enhances administrative efficiency, and simplifies onboarding processes.  
  Future-Proofing: The combination of virtual and physical tokens ensures organizations are prepared for future authentication technologies, guaranteeing ongoing security enhancements.  
  Risk Reduction: The deployment of FIDO and smart card-based MFA effectively combats various attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, and credential stuffing. This enhances security across all users and use cases.  
  Improved User Experience: By reducing login streams and offering the choice between passkeys (FIDO credentials) or smart cards, user satisfaction increases while minimizing security fatigue and failures.  
  Cost Efficiency and Revenue Growth: The unified provisioning, management, and auditing platform reduces costs related to password resets, help desk calls, and authentication-related downtime. This efficiency enables organizations to redirect resources toward core business objectives, thereby increasing overall value and customer trust.  
  
 Building a Secure Foundation for the Future  
<p>In the face of relentless cyber threats, the HYPR | Yubico partnership delivers a robust and forward-looking passwordless authentication solution. By empowering organizations to effectively counter threats, meet compliance requirements, reduce costs, and enhance user experiences, this partnership sets the stage for more secure authentication operations. As organizations embrace the future of authentication, they not only establish a strong security foundation but also foster user trust, driving overall business success.

  A Travel Rule Solution streamlines compliance with FATF’s crypto transaction guidelines, specifically designed for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).  Travel Rule Solutions bridges the gap between regulatory requirements and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.  A well-designed Travel Rule Solution, like Shyft Veriscope, is a balance of data security, interoperability, and regulatory adaptability, making it an essential tool for&nbsp;VASPs.  <p>Understanding the complexities of financial regulations, especially ones like the FATF Travel Rule, is crucial for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). When grappling with these compliance issues, understanding the FATF Travel Rule Recommendation 16 is a necessary first step, and a Travel Rule Solution becomes an invaluable asset.</p> What is a Travel Rule Solution? <p>A Travel Rule Solution is a specialized software designed to help VASPs comply with FATF Travel Rule requirements. This rule mandates sharing customer details for transactions exceeding a certain monetary threshold, which varies by jurisdiction.</p><p>For instance, the European Union has set this minimum transaction value at zero euros, while the United States has set it at $3,000. If you wish to learn more about the Travel Rule in EU’s context, you can head over to <a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/eu_tfr">our EU Travel Rule PDF&nbsp;guide</a>.</p><p>While this is a simple task in traditional banking, the Travel Rule in crypto environments calls for a specialized approach. That’s where our Travel Rule Solution, Shyft Veriscope, distinguishes itself. It offers unmatched levels of automation and security, outpacing other solutions in the&nbsp;market.</p> Why do we Need a Travel Rule Solution? <p>The FATF Travel Rule sets out requirements to curb money laundering and terrorist financing. However, these mandates interact complexly with the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies. In this context, an effective Travel Rule Solution becomes crucial. It allows VASPs to adhere to FATF guidelines while still respecting the core blockchain principles of security and&nbsp;privacy.</p> How Does a Travel Rule Solution&nbsp;Work? <p>Fundamentally, a Travel Rule Solution operates as a secure pipeline between VASPs during transactions. It standardizes the data exchange format to ensure that sensitive customer information is consistently and securely communicated between participating parties. Solutions usually integrate well with a VASP’s existing tech stack, making the entire compliance process less burdensome.</p> Essential Attributes of a Comprehensive Solution  Seamless Integration <p>The most significant challenge lies in creating a solution that can easily integrate with existing systems — each VASP might be operating on entirely different tech stacks, employing different data formats and protocols. Therefore, a viable solution must offer a certain level of adaptability and customization to align with these various systems without requiring a complete overhaul.</p> Security and Encryption <p>Handling sensitive user data requires the highest security standards to prevent data breaches. A robust Travel Rule solution would incorporate advanced encryption techniques and secure channels for data transmission. This ensures that while compliance is met, user data is also shielded from unauthorized access.</p> Regulatory Adaptability <p>Regulations are not static. They evolve. Any effective Travel Rule solution must be agile enough to adapt to changing regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. This adaptability will save VASPs from the recurring costs and time-consuming efforts of having to frequently update their compliance systems.</p> Data Minimization <p>It’s crucial to collect only the information necessary to meet regulatory requirements and nothing more. The less personal data stored, the lower the risks associated with potential data breaches. Therefore, a good Travel Rule solution would employ a principle of data minimization, ensuring that only essential information is captured and transmitted.</p> Decentralization <p>Given that the cryptocurrency space values decentralization, it would be antithetical for the industry to adopt a centralized solution for compliance. A decentralized approach, such as the Shyft Veriscope Peer-to-Peer system, would retain the ethos of the blockchain community while still meeting regulatory standards. This is a complicated balance to maintain, but it’s essential for industry-wide adoption.</p> Shyft Veriscope: A Seamless &amp; Privacy-compliant Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution <p>Shyft Veriscope excels in features beyond mere compliance, addressing future challenges and opportunities in the digital asset space. Its real-time auto-detection of counterparty VASPs, and its comprehensive data retention features stand out. It also solves the complex “Sunrise Issue,” facilitating transactions with VASPs in jurisdictions that haven’t yet embraced the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>More on Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report — Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p> Conclusion <p>In a fast-paced crypto world with ever-changing rules, a Travel Rule Solution is more than a handy tool — it’s a must-have for any Virtual Asset Service Provider. By balancing regulatory demands with crypto’s decentralized spirit, the right solution can make all the difference for secure and compliant transactions.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard to believe it’s been almost a year since we made cross-tenant access settings generally available. Since then, it’s been awesome seeing you adopt this feature to secure your cross-tenant collaboration scenarios and improve end-user experiences for partners by setting up trust of multi-factor authentication (MFA) from their home tenants. With that said, we’ve also heard your feedback on a few critical areas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been hard at work to address that feedback and we have some new improvements to share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can create custom roles and use protected actions to secure changes in cross-tenant access settings. 
 We've removed limits so you can set up policies for as many partners as you want. 
 Invitations respect cross-tenant access settings protecting your tenant from unapproved users and preventing user&nbsp;confusion. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s great to see the team making continuous improvements, thank you for your feedback! Now I’d like to welcome back Senior Product Manager, Josh Douglas, to the blog to walk you through the details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone, this is Josh. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm excited to share how cross-tenant access settings can better assist you on your zero-trust journey! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s dive right into the changes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Create custom roles and protect cross-tenant access settings administration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things we hear a lot is that you want to create your own roles for managing cross-tenant access settings. Today, you need to use either a Global or Security admin to fully manage cross-tenant access settings. Now you can use custom roles to create roles that meet the requirements you have. We’ve seen customers create a full cross-tenant access administrator, a partner administrator, and even a cross-tenant access reader. This allows you to delegate only the rights needed to perform these management actions without granting too many permissions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cross-tenant access settings admin experience has also been updated to respect these new custom roles. If a user does not have the proper permissions, the experience will update and only allow them to perform the actions they have access to perform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: A read-only role cannot perform any edit actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: A read-only role can view settings but is informed they are in a read-only view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview#custom-roles-for-managing-cross-tenant-access-settings">custom roles in cross-tenant access settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to supporting custom roles, cross-tenant access settings permissions have also been onboarded as protected actions. This allows you to protect management actions with Conditional Access policies. For example, to change default settings for B2B collaboration first requires that you perform MFA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: A conditional access policy for protected actions requires MFA before making updates to default settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe with these new capabilities it will empower you on your journey to zero-trust to give admins only the permissions they need to perform management of cross-tenant access settings and keep those highly privileged actions protected with Conditional Access policies!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No more limits on number of partners in cross-tenant access settings 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard from many of you that you have needs to collaborate with hundreds, or even thousands, of organizations and you needed a way to manage all those relationships. Cross-tenant access settings originally had limitations and we realized that those limitations stood in the way of enabling you to manage all of your partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we’ve created a new way of storing data for partners in cross-tenant access settings, where each partner has their own partner policy. With this new model, you can add as many partners as required. From your standpoint, nothing will change with how you manage cross-tenant access settings. You’ll still manage things exactly the same way via the Entra portal or Microsoft Graph, but you’ll no longer hit any size limitation when adding new partners in cross-tenant access settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are beginning to migrate all customers who use cross-tenant access settings to this new, scalable model in CY23 Q3. You may notice an audit log entry for our service that conducts the migration once your tenant is migrated, but there is nothing to worry about! This is our service just moving your configuration to the scalable model, unlocking this new capability for adding as many partners as you need!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Invitations respect cross-tenant access settings 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until now, even if you had blocked someone in cross-tenant access settings, or only allowed specific partners, you could still send B2B invitations to any of the users who may be blocked. After receiving the invitation, they would be blocked as they tried to redeem the invite and access resources. This is a confusing experience for both the inviter and invitee, as the invite went through and then the user was blocked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve introduced a change to make this a better experience all around. We now respect your cross-tenant access settings when sending B2B invitations. This means that for any organization you have blocked, you will no longer successfully invite those users and we will instead fail the invitation and make it clear you need to update cross-tenant access settings if you’d like this invite to go through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you’re excited about these improvements in cross-tenant access settings and can leverage them to work towards a zero-trust posture. As always, let us know if you have any feedback by reaching out to us through the Azure forum or tagging @AzureAd on Twitter!</p>

  <p>It's been about 15 years since the electric vehicle (EV) was introduced broadly to the American automobile market. While the early EVs drew tons of interest, they were prohibitively expensive for most consumers. As more affordable models began to arrive, they drew interest from a larger pool of potential buyers, but their limited range between charges turned many consumers toward hybrid vehicles instead. Hybrids were affordable and could satisfy consumers' demand for greater distance before refueling (or recharging).</p>

<p>Hybrids combine the best qualities of two or more different worlds — and the same is true with hybrid cloud and hybrid IAM. Before we go any further, let's define hybrid cloud and look at its benefits, and then we'll look at hybrid IAM.</p>

<p>Hybrid cloud represents applications, services,and systems that use a mix of on-premises infrastructure along with one or more private cloud or public cloud services. If that on-premises environment is running in a private cloud, it can be considered a hybrid cloud. Because you can choose which environment to use for what applications, combining the best of both worlds, you get the data residency, privacy, and control of on-premises with the agility, flexibility, and scalability of cloud computing.</p>

<p>Like the car analogy, one of the other advantages of hybrid cloud comes down to cost. Because you are using the investments you already made in your on-premises infrastructure and paying only for the cloud capacity you use, a hybrid cloud environment is cost-effective.</p>

 Hybrid cloud can create identity silos, and that's where hybrid IAM comes in 

<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of hybrid cloud is that it fragments digital identities and spreads them across multiple environments. These identity silos can lead to duplicate identities and increased risk. Without visibility across all environments, it's difficult to identify and monitor high-risk requests. On the other hand, unifying all identities across all digital services and avoiding a new set of silos is critical for closing security gaps and delivering great access experiences to users. This unification is known as hybrid IAM.</p>

<p>Hybrid IAM is an IAM platform capable of running, unifying, and securing all digital identities in a hybrid cloud environment.</p>

 Hybrid IAM delivers three key benefits 

<p>Hybrid IAM enables organizations to seamlessly integrate, centralize, and manage identities across any environment in a single IAM platform.</p>

<p>Cost savings: By having a single IAM platform that can run in a hybrid cloud architecture — with you controlling how much will be on-premises and how much will be in the cloud — you have the flexibility to keep costs down and move to the cloud at your own pace without worrying about additional future IAM costs, which could include investment in migration activities and maintenance.</p>

<p>Great experiences: By unifying siloed identity information on a hybrid IAM platform, you can deliver a consistent user experience at any scale for any type of user identity, including IoT devices and services, no matter where the user (customer or employee) or application is housed within the hybrid cloud.</p>

<p>Uncompromising security: By adding user and device context to authentication, including the ability to continuously authorize every transaction, hybrid IAM can enable you to quickly adopt a Zero Trust strategy. By adding full user lifecycle management on top, you can truly unify identities to improve audit and compliance.</p>

 The ForgeRock approach to hybrid IAM 

<p>Capable of being implemented within on-premises, any cloud, and as-a-service infrastructures, ForgeRock offers a truly comprehensive hybrid IAM platform.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, enterprises can introduce modern, identity-driven security and frictionless user experiences into their environments, and address the broadest range of IAM use cases while reducing operational costs and achieving faster time to value.</p>

<p>ForgeRock offers hybrid IAM without compromise. With one subscription, ForgeRock offers the same experiences and outcomes across all platform consumption and implementation choices. Organizations can integrate all their applications by implementing the ForgeRock Identity Platform as a self-managed offering in a cloud of their choice, and when consuming <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> as a service.</p>

   Why success matters to federal agencies — and how to choose a solution 

<p>The recent guidance document released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), "<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/csso-scuba-guidance_document-hybrid_identity_solutions_architecture-2023.03.22-final.pdf">Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Hybrid Identity Solutions Architecture</a>," proposes a number of architectures and solutions to move more identity management functions to a SaaS model, also known as identity as a service, or IDaaS. The CISA publication is timely, given the prevalence of IDaaS solutions that are providing modern use cases to help secure organizations.</p>

<p>There are still many self-managed identity management solutions on the market, and IDaaS solutions have been available for over a decade. But federal agencies have struggled to migrate the full breadth of identity functionality to SaaS solutions. The hybrid models suggested by CISA do address ways to work through many of the common challenges.</p>

<p>There are a few areas that ForgeRock would like to address, complementary to CISA's comprehensive document. Having a single vendor that can address all of the core identity functionality needed by an agency, no matter how it is deployed, is key. The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> is a complete identity and access management (IAM) solution. The following points underscore what a complete identity platform is and why it's important for agencies.</p>
	
 Flexible deployment 
	
<p>Identity solutions should facilitate the hybrid models presented by CISA without relying on legacy identity solutions. ForgeRock maintains its self-managed, as-a-service, and DevOps deployments. The licensing for IDaaS allows for the other deployment models to be deployed in a hybrid model without additional license charges. You can have an unlimited number of instances of the ForgeRock platform deployed on-premises or to the agency's virtual private cloud. Flexibility supports CISA's hybrid deployment models without increasing the license costs.</p>
	
 Modernizing existing architectures 
	
<p>Agencies need modern features that are more complete than many IDaaS solutions provide. This includes the flexibility to run a next-generation, scalable LDAP on-premises while leveraging an IDaaS solution. ForgeRock has both deployments available to support these use cases. The ForgeRock solution also provides multiple solutions to authenticate securely into legacy apps and a robust <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT solution</a>.</p>
	
 Support for open standards 
	
<p>When there is heavy reliance on federation standards, as CISA calls out in its report, the identity vendor needs to proactively support and update the specification for standards like SAML, OIDC, and WebAuthn. ForgeRock releases updates for specification changes to standards and references the changes in release notes. This enables our customers to quickly leverage security updates and feature changes included in the specifications.</p>

 The pricing model 
	
<p>The impact of monthly surge pricing, charging by integrated apps or by multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions in use have to be eliminated from the identity space, both for scalability and to stabilize budgets. ForgeRock's license is based on annual identities for the modules purchased. This allows for agencies to budget confidently for their identity solutions. This license model also frees agencies from monthly surge pricing and reduces the complexity of the licensing model.</p>

<p>When an agency is looking to modernize their identity solution, they should look for flexibility and stability in a comprehensive identity platform that can be deployed for any core identity use case. ForgeRock is a comprehensive identity platform that will solve your hybrid identity use cases.</p>

<p>The starting whistle has gone off in the race for quantum-safe cryptography solutions. Last week, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released their <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/08/nist-standardize-encryption-algorithms-can-resist-attack-quantum-computers">draft standards</a> for post-quantum cryptography (PQC).</p>
<p>As my colleague <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/nist-standards-for-post-quantum-cryptography-are-coming-soon-what-does-this-mean-for-enterprises/">Greg Wetmore noted in July</a>, all eyes have been on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">NIST PQ competition</a> for the last several years, with the third-round finalist algorithms announced last summer, and now the release of the PQC draft standards – a major milestone in quantum readiness and the future migration to quantum-safe cryptography.</p>
<p>Despite knowing the high stakes – by most analysis, advancements in quantum computers will result in them being capable of breaking <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">traditional public key cryptography</a> within the decade – some organizations have been hesitant to begin their PQC preparations until NIST’s draft standards were released. That barrier has been crossed.</p>
<p>Now, draft standards for three algorithms are open for public comment and feedback until November 22, 2023; with the standards likely to be finalized in 2024. Once this happens, organizations will be expected to make the transition to these algorithms designed to withstand quantum computer attacks in order to protect their sensitive data. And with the fourth round of the competition still underway, it’s no surprise that the NIST release also states that “While these three will constitute the first group of post-quantum encryption standards NIST creates, they will not be the last.” So, more to come.</p>
<p>The draft standards weren’t the only quantum-related announcement last week. NIST, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) released a joint factsheet titled <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/quantum-readiness-migration-post-quantum-cryptography">Quantum-Readiness: Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/governments-across-the-globe-are-looking-to-prepare-for-and-mitigate-the-quantum-threat/">intention</a> of the joint factsheet is to further encourage – both government agencies and organizations – to begin their planning for the migration to PQC now. Why?</p>
 
 The migration will take time. The factsheet notes that “creating quantum-readiness roadmaps, conducting inventories, applying risk assessments and analysis, and engaging vendors” will take time – likely several years. Not only that, but the migration to PQC will be more complex than anything we’ve ever done before and will touch almost every piece of infrastructure. 
 Harvest now, decrypt later attacks. There is a known threat to long-life data (any sensitive data that needs to remain confidential for 10+ years) where bad actors are harvesting it today, with the intent of decrypting it once a quantum computer is capable. This same threat also exists for long-life connected devices. 
 
<p>Regardless of the nature of your organization, steps need to be taken to protect your data from the quantum threat. From inventorying cryptographic systems and assets, to creating a migration plan, to speaking with your technology vendors about their own PQ roadmap – there is much to be done and there’s no time to waste in getting started.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Money laundering, the process of making illicitly gained money appear legitimate, has far-reaching implications for the global economy. It can serve as a lifeline for criminal organizations, fostering illegal economic activity such as terrorism financing and drug trafficking. To counter this, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures are essential to a legitimate financial system. This blog post aims to provide an in-depth exploration of AML, its crucial role in today’s economic landscape, the components of an effective AML program, and how technology can aid in AML compliance.</p>
 What’s Anti-Money Laundering? 
<p>In simple terms, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. AML measures involve identifying the origins of these foreign assets, controlling well and tax evasion, monitoring suspicious activities, and reporting potential money laundering activities to the relevant financial sector and authorities.</p>
 What Are Some Ways That Money Is Laundered? 
<p>Money laundering involves a three-step process: placement, layering, and integration. In the placement stage, illicit funds are introduced into the financial system. This is often done by breaking up large amounts of cash into less conspicuous smaller sums deposited directly into a bank account or used to purchase various assets.</p>
<p>Layering is the most complex phase, involving multiple transactions to obscure the source of the laundered funds. These could include wire transfers, purchasing and selling investment instruments, or other means of distancing the dirty money from its inception. Integration is when the ‘cleaned’ money is returned to the criminal from what appear to be legitimate sources.</p>
 Can Money Laundering Be Stopped? 
<p>While stopping money laundering is challenging due to its pervasive and covert nature, AML programs can significantly deter and disrupt these illicit activities.</p>
<p>By establishing a combination of legislative measures, private banking, financial institutions, and industry know-your-customer norms, vigilant transaction monitoring, stringent reporting requirements, and promoting international cooperation, the prevalence of money laundering can be drastically reduced.</p>
 What’s the Difference Between AML, CDD, and KYC? 
<p>While AML, CDD, and KYC are all essential components of financial regulation, they have different focuses. AML refers to the laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent the act of disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate.</p>
<p>CDD, or Customer Due Diligence, is a vital part of these AML procedures, involving checks on customers to ensure they are who they claim to be and are not engaged in criminal activities.</p>
<p>KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a subset of CDD that involves verifying the identity of clients and assessing their suitability, along with the potential risks of illegal intentions towards the business relationship.</p>
 The Regulatory Framework of Anti-Money Laundering 
<p>Combating terrorist financing is not just a singular country’s problem; it is a complex, international issue requiring cohesive global efforts. Recognizing this, regulators worldwide have implemented AML laws to combat terrorist financing, foster transparency, and reduce opportunities for financial crime.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of this framework is the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html">Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations</a> – a comprehensive, 40-point guideline designed to help countries establish effective legal and regulatory measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing together.</p>
<p>Another influential anti-money laundering legislation is the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html">US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</a>. Introduced in 1970, the BSA obliges financial institutions to aid government and law enforcement agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering.</p>
<p>These efforts include reporting transactions above a set threshold and maintaining records of cash purchases. However, AML laws, while sharing a common objective to launder money less, can vary significantly between jurisdictions, creating a challenging issue for cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>The consequences of non-compliance with these AML regulations are severe, extending beyond substantial financial penalties. They can also lead to damaged reputations, loss of business, and potential civil and criminal penalties and charges for individuals involved in non-compliance.</p>
<p>Therefore, implementing a robust AML program is more than just a regulatory requirement; it’s essential for the survival and growth of financial institutions.</p>
 Impact on Cross-Border Business Transactions 
<p>Cross-border transactions can become complicated due to the variation in AML laws across jurisdictions. Navigating these disparities is crucial for businesses involved in international trade or services.</p>
<p>Understanding and adhering to the AML regulations of all affected jurisdictions can help businesses mitigate risks, avoid penalties, and maintain their international partnerships.</p>
 Cost Implications of Non-compliance 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance with AML regulations can be financially damaging. As seen in several high-profile cases like…., businesses face substantial penalties, sometimes billions of dollars.</p>
<p>In addition to fines, businesses can suffer from reputational damage, loss of customer trust, reduced operational efficiency due to increased regulatory scrutiny, and even loss of operating licenses in extreme cases.</p>
 Key Components of an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program 
<p>Establishing an effective AML program is no small feat, requiring a blend of rigorous processes, dedicated resources, and continuous monitoring. A comprehensive AML compliance and risk assessment program typically consists of several key components:</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Understanding who your customers are central to any AML compliance program. This is achieved through CDD, which involves verifying the customer’s identity, understanding their financial activities, and assessing their risk profile. In cases where a customer poses a higher risk (such as those with political influence or those from high-risk jurisdictions), businesses should implement Enhanced Due Diligence. This involves more rigorous steps to understand the customer’s wealth source, financial transactions, and business relationships. 
 Transaction monitoring systems: Transaction monitoring systems are designed to analyze customer transactions continuously. Identifying any activities that fall outside the customer’s standard behavioral patterns or appear suspicious is critical. Businesses should invest in advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning, which can swiftly analyze vast amounts of transaction data and identify patterns that might escape human detection. 
 Regular audits and AML training for employees: Regular audits are essential to ensure AML procedures are followed correctly and any compliance gaps are promptly addressed. Simultaneously, continuous AML training for employees is critical to ongoing monitoring, informing them of the latest AML legislation and regulations, emerging risks, and best practices. Businesses should make this training a regular part of their operations to maintain the highest compliance standards. 
 
 Who is Using AML? 
<p>A wide range of entities across various sectors implements AML measures:</p>
 
 Banks: The traditional banking sector is key in implementing Anti-Money Laundering measures. Banks conduct rigorous Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols to verify clients’ identities and scrutinize transactions. They also work closely with regulatory bodies to stay updated. 
 Credit Unions: Similar to banks, credit unions have a crucial role in preventing money laundering. They follow comprehensive AML procedures, including customer identification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting. These community-based institutions provide services to numerous members, making them significant gatekeepers in the fight against financial crimes. 
 Fintech Companies: As technology advances, the fintech sector has become a significant player in the financial industry. These digital platforms must implement stringent AML protocols, including automated CDD, transaction monitoring, and machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious patterns. Their digital nature demands high cybersecurity measures to prevent online financial fraud. 
 Cryptocurrency Exchanges: With the rising popularity of digital currencies, cryptocurrency exchanges are now integral to AML efforts. These platforms are often targets for illicit funds due to their relative anonymity and cross-border capabilities. Therefore, they have robust AML programs, including blockchain analysis tools, to trace transactions and detect illegal activities. 
 Non-Financial Businesses: Non-financial businesses like casinos, real estate companies, and law firms also use AML measures. For example, casinos must report any high-value transactions to regulatory authorities. At the same time, real estate companies and law firms must ensure the money used in property transactions and trust accounts is legitimate. 
 Government Agencies and Regulatory Bodies: Government agencies use AML measures to enforce compliance and track financial crimes. They are responsible for setting the AML regulations, conducting audits, levying penalties for non-compliance, and collaborating with international counterparts to combat money laundering globally. 
 
<p>By adhering to stringent AML procedures, these entities contribute to a more secure and transparent financial ecosystem. They deter criminal organizations and foster trust among customers, partners, and regulators.</p>
 Utilizing Technology for AML Compliance 
<p>The advent of technology has revolutionized the way businesses approach AML compliance. With the volume of transactions increasing exponentially, manual monitoring of financial fraud and customer due diligence processes are no longer feasible or practical. In response, other financial institutions are turning to cutting-edge technologies to enhance their AML efforts:</p>
 
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): AI and ML can analyze vast amounts of transaction data swiftly and identify patterns or anomalies in criminal economic activity that might escape human detection. This can help flag suspicious activities more accurately and in real time, enhancing the effectiveness of transaction monitoring efforts. 
 Blockchain technology: Blockchain technology can improve the traceability of transactions. Providing a tamper-proof, decentralized ledger of transactions can offer higher transparency and security to report suspicious transactions, reducing opportunities for money laundering. 
 Automation: Automating KYC and CDD processes like <a>BlockID</a> can significantly reduce the time and resources required while minimizing the risk of human error. It enables staff to focus on higher-value tasks, such as regarding suspicious activity reports investigating flagged transactions, or enhancing AML strategies. 
 
 Challenges and Solutions in AML Compliance 
<p>Implementing an effective AML program has its challenges. Data management issues stemming from transaction data’s sheer volume and complexity can hinder accurate monitoring and reporting to prevent money laundering.</p>
<p>Cross-border regulation complexities can lead to compliance issues, especially annual money laundering flows, for institutions operating in multiple jurisdictions. Also, money laundering tactics continuously evolve, requiring institutions to stay updated and adapt their strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>Overcoming these challenges to practical anti-money laundering efforts requires a combination of technological innovation, strategic planning, and international cooperation:</p>
 
 Data Management and Technology: Advanced data analytics and investing in AI and ML can help manage large volumes of transaction data effectively. Consider investing in these technologies to streamline your compliance processes and risk management. 
 Cross-Border Regulation and Collaboration: Harmonizing AML regulations and fostering international collaboration can address cross-border compliance issues. Maintain an open line of communication with regulatory bodies in your region to stay on top of new rules and understand regulatory expectations. 
 Continual Strategy Updates: Continual updates to AML strategies, in line with emerging risks and technologies, can help stay ahead of evolving money laundering tactics. Regular audits and ongoing employee training will help ensure your business remains compliant as regulations change. 
 Outsourcing AML Compliance: If managing AML compliance in-house is overwhelming, consider outsourcing to professional service providers specializing in this field. They can help ensure your business complies with the latest regulations and best practices. However, always ensure you choose a reputable provider with demonstrated knowledge and experience in AML compliance. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Enhancing global stability necessitates robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, underscored by emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. These innovations empower businesses to anticipate and mitigate risks and financial crimes, thus strengthening AML compliance.

				  When it comes to decentralized identity, Indicio is technology agnostic. This enables us to offer customers the best possible solutions to meet their exact needs.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>In a rapidly expanding field, there are many approaches to solving a multitude of use cases and requirements. This is why Indicio’s approach is to solve the customer’s problem rather than sell them a specific protocol or single technology. Within the overall framework of decentralized identity and using verifiable data to create trusted digital relationships, we are and have always been technology agnostic.</p>
<p>At present, this agnosticism applies most of all to credential formats. There is no single format — at least not yet — that meets every customer’s needs or legal requirements. So we help our customers assess what is important to their use case, for example:</p>
<p>Does regulation require them to use a particular credential type?<br>Do they need to be able to use selective disclosure?<br>Do they need to be able to use predicate proofs?<br>Do they need privacy-preserving holder binding?</p>
<p>Where preserving privacy is critical, we recommend AnonCreds, as it is the most feature rich. If regulation or interoperability require a different credential format, we’ll support that as well.</p>
<p>The same situation also exists for the protocols in an ecosystem. Our clients often have requirements that are well met by the rich interaction models and power of DIDComm-based credential exchange and communication protocols.</p>
<p>Increasingly, our clients require interoperability with the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS 2.0 standards</a>, including the OID4VCs protocols. We support these as well, and advise our customers on the best way to achieve their goals within the limits of those protocols. If a customer is already using DIDComm for its rich interaction model and protocols, they are usually able to keep those features while adding additional protocols for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Our mission is to always meet the needs of our customers and generate solutions that deliver the most benefits. For us, this means delivering a complete solution that works right “out of the box” and that they fully own and can develop on as technology evolves.</p>
<p>Providing this future flexibility is why we use and support open-source projects whenever possible. In the adoption of additional credential types and protocols, we are working with open-source collaborators to realize these goals. These collaborative efforts lift and support the community as a whole for a stronger, more capable, and broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>When it comes to deployment, we can do as much or as little as a customer’s development team needs. This is why our product range is available both as complete ecosystem solutions and as individual building blocks—and why we are continually adding blocks, new features, and full ecosystems to our product range.</p>
<p>Our most recent addition is an update to Aries Cloud Agent-Python (ACA-Py) so that it can handle <a href="https://indicio.tech/breakthrough-in-didcomm-mediation-indicio-achieves-significant-scale-with-new-solution/">thousands of interactions per minute</a>, thereby enabling verifiable credential ecosystems to rapidly scale.</p>
<p>For those curious about the technologies we have on our roadmap, here are the technologies we are asked about most often:</p>
<p>Credential types: SD-JWT, JSON-LD, OpenBadges 3.0, mDL/mDOC<br>Protocols: DIDComm v2, OID4VCI/OID4VP, WACI<br>DID Methods: did:web, did:indy, did:ion<br>Governance: DIF CredentialTrustEstablishment, eIDAS PKI, TOIP Trust Registries<br>Signature Types: RSA, ECDSA, Secp256k1</p>
<p>There is no single technology choice that will rule the entire decentralized identity landscape in every environment and across time. The important thing is that we keep our eyes on the overall value proposition: solutions that create trusted digital relationships.</p>
<p>If you have questions or would like to learn more we encourage you to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to our team.</a></p>

  <p>Just today I received an email from one of my financial services providers warning me about imposter scams and fraudsters. Their warning was to alert me that fraudsters are impersonating financial institutions and contacting their customers. My institution’s goal was to help me understand how to identify someone taking the first steps to perform<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_fraud"> identity fraud</a>, which involves gaining some user credentials or parts of my identity to commit fraud. It’s a good first step in fraud prevention, but more is needed.</p>

<p>Attackers are innovative and highly motivated to use new technologies and techniques in pursuit of a big payoff. With data from prior breaches and publicly available information, they have access to a wealth of identity tidbits, if not rich data, that they can use to commit identity fraud.&nbsp;</p>

 Our personal information is everywhere, ripe for misuse 

<p>Every month my identity monitoring service warns me about pieces of my personal information turning up on the dark web, enriching the information fraudsters need to execute their plans. This didn’t come as a huge surprise to me. According to the ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report"> 2023 Identity Breach Report</a>, users’ names and physical addresses were in at least 99% of breached records and, in the last year, there’s been a sharp increase in more valuable information, such as date of birth and protected health information (PHI). And an eye-opening 72% of U.S. breaches contained Social Security numbers.</p>

<p>With all this information, layered with artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, perpetrators gain fidelity and higher-quality information to use in their activities. They can analyze and predict the credentials I might use for one account based on what they have seen with my other accounts. What is my password selection process and what might I have created?&nbsp;</p>

<p>With bots, fraudsters gain scale and speed to carry out identity fraud attacks. In the event that I opt-in for multi-factor authentication (MFA), they can attempt to get me to click the wrong button through<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them"> MFA prompt bombing</a> attacks.</p>

<p>The fraudsters’ goal is to garner login credentials to do harm, mostly for financial purposes. If they are successful in an<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover"> account takeover (ATO)</a> attack, they can fraudulently purchase goods and services, abuse healthcare processes and claims payments, steal tax refunds, or open new bank accounts and move money around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the help of AI, cybercriminals are also creating synthetic identities using pieces of information gleaned from identity theft. A synthetic identity may use a valid Social Security number and birthdate and combine it with fraudulent information, such as a fake name, to obtain a new credit card. Using bits of information either stolen or obtained from public sources (social media posts can be a rich source for pet names, schools, birthdays, and much more), can enable identity fraud if organizations do not have controls in place to help prevent it — whether the fraudsters have pieces of information or even full credentials.</p>

 How IAM can stop identity fraud 

<p>In addition to facilitating the login process, identity and access management (IAM) systems can perform a variety of actions to detect and prevent identity fraud and other misuse of a user's identity that results from a successful ATO attack.</p>

<p>IAM systems can generate risk scores during the login process, calculated based on IP address, geolocation, and other user behaviors. These and other access patterns can also identify and block bot attacks, such as credential stuffing, password spraying, and MFA prompt bombing.</p>

<p>Even if a bad actor has the right credentials, IAM can detect anomalous behavior, such as an unusual location or device, and demand further proof of identity, known as step-up authentication. With MFA, the identity system moves from basic authentication to include an out-of-channel factor from, say, a mobile device authenticator app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Implementing<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication"> passwordless authentication</a> can reduce the risk even further, making one piece of the authentication a cryptographic function instead something on a sticky note. With different factors to reduce risk in the user authentication process,<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration"> identity orchestration</a> comes into play to build a workflow that integrates risk factors and tailors the user experience based on the goal of reducing identity fraud.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year we took a big step towards improving customers’ experience with Apple devices by providing companies with the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices</a>. This plug-in enables&nbsp;Microsoft Entra ID users to have device-wide single sign-on (SSO) for all apps and websites in a consistent, secure, and seamless way. Best of all, it always stays up to date with the latest Microsoft technologies as they evolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're announcing a powerful enhancement to these capabilities - Platform SSO for macOS. This enhancement is designed to make using your macOS devices more seamless and secure than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO is an enhancement to the existing SSO Extension capabilities for macOS, which allows users to sign into their Macs using passwordless credentials or passwords managed and validated by Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabled by Platform SSO and powered by Microsoft’s Enterprise SSO plug-in, Platform Credentials for macOS allow users to go passwordless by using Touch ID to unlock their device and be signed into Entra ID under the hood using a device bound cryptographic key. It uses phishing-resistant credentials, based on the technology we use for Windows Hello for Business, and backed by Apple’s hardware already in your device. This will save your organization money by removing the need for security keys or other hardware. Once you sign in, the existing Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in continues to do its magic keeping you signed into&nbsp;the apps you use for work, but with a credential that’s safer and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those not ready to completely remove passwords from Entra ID sign-ins, Platform SSO for macOS allows organizations to synchronize their local account password and their Entra ID passwords so users can use one credential across their macOS device. No more remembering separate passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO for macOS also allows admins to configure the end-user authentication method, specifying either the phishing-resistant credential or a traditional password as the authentication method.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplified Management&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this update, we’ve reimagined the employee onboarding experience on Macs for users of Microsoft Intune. Platform SSO for macOS simplifies the employee onboarding experience on Microsoft Intune by enabling a familiar and native macOS experience that Mac users will love. As an example, it eliminates the need to launch the Company Portal app to access resources protected by Conditional Access on Intune-managed Macs. To learn more about how Microsoft Intune is innovating in Apple device management, see <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-intune-blog/10-ways-microsoft-intune-improves-apple-device-management/ba-p/3766718">10 ways Microsoft Intune improves Apple device management - Microsoft Community Hub.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming public preview of Platform SSO for macOS will work with Microsoft Intune. Other MDM providers will be coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Helping You Go Zero Trust&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our integration with the Secure Enclave included in modern Macs, the passwordless authentication method offers a powerful means for enterprises to advance their zero trust security objectives. By eliminating passwords as a primary attack vector, organizations can significantly enhance their security postures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The credentials used in passwordless systems are bound to physical hardware. This requires attackers to gain physical access to specific hardware rather than steal login information, making unauthorized access even more challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Prepare&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently in private preview with select customers today with public preview coming soon. If you’d like to be considered to be added to the private preview, please contact <a href="mailto:macos-sso-feedback@microsoft.com">Platform SSO for macOS feedback</a>. Spaces are limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can prepare your organization for Platform SSO for macOS by taking the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Deploy the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in.</a>&nbsp; 
 Ensure users are registered for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted">Microsoft Entra ID multifactor authentication;</a> for the best experience, we recommend using Microsoft Authenticator.&nbsp; 
 Update macOS devices to macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Summing up&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO for macOS is a big step towards enhancing the SSO experience and security of the Macs in your organization. Users benefit from SSO through a hardware-bound key or by signing in to a Mac using their Microsoft Entra ID password. The integration with the Secure Enclave enables hardware-bound, passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication on macOS devices advancing enterprises' zero trust security objectives. At public preview launch, Platform SSO for macOS can be natively managed with Microsoft Intune, with support for other MDM providers coming soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this latest feature, credential issuers can now request specific data from holders if they’re missing information to issue a credential such as their last name, email, or date of birth. This functionality makes the issuing process more efficient while ensuring all of the necessary details are up to date before issuing a credential. </p><p>The issuer would request the missing information by simply sharing a QR code or link to the holder. The holder would then present the missing information from their Dock Wallet and once the issuer receives all of the information, the credential will automatically be sent afterwards.</p> Use Case Examples for the Request Data Feature <p>There are many instances where issuers would need to request missing data from holders to validate information associated with credentials. This ensures that the data is accurate and strengthens the overall credibility of the issued credentials.</p><p>University Transcripts</p><p>A university may want to issue digital transcripts to their graduates, but it might not have the most current contact details for each graduate. By using <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a>, the university can request the missing information directly from the alumni. Once they provide the needed details, the university can issue the credentials.</p><p>Professional Certifications</p><p>A professional certification board, such as one for engineers or medical professionals, may need to issue digital certification credentials to its members. However, if the board doesn't have the most recent details like the updated email, they can use Dock Certs to request this information. Once the members update their details, the digital certifications can be issued.</p><p>Event Management</p><p>For a large conference or event, the organizers may wish to issue digital attendance certificates or badges to attendees. If they lack certain details (like a correct email address or full name), they can request this information from attendees from Dock's platform. Once the attendee provides the missing information, their digital attendance certificate or badge can be automatically sent.</p> Request Data Process <p>Successo Academy provides an online course for people to learn about Content Marketing. They want to confirm the full name of participants that will be added on the credential and their preferred email address. </p>  Successo Academy uses <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> to create a custom credential template and selects Add Manually. From here, they can choose which field is missing and request the information from the credential recipient. In this example, they request their full name and email in order to issue the course completion certificate.   <p>2. Successo Academy can preview the message before sending it to the holder Anna Ly. </p><p>3. Anna receives the credential request in her email and scans the QR code with the Dock Wallet. She selects the DID she wants to use to submit the information. The QR code can only be scanned once. Anna fills in the missing information.</p><p>4. Once Successo Academy receives the information, the credential is automatically issued to Anna.</p> About Dock <p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential platform makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the <a href="https://www.dock.io/certs-api?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs API</a>, the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/dashboard?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs no-code web app</a>, an <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app?ref=blog.dock.io">ID wallet</a> and a dedicated blockchain.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th August to 28th&nbsp;August <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope crypto regulatory newsletter, where we navigate the intricate maze of rules and developments shaping the future of digital currencies worldwide.</p><p>In today’s edition, we kick off with the United Kingdom’s stringent new rules following FATF guidelines and contrast that with New Zealand’s more cautious, observant stance.</p><p>We’ll also cover India’s call for global regulatory unity at the recent G20 summit and wrap up with the United Arab Emirates’ flexible approach centered on Dubai’s recent&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Now, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Unpacking the Global Patchwork of Crypto Regulations <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is as varied as it is intricate, with countries worldwide adopting distinct approaches. From stringent measures in the United Kingdom to cautious observation in New Zealand, the debate is global and complex. Add India’s plea for international unity and Dubai’s flexible stance, and it’s clear that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work for a foreseeable future.</p><p>The UK: The United Kingdom has set a strong regulatory precedent by imposing the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule on all crypto businesses. Under this rule, crypto firms must share customer data during transactions, a move reportedly aimed at combating financial crimes like money laundering.</p><p>New Zealand: However, not all nations are taking the U.K.’s hardline approach. New Zealand, for example, is advocating for restraint and careful study before enacting stringent regulations. This nuanced view, outlined in a report by the country’s Finance and Expenditure Committee, highlights the discord in international perspectives on crypto governance.</p><p>India: Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pressing for a global perspective. Calling for a broad regulatory approach that considers impacts beyond financial stability, PM Modi’s comments were a focal point at the recent G20 summit. His vision for international cooperation adds another layer to the ongoing discussions about how best to regulate the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>UAE: Dubai, too, is making waves in the regulatory sphere. The city’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority recently updated its rulebook, easing licensing requirements for staking services. This flexible approach further complicates the global regulatory landscape, showing that countries are far from unified in their&nbsp;methods.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1694786889838891210?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>So, where does this leave us? The quest for balanced, effective, and globally cohesive crypto regulation is ongoing. Each country’s unique approach adds another piece to an already complex puzzle. The challenge now is to find a way for these disparate pieces to fit together, promoting both innovation and security in the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies.</p><p>Now, let’s zero in on two of these major developments and analyze them in&nbsp;detail.</p> New Zealand Takes a Balanced Approach to Crypto Regulation <p>New Zealand is setting itself apart in how countries are dealing with cryptocurrency. A detailed report from its Finance and Expenditure Committee suggests watching and learning rather than rushing to set strict rules. The report sees the value and risks in crypto and recommends learning from what works and doesn’t work globally.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1694786889838891210?s=20">Image Source</a>) Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The benefit of New Zealand’s approach is clear: it leaves space for new ideas to grow. By not setting up too many rules too quickly, the country could become a go-to place for crypto businesses looking for a more open environment.</p><p>But this careful approach also has downsides. Without set rules, things can feel uncertain. For investors and companies, clear guidelines often make it easier to plan for the future. New Zealand’s wait-and-see strategy could turn away those looking for quick, clear&nbsp;answers.</p><p>In short, New Zealand aims for a careful balance between letting the crypto market grow and keeping it in check. Whether this approach will serve as a strong model or a cautionary tale remains to be&nbsp;seen.</p> UK Adopts FATF Standards, Broad Implications Loom <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom is set to enforce the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing rules, popularly known as the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Starting September 1, UK-based crypto businesses must share customer information for transactions, aligning the country with 2019 FATF standards. This move comes as part of a slew of upcoming regulations in the UK’s crypto landscape, including new FCA marketing standards this&nbsp;October.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1692589864665928125?s=20">Image Source</a>) Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects   Global Trust: Aligning with FATF standards could boost international trust in the UK’s crypto&nbsp;market.  Risk Mitigation: The rules aim to curb illicit activities, thereby making the ecosystem safer for investors.   Negative Aspects   Compliance Burden: Companies, especially startups, may find the compliance costs burdensome.  Privacy Concerns: Sharing customer data may raise privacy issues, potentially deterring participation in the crypto&nbsp;market.  <p>This move is a telling sign of how nations are striving for a regulated yet thriving crypto environment. However, the increased oversight could serve as a double-edged sword, enhancing legitimacy while also stifling innovation and flexibility.</p><p>In navigating this complex regulatory landscape, Shyft Veriscope offers a solution that could ease the transition. Its automated features simplify compliance, mitigating risk without adding undue burdens on businesses.

In addition to the rich protocols within DIDComm, Indicio’s products also support protocols focused solely on credential issuance and presentation such as OID4VC.</p>
<p>A mediator provides a cloud-based connection point to send and receive requests between mobile holders and credential issuers and verifiers. As the ability to hold a verifiable credential on a mobile device is central to sharing and verifying data, mediation is a critical element of any decentralized identity deployment using DIDComm. DIDComm based protocols allow individuals using a combination of mobile phones and other internet-enabled devices to be full participants in trusted interactions. Reliable mediation ensures a smooth interaction between all parties. The Indicio Proven™ Mediator comes from Indicio’s extensive experience in building award-winning Trusted Digital Ecosystems for enterprise clients.</p>
<p>“Mediation is an essential component to any decentralized identity deployment designed for rich interactions,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “With the Indicio Proven Mediator, we’re providing Google customers with the result of our years of successful work on mediation — a product that reduces development roadmaps and deployment anxiety and enables you to grow your ecosystem solution to meet increased demand.”</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">open sourced the base code</a> for the Mediator to the Hyperledger Foundation Aries project in 2021 and subsequently deployed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">free Indicio Mediator</a> for shared use to develop and test solutions. A key operational difference between the public Indicio Mediator and the Proven Mediator on Google Cloud is that the former is shared with other users and is unsuitable for business deployment where 100 percent availability is essential. The Proven Mediator deepens Indicio’s commitment to bringing open-source, Web3, decentralized solutions to the hybrid cloud, making it easier for customers and partners to confidently deploy enterprise-grade solutions. Indicio also offers a <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/mediator-agent-training/">Mediator Agent Workshop</a> to help teams gain a deeper understanding of Mediator technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven™ Mediator joins <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-node?project=sunlit-apricot-360315">Indicio NoDe</a>, a quick-start solution for setting up and operating a node on any Hyperledger Indy network, on Google Cloud Marketplace, and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-proven-sandbox?project=indicio-public">Indicio Proven Sandbox</a>, the easiest way to create and build verifiable credential pilots, demos, and architectures.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>Or, Passwordless as the 0th Factor of Authentication</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication is kind of hot right now, even though “passwordless” predates the password—much like horse-drawn carriages predated cars (which were first known as “horseless carriages”). But after witnessing a groundswell of support for new passwordless methods such as <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/">YubiKey</a>, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO Passkey</a> (not to be confused with Apple Passkey), and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication">MS passwordless</a> authentication methods, I resolved to determine for myself whether that brave new world that has such security in it had in fact arrived. In short, we’re still not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, my recent search for KuppingerCole Analysts. As many of you are aware, I took some needed time off before joining KuppingerCole Analysts — a kind of self-directed sabbatical. During that time, when I found any job listing that seemed interesting, I’d naturally apply. That usually meant setting up an account with the employer and then connecting to LinkedIn to autofill my profile and work experience. But the authorization flow on LinkedIn requires username and password.</p>
<p>The risk of Zero Factor Authentication</p>
<p>I panicked! I didn’t know my password—Apple Keychain had it. So, I scrambled to authenticate to Keychain on my phone and then realized, “dang it! How do I transfer this ridiculous password that’s longer than my screen onto this web browser??” I thought about copying and pasting the password somewhere I could see it in a large, easy to read font—but then my Apple Passkey is out there in the universe! I then realized I could go get the MacBook I sync my Keychain to, start the flow over from there, then open Keychain on that MacBook and copy and paste from there (note: this is an embellishment—I don’t actually own a set of security-separated MacBooks, but it illustrates a point).</p>
<p>Hmm… I mean, I normally like having options, as long as one of them is good. But, in this case I realized that in pursuit of multi-factor authentication I had ended up with none—I now call it Zero Factor Authentication (ZFA). I guess that’s what is meant by Zero Trust? Anyway, after a couple such occurrences, I reset my LinkedIn password back to something I actually know.</p>
<p>What kind of factor is passwordless?</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be thinking, that if had only used a FIDO Passkey instead, things would have gone smoothly. But, allow the pun: not so fast. A FIDO Passkey uses a Private Key that resides on my device. This begs invoking the “practitioner’s refrain”: is this something I know? is it something I have? is it something I am? OK, it’s something I have, so that’s 1-for-3 and arguably stronger than something I know.</p>
<p>So, what kind of factor is passwordless? The way I see it, it’s a flow that provides evidence to a website you’re visiting that you have successfully enabled your device to sign a challenge that the site just sent. See? But again, what kind of factor is that? Well, it’s “something special you enable a pre-registered device to do,” which strongly implies to the website that it can consequently continue with the operation at hand … conveniently. So, maybe passwordless defies our decades-long adherence to the 3-pronged approach to identity verification; maybe passwordless is more of a root factor—say, a “0th“ factor?</p>
<p>The absence of a priori technology agreements</p>
<p>The quality of passwords that continually escapes our security consciousness is their utility; no other authentication method even comes close to the utility of a password. Passwords can be used anytime, anywhere, by anybody for whatever reason, and across any technology. Passwords don’t require a priori agreement on technology or standards. These qualities must also be part of any passwordless solution if it is to become ubiquitous.</p>
<p>This all reminded me of a Lex Fridman <a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/public/lex-fridman-podcast-artificial-intelligence-ai/124-stephen-wolfram-fundamental-theory-of-physics-life-and-the-universe">podcast</a> I once heard during which Steven Wolfram discussed his ideas on entropy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">2nd Law of Thermodynamics</a>. In Wolfram’s interpretation, this law predicts that closed systems prefer to settle in a state that appears chaotic from the human perspective, while eschewing states that we find much simpler and more organized.</p>
<p>To apply Wolfram’s definition here, passwords exist because that’s the state the system is most likely to be in, whereas passwordless is a state that requires vast amounts of energy or luck to arrive at and sustain. Why do we still use passwords? It’s elementary, everyone: entropy; or as I call it “The Second Law of AuthN Dynamics.”</p>
<p>For the record, I’m still working out the First Law, so stay tuned! One way you can do that is by attending my next (and first) webinar at KuppingerCole, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2023/09/digital-transformation-for-finance-with-biometrics">Digital Transformation in Financial Services Using Biometrics</a>” on September 19. I’ll be hosting Pascal Tavernier, Identity &amp; Access Management Architect, Executive Director at UBS, to get his insights on how to make strong forms of authentication ubiquitous. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me with questions or comments.</p>

       Federated Learning 
<p>In addition to UNISOT’s blockchain prowess, federated learning plays a vital role in empowering large enterprises. <a href="http://(https://seafoodchain.no/federated-learning-in-the-fishing-and-seafood-industry/)">Federated learning</a> is a machine learning approach that enables training machine learning models across multiple devices or servers while keeping data decentralized and secure. This technology allows enterprises to collaborate and gain insights from collective data without sharing sensitive information.</p>
 Key Benefits of Federated Learning: 
      <p>Privacy Preservation</p>
<p>For large enterprises, data privacy is of paramount importance. Federated learning ensures that sensitive data remains on-premises, never leaving the organization’s servers. This way, enterprises can collaborate on improving machine learning models without compromising data confidentiality.</p>
      <p>Enhanced Model Performance</p>
<p>By pooling knowledge from various entities, federated learning enables the creation of robust and accurate machine learning models. The aggregated insights from diverse data sources result in better models that can benefit all participating enterprises.</p>
       Web3 Technology 
<p>Web3 technology is the next evolution of the internet, emphasizing decentralization, transparency and user ownership of data. UNISOT Web3 Supply Chain Traceability Platform, implementing Blockchain and AI in the form of Federated Learning, creates a powerful ecosystem that empowers large enterprises further.</p>
 Key Benefits of Web3 Technology: 
      <p>Decentralization and Transparency</p>
<p>Web3 technology leverages blockchain’s decentralization to create transparent and trustless interactions. In the context of supply chains, this means verifiable and auditable records of every transaction, providing unparalleled transparency for enterprises and their customers.</p>
      <p>User-Centric Data Control</p>
<p>With Web3, organizations and individuals have greater control over their data, deciding what information to share and with whom. For large enterprises collaborating on federated learning models, this user-centric approach ensures that data contributors have ownership and agency over their valuable information.</p>
       <p>UNISOT opens a world of opportunities for large enterprises seeking to optimize their supply chains, enhance operational efficiency and foster customer loyalty. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, businesses can create a seamless, transparent and secure ecosystem that drives growth and success in the modern digital landscape.</p>

<p>Framing matters. How you frame an issue or picture determines what you include and what you leave out, how the relationships between the different elements present themselves, and therefore what you focus your attention on.</p><p>The Mona Lisa’s hands are, no doubt, beautifully painted. But would this picture have achieved its iconic world-wide status if the hands were all we were looking&nbsp;at?</p><p>Today we’ve got a ‘Mona Lisa hands situation’ with personal data. The issues have been framed in such a way that the full significance and opportunity of what is unfolding is being left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Two common narratives about personal data illustrate this problem. The first is the classic ‘corporate asset’ picture of personal data, which creates a story that goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Data, including personal data, is one of the modern corporation’s greatest assets because the analytics-driven insights it generates can drive innovation, improve marketing targeting, and provide competitive edge (especially if other corporations can’t get their hands on the data that you can). Therefore, the corporation needs to amass as much data as it can, and policy makers need to support corporations in these efforts as much as they can — because this is the route to economy-wide innovation and growth which will benefit us&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>This, basically, was thinking behind the current Government’s earlier (but now defunct) attempts to take data in “a new direction”. [LINK] It also lies behind many of today’s biggest problems as they relate to personal data including corporate agendas focused on data monetisation that drive them to invade peoples’ privacy and abuse of the power it provides. Cambridge Analytica springs to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>In response to this narrative, another counter-narrative has grown up. It goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Organisations’ unrestrained collection and use of data has resulted in multiple abuses of power and privacy and an unfair share of rewards. Therefore individuals should be given more control over the data that organisations collect about them and these rights should be legally enshrined in legislation such as&nbsp;GDPR.”</blockquote><p>At one level, these two different narratives are complete opposites. The first ‘corporate asset’ narrative focuses on commercial benefits unleashed for corporations; the second ‘human rights’ narrative focuses on laws and policies designed to counter and ameliorate the harms caused by corporations’ over-zealous pursuit of financial gain.</p><p>On the other hand, they are both organisation-centric in their underlying assumptions. They both assume that what happens in the world of personal data revolves entirely around how organisations collect and use it. To this degree, they are like the Mona Lisa’s hands. They come as a pair, the one being the mirror image opposite of the&nbsp;other.</p><p>And as narratives, neither is actually ‘wrong’. They are indeed part of the picture. But focusing on them alone means missing what it has really got to&nbsp;say.</p><p>Only if you zoom out to see the bigger picture — the one that includes the Mona Lisa’s face — can the limitations of this organisation-centric framing be seen. This reframing of the narrative goes like&nbsp;this.</p> A system trapped by its&nbsp;history <p>Our current data ecosystem is trapped by its history, with its total dependence on the organisation-centric database.</p><p>With the organisation-centric database, organisations collect and generate data which they place in their systems and use to add value in various ways. The organisation-centric database was a game-changing invention. It was how the data economy developed. It is still how organisations use data to add value and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. It is immensely valuable and important.</p><p>But it has a design flaw in its very foundations. At a certain point, it cannot help but run slap-bang into the essential nature of data e.g. that data doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used; that the same data points can be used by many different parties for many different purposes.</p><p>So the way our data ecosystem has evolved means that it has hit a systemic brick wall. For the full potential of data to be realised it has to be shared. But the organisation-centric database stands in the way of&nbsp;this.</p><p>People are trying to address this problem in many ways, for example by seeking to create data ‘markets’ or ‘Open Spaces’ or initiatives around Open&nbsp;Data.</p> The problem of personal&nbsp;data <p>However, all these ways of getting round the problem hit another fundamental snag when it comes to personal data. Data use and sharing raises important questions relating to privacy, ethics and human rights. Laws such as GDPR have been passed to establish and protect individuals’ rights in these areas. It has been determined that unlike virtually every other corporate asset, personal data is not the organisation’s private property that it can do anything it likes&nbsp;with.</p><p>These issues relating to privacy, ethics, human rights and data protection are big enough when data use is restricted only to organisation-centric silos. They explode out of control once we start trying to share personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Again, many attempts have been made to address these issues, virtually all of them based on the human rights narrative summarised above. But in the end, all these attempts really do is throw sand into the gears of efficient data operations.</p> A fundamental structural question <p>What’s needed is to find a way to share data that respects individuals’ rights and retains their trust, but which also works efficiently, so that they become mutually supporting rather than mutually opposing.</p><p>This is not just a moral, ethical, human rights and governance issue. It is also a structural issue. It relates to the structure and architecture of the data ecosystem itself.</p><p>The structure of today’s organisation-centric data ecosystem is a bit like a redwood forest, full of towering trees, each a vertical silo in its own right, but without any roots connecting them in the soil. (Or you could think of this structure as a set of buildings made up only of pillars with no floors connecting them.)</p><p>Within this system, when it comes to data, individuals are tied to the organisations they have data relationships with. Their data is held by the organisation and the individual cannot go elsewhere with it. This is like the feudal system where serfs were tied to the&nbsp;land.</p> The need for a new layer of personal data infrastructure <p>To unleash the full potential of personal data — to enable safe, efficient data sharing — we need end data serfdom so that individuals can collect, store, use, manage and share their own data independently of the organisations that collect and use data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This isn’t just about giving individuals the right to ask for their data to be ported from one siloed organisation to another, as in Open Banking. It is about equipping individuals with their own databases for their own data which operate independently of and outside of organisations’ software systems and estates. So that the data becomes the individual’s asset, as well as a corporate asset with shared rights as defined by terms of service and data sharing agreements approved by the individual.</p><p>As well as safely storing individuals’ data (for example for their own use), these personal databases need to do something else: they need to enable individuals to share their data with other parties if they wish to — including other organisations.</p><p>What this does is transform the architecture and structure of the data ecosystem. All the existing separate, isolated, parallel data silos remain just as they are, fulfilling their old functions. But a new ingredient — a new layer — is added to the system: a data sharing network with each individual acting as a data sharing node within the network, connecting that individual to all the entities she has data relationships with. This is what personal data store infrastructure does: change the structure of the system to enable safe, efficient data sharing that unleashes the full personal, social and economic potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>To continue the analogy from above, this new personal data store infrastructure places a new mycelial network under each of the redwood trees in the forest, enabling the exchange of nutrients and information between them — in a way that also empowers the citizen and slices through all the moral, ethical, human rights and governance issues that were previously blocking the system’s efficient working.</p> Win-win economic&nbsp;benefits <p>Economically speaking, this structural change opens the door to a productivity and innovation revolution which is potentially as big as that created by mass production in the early 20th century. (It operates by the same principles). But most people, stuck as they are with organisation-centric blinkers to their vision, simply cannot see it, just as craft producers could not see the potential of standardised parts and moving assembly&nbsp;lines.</p><p>The economic revolution arises because today’s organisation-centric silos generate massive, system-wide duplication of effort and cost. Just as craft producers were piling on cost by continually re-working every item they hand-produced in order to fit them together, so today’s organisations are each duplicating the effort and costs needed to do basically the same things with much of the same data. In the meantime, they are also massively restricting the potential uses of this&nbsp;data.</p><p>Mydex has outlined the economic opportunities opened up by the structural change we are talking about in our White Paper on<a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf"> The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>. Actually, there are seven different economic revolutions all bound up together in a mutually reinforcing way. But basically they boil down to a very simple insight. If individuals are equipped with tools that enable them to safely bring their own data with them to data relationships — including data previously generated and used by other organisations — then layer upon layer of duplicated cost and effort can be stripped out of the workings of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Of course, these tools are what is provided by the personal data&nbsp;store.</p> Conclusion <p>Different frames generate different pictures which in turn create different action agendas. The ‘corporate asset’ framing of personal data creates its own particular ‘therefore’: therefore organisations need to accumulate and monetise as much data as they can. The human rights framing of personal data creates a mirror-image opposite: therefore individuals need to have legally backed rights to exert some control over what these organisations do with their data. These, together, are the Mona Lisa’s&nbsp;hands.</p><p>But if you reframe the personal data picture to include her face, in context, a very different picture emerges with an equally different ‘therefore’: therefore we need to build a person-centric, citizen-empowering view where personal data also becomes a personal asset; where every individual is equipped with their own, independent personal data store. Equipping citizens in this way should be seen as a vital 21st century infrastructure project, just as providing water, electricity, road and rail transport were seen in their&nbsp;day.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-do-you-think-of-the-mona-lisas-hands-and-other-such-problems-bfc284bee919">What do you think of the Mona Lisa’s hands?

 Introduction 
<p>Cybersecurity is no longer just about setting a strong password or having an encrypted connection. As digital threats have evolved, so too have the mechanisms to counteract them. Continuous authentication offers a fresh perspective, moving beyond the initial login verification to ensure secure identity verification a user remains genuine throughout their session.</p>
<p>How can organizations maintain top-notch security as threats become more intricate without hampering user experience? That’s exactly what we are going to cover in this blog post.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Evolving Security Paradigm: The evolution of cybersecurity from simple password-based protection to continuous authentication reflects the need for a dynamic approach that monitors user behavior throughout their session to counteract evolving threats. 
 Integration and Fortification: Continuous authentication’s strength lies in integration with other security systems, such as intrusion detection, firewalls, and SIEM, forming a multi-layered defense strategy against cyber threats and minimizing potential breaches. 
 Balancing Costs and Benefits: While initial costs are associated with implementing continuous authentication, the potential savings from preventing breaches, reducing downtimes, and enhancing user trust make it a strategic choice with a clear Return on Investment (ROI). 
 
 The Evolution of Authentication Methods 
<p>The evolution of authentication methods has responded to the ever-growing sophistication of cyber threats. Here’s a look at how these methods have developed over time:</p>
 
 Password-based authentication: Once upon a time, a strong password was deemed the gatekeeper of digital information. But as hacking tools improved, merely having a complex password combination wasn’t enough. Intruders found ways to decipher logic credentials, leading to unauthorized breaches and compromised passwords. 
 Two-factor &amp; Multi-factor authentication: Recognizing the limitations of single-password protection, the digital security community introduced multi-layered authentication verifications. This involved not only something users know (password) but also something they have (a mobile device, for instance) or something they are (biometrics). 
 Biometrics: Biometrics brought forth unique identifiers such as fingerprints, retina scans, and facial recognition. These, being unique to individuals, offered a more personalized security approach. But, even then, once authenticated, the user had unlimited access until logout. 
 
<p>Our journey in the authentication realm began with simple password systems called single-factor authentication. As threats evolved, so did the checks, leading to two-factor authentication, knowledge-based authentication (like secret questions), and possession-based authentication (like smart cards or tokens).<br>
While all these methods offer levels of protection, they’re typically static, emphasizing the need for the dynamic verification processes we see today.</p>
 Integration with Other Security Systems 
<p></p>
<p>Continuous authentication, while powerful on its own, achieves its full potential when integrated with other security systems. Here’s how such integration can fortify your defense against cyber threats:</p>
 
 Integration with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): IDS ensures that any abnormal behavior can be flagged in real-time, even if authenticated. This proactive approach drastically reduces the window of opportunity for malicious actors. 
 Empowering Firewalls: Firewalls are the first line of defense against cyber threats. They can be more adaptive when fed with continuous authentication functionality and data, allowing them to respond quickly to potential threats. 
 Unified Dashboard with SIEM Systems: Integrating continuous authentication with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems creates a unified dashboard where multiple security events can be monitored and analyzed concurrently, ensuring no threat slips through the gaps. 
 
<p>By fusing user authentication with these vital security components, organizations can establish a multi-layered defense strategy that efficiently safeguards their digital landscape against evolving cyber risks.</p>
 Cost Implications and ROI 
<p></p>
<p>The financial implications of implementing continuous authentication are twofold:</p>
 
 First, there’s the direct cost associated with setting up the system, which includes the technology, infrastructure, and manpower. 
 Second, there are indirect savings – reduced potential losses from breaches, decreased downtimes, and enhanced user trust. 
 
<p>The ROI for continuous authentication becomes evident when weighed against the financial and reputational damage caused by data breaches – which can run into millions or even billions of dollars. For decision-makers, understanding this balance is crucial.</p>
<p>The initial investment in a continuous authentication solution can prevent far more significant potential losses, making it a strategic choice rather than just a cost.</p>
 User Education and Training 
<p>While technology forms the backbone of continuous authentication, users significantly influence its efficacy. Organizations should prioritize user education and training. By making users aware of the reasons behind constant checks and their benefits, resistance to adoption can be reduced.</p>
<p>Training sessions can familiarize users with the new processes, helping them understand the nuances and the importance of their role in this system. Cultivating a security-first mindset ensures that the authentication system functions seamlessly and that individual users are partners in the organization’s security endeavors, not just passive participants.</p>
 Future Innovations in Continuous Authentication 
<p>The realm of continuous authentication is ripe for innovations. With advancements in AI, the capacity for real-time behavioral analysis is set to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>Biometrics, too, is seeing a surge in research, with possibilities ranging from gait analysis to biometric authentication to heartbeat recognition.</p>
<p>The most exciting frontier is quantum computing. With its ability to process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, quantum computers can revolutionize how the authentication process analyzes and responds to potential cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Such advancements ensure that continuous authentication remains adaptive, evolving with the ever-shifting cybersecurity landscape.</p>
 Comparison with Traditional Methods 
<p>Continuous authentication methods and traditional methods clearly distinguish their efficacy. Traditional methods, like single-factor authentication, rely on one-time checks, making them susceptible to breaches post-verification.</p>
<p>In contrast, continuous authentication remains vigilant throughout a user session, offering dynamic protection. While traditional methods might be less resource-intensive upfront, they can be costly in the long run, given their vulnerability to breaches.</p>
<p>Continuous risk-based authentication, with its initial investment, offers a more fortified defense. For organizations making a choice, the question becomes: “Is it more prudent to invest now and be secure or save now and risk potential breaches?”</p>
<p>Now that we got familiar with the evolution of authentication methods let’s explore deeper what Continuous Authentication exactly is.</p>
 Understanding Continuous Authentication 
<p>Unlike earlier methods, continuous risk-based authentication isn’t a one-time identity verification. It actively and unobtrusively monitors users, ensuring they’re who they claim to be every second of their session. This approach enhances security and aligns with the modern demand for seamless user experiences.</p>
<p>The fundamental cornerstone of this method is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-based_authentication">risk-based authentication</a>. Instead of merely accepting a user post-login, the system consistently evaluates the risk associated with the user’s behavior and actions. Depending on the perceived threat, it either allows access or triggers additional security measures.</p>
 Specific Threats Continuous Authentication Mitigates 
<p>Continuous authentication addresses several modern-day cyber threats that more traditional authentication methods might overlook.</p>
<p>One looming threat is session hijacking, where a malefactor takes over a user’s session post-authentication. This method bypasses initial login checks, making continuous verification crucial.</p>
<p>Then there’s the risk posed by insiders – employees with malicious intent or compromised accounts. User authentication helps detect unusual behavioral patterns, ensuring that an insider doesn’t misuse their privileges.</p>
<p>Lastly, while credentials might be compromised, mimicking user behavior throughout a session is a tall order, making continuous checks a robust deterrent against such breaches.</p>
<p>Now that we have a brief understanding of what continuous authentication is, let’s delve into key components of how it works.</p>
 How Continuous Authentication Works 
<p>Continuous account Authentication offers a sophisticated and dynamic approach to verifying identities. This multi-faceted process leverages various techniques and factors to ensure ongoing user validation:</p>
 
 Behavioral Biometrics: Everyone has unique ways they interact with their devices. Some might type rapidly, others more deliberately. These interactions, like keystroke dynamics or mouse movement patterns, are invaluable for continuous verification behavioral biometric authentication. These patterns remain consistent over time and are challenging to replicate. 
 Contextual Attributes: The context surrounding user activity offers numerous clues. Is the user logging in from a previously unrecognized device? Is the IP address from a different country than usual? Such deviations can indicate a potential breach of user identity verification and are considered in real-time by continuous authentication systems. 
 Time-based Patterns: Humans are creatures of habit. If an employee routinely accesses the system during office hours, a sudden login at an odd hour could be considered suspicious behavior. Continual monitoring allows for instant risk assessment based on these patterns. 
 Machine Learning &amp; AI: The beauty of continuous authentication lies in its learning capabilities. Using AI, the system adapts to evolving and continuous user authentication behaviors, ensuring that genuine activities are rarely flagged and anomalies are swiftly identified. 
 
 Continuous Authentication with Typing Biometrics 
<p>Typing biometrics offers a unique dimension to continuous authentication. It isn’t merely about the password entered but how it’s typed: the rhythm, speed, and finger pressure used by keystrokes – can be as unique as a fingerprint.</p>
<p>The technology captures these nuances, creating a behavioral profile for users. Over time, systems recognize this pattern, ensuring that replicating the typing pattern becomes a formidable challenge even if someone knows your password. When integrated into continuous user authentication frameworks, such biometric data provides a dynamic layer of security that’s subtle and powerful.</p>
<p>Moving forward, it’s time to look deeper into the advantages of continuous authentication and what makes it a very important security solution.</p>
 Advantages of Continuous Authentication 
<p>Here are some of the most common advantages of continuous user authentication:</p>
 
 Enhanced Security: Continuous authentication is akin to having a security guard who doesn’t just check IDs at the entrance and ensures only authorized personnel act within the premises. Continuously verifying users minimizes the window of opportunity for malicious activities. 
 User Experience: One of the main drawbacks of heightened security has often been compromised user experience. Continuous user authentication sidesteps this by working seamlessly in the background, ensuring constant security checks do not inconvenience genuine users. 
 Adaptable Security: Different users might present different risk levels. Continuous authentication scales its scrutiny based on perceived risk, ensuring that high-risk actions get attention. 
 Reduction in False Alarms: Traditional systems might flag genuine actions as threats, leading to unnecessary disruptions. By understanding the user better, continuous authentication reduces such false positives. 
 
<p>Embracing these benefits of continuous authentication fortifies an organization’s defenses and paves the way for a more intuitive user experience. Yet, as with any evolving technology, specific challenges warrant consideration.</p>
 Challenges and Concerns 
<p>While the merits of continuous authentication are undeniable, it’s essential to approach this method with a holistic perspective. No matter how advanced, every technology comes with its challenges. Recognizing these concerns ensures that organizations are better prepared to address them:</p>
 
 Privacy Concerns: Continuous monitoring, though for a noble cause, can raise eyebrows. Users might feel their privacy is invaded, leading to resistance against its implementation. 
 Technical Hurdles: Implementing continuous authentication is more than just a plug-and-play affair. It demands a synergy of advanced tech infrastructure and skilled personnel to integrate it seamlessly. 
 False Flags: No system is foolproof. There might be instances where genuine user actions are misconstrued as anomalies, leading to unwarranted security measures. 
 
<p>While these concerns present valid roadblocks, understanding them is the first step in addressing and mitigating potential issues. The ongoing evolution of continuous authentication hints at a transformative horizon.</p>
 Compliance with Security Standards 
<p>Adopting continuous authentication isn’t just about fortifying defenses; it’s also about aligning with global security standards. For instance, under GDPR, organizations must ensure data protection by design and default.</p>
<p>Continuous authentication aids in fulfilling this mandate. Similarly, adhering to HIPAA standards becomes paramount for industries dealing with healthcare data. Implementing ongoing checks can significantly reduce unauthorized data breaches, ensuring compliance. Non-adherence to such measures can lead to hefty penalties and reputational damage, making the case for continuous authentication even stronger.</p>
<p>All tech solutions need user acceptance and buy-in, irrespective of their brilliance. For continuous authentication work on an organization-wide rollout, users need to understand and appreciate the value continuous authentication brings.</p>
<p>So, keeping those challenges and concerns in mind, what is the future of continuous authentication and different continuous authentication methods? Let’s look into that next.</p>
 Future of Continuous Authentication 
<p>Continuous authentication stands out as a beacon, signaling the direction in which secure user verification might head. What does the horizon hold for this emerging authentication method? Let’s speculate on the coming developments:</p>
 
 Predictive Analytics: The next frontier is not just to identify but also to predict. Systems can anticipate and ward off threats by understanding user behavior patterns and behaviors before they materialize. 
 IoT Integration: With the proliferation of intelligent devices, the boundaries of what needs protection have expanded. Continuous authentication solutions can be pivotal in ensuring these devices remain uncompromised in a hyper-connected environment. 
 Broader Applications: E-commerce platforms can leverage this tech to ensure transactional security, enhancing trust and minimizing fraud. 
 
<p>The horizon for continuous authentication seems promising, teeming with innovations and enhancements. As we advance, it becomes imperative for organizations not just to understand its potential but also to take proactive steps toward its implementation.</p>
 Implementing Continuous Authentication in Your Organization 
<p>The journey from traditional password-based systems to continuous authentication can appear daunting for many organizations. However, the transition can be smooth and rewarding with a structured approach and clear roadmap. If you’re contemplating the incorporation of continuous authentication within your organization, here are a few actionable steps:</p>
 
 Evaluating the Need: The first step is introspection. Does your organization handle sensitive data? Are you a high-risk target for cyberattacks? If yes, this might be the upgrade you need. 
 Implementation Roadmap: Identifying the need is just the start. Partnering with the right tech providers, setting up the infrastructure, and training stakeholders form the crux of the implementation journey. 
 Monitor and Iterate: As with all tech solutions, continuous authentication is not a set-it-and-forget-it tool. Regular, continuous risk assessments ensure that it evolves with changing threats. 
 
<p>Venturing into continuous authentication is a strategic decision that demands thoughtful execution. With the right approach, organizations can enhance security and enrich the overall user experience in your organization.</p>

<p>You should own your thoughts.</p><p>This may seem like an odd statement. "Of course, I own my thoughts," you think to yourself. But when you take those thoughts and enter them into a notes app, are you always guaranteed access to those ideas?</p><p>Most note-taking apps are centralized tools. If a company that runs the app goes out of business, users lose all of their content - that's years of valuable insights.</p><p>And what if you become unhappy with the direction the app is taking, and you wish to take your notes to one that has more of the features you desire? Good luck trying to switch seamlessly. It's unlikely that the apps will interoperate with each other, leaving you stuck spending countless hours trying to reconfigure your notes on the new platform.</p><p>Furthermore, since these centralized apps are walled gardens, your friends and connections are left behind, leaving you missing out on the social aspect of shared note-taking.</p><p>But the web wasn't always this way.</p><p>It started as a way for researchers and academics to share information worldwide. Distributed nodes were established at institutions and universities, enabling users to uncover important insights faster and make breakthroughs. Everything interoperated because it was built on open protocols, and data always stayed with the user first.</p><p>How can we return to this way of working and collaborating on the web?</p><p>That was the question <a href="https://twitter.com/gordonbrander">Gordon Brander</a> and <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@cdata@mastodon.social">Chris Joel</a> had two years ago. Brander and Joel wanted to find a way to build a worldwide knowledge graph that would empower users to own their thoughts and surface connections that they wouldn't have otherwise realized were there, all while connecting with others to work more efficiently.</p> Open Protocols and Their Benefits <p>Brander and Joel started building Subconscious, a local-first decentralized note-taking app. They began with the protocol that would power the app - Noosphere. Noosphere is permissionless and open source, like HTTP or IMAP; anyone can build on top of it. That means even if the Subconscious app goes away one day, anyone running the Noosphere protocol can resurrect it. Content AND contacts can also move with the user to another platform built on Noosphere, creating a <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fcredible%2520exit&amp;utm_medium=reader2">credible exit</a>. </p><p>All the content users create is stored on IPFS. IPFS uses content-addressable data created by a cryptographic hashing process that generates a unique identifier (CID). The CID acts as a hard link that points to a specific version of a file. This data structure enables two important things - distributed file storage and version control.</p><p>Distributed file storage makes the Subconscious app more resilient and able to work offline and local-first. And since IPFS is a shared resource with high adoption in both the Web3 and DWeb spaces, this is another reassurance that the user's notes are safe. </p><p>Version control allows Subconscious to create a daisy chain of edits synced across all devices. Furthermore, users can use this structure to review previous versions if they need to restore their notes or memo to an earlier state.</p><p>Data is linked using hypertext. These integrated hyperlinks enable users to build their knowledge networks. </p> The Heart of Subconscious - Notes, Memos, and Spheres <p>Noosphere is a protocol made up of networked "spheres." Your sphere is your portable data backpack. Spheres contain your content as "notes" and "memos". </p><p>Like a letter envelope, memos wrap your notes and add some additional metadata, including an IPFS content ID that points to the version history for that file (the previous version of that memo). Subconscious puts note files in memos, but you can put any file in a memo, making Noosphere a versatile tool. </p><p>Spheres also contain contacts, similar to an address book of other spheres you follow. </p><p>Finally, spheres are not a server. They are a data structure that lives on your device (local first) and on IPFS. That means your sphere is decentralized, and you always have your data. And spheres are signed with your cryptographic key, so they are secure and can be verified as belonging to you.</p><p>Subconscious users can delegate and revoke access to their spheres anytime because the tool utilizes <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>. Created by Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, UCANs handle authorization in distributed systems by leveraging capabilities rather than ACLs. Users delegate their capabilities rather than their keys, making it very secure. Each agent in the system identifies itself using a keypair, and the user delegates capabilities (permissions) to the keypair. </p> In Summary <p>Subconscious is open source and transparent and provides users with a credible exit. No walled gardens or predatory privacy policies leaving users feeling powerless with few viable alternatives. &nbsp;Open source protocols that bring transparency and trust are utilized to thwart centralization.</p><p>Users don't sacrifice the multi-player experience. Subconscious users will enjoy networked intelligence effects when they follow other users, making connections and gleaning insights that might have otherwise eluded them. This will amplify users' productivity, creativity, and ability to collectively solve big problems.</p> Getting Started <p>Subconscious is now in <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subconscious-beta">beta</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9l6eo5KQiEuT9JuomtTagd8DU37b6fXUrqlKbSWRfBBP-Bg/viewform">Join the waitlist</a>! </p><p></p><p></p>

 We sit down with the financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach to discuss why he left the police force, how criminal investigations have changed over time, the importance of education and accountability in an anti-fraud strategy, and why he would never become a KYC specialist. 



 



<p>Paul Stratton has always wanted to be a police officer. In fact, during a recent house clean-up, his wife discovered a childhood picture of Paul and his brother dressed up as characters from ‘Chips’ (an 80’s TV show about two motorcycle officers from the California Highway Patrol).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, after 22 years of working for Merseyside Police, including almost four years in the Fraud Unit, Paul knew he had to leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It got to the point where I was struggling with the lack of team ethos and internal politics. Before moving to the Fraud Unit, I was investigating domestic abuse, violent crimes, and sexual offences, and was starting to feel like an Uber driver, where the next job would just pop up in my inbox. I just didn’t have time to follow up as much as I wanted to with the people I had helped and that always bothered me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Victim care is something that the police talk a lot about and I think it’s just become a soundbite. I don’t think we are doing as well as we could with victim care in certain areas of policing, and it frustrated me to just follow up with phone calls.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then, that Paul left the police to pursue a career in fraud and financial crime training and raising awareness of the harm of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of education, accountability, and tangible messaging in the battle against fraud was a recurring theme in our discussion, as Paul believes a lack of consistent education – to the public, to the police, and the wider public sector – is a significant issue in the UK’s fight against fraud attacks. These rates, Paul believes, will not go down until that education gap is filled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referring to the UK’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">recently-released fraud strategy</a>, Paul said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>You can create the best strategy in the world, but it’ll just collect cyber dust unless there’s tangible messaging that is shared with the public. There’s no real messaging, and that’s where I fear it’ll fail.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>“We can’t hold departments accountable because, besides the general aim to reduce fraud by 10% by 2025, there are no specific figures [that they wish to hit] or how they’re going to do it,&nbsp;and no one knows what they’re tangibly supposed to be doing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-outlines-his-five-key-priorities-for-2023">British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out his five priorities for 2023</a>, and, like them or not, they are clear, so why aren’t we doing something similar with the UK’s fraud strategy?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss everything from Paul’s skepticism regarding the strategy’s 400 promised new fraud officers, why he hates words like ‘scams’, ‘white collar crime’, and ‘money mules’, and why we’re still probably one or two generations away from fully recognizing the impact of social media and acting upon the dangers of online crime.</p>



 From detective at Merseyside Police to fraud specialist at Liverpool City Council, and currently, a full-time fraud apprenticeship coach and fraud and financial crime trainer, why the career change, and what are the main differences and similarities in roles, if any? 



<p>I spent 22 years with Merseyside Police, and never wanted to leave, in fact I still consider myself police, but I had to leave as I knew there had to be something better out there. Somewhere where a work/life balance is achievable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I brought the same principles and work ethic into my role at Liverpool City Council. In fact, it was working at the Council where I learned the most about fraud, corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, gifts and hospitality, social media, KYC, and all the other typical red flags you look out for in police investigations.&nbsp;</p>



 What did a typical day look like at Liverpool County Council? 



<p>I oversaw the Whistle Blowing process, reviewing, and allocating cases, and I was the lead investigator for all allegations of internal fraud and potential criminal activity. I was also part of the council’s effective Due Diligence Group and developed the council’s new Fighting Fraud &amp; Corruption Together strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020-2021, Liverpool City Council received a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/25/scale-of-problems-at-liverpool-city-council-revealed-in-commissioners-report">bad press</a> due to claims of widespread corruption, which led to numerous police investigations and government intervention.</p>



<p>I started my role just after the controversy started, so a lot of my work was focused on trying to bring Liverpool City Council to a point where there was that awareness of fraud and best practices. So, I would work virtually every day on building and delivering educational and engaging training sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We talk a lot about anti-fraud culture, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/counter-fraud-culture-uk/">counter-fraud culture </a>– that’s a phrase that’s bandied around. But anti-fraud culture is a difficult thing to achieve, as that would mean everybody knows about fraud, and how to prevent it and protect themselves from it.</p>



 What led you to leave the Council and launch your fraud and financial crime training and consultancy business? 



<p>It’s something I’ve always wanted to do. I am committed to providing quality training to delegates. Long gone are the days when trainers could just sit in front of a PowerPoint and talk for an hour. It must be immersive, with tasks, real-life examples, and problem-solving sessions. People want, need, and deserve more. This is especially true in the public sector, where there’s very little money to train people, so when a trainer does come in, it’s vital they deliver the best learning they can.</p>



 How have criminal investigations and intelligence operations changed in the two-plus decades since you began? 



<p>Since I started, back in 1998, it’s changed dramatically. For example, when I joined there was very little education on evidence-gathering at a scene, but now, with technology, recruits are even receiving Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and social media training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether it’s over Facebook (which it inevitably is), or Instagram or Twitter, investigators need to know and understand how to secure digital evidence. That’s where a lot of the crime exists now. It’s not in person anymore – it’s online.</p>



 Would you say the perception of fraud has changed over the years? 



<p>Yes and no. When I started in the police, the Fraud Unit, which was called the Cheque and Fraud Wing, would only deal with cases of a certain amount; it had to be of high value for them to even become involved.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Some police forces, like Merseyside Police, have now shifted to harm-based assessments, where they look at the harm caused by fraud. Yes, the monetary amount is important, but it’s not everything.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>For example, £1 million in losses to a huge organization is a speed bump in relation to a single parent losing £500 in a month and being unable to pay the rent. You see this with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance frauds</a>, where people lose everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the perception of fraud can be too rarefied; we think ‘fraud’, we think “white collar crime,” and it’s a phrase I can’t stand, because many equate “white collar crime” with a business crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last suspect I ever interviewed before I left the police was a young lad involved in a gang that were dealing drugs and other types of criminal activities like selling fake Liverpool and Everton tickets. And they were doing all that through a bank account they’d created with the name of a vulnerable neighbor, and had done it horrifically easily at the time. There are increasing numbers of gangs moving into fraud and money laundering now.</p>



 What are your thoughts on the UK’s recently-released fraud strategy? Do you think it goes far enough, and is dedicating resources in the right place? 



<p>I think anything that looks at reducing fraud is a good thing. However, [in the strategy] there are a lot of new names for old teams, and reinventing the wheel somewhat, but that’s often law enforcement’s way. We go from priority to priority. You won’t have a burglary team for two years, but then you have a huge burglary problem, so you assemble a burglary squad and solve that problem, then move onto something else. Such is the lack of resources to specialize in everything at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the things that I’m skeptical about is the government’s pledge to get 400 new specialist investigators. I don’t think these can be existing police officers, as no police force has enough staff to do what they need to do right now. So, I’m not sure where any new fraud specialists are going to come from, and whether they’re going to be trained or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also don’t think the fraud strategy factors in the educational component. The strategy may be on gov.uk, but are people seeing it in any kind of usable format?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are we doing enough education-wise with the public? I can’t ever remember seeing an advert on fraud prevention from the government. I see adverts about giving to charity and how people can spend money, but I don’t see adverts on how people can protect their money.</p>



 In the Foreword to the strategy, Home Secretary, Suella Braverman spoke of the need for coordinated collaboration between the police, the public and private sectors, as well as allies abroad. In your opinion, what is the most important component of a successful fraud strategy? Conversely, what hinders or can negatively impact the strategy, or a fraud investigation? 



<p>Intelligence sharing between the public and private sector and international arena is nothing new. The fact that, in 2023, we’re still talking about better intelligence sharing shows how far behind we are. From an investigator’s point of view, the mechanisms already exist for effective intel sharing. We have the National Crime Agency, which does a lot for police forces when they’re investigating abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if I was investigating bank accounts or looking to get an IP address, we have Financial Intelligence Units that can act in the international arena. We have the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force</a> for money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to look at how this affects investigators, and how we can make their jobs easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know they’ve assigned an MP (Member of Parliament) with the role of Anti-Fraud Champion [Anthony Browne, MP], which is fantastic, but I think it needs to be more effective than just naming someone a champion. Is giving this role to one MP enough? How is he going to do that amongst his constituency work, and other responsibilities? (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s Anti-Fraud Champion, Anthony Browne here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud accounts for 40% of all crime, 80% of that fraud is cyber. If this was burglary (or firearms), I can guarantee there’d be more press, and people would understand what steps the government is taking, and people would be more educated.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>But, for some reason, fraud is just not considered as severe. It’s almost perceived as a sort of invisible crime, where a lot of victims may report it but be too embarrassed to tell people about it.</p>



<p>For example, with romance fraud, many people may think the victim has brought it on themselves and should have been wiser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t like the term ‘money mules’; I call them money movers. I also don’t like the word ‘scam,’ people do not ‘fall for scams.’ They are defrauded by criminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People may have a lack of empathy when they hear “falling for a scam,” and think how could they send £500 pounds to someone they’ve never met? Well, that’s the way of the world now – that’s how we meet people in 2023. We’ve moved on; we’re probably one or two generations away from a full understanding of the impact of social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People now spend their lives online; on LinkedIn, on Instagram, everything’s done over email, if someone even rings you now, you think there’s a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s the same with fraud and understanding the full effects of it. I don’t think we’re going to get over the “How could they fall for that scam” for a couple of generations because people just think, “Well, I met my partner in person or I still bank in branch,” and it doesn’t work like that. Those days are gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s for the same reason that people don’t like to be called “victims.” In the police, we call them complainants because they are complaining about a crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Words matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Apparently, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154660/Fraud_Strategy_2023.pdf">just </a>1% of police resources are dedicated to tackling fraud, despite fraud accounting for 40% of all crime in the UK.&nbsp; Why do you think fraud is such a neglected area? 



<p><a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk">Action Fraud</a> has had a lot of bad press, and I don’t think people actually understand what they do. Not to diminish their work at all, but Action Fraud is like a call center and data warehouse. People call up and make a complaint; they’re not staffed by experts, or detectives or fraud experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What hinders the effectiveness of Action Fraud is that we don’t tell people what Action Fraud is or manage people’s expectations enough to say that the complaint may not be investigated. So, when they get a letter a few weeks later, saying that the complaint is not being investigated, with no explanation, it’s tough. Whether it’s £50 or £5 million, you deserve a reason why the suspected crime isn’t being investigated, and you would get that if you were assaulted, for example. [<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Action Fraud will be replaced in Q2, 2024 with a new division. Read more about how it fits into the UK’s wider fraud revamp here.</a>]</p>

 And that understandably has an impact on future reporting habits? 



<p>Of course, people just won’t bother reporting fraud. For years, victim support has been around the physical: assaults, sexual offenses, murders. But what do we do for people suffering financial and emotional loss because of romance fraud? Not enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What most hinders an investigation, however, are the low numbers of staff, and inadequate training. Officers, detectives, and investigators all need to be trained, whether that’s in document fraud, cybercrime, or how to find an IP address from an email. Unfortunately, this is not always the case in the public sector, with local authorities. Although this is being changed with the recent <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/503">Counter Fraud Investigator Apprenticeship</a>.</p>



 I suppose if complainants believe they are unlikely to receive any of the stolen funds back, then this would also have a knock-on effect in reporting rates? 



<p>Yes, you’re right, the ease with which <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/proceeds-of-crime-act-poca/">Proceeds of Crime </a>(stolen funds) can be moved around into multiple bank accounts is scary.&nbsp; A lot of people may think that if it’s only £100, they won’t report it, because they’re not going to get their money back, and it’s more effort than it’s worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once that money is spent, even if the perpetrator is caught, it’s very difficult to get it back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say the perpetrator resides in the UK, and you get them, the likelihood is they’re doing it for a reason: because they have no money or they’re greedy, so they’ll just spend it. It may not bother them if they get convicted, because they’re not going to get a job where they need a DBS check anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of how much money has been lost, that shouldn’t necessarily factor into the decision to a) report it, and b) investigate it. We must look at harm. Unfortunately, currently, Action Fraud just does not do that.</p>



 The fraud strategy has earmarked £100 million for additional police resources. Is that enough? 



<p>No, it’s not; we lose millions of pounds every day to fraud. Again, it’s not the amount, it’s where it’s going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putting maybe one more detective into a fraud squad will take the pressure off, and really help get more positive outcomes, but I think there needs to be real education, and refresher courses on, for example, the blockchain. Can some of the money be used to procure external services, and bring someone in to talk about it? We just don’t know. Can we bring experts in to help the police with investigations, because we don’t know everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there’s a balance to strike, and you don’t want to saturate people with information on fraud and get people scared. Perhaps the best approach would be to properly publicize new fraud initiatives that show how the money is being used. Help teachers get training on fraud prevention, train doctors in how to deal with the mental health ramifications of fraud.</p>



 Education is a recurring theme, as is responsibility. Responsibility of the government to educate people, responsibility of victims to report complaints. What about companies and service providers, where does the responsibility lie there? What role will technology, and in particular KYC and identity verification services, play in the future of fraud prevention? 



<p>They bear a huge responsibility, don’t they? Having recently been onboarded by a company, it’s all completely digital now, isn’t it? One of the cases I dealt with before I left the police was with a new online bank, where a lot of criminals were using their friends’ photographs, passports and licenses to open bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Knowing Your Customer (KYC)</a> is everything really. And, it’s not just knowing your customer, it’s knowing your applicants, and knowing your staff. It’s having all these things in place, especially in recruitment, as document fraud is rampant, so it’s a huge responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll have KYC specialists in banks, but what about the public sector and other private companies? In recruitment, for example, you’re relying on recruitment staff – are they getting the training they need? Are they all aware of the threats of fraud? Do they understand what KYC is?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can only speak from the public sector, but the public sector and local authorities can learn a huge amount from banks and a huge amount from the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a fraud investigator’s point of view, I think it’s going to get harder and harder, because long gone are the days where an applicant or consumer must come to a business, and if you’re opening a bank account nowadays, it’ll be online, and you don’t have to see anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t envy KYC staff – let’s put it that way. It’s not a job I’d like to do; there’s a lot of risk on their shoulders to develop, keep themselves regularly updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this technological age, it’s also important to remember that fraud is about people as much as it’s about AI and machine learning. Someone must press that button at the start, and someone must be a victim at the end.</p>

To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF52 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

  <p>Divestitures, dissolution of partnerships, and other business <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-up.asp">split-ups</a> are rarely fun, but they do happen and can have significant implications for your digital assets. Whatever the reason for a business split-up, it's important to prioritize digital security.</p>

<p>The average <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">data breach in the U.S.</a> costs a company $9.4 million. Your digital assets need to be protected before, during, and after the split.</p>
	
 What are digital assets and why are they vulnerable to cyberattacks? 
	
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-asset-framework.asp">Digital assets</a> are any virtual item created and maintained/stored online. They're identifiable to your particular company or someone within your company, and they're of a certain value. Digital assets also must be searchable and discoverable, typically through metadata.</p>

<p>During business split-ups, you have to take inventory of all of your digital assets and who may have access to them. You also have to preemptively determine how hackers could exploit vulnerabilities to find and exfiltrate data and assets that could be of value to bad actors — or damaging to your company. You never want to think your former business partner would use sensitive information against your company, but it happens, often accidentally.</p>
 Best practices for protecting your digital assets 

<p>When separating your business, it's wise to implement <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-and-access-management">identity and access management</a> (IAM) best practices. Some of these include:</p>

  Requiring <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) 
   Implementing single sign-on (SSO) 
   Managing authorization 
   Ensuring the right identities have access only to the appropriate resources, and nothing more, through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> 
  Strategies for enhancing your security posture 
	
<p>You may already have a strong foundation of IAM best practices in place. Even so, there are tools that help you keep your accounts secure, particularly in the instance of a business split-up.</p>
	
 Institute a cybersecurity policy 
	
<p>A shareable, company-wide cybersecurity policy should be available in times of dissolution. Set it up as soon as possible, even if there's no business split-up planned for the foreseeable future. In the event that one does happen, you'll then have something to refer to and mark off as a sort of checklist to ensure all your cybersecurity bases are covered.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity policy for digital assets during business split-ups should include some of the following:</p>

  A list of all accounts managed by your organization 
   A list of all third parties with and their access privileges 
   A guide for managing account access 
   When to revoke account access upon dissolution 
   Risk assessment instructions 
   An acceptable use policy (AUP) that parties have to sign 
   A response plan in the event of a data breach 
 <p>You can find variations of these types of policies online, but tailor them to your specific situation. Have an overall cybersecurity policy and include a section on business divestiture or dissolution, or make a separate document for this entirely. The important thing is that the right people in the organization have access to this policy to refer to as needed.</p>
	
 Implement strong authentication 
	
<p>Strong authentication practices are a hallmark of cybersecurity. While many organizations continue to rely on username and password combinations for authentication, this practice is known to be risky. For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been unauthorized access, which is another way of saying the use of stolen credentials.</p>

<p>For environments where passwords remain in use, the first line of defense is to require strong and unique passwords for every account, and changing them regularly (and immediately in the event of a business split).</p>

<p>Attackers often use "brute-force" techniques to guess weak passwords, including using random password generators to guess passwords rapidly, or by simply guessing the password due to its weak nature — for example, if the password is "password1234" or "Qwerty!" Despite stronger enterprise policies, employees commonly use such weak, guessable passwords, and use them for multiple accounts. These practices expose your organization to risk, as hackers also frequently turn to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/glossary-page#Credential-Stuffing">credential stuffing</a>, which is the practice of using credentials for one account to gain access to other accounts.</p>

<p>A better approach to strong authentication is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, which can reduce the risk of a data breach following a business dissolution. By eliminating passwords and replacing their use with biometrics, like fingerprints or facial scanning, passwordless offers are far more secure way to ensure that only the right account holders can access your digital assets.</p>

<p>Another way to strengthen security is through risk-based authentication, which uses AI to detect unusual behavior. For example, a legitimate employee may sign in to an account using the correct credentials and a trusted device, but the location is unusual. An <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven tool</a> would automatically flag such a request and require additional authentication steps during that first attempt. If the login attempt is deemed a high risk, it is automatically blocked or redirected for analysis.</p>

 Eliminate identity silos 
	
<p>Identity silos occur when different systems, applications, or business units have disparate identity systems that don't talk to each other. What you need is an enterprise-wide view of all your identities and their access permissions, no matter where they are connecting or where the assets they seek are hosted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">Hybrid IAM</a> is the way to unify and secure all your digital identities and access requests whether your data and resources are running on-premises, in public and private clouds, or all of the above.</p>
	
<p>By implementing a modern <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">identity platform</a>, you can manage and protect digital assets, even if you have a hybrid work model or are moving to a different business workflow process along with the divestiture.</p>

<p>Blog post by Apillon&nbsp;below</p> The joint initiative by Apillon, KILT Protocol, and Nova Wallet marks another step towards simplification of Web3&nbsp;UX.   What is&nbsp;w3ndi?  How does w3ndi&nbsp;work?  Apillon, KILT Protocol, and Nova Wallet joining&nbsp;forces   What is&nbsp;w3ndi? <p>w3ndi (you can call it Wendi, too) is an Apillon-built decentralized index of digital accounts that links your web3name (w3n) by KILT Protocol with your digital addresses. It currently supports Polkadot (including KILT and other parachain address types) and other popular chains, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>With w3ndi, you can browse digital wallet accounts tied to your web3name, KILT’s human-readable format for DIDs (decentralized identifiers). The addresses can be differentiated by chains and tags, and thanks to easy browsing via w3n, replace copy-pasting of lengthy, meaningless strings of alphanumeric characters and simplify crypto transfers.</p><p>The first app to integrate w3ndi is Nova&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Why w3ndi and how does it&nbsp;work? <p><a href="https://blog.apillon.io/why-web3-needs-a-ux-framework-e0db6806a579">UX is a huge friction point of Web3</a>. Everyone is familiar with using lengthy strings of characters and numbers, double-checking just the first and the last few ones, if at all. Too often, users neglect their responsibility to verify addresses, which could even lead to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1686764372616515585">funds drain</a>. Or, they verify a recipient’s address by first transferring a small test amount before moving larger crypto numbers. But users are hardly to blame. Clumsy UX&nbsp;is.</p><p>The user interface of dapps has come a long way since the early days of Web3, with new solutions that stay true to the principles of decentralization while going easy on end users. KILT has redefined how we think of decentralized digital identity by introducing W3C-compliant DIDs, how we attach and attest its components (digital addresses included), and how we represent DIDs in a human-readable, memorable form with <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/web3names/">web3name</a>(w3n).</p><p>A few months ago, KILT <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/send-funds-to-a-web3name-via-nova-wallet-b3182457c90b">partnered with Nova Wallet</a> to allow for easy user and digital address search. However, <a href="https://docs.novawallet.io/nova-wallet-wiki/help-and-support/associate-address-with-web3name">the initial process of associating addresses with web3name</a> required users to master certain technical skills.</p><p>Now, a more user-friendly w3n-address linking method has come to life with&nbsp;w3ndi.</p><p>Link addresses once, and use them as you go with just a few&nbsp;clicks.</p> w3ndi app by&nbsp;Apillon <p>w3ndi simplifies the process of attaching digital wallet addresses to your DID and w3n by KILT, ultimately, your digital identity.</p><p>The first integration of the w3ndi app by Apillon is live on <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a>, a leading crypto wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem. With w3ndi enhancing the Nova UX, you can easily find peers in the Web3 community by their web3name, and initiate transactions without having to know or double-check the exact and complete alphanumeric strings of their addresses.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>The free-to-use w3ndi app is accessible at <a href="https://w3ndi.apillon.io/">w3ndi.apillon.io</a>.</p><p>Once you connect with your Sporran wallet from KILT and select the digital identity represented by your DID or w3n by KILT, you can start attaching your digital wallet addresses from multiple networks and create a self-sovereign wallet registry under a single&nbsp;name.</p><p>Using tags, you can differentiate between various-purpose addresses, e.g. Friends and family, Business, Charity, etc. You can also choose to make an address work on multiple&nbsp;chains.</p><p>In the process of linking w3n with digital addresses, w3ndi generates a JSON file containing identifiers for different wallet addresses that you attached to your web3name on the KILT parachain. To ensure unstoppable access, the file is stored on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> and pinned via <a href="https://crust.network/">Crust Network</a>. Find w3ndi on GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Apillon-web3/w3ndi-app">here</a>.</p><p>With w3ndi on Nova Wallet, your human-readable w3n nickname opens up an index of all your linked digital addresses. Thanks to added tags, you can easily differentiate accounts and mitigate the risk of interacting with the wrong&nbsp;one.</p><p>To send funds, simply type in the recipient’s w3n using “w3n:[name]” and select an account based on its tag. Or, to receive a deposit, let the sender know your w3n and the tag that defines the correct address. All in just a few&nbsp;clicks.</p><p>In Nova Wallet, w3ndi makes digital asset exchange seamless and user-friendly. When integrated into other apps, w3ndi could expand its usability of linking human-readable w3n with digital addresses.</p><p>Learn step-by-step how to use w3ndi&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apillon.io/guide-use-w3ndi-to-connect-your-digital-addresses-to-w3n-by-kilt-and-use-it-in-nova-wallet-de98a1289aae">here</a>.</p> Fully decentralized <p>As you save and deploy an address in w3ndi, the address index file is pinned to IPFS via Crust with a unique CID, enabling the w3n name resolution service and keeping it fully decentralized.</p><p>Each time you change or add a new address, the address pointers change, too, and a new unique CID is generated.</p><p>If you decide to delete all addresses, you must deploy changes, resulting in an empty w3n name resolution. Keep in mind that the minimal period of file pinning is six months, so files are deleted only after that period has&nbsp;passed.</p> Apillon, KILT, and Nova Wallet joining&nbsp;forces <p>w3ndi is a result of collaboration among three Polkadot projects, each contributing its distinct qualities:</p>  <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> powers decentralized digital identities via DIDs and web3names (w3n)  <a href="http://w3ndi.apillon.io/">w3ndi by Apillon</a> builds up registries of digital addresses linked to a user’s w3n by&nbsp;KILT  <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a> integrates w3ndi’s w3n registries as an enhanced UX functionality  <p>In addition, Crust Network supplies <a href="https://wiki.apillon.io/build/2-web3-services.html#web3-storage">decentralized storage</a> and pins w3ndi’s index JSON file on IPFS, ensuring permanent access to the owner of the file’s&nbsp;link.</p><p>Try w3ndi on Nova Wallet today, and use your w3n by KILT for seamless crypto transfers.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise, government and consumers.

 Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) — Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication  Written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.  How it&nbsp;started <p>Bitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.</p> How it’s&nbsp;going <p>Beyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared “computer” or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else’s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of “dApps”, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don’t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain “bridge” design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile&nbsp;up.</p> The solution <p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p> A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties <p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p>  Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.  VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC&nbsp;calls.  Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today’s single currency blockchain networks.  Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.  In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for&nbsp;all.  All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:    Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)  Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)  Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway&nbsp;proofs  <p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We’ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p>  “Earned” and “Accepted” notarizations — VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.    Generally, one side of a connection will create “earned” notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further “confirmation” rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are “auto”, centralized, or “notary confirm”.  Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the “notary” system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an “accepted” notarization, and is entered as “agreeing” with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.  <p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point&nbsp;behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, “notary confirm” always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof&nbsp;root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level&nbsp;bundles.</p> What witness / notaries do NOT&nbsp;do <p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries’ primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators’ earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof&nbsp;root.</p> Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations? <p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a&nbsp;quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat&nbsp;models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p> Improvement over common cross-chain protocols <p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private&nbsp;keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p>  Colluding, malicious notaries  Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain  <p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p> Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Arthur C. Clarke, the famous English science fiction writer, had once noted that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Back in the 1960s, he was probably thinking about space exploration, which was the hottest and most impressive topic of that decade. Since then, however, spacecraft have unfortunately lost a large portion of their glamour, becoming instead reliable workhorses for the industry. A few other revolutionary technologies have met the same fate during the later decades as well – the Internet, mobile communications, electric vehicles, etc. The buzzword du jour, Artificial Intelligence, will become another part of our daily routines pretty soon as well.</p>
<p>Quantum computing, however, is still viewed by the public as something truly magical and simultaneously completely unrealistic. Perhaps, this can be explained by the lack of a “killer app” that would demonstrate immediate usefulness of the technology to average people, like ChatGPT did for generative AI. Or simply because quantum mechanics is something that requires substantial effort to wrap your head around. Sure, most of us still vaguely remember from school that subatomic particles can exhibit properties of both particles and waves, and some might even have heard about quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>, but how exactly does it make extremely fast computing possible?</p>
<p>Well, it does not. Quantum computers are not supposed to replace classical ones, which are based on binary logic implemented with semiconductor-based logical gates. They won’t make existing algorithms any faster. They do, however, allow us to design entirely new algorithms that can solve mathematical problems that were previously impossible. Such developments started to emerge back in the 1980s, but remained largely an academic exercise until Peter Shor devised a quantum algorithm for breaking popular encryption methods. Finally, quantum computing caught the interest of businesses. And intelligence agencies, of course.</p>
<p>Sure, there are many other potential applications for this technology – modeling natural processes in physics and chemistry, creating new fuels and batteries, designing more efficient drugs, and so on. Quantum computers are also great for modeling quantum processes, helping us understand the origins of the universe. Businesses are ready to invest, and vendors are busy developing hardware to run all those workloads.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even a single quantum bit (qubit) – a basic element of a quantum computer – is an extremely sophisticated and fragile device that depends on things like liquid helium to operate. The largest currently existing prototypes contain up to 1000 of such elements, and yet, it is projected that future “proper” quantum computers might need millions of them. Quantum computers are also prone to noise caused by insufficient isolation from the environment – noise that reduces the reliability of hardware and introduces errors into calculations. To put it simply, quantum computing nowadays can be compared to the early days of aviation – experts just cannot agree how many more years it will take until we see practical, working, error-proof computers. But it definitely won’t happen tomorrow. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/error-correction-codes">Or will it</a>?</p>
<p>A more interesting question, however, is how all this is related to cybersecurity. We already know that quantum computing can potentially make existing cryptography obsolete overnight. This would have massive implications on the entire digital economy of the world – everything from secure network connections to public cloud services to distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies depends on the inability of a malicious actor to break this encryption. Modern cryptography relies to a large degree on the fact that classic computers cannot solve the underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">mathematical challenges</a>. Yet, it has been established that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can do it easily using Shor’s algorithm. The only open question is when such a computer will become available to malicious actors.</p>
<p>Even though many experts are still quite skeptical about the probability of this happening anytime soon, it is worth noting that the “better safe than sorry” camp is also quite substantial. The entire field of post-quantum cryptography emerged years ago to develop new encryption methods that are resistant against quantum attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">standardization program</a> for quantum-resistant encryption methods since 2016 and the publication of new standards is planned for 2024.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to wait until working quantum computers emerge to start implementing the new standards. In fact, by that time it will definitely be too late. For any business that relies on encryption to safeguard its processes and products (and nowadays, it’s basically any organization, regardless of its size or industry), the notion of cryptographic agility has become a critical part of business continuity.</p>
<p>Cryptographic algorithms become outdated all the time. DES, MD5, SHA1 – they are no longer considered strong enough even against classical brute force attacks and should be replaced everywhere. Sometimes, weaknesses are discovered in specific implementations – remember the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident">Heartbleed incident</a>? Being able to respond to these challenges quickly and to replace cryptographic primitives across your entire organization without massive impact to your business – that’s what crypto-agility is about. Quantum resistance is just another good argument for selling this idea to the board.</p>
<p>One should also not forget about other applications of quantum mechanics to cybersecurity as well. After all, the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography">quantum cryptography</a> proper is also quite fascinating. One particular technology relies on the properties of quantum entanglement to implement secure communications between parties that are impossible to eavesdrop on. This can be used to produce a shared secret key that is resistant against any man-in-the-middle attack. Surprisingly, practical implementations of this technology are already available, with record-breaking speeds and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230615710544/en/Terra-Quantum-Breaks-Records-in-Quantum-Key-Distribution-Paving-Way-to-Offering-Unprecedented-Security-Over-Existing-Fiber-optic-Networks-Globally">distances over 1000 km</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, quantum technologies will be a part of the agenda at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference that will take place this November in Frankfurt, Germany. If you are interested in expanding your quantum computing horizons, come and meet the experts there!</p>

<p>In the always-on world of ecommerce, most business owners know that understanding customer behavior is one of the key ingredients to success. But getting to know your customers inside and out can be tricky if their information is stored in more than one location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to establish a central database, or “single source of truth,” where all customer data is managed and stored. This source of truth is known as “a single view of the customer,” and it’s like having an all-access pass to a customer's inner world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of it like this: Each customer data point is like a puzzle piece, and the central database is the box where all of the pieces are kept. However, instead of loose puzzle pieces tossed in a box with no sense of organization, a database categorizes and organizes pieces of customer data into searchable categories and subcategories for precise retrieval and exploration. </p>

<p>The United States faces numerous challenges when it comes to balancing supply v demand in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The intricate nature of the pharmaceutical industry, coupled with the country’s diverse healthcare system, regulatory framework, and evolving market dynamics, contribute to a complex landscape that presents both opportunities and limitations. Here, we will explore some of the key challenges that the US encounters in managing pharmaceutical supply and demand.</p>
<p>One of the primary challenges is ensuring a steady and adequate supply of pharmaceutical products. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Pharmaceuticals/U.S.-dependence-on-China-for-lifesaving-drugs-grows#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20imported%20%246.95%20billion,the%20annual%20tally%20from%202021">The US relies heavily on imports</a>, with many active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drugs being manufactured overseas, particularly in countries like China and India. This dependence on foreign sources can make <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/the-u-s-needs-to-reimagine-its-pharma-supply-chain">the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions</a>, such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or regulatory issues. A single interruption in the supply chain can lead to shortages of essential medications, potentially compromising patient care and public health.</p>
 Challenges posed to pharmaceutical demand by the US healthcare system 
<p>The complex and fragmented nature of the US healthcare system presents challenges in predicting and meeting pharmaceutical demand. Unlike many other countries with centralized healthcare systems, the US has a diverse array of payers, including private insurance companies, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and self-pay patients. Each payer operates differently, with varying formularies, coverage criteria, and reimbursement rates. This diversity makes it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to accurately forecast demand and allocate resources efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, the high cost of pharmaceuticals in the US poses a challenge in meeting demand. Prescription drug prices in the US are significantly higher compared to other countries, partly due to the number of intermediaries involved in the supply chain, the absence of government price controls and negotiation mechanisms. The high prices can create barriers to access for patients, particularly those without adequate insurance coverage or with high out-of-pocket costs. This can lead to underutilization of medications, compromising patient outcomes and exacerbating health disparities.</p>
 Falsified and substandard drugs in the US market 
<p>The issue of substandard and falsified drugs also affects the pharmaceutical supply chain in the US. Counterfeit drugs, which can be ineffective or even harmful, pose a serious risk to patient safety. While the US has robust regulatory mechanisms in place, including those managed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), illicit online pharmacies and other illegal channels continue to thrive, making it challenging to ensure a safe and secure supply of medications.</p>
 How technology is reshaping the pharma landscape 
<p>Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancements in pharmaceutical research and development introduces challenges in matching supply with evolving demand. The emergence of innovative therapies, such as gene therapies and personalized medicines, necessitates agile and adaptable manufacturing processes. Ensuring that the supply chain can accommodate these novel therapies, including scaling up production and maintaining quality control, is a complex task.</p>
 ARTiFACTS Verify’s role in ensuring the integrity of the US pharmaceutical supply chain 
<p>To address these challenges, various stakeholders in the US healthcare system are taking steps to enhance pharmaceutical supply and meet growing demand. Efforts include diversifying sources of drug manufacturing, encouraging domestic production, strengthening regulatory oversight, promoting price transparency, and fostering collaboration among manufacturers, payers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. In 2013, the US government implemented the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa">Drug Supply Chain Security Act</a> (DSCSA) with the aim of achieving interoperable, electronic tracing of products at the package level to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. Manufacturers were given 10 years to adapt their processes, ample time to meet evolving requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, advancements in digital health technologies and data analytics are being leveraged to optimize supply chain management and improve forecasting accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">ARTiFACTS Verify</a> supports these latter efforts through our cloud-based platform for monitoring drug quality across the pharmaceutical supply chain. Currently, Verify is capable of the following (with more in development):</p>
 
 Collecting chemical analyses of drugs obtained through destructive testing of samples at any point in the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
 Applying Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies that improve the accuracy, speed, and data-integrity of scientifically generated results. 
 Monitoring and reporting results for a growing set of active pharmaceutical ingredients with the capacity to address nearly all <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MHP-HPS-EML-2023.02">World Health Organization Essential Medicines</a>. 
 
<p>In conclusion, the US faces multifaceted challenges in balancing pharmaceutical supply and demand. These challenges stem from the complex nature of the healthcare system, dependence on foreign sources, high drug prices, counterfeit drugs, and the need to adapt to evolving therapies. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration, innovation, and policy reforms to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of patients across the country.</p>

  <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thrilled to announce that Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning is now in public preview!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With today’s announcement, we’re expanding our support for HR-driven provisioning to address the most common customer asks, including:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Automatically provisioning cloud-only users and hybrid users (users that require an on-premises Active Directory account) from any trusted source&nbsp; 
 Importing data from sources like CSV files and SQL staging tables using the automation tool of your choice&nbsp; 
 Simplifying the integration by using standard SCIM schema attributes to abstract schema differences across systems and provide a consistent mapping experience 
 Leveraging <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/lifecycle-workflows-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2466931">Lifecycle Workflows</a> to automate joiner-mover-leaver workflows for users sourced from any system of record&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one common customer scenario, organizations use a cloud human capital management (HCM) platform for managing employees and extracting nightly flat files/CSVs to manage vendor and contractor data. Both of these sources can send information to Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning using your automation tool of choice. Then, the provisioning service will automatically determine the right operation to perform for each user, and Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/lifecycle-workflows-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2466931">Entra ID Governance Lifecycle Workflows</a> will automate the joiner-mover-leaver processes configured by your IAM admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning data flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Let’s walk through the steps involved in configuring this integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Bring identities into your directory from any source in three easy steps&nbsp; 
<p>Step 1 – Configure API-driven provisioning app&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft Entra Portal, sign in as a user with Application Administrator and Hybrid Identity Administrator role. You will see two new provisioning applications in the Enterprise App gallery:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 API-driven provisioning to Microsoft Entra ID: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-configure-app">Configure this app</a> if you’d like to provision cloud-only user accounts from your authoritative source. 
 API-driven provisioning to on-premises Active Directory: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-configure-app">Configure this app</a> if you’d like to provision user accounts first to your on-premises Active Directory and then sync them into Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync / Connect Sync.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your provisioning target is an on-premises Active Directory domain, download and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/cloud-sync/how-to-install">configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent</a>. Once configured, you can select the Active Directory domain in the provisioning app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Connect to your on-premises Active Directory domain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>By default, the provisioning app maps attributes from the standard <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643.html#section-4.1">SCIM Core User schema</a> and the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643.html#section-4.3">SCIM Enterprise User schema extension</a> to the corresponding Microsoft Entra ID / on-premises Active Directory user attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: SCIM schema attributes to on-premises Active Directory attribute mapping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra provisioning service creates a unique API endpoint for your provisioning app. You can copy this API endpoint from the “Overview” blade. Select “Start provisioning” to accept inbound provisioning requests at this API endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4:API endpoint for your provisioning app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inbound provisioning API endpoint has the format:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/%7bservicePrincipalId%7d/synchronization/jobs/%7bjobId%7d/bulkUpload">https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/{servicePrincipalId}/synchronization/jobs/{jobId}/bulkUpload</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where {servicePrincipalId} is the object ID of your provisioning app and {jobId} is the provisioning job id.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 – Grant permission to your application or service to upload identity data&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this step, you create an entity in Microsoft Entra ID that represents your application or service calling the inbound provisioning API and grant it the necessary permissions. You can use one of the following options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-grant-access#configure-a-service-principal">Configure a service principal</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-grant-access#configure-a-managed-identity">Configure a managed identity</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grant the following Graph API permissions with admin consent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 SynchronizationData-User.Upload&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 AuditLog.Read.All&nbsp;<br> 
 
<p>Figure 5: Permissions required to perform API-driven provisioning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 3 – Upload identity data using any automation tool of your choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now securely upload identity data to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/synchronization-synchronizationjob-post-bulkupload">provisioning /bulkUpload API endpoint</a>. The great thing about API-driven provisioning is that you don’t need to implement custom logic to figure out whether an operation in your system of record requires creating or updating an identity. Just upload the data from your source systems and the Microsoft Entra provisioning service will automatically determine the right operation to perform for each user record based on mapping rules configured by your IAM admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unlock more integration scenarios&nbsp; 
<p>In the set of steps above, we showed you how to provision to Microsoft Entra ID in the cloud, and to Active Directory on-premises. You can apply these steps to implement several enterprise HR integration scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 1: IT teams can import HR data extracts from any source&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flat files, CSV files and SQL staging tables are commonly used in enterprise integration scenarios. Employee, contractor, and vendor information are periodically exported into one of these formats, and an automation tool is used to sync this data with Microsoft Entra ID. With API-driven provisioning, IT teams can use any automation tool of their choice (example: PowerShell scripts or Azure Logic Apps) to modernize and simplify this integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 2: HR ISVs can build direct inbound sync with Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, HR ISVs can ship native synchronization experiences so that changes in the HR system automatically flow into Microsoft Entra ID and connected on-premises Active Directory domains. For example, an HR app or student information systems app can send data to Microsoft Entra ID as soon as a transaction is complete or as end-of-day bulk update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 3: System integrators can build more connectors to systems of record&nbsp;</p>
<p>System integrators can build custom HR connectors to meet different integration requirements around identity data flow from systems of record to Microsoft Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What customers and partners are telling us&nbsp; 
<p>We got some great feedback from customers and partners like you during the previews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning will allow us to achieve our cloud-first vision by provisioning identity directly in the cloud and on-premises, integrating with our HR application. We will be able to remove legacy infrastructure and automate many fragmented workflows and reduce dependency on on-premises Active Directory infrastructure. This will enhance our security, efficiency, and user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sachin Desai, Sr. Director at Avanade Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, HR has better control over the identity lifecycle &amp; data in Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. When combined with Lifecycle Workflows, onboarding and offboarding becomes easy and seamless, and with that, no more manual work and always an up-to-date identity!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pim Jacobs, Principal Consultant at InSpark and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra API-driven inbound provisioning is a game changer for customers constrained by existing technologies, opening the possibility for any customer to start the journey for joiner, mover, and leaver automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martyn Gill, Senior Architect and Team Lead at Kocho&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, our customers can link employee information in SmartHR with Microsoft Entra ID. This will reduce the time and effort required to manage accounts as employees join, move, or leave the company. SmartHR is excited to partner with Microsoft in building this integration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Takumi Kanzaki, Product Engineer at SmartHR&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance by automating payroll, expenses, and benefits in one integrated platform.

<p>Passwords are still the most common form of authentication but are more problematic than ever.</p>



 The first big problem with passwords is that most people manage them poorly. 



<p>Most people choose weak (guessable) passwords, don’t store them securely (sticky note, anyone?), regularly forget and have to reset them, and reuse the same one (or even different variations of it) across all accounts (which is <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100</a> on average for Americans). In a 2020 study of Microsoft users across only three months, a massive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/12/06/microsoft-finds-password-security-problem-affecting-44-million-users/#356efc3c67c4">44 million users</a>&nbsp;had used the same password on more than one account.</p>



<p></p>



 The second big problem with passwords is that they are the most attractive target for cybercriminals. 



<p>Verizon’s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/infographics/2023-dbir-infographic.pdf">2023 data breach report</a> reveals 49 per cent of breaches by external actors used stolen credentials. Its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">2020 report</a> noted 80 per cent of hacking-related breaches were linked to passwords. Well-meaning advice to frequently change passwords is just a band-aid on a gaping wound.</p>



<p><a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">PC Magazine</a>’s recent list of 12 simple things consumers can do to be more secure online had some valuable recommendations for passwords:</p>



 
 Make them unique for every login. 



 Turn off the save password feature in browsers. 
 



<p>But while consumers are increasingly aware of the dangers of these poor practices, few do anything about it. It seems doing the right thing is difficult, and most people don’t know where to start.</p>



<p></p>



 Doing the right thing 







<p>Among the practices that make using passwords infinitely safer, the most recommended are:</p>



 
 Make sure they are complex and hard to guess. The more characters and variety in those characters (letters, numbers, special characters, upper and lower case) the better. 



 Don’t reuse them over and over again. To be safe, every place that requires a password should have its own unique, complex version. The days of simply iterating on an already-used password by increasing the final number by 1 are long gone. 



 Store them securely. Ditch the sticky notes—don’t write them down. 



 Don’t use the save password feature on browsers. Enter it each time it is needed. 
 



<p>No-one can follow that advice without help. And the best way to make those suggestions a reality is by using a password management solution. Unfortunately, very few consumers are inclined to research, acquire, install, configure, and maintain yet another piece of technology on top of what they are already doing. That’s where you can ride in on your white horse and save the day for the customers of your online <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/5-predictions-for-data-privacy-in-2023-and-beyond/">data privacy</a> and security offering.</p>



<p></p>



 Here’s the opportunity to make it easy 







<p>The password manager that you could offer should have these capabilities to deliver maximum value:</p>



 
 Secure, encrypted storage of passwords and other data (such as banking information, driver license, and social security number) 



 The ability to create unique, un-hackable passwords for each login (fun fact: a 12-character password takes <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mathematics-of-hacking-passwords/">62 trillion times</a> longer to crack than one with six-characters) 



 Enforcement of password complexity rules including preventing the reusing or iterating of older logins 



 The ability to securely auto-fill passwords for all logins 



 Functionality on all the devices a customer would need – mobile, desktop, etc. 



 Ability to import and export from other password managers or data sources 



 Ability to share vaults and credentials. 
 



<p>Fortunately, Anonyome Labs is leading the charge for making online privacy and security a no-brainer for regular folks. Anonyome’s <a href="https://sudoplatform.com">Sudo Platform</a> offers you the ability to easily add important password management to your products – branded and packaged the way you want.

 From ancient bone etchings to blockchain brilliance: Discover how 20,000 years of data revolution is reshaping our world, why you should care, and how it impacts&nbsp;you. <p>This blog will synthesize a 20,000-year timeline between ancient Babylon, record keeping, AI DAOs, machine-to-machine payments, and everything from then, to 2040 and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>TLDR: Data has been here and is here to stay. It’s always been about the data. Walk through what it has been and why now is the time to pay attention.</p><a href="https://365datascience.com/trending/history-of-data/">Image Source</a> 19,000 BC: The Great&nbsp;Baboon <p>Evidence of early data collection dates back to the earliest known human civilizations. The first use and record of a ‘data point’ can be found in 19,000 BC when our Paleolithic ancestors used a baboon tool called the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ishango_bone#/media/File:Ishango_bone.jpg">Ishango bone</a> to perform simple calculations. Back then, there were no calculators, pencils, or chat GPT— imagine how people got around or knew what coffee to order?! For this, we consider this invention as the first evidence of tallying or recording information.</p><p>2,500 BC Sumerians &amp; Bookkeeping</p><p>Ancient Sumerians, who lived in what is now modern-day Iraq, kept written records of harvests and taxes on clay tablets over 5,000 years ago. The evolution of writing helped shape data collection, as written records became more widespread and sophisticated. Libraries, which first appeared in ancient Egypt around 2,000 BCE, were instrumental in the curation and preservation of written records. The earliest libraries were typically housed in temples and contained religious texts, but over time, libraries began to expand their collections to include works on various subjects.</p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485">Image Source</a> History of Data in 1640: The GodFather of Public Health Statistics <p>In 1640, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graunt">John Graunt</a>, a hat maker, started collecting information regarding deaths in London. John noted down statistics such&nbsp;as:</p>  The number of&nbsp;deaths  The mortality rate among age&nbsp;groups  The causes of&nbsp;death  <p>By this seemingly mundane tallying, he revolutionized how we use medical data and human organization records to this day. In fact, Graunt was the first person to use data analysis to understand and solve a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>In 1665, he published his book, <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A41827.0001.001?view=toc">Natural and Political Observations Mentioned in a Following Index</a>, and made upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bills_of_mortality#:~:text=Bills%20of%20mortality%20were%20the,Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Parish%20Clerks.">Bills of Mortality</a>, as the collective result of his research. In it, the innovator stored information in tables and even attempted to predict life expectancy.</p><p>As a result of Graunt’s publication, the city started issuing a weekly report called “Bills of Mortality”. Knowing the number of deaths and births better-prepared people for a possible plague outbreak at that&nbsp;time.</p> History of Data in the 1880s: The Era of Data Processing <p>Speeding through centuries into the 1880s, the German-American statistician Herman Hollerith saw a train conductor punching train tickets for passengers. That’s how the idea of using punch cards in writing and processing data was born. Hollerith started working on the design of the <a href="https://www.hnf.de/en/permanent-exhibition/exhibition-areas/hall-of-fame/herman-hollerith-1860-1929.html">tabulation machine</a> that uses punch cards, based on a previous model invented by the silk weaver Joseph Jacquard in the&nbsp;1800s.</p><p>A punch card is normally a type of stiff paper, onto which a machine would create holes in specific locations. The cards are moved between brass rods so that the data is read electronically. With this great breakthrough, Hollerith helped the American government complete the US census within the same year — after it took them nearly a decade of trial and&nbsp;error.</p> Data in 1928: The Concept of&nbsp;Storage  Pfleumer’s Magnetic&nbsp;Tape <p>In 1928, German engineer Fritz Pfleumer patented a <a href="https://historyofinformation.com/image.php?id=6719">magnetic tape</a> that he used to replace wire recording for storing data. Essentially, he coated very thin paper with iron oxide powder and glued it with lacquer. The idea of storing information on magnetic tapes actually inspired the invention of floppy disks and hard disk drives later&nbsp;on.</p> Present-Day: Here comes the Internet&nbsp;Era <p>The rise of the internet consequently came with its counterpart of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-science/#:~:text=Data%20science%20is%20the%20study,analyze%20large%20amounts%20of%20data.">big data</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">Sir Tim Berners Lee</a>, hypertext and hyperlinks made it easy to share information and connect resources globally.</p><p>The introduction of Google in 1997 took Lee’s work and scaled to the masses. Data became even more widely available to everyone with access to a computer or mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>For the context of this topic, we can point readers to inquire on <a href="https://caseybotticello.medium.com/life-after-google-f9dcb639b087">Life After Google</a> by George Gilder, highlighting the rise and fall of Big&nbsp;Data.</p><p>Most people believe the internet is here to stay, specifically, those who’ve yet to think about digital ownership, blockchain, or privacy as any concern, nor the rise of AI. Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 allowed us to have the ability to read and write…creating data points every second we update the screen. Reading and writing are certainly not the final destination on the history of the data timeline graphic shown above. With every innovation in technology, data science, <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained">machine learning</a>, &amp; artificial intelligence comes a new way of creating and spreading information, knowledge, or&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Data has altered the way we view and assume the world, and continues to shape our reality in different ways. Industries like Finance, Insurance, Supply Chain, and Natural Sciences benefit from employing data-driven thesis &amp; techniques to improve their operations.</p> Internet Era -&gt; Blockchain Era (2023, 2040, and&nbsp;beyond) <p>As mentioned above, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 allowed us to read and write. Web 3.0 states the ability to read, write and&nbsp;own.</p><a href="https://elevatex.de/blog/web3/web1-web2-and-web3-explained/">Image Source</a><p>Web3 is positioned to Decentralize the Internet and bootstrap a more multidimensional and immersive environment (ie: the “metaverse”) designed for more participation, reward, engagement, and privacy by/for&nbsp;users.</p><p>The first question to this is how? Shorthand's answer is Blockchain technology. The distributed ledger technology changes how information is shared and stored. Deliverables: provide verifiable, trustless, distributed data on peer-to-peer nodes or servers that can enable the creation of new economic sectors and new forms of commerce.</p><p>Furthermore, decentralized applications (dApps) are the vehicle to transfer much of the power and control back to the public and consumers, marking a shift to a more user-owned web. Remove middlemen, expose bad actors, and streamline business processes to tailor to users and creators, rather than for-profit entities. DApps built inside the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem">here</a>.</p><p>Peer-to-peer buying and selling of assets are just the beginning. The peer-to-peer ownership of data, assets, information, and algorithmic scriptures is executed through the standard of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and ever-expanding mobile eCommerce has effectively cut the middlemen out of parts of the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Infamously, we will use credit card fees as an example. Consider the transaction fees charged to retailers by credit card companies. The seemingly small 1 to 4% adds up moving through the <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/s/supply-chain">supply chain</a>. The inefficiency of small transactions forces many companies to purchase in bulk and effectively shuts out smaller businesses.</p><p>Advocates of ‘DeFi’ or decentralized finance lobby for more personalized financial models and even a future without banks and centralized stock exchanges.</p><p>Pioneers in the space include OpenSea, the most prominent digital marketplace for crypto collectibles and NFTs, Coinbase for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrency, and Ocean Protocol, an open-source tool kit to own and deploy web-native applications, algorithms, and assets on the blockchain.</p><p>Ocean Protocol combines the ownership of data and payment rails into one. This takes the digital payment providers (Stripes of the World) and data storage (Snowflake of the World) and wraps ownership into one rail. The cost reduction, efficiency, and scalability of this mesh will be quantified in years to&nbsp;come.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter</a> or<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

<p>Security teams have been focused on protecting their customers and their business for quite a while now, but the job is never finished. Bad actors are always finding new ways to exploit IT infrastructures, and they aren’t interested in slowing down. As digital commerce and operations have shifted online, so have the bad actors. Nobody is holding up banks anymore; all the fraud now happens online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters a bit more complicated, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/privacy-consent.html">customer privacy and consent</a> have also grown in demand, and they often fall on security teams to implement. This adds yet another set of requirements that these teams have to learn, implement, track, and update, often requiring a consent management platform (CMP). And it’s not a simple switch that can be turned on. Privacy and consent requirements vary by region, regulatory standards, customer preferences, and other factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long gone are the days when convenience was the main customer driver. “You’d like access to all of my personal data for one-click access? Sure, why not, what’s the harm?” Do you still wonder what happens to those pictures you upload to social media sites and who ultimately owns them? For the longest time, it seemed like social media companies owned them, but fortunately, this trend is starting to shift as customer concern about privacy and data collection continues to grow. And the main driver of this shift is often companies’&nbsp; bottom line. Customers don’t do business with companies they don’t trust, especially when there are numerous substitutions available just a few clicks away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authentication security remains a significant vulnerability in most organizations' security posture. Even individuals without technical expertise can easily acquire and employ pre-made hacking tools. Microsoft, for instance, fends off an astonishing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/01/26/2023-identity-security-trends-and-solutions-from-microsoft/">1,000 authentication attacks a second</a>. Furthermore, the dark web is flooded with over 24 billion username and password pairs available for purchase, perpetuating the constant onslaught of these malicious activities.</p>  
<p>Security systems have incorporated measures like <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> to deter attackers. However, several MFA methods, including push notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs), are easy to circumvent. Adaptive authentication is a promising advancement to enhance authentication protocols, leveraging diverse parameters to conduct a risk-based evaluation of authentication requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In this blog, we’ll delve into adaptive authentication, exploring how it is deployed and how it can enhance your authentication security.</p> 
 What Is Adaptive Authentication?  
<p>Adaptive authentication, also knowns as risk-based authentication, is an intelligent system that dynamically determines when to step up authentication and request additional factors to prove identity. The system makes risk-based assessments for determining what level of authentication must be provided, moving towards continuous assessment rather than a user simply authenticating at the start of their session.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common example of adaptive authentication is banking applications, where users can freely view their account balance. However, the authentication process may require additional factors if they want to initiate a transfer. Likewise, within an enterprise setting, risk-based assessments can determine what data or apps a user can access with the authentication factors they’ve provided. It is also apparent on a smart device, where a low-risk request, such as checking the time or seeing the subject of an email, can be done without entering a password or using a biometric identifier.</p> 
<p>Adaptive authentication serves two primary objectives. Firstly, it aims to enhance authentication security by eliminating the “break once, run everywhere” scenario, where an attacker gains continuous account access by overcoming a single authentication challenge. Secondly, it strives to strike a balance between security and user experience. Since the strength of authentication is often associated with its duration or complexity, adaptive authentication allows low-risk requests to be granted swiftly without burdening users with excessive time-consuming processes.</p> 
 How Adaptive Authentication Is Deployed  
<p>The driving force of adaptive authentication is risk assessment, with the authentication requirements increasing linearly as the risk to the user or organization increases. The following “rules” govern how adaptive authentication is deployed in real-life applications.&nbsp;</p> 
 Static Rules  
<p>This ruleset has a clear relationship between actions, risks, and authentication requirements. This means, for example, that every time a user seeks to submit changes within an internal app, they must pass an authentication challenge. Standard rule policies cover role-based access, the importance of the data or application, or the action they are looking to take. In these cases, a defined rule will correspond to a defined authentication protocol.</p> 
 Dynamic Rules  
<p>These are where the users’ actions and behavior will set the baseline for system access, and any deviations from that norm trigger authentication challenges. For example, if you log on every day from Southern California but now it says you’re in Brazil, this would cause the system to ask for further identity verification. Similarly, if your account normally interacts with product development but now it’s seeking access to the sales team’s client list, it would be flagged.</p> 
<p>Some adaptive authentication technologies incorporate even more sophisticated dynamic risk signals such as device status, user behavior anomalies and risk data from SIEM tools or other corporate security systems.</p> 
 Hybrid Rules  
<p>This sees the adaptive authentication process use both dynamic and static rules. This might look like increasing authentication requirements for certain apps but lowering them if a user logs on with their recognized device on a company VPN rather than an unknown device on a public network. However, as machine learning improves in capabilities mixing static with AI-driven authentication policies could become very common.</p> 
<p>The stepped-up authentication requests that the system makes can be the same as those of your MFA system, which could include:</p> 
  
  Biometric identifiers (face or retina scans, fingerprints)  
  <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTPs sent to SMS/email</a>  
  Security keys  
  Smart cards  
  <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">Push notifications</a> sent to a personal device  
  
<p>Depending on the risk level of the user’s request, a system can also require different factors than what they logged in with to improve security. As mentioned, contextual indicators, such as IP, device MAC address, or geolocation, can also play a role in deciding the risk level of the request.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, many MFA methods aren’t all that secure so adding in an additional layer may not sufficiently secure against the increased risk level. Ideally, your baseline authentication would already use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant mfa,</a> with the step-up requirements either being a re-authentication request or another highly secure factor.</p> 
 Benefits of Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Implementing adaptive authentication provides several key advantages for organizations, including enhanced security and bottom-line savings.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improves Security  
<p>Adaptive authentication protocols should improve the detection of <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a> or at least compartmentalize how far they can spread. Requiring several more layers of authentication factors as the privilege level escalates makes it unlikely that anything bar highly targeted attacks could succeed. In addition, building a behavioral anomaly identifier into the system for dynamic rulesets can identify unauthorized intrusions as they occur.</p> 
 Balances User Experience and Security  
<p>If an authentication system is too demanding, users will get frustrated and try to take shortcuts, such as sharing authentication factors, to save time. If it is a customer, they may abandon their transaction and take their business elsewhere. An advantage of adaptive authentication is that it seeks to find the best for both, with low-risk requests treated with a lighter touch. This way, users understand there’s a reason for heavier security for higher-risk requests.</p> 
 Saves Time and Money

 The Shyft Perspective: Crypto Regulations — The South American&nbsp;Way <p>South America, home to over 440 million people across twelve nations and three territories, comprises roughly 5.47% of the global population. Yet, when discussions turn to cryptocurrencies, attention predominantly shifts to the Western World and the emerging Asian economies. This oversight is surprising, given that South America is leading the charge in digital currency adoption and pioneering central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><p>Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador notably rank among the top 20 nations for global cryptocurrency adoption. The rise of crypto in South America isn’t just about global rankings — it’s deeply rooted in pressing economic challenges.</p><p>The continent grapples with high inflation, increasing social unrest, waning trust in public institutions, and stagnant job and economic growth. For instance, Venezuela is suffering from hyperinflation that has left its currency worthless, catapulting cryptocurrencies to a favored position in the nation and shedding light on similar trends throughout the&nbsp;region.</p> Crypto Adoption in South&nbsp;America <p>Taking a closer look at South America’s stance on crypto, it’s clear the region is not just active but thriving. The 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis echoes this sentiment: Brazil is positioned at the 7th spot, followed by Argentina at 13th, Colombia at 15th, and Ecuador rounding off at 18th. The figures paint an interesting narrative.</p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)<p>South American nations, in fact, boast higher crypto adoption rates per capita than some of the most developed economies, including the likes of the US and EU. This perspective is further emphasized by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202468/global-cryptocurrency-ownership/">Statista’s findings</a>: Argentina leads with crypto ownership of 21%, trailed by Colombia at 15%, Chile at 14%, and Peru and Brazil both at 13%. In contrast, economic titans such as the US could muster only 10%, Russia 8%, China 7%, Germany 7%, and Japan at a mere&nbsp;4%.</p><p>It’s evident there’s a solid demand for cryptocurrencies in these nations, particularly showcased by the surge in peer-to-peer (P2P)&nbsp;usage.</p><p>To contextualize this momentum, the <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/PP/2023/English/PPEA2023004.ashx">International Monetary Fund’s February 2023 report</a> highlights several catalysts: the allure of efficient cross-border transactions, the appeal of crypto as a bulwark against hyperinflation, challenges stemming from fiat currency depreciation, and the overarching need to navigate strict capital controls. These elements, in tandem, underline the region’s steady pivot towards crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Crypto Regulations in South&nbsp;America <p>South America has been at the forefront of crypto adoption, yet it lacks a region-wise comprehensive regulatory structure like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA). As such, crypto regulation diverges widely across the region, ranging from crypto acceptance to prohibition.</p><p>Looking into the latest major developments in South America’s crypto regulatory landscape, we can easily identify trends emerging in this&nbsp;region.</p> Argentina <p>Amidst an escalating annual inflation rate of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/argentina-inflation-likely-sped-back-up-ahead-primary-vote-analysts-say-2023-08-11/#:~:text=Argentina%20has%20one%20of%20the,dollars%20to%20protect%20the%20peso.">116%</a>, its highest in over three decades, Argentina finds itself at a crossroads. Interestingly, this financial turbulence coincides with the rise of pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate Javier&nbsp;Milei.</p><p>This isn’t surprising, given an interest rate of 118%, unpredictable currency fluctuations, strict capital controls, and a general wariness towards the government. In this climate, approximately 12% of the population is adopting&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Buenos Aires even facilitates tax payments via&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>However, the nation’s engagement with crypto doesn’t stop at usage. Argentina is also a significant hub for Bitcoin mining. And while the central bank maintains a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, public regulators are more optimistic. They <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-regulatory-recap-19th-june-to-4th-july">have expressed interest</a> in fostering the growth of the crypto sector and building a structured regulatory environment.</p><p>As the landscape evolves, Argentina is all set to roll out new crypto rules, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentina-regulate-crypto-firms-fight-145745814.html">aligning with IMF’s strategies</a> to counter money laundering.</p> Bolivia <p>In the case of Bolivia, the country’s central bank has prohibited the use and commercialization of crypto assets, making such means of payment for the purchase and sale of products and services illegal in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>However, recently, Bolivian National Deputy Mariela Baldivieso spearheaded an initiative to legalize cryptocurrencies in Bolivia by introducing a proposal to lift the current ban on crypto assets. The proposal urges the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance to establish regulatory norms and “embrace new technologies as a transformative opportunity to strengthen our economy, promote financial inclusion, and open the doors to technological innovation.”</p> Brazil <p>The 10th largest economy globally with an <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/brazil-inflation-returns-to-target-range-64cd849c#:~:text=The%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20in,the%20national%20statistics%20institute%2C%20IBGE.">inflation of 4.65%</a>, Brazil is the 5th largest crypto market in the world. Approximately 7.8% of its citizens are now crypto&nbsp;owners.</p><p>What’s more, their trading activities have been bustling. Only in 2022 alone, they transacted a staggering $11.4 billion in stablecoins. The primary drivers that have motivated Brazilians to turn to cryptocurrencies are price speculation, their purported role as a reliable store of value, and streamlined international remittances.</p><p>Taking note of this momentum, in June 2023, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva t endorsed a decree, carving out a solid legal foundation for the country’s burgeoning crypto economy. This legislation entrusts the central bank with the mandate to keep a keen eye on virtual asset service providers, known in industry parlance as&nbsp;VASPs.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>And for those tokens that parallel securities? They remain under the oversight of Brazil’s Comissão de Valores Mobiliários, or CVM, akin to the US’s SEC. It doesn’t end&nbsp;there.</p><p>The central bank, in tandem with payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, is gearing up to roll out a pilot for their own digital currency: the digital&nbsp;real.</p> Chile <p>Chile has a small but rapidly growing crypto market, with around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-chile-2021/">2.6%</a> of the population owning crypto. The country has a thriving P2P trading market and perceives crypto positively, with 36% of Chileans in favor of crypto being recognized as an official kind of currency. There’s also the possibility of a Digital Chilean&nbsp;Peso.</p><p>Currently, there is no formal regulatory framework, but tax guidance is available for those trading digital assets or those doing business in virtual assets. Under Chile’s tax guidelines, crypto assets are classified as virtual assets, which are not considered securities or foreign currencies, which means investors need to pay capital gains&nbsp;taxes.</p><p>The nation has been debating a “Bitcoin Law,” which was presented to Congress in late 2021 and aimed to generate a safe environment and provide protection for involved parties while making the central bank responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies.</p> Colombia <p>This country, home to hundreds of crypto ATMs, is the 4th largest crypto market by volume for P2P trading worldwide. It is estimated that <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-colombia-2021/">6.1%</a> of its citizens own cryptocurrency. This adoption is due to strict taxation policies for crypto within Colombia and a lack of regulatory clarity for exchanges and crypto businesses.</p><p>In Dec. 2021, Colombia’s Financial Information and Analysis Unit mandated cryptocurrency exchanges to report user transactions. Notably, all Bitcoin transactions above $150 were required to be registered after April 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The nation has also created a regulatory sandbox, a pilot program that enables exchanges to interoperate with banks. But it hasn’t been the most successful due to the 40% of the population being unbanked.</p> Ecuador <p>Interest in cryptocurrencies is clearly rising in Ecuador, with <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-ecuador-2021/">2.73%</a> of its residents now holding such&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Ecuador, which operates its own electronic money system anchored to its official currency, the US dollar, has set firm rules for the crypto scene. Although the National Assembly once outlawed Bitcoin, it has since revised its position, as it clarified: while cryptos aren’t official payment methods, buying and selling them remains&nbsp;legal.</p> Guyana <p>In Guyana, cryptocurrency regulation is still in its infancy. Even so, the government is actively laying the groundwork for a regulatory framework. As part of this initiative, they have established a task force dedicated to studying the crypto landscape, aiming to both regulate the industry and safeguard investors.</p><p>Building on that, <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llglrd/2021687419/2021687419.pdf">the Library of Congress pointed out in November 2021</a> that although Guyana places restrictions on certain cryptocurrency activities, there isn’t a complete ban. Furthermore, the sector remains untouched by tax laws and measures against money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT).</p> Paraguay <p>Paraguay is yet another crypto-friendly nation where crypto is widely used in everyday life. However, in Dec. 2022, Paraguay failed to pass a bill that would have regulated crypto and mining. The bill titled “Regulating the industry and marketing of virtual assets — crypto assets” was approved <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining">only to be vetoed later by President Mario Abdo&nbsp;Benítez</a>.</p><p>This comes at a time when some of the world’s largest Bitcoin miners have set up operations in Paraguay, having been attracted by the cheap energy rates it&nbsp;offers.</p> Peru <p>Much like Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia, inflation is the primary driver of crypto and stablecoin adoption in Peru. And although its annual inflation has eased somewhat in July 2023 at <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/peru/inflation-cpi#:~:text=to%20Slow%20Down-,Annual%20inflation%20rate%20in%20the%20capital%20of%20Peru%2C%20Lima%2C%20fell,bank's%201%2D3%25%20target.">5.88%</a>, it is still above the central bank’s target band of 1%-3%. Political turmoil is another factor that has led to Peruvians buying crypto as a hedge against financial crisis.</p><p>The country has been taking a slower approach to adopting a regulatory framework. Only recently, it has begun debating the creation of a public registry of crypto service providers that aims to report what it terms “suspicious operations.” Profits from trading crypto, however, are&nbsp;taxed.</p> Suriname <p>Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the law in Suriname, and there are no mechanisms to regulate their use or tax the income derived from them. However, trading and investing in crypto assets is possible through P2P and crypto exchanges.</p><p>Located in the northern part of South America, Suriname is one of three carbon-negative countries in the world, seeing growing interest in crypto among its citizens with a couple of projects looking to connect its indigenous communities with global markets through&nbsp;crypto.</p> Uruguay <p>In Sept. 2022, Uruguay’s executive branch <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-bill-introduced-in-uruguays-parliament-what-you-should-know">submitted a bill to Congress</a> to give the country’s central bank legal powers to regulate crypto. The bill proposes to treat crypto assets as securities that can only be issued by a registered entity per the laws and regulations. It further aims to create a new category of companies for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and seeks to amend the organic charter of the Banco Central Del Uruguay or Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) and put VASPs under the supervision of the Financial Services Superintendence.</p><p>The country’s central bank has started working on a plan to lay the foundation for regulating cryptocurrencies and companies that provide related services. For now, however, there is no explicit tax regulation in Uruguay for cryptocurrencies.</p> Venezuela <p>With its national currency, the Bolivar, depreciating more than 100,000% from 2014 to 2022, Venezuela has been pro-crypto for a while now. Over the last few years, Venezuela formed the national crypto department, created a framework for crypto mining, institutionalized the registration of crypto exchanges, and in 2021, launched its own cryptocurrency called The&nbsp;Petro.</p><p>But challenges arose when people accused the country’s crypto regulator of corruption. This controversy led to the arrest of the Superintendent of Cryptoassets, Sunacrip. Subsequently, Anabel Pereira Fernández, a lawyer who served as president of the Fondo de Garantía de Depositos y Protección Bancaria, the Venezuelan version of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, took the reins and closed multiple crypto exchanges and mining farms. The national crypto group, Asociación Nacional de Criptomonedas (Asonacrip), opposed her decisions, emphasizing that private enterprises shouldn’t bear the brunt of internal regulatory issues.</p><p>José Ángel Álvarez, Asonacrip’s president, conveyed his concerns about the indiscriminate crackdown on mining farms, especially those fully compliant with required permits. And while the organization respects the need for a thorough anti-corruption probe, Asonacrip urged a more nuanced approach that doesn’t hamper the nation’s burgeoning crypto infrastructure.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>A perfect storm of challenges — weak national currencies, climbing inflation, political upheavals, capital restrictions, large unbanked populations, and a surge in remote work — has set the stage for crypto’s broad acceptance in South American&nbsp;nations.</p><p>While some countries have not yet specified any laws regarding crypto, most economies are contemplating regulation as the adoption of crypto assets continues to rise. A few countries have made significant advances toward establishing a regulatory framework, particularly those with the highest crypto adoption.</p><p>Across South America, legislation to oversee crypto has entered the discussion phase, each at varying progression levels. Yet, a unified and all-encompassing set of standards remains elusive, making it challenging to both harness crypto’s advantages and mitigate its associated risks.</p><p>Numerous countries in this region are taking strides to bring crypto under the rule of law, but the journey stretches far ahead.

				  In a previous article we discussed <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-does-the-ledger-do-anyway/">what exactly a ledger does.</a> In this article we will seek to understand why you would want to use one, and what your options are.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>For a brief recap, the ledger offers four important elements when building a decentralized ecosystem, these being:</p>
<p>1) Immutability: The data cannot be changed — by anyone.<br>2) Tamper resistance: A distributed ledger makes it very difficult for a malicious actor to break in and change material.<br>3) High availability: If one node on the network goes down for any reason, there are plenty of others to receive data from.<br>4) Geopolitical and infrastructure diversity: By hosting the ledger on servers located in multiple geographic areas and by diverse organizations, network resilience to technical problems is maximized — and this contributes to high availability.</p>
<p>While there are other options available, ledgers provide all these aspects in one convenient place; oftentimes, efforts to provide all the necessary features end up resembling a ledger anyway.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that while other options such as web infrastructure (did:web or similar) can provide some of the combination of immutability, tamper resistance, and high availability, they often fall short in one of them. For example, did:web doesn’t provide features universally, leading to a deficit in the high availability / diversity category.</p>
<p>When creating a decentralized network, using a ledger is often both the easiest and most effective choice. Once you have decided on using a ledger there are several different types that you can employ, all with slightly different specialties.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work Networks</p>
<p>The most well-known proof-of-work network is Bitcoin, which was also the first widely-known application of blockchain technology. Beginning as a protocol for peer-to-peer financial transaction, Bitcoin evolved to become a store of value, known generically as a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Without a central authority to authorize and record transactions, a decentralized financial network needs to establish a way to ensure that everyone agrees on what is written to the ledger, not least to prevent money being spent twice.</p>
<p>Bitcoin solves this with “proof of work.” It turns the verification of a new block of transaction records into a numeric challenge, the solution of which writes the block to the chain and earns the winner Bitcoin (which expands the amount of currency in circulation). Those that compete to solve the problem are called “miners,” and the complexity of the problem increases the more miners there are and decreases the fewer there are. The first miner to complete a proof of work for a new block, broadcasts the block to the rest of the network, where it is <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">verified</a> as following the rules of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>This process ensures that a new block is written to the ledger roughly every ten minutes and that the effort expended to solve the problem is evenly balanced to the Bitcoin earned. The easiest way to think of all this is that the effort required to verify transactions serves as a deterrent against fraud. This proof-of-work methodology, however, is not without controversy, as the effort is measured in computing power and hence energy to do the work. This excess usage of energy is frequently criticized as being wasteful.</p>
<p>If you want to use a proof-of-work network — such as Bitcoin — you will need to have your transactions verified by a miner, typically for a small fee. This fee can fluctuate and be unpredictable, but generally the more you are willing to pay, the quicker your transaction record will be verified.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Stake Networks</p>
<p>Some networks are controlled through proof of stake networks, often referred to as smart contracts, which are digital programs that mirror the functions of a traditional contract in the form of “if this, then that” rules. Once the terms of the contract are met, the program automatically executes the predetermined outcome. A popular analogy is that of a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/">digital vending machine.</a> As a smart contract program cannot be altered and automatically executes the terms of the contract, it can be trusted to continually execute the code it was created with.</p>
<p>While smart contract networks can do a lot more than finance-oriented, proof-of-work networks, this greater flexibility creates complexity. When a smart contract is not read and understood correctly by the user, or the contract parameters are defined poorly, the code may do things you were not expecting or don’t want to happen. And once the code executes it can’t be undone.</p>
<p>The transaction fees on this type of network pay for the execution of contracts (Ethereum calls this fee “gas”) and keeps the contracts to be kept active and running on the network. The fees required are subject to market forces, and makes this fee unpredictable.</p>
<p>Public-Permissioned Networks</p>
<p>A public permissioned network allows anyone to read the data written to it but requires authorization by the network to write to it. This is because the ledger is a permanent record and writing personal data to the ledger would breach data privacy law, such as the right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to write to this type of ledger (typically called a “Transaction Author”) must go through a “Transaction Endorser,” an organization that has a signed legal agreement with the network for approving writes to the ledger. Endorsers may charge a transaction fee for approving writes and pay a fee to the network for writing to the ledger. These fees can change, but are far less volatile than the fluctuating fees charged by other ledger technologies.</p>
<p>A good example of this type of network would be <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy-based identity networks.</a> These networks are ideal for decentralized identity as they are compliant by default with many rules and regulations put into place by governments that have run into issues with blockchains in the past. These ledgers do not require proof of work to establish consensus. They are not set up to create tokens or currencies and can’t handle complex smart contracts, focusing instead on the fundamental needs of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>No Network?</p>
<p>Some of the goals of decentralized identity may be accomplished without using a ledger at all. There is, for example, some support for hosting the assets necessary for an identity ecosystem on web infrastructure, a well-understood technology stack which avoids all the complexities of a ledger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, web technology does not meet the requirements necessary for a stable decentralized ecosystem. While immutability and tamper resistance can be achieved with the proper application of digital signatures, and high availability in web infrastructure can be gained by using clusters of servers for redundancy (often by the use of a content delivery network, or a large, distributed collection of servers for delivering web content), these must be provided on a per-identifier basis. Some web infrastructure will have high availability, and some will not. This creates an uncertain environment when it comes to accessing the assets required for data verification.</p>
<p>Infrastructure diversity is partially solved using the same methods as high availability, but the need to continue hosting assets when a company or organization ceases to exist remains unmet. This also adds uncertainty when retrieving assets using web infrastructure.</p>
<p>The decision to use web infrastructure must be made with these deficiencies in mind and a plan to address them.</p>
<p>So how do I choose?</p>
<p>When choosing a network to host your solution the answer comes down to functionality and seeing if your goals align with what the network is good at. As we have outlined above, despite all falling under the umbrella of “blockchain,” these networks have very different ways of establishing consensus, creating blocks, and executing code.</p>
<p>A brief recap and slight oversimplification may be helpful here:</p>
<p>If you are looking for token or financial exchanges, and can handle heavy computation costs, a proof-of-work network is probably best suited for you.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a trustworthy way to broker deals and execute code when certain conditions are met — “if this, then that” — then a smart contract network is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you are looking to create a solution that needs to be highly visible to anyone, but exclusive about who can write to the network — such as anyone being able to check an ID but very few being able to create one — then a public-permissioned network will meet your needs nicely.</p>
<p>Need something free that meets credential holder needs and you don’t care about issuing capabilities? Did:peer could be an option for you.</p>
<p>Lastly, if high availability and infrastructure diversity are not major concerns, you might be able to use did:web.</p>
<p>This technology is new and highly nuanced. If you aren’t completely sure which network will be best for you, figuring it out before you start building can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Indicio can personally attest to the effectiveness and ease of <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy networks.</a> Indicio uses them across our products and services, and If you are interested in building an ecosystem for the secure exchange of identity information, these networks are custom built with your use cases in mind.</p>

<p>The CA/Browser Forum released <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/05/24/ballot-csc-18-update-revocation-requirements/">Ballot CSC-18 to update the code signing certificate revocation requirements</a> in the Code Signing Baseline Requirements (CSBRs). The purpose of the ballot is to align the revocation reasons with the TLS BRs and to provide stricter requirements for revocation due to private key compromise and use in suspect code.</p>
<p>Revocation reason consistency will allow the CAs to have the same response and processes for most revocations regardless of certificate type. The revocation reasons are also similar to those with the S/MIME BRs. CAs issuing code signing certificates also need to address where a certificate has an associated private key that has been compromised or where the private key has signed suspect code. Suspect code may contain malicious functionality or serious vulnerabilities, such as spyware or malware. Suspect code may install without the user’s consent or may resist removal. The code may compromise user security or could be exploited in ways not intended by its designers.</p>
<p>The CSBRs will require certificates associated with compromised private keys or suspect code to be revoked within 24 hours. This will stop any future use of a compromised key or signing of more suspect code. The requirements also allow the CA to change the revocation date to a time earlier than when the revocation occurred. The purpose of backdating the revocation date is to choose a time before the key was compromised or suspect code was signed. With the earlier date, any timestamped signature by the compromised key or on suspect code performed after the date would no longer be trusted.</p>
<p>There is an exception to the certificate revocation requirements. This may apply when an application software supplier, such as Microsoft, requests a delay where immediate revocation has a potentially large negative impact to the code signing ecosystem. An instance may occur where revocation of the certificate will also impact good signatures, which will prevent the associated good code from being installed. A delay would allow the good code to be re-signed with a new private key.</p>
<p>The ballot includes reasons for a root CA to revoke a subordinate CA. These reasons are the same as those specified in the TLS BRs.</p>
<p>Entrust will update its practices to reflect the new ballot, which is effective April 15, 2024.</p>

 Interview with interested.fyi Team: Implementing Veramo in Buildathon at EthDenver 2023 EthDenver2023<p>We had the pleasure of interviewing the interested.fyi team after their participation in the last Buildl hackathon at EthDenver 2023. The team integrated Veramo into their project, and we were excited to learn more about their experience.</p><p>The Buildl hackathon is a renowned blockchain hackathon that brings together developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts to collaborate and build innovative blockchain solutions. The Buildl hackathon was held recently at EthDenver 2023. The hackathon saw the participation of several teams, including interested.fyi.</p><p>The team consists of eleven (11)&nbsp;members:</p><p>Product: Alec.eth Gutman (Venture Contributooor) — Peeple DAO / Ex ConsenSys Mesh &amp; Matt Mulford (Engineer)</p><p>With contributions from Kate Yeh (Product)—Scroll/ Ex Arbitrum + DoorDash, Chester, LaCroix (Design)—Free agent / Ex Sushi + Component.fi&nbsp;, Charles Walsh (Design)—Free agent / Ex, John McClure (Engineer)—Inuition/ Ex Ethereal Ventures + DRW and Alexis Bednarick (Venture Contributooor) — Peeple&nbsp;DAO</p><p>Day2Day Venture Contributooors:</p><p>Alec.eth Gutman, Alexis Bednarick — Peeple DAO, Alexis Perez — Peeple DAO, and Manny Narang — Peeple DAO + Developer DAO</p><p>We wanted to know more about interested.fyi’s experience using Veramo and how it helped them in their project. Let’s dive into their journey and see how they #builtwithveramo!</p><blockquote>Veramo is an open-source modular framework that simplifies the process of building decentralized identity solutions.</blockquote> Q1. <p>Can we meet you? (Tell us about the team and your roles within the project.)</p><p>At our recruiting Service DAO, we are developing Interested.fyi, a product that enables us to contribute to the products we are most passionate about getting to market. Our goal is to improve the process of venture contribution and support the growth of innovative products.</p> Q2. <p>Tell us a bit about your solution. How did you come up with the idea for your project, and why did you build it? (Read: What problem were you trying to&nbsp;solve?)</p><p>As curators of conversations, we’ve often found that interests drive the best discussions. We are making it simple to express interest in working with and/or learning more about a specific&nbsp;team.</p> Q3. <p>How did you come across Veramo, and why did you choose it for your&nbsp;project?</p><p>I came across Veramo after struggling with another SDK that couples all of its features tightly to its storage layer. Googling DID solutions led me to Veramo. The Veramo tools existing independently of any other technology is what makes it appealing. We are free to set up a web resolver and then add on chain elements to enhance the experience as it makes sense, rather than going all in on a beta, decentralized storage solution. Also, the documentation was spot&nbsp;on.</p> Q4. <p>How did our framework help you achieve your project&nbsp;goals?</p><p>By only focusing on the DID/VC layer and allowing us to implement our own storage, we were able to ideate and test implementations more efficiently.</p> Q7. <p>How do you see this project going&nbsp;forward?</p><p>We will likely seek funding to build&nbsp;more</p> Q8. <p>If people are interested in collaborating, how can they reach&nbsp;you?</p><p>In the weeks to come, you’ll be able to attest to your interest in learning more about People DAO with ease. Until then, you can get in touch with us at @chipagosfinest on Twitter or Telegram.</p><p>___________________________________________________________</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about Veramo and connecting with others in the community, we invite you to <a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">join our community</a>.

<p>Liquid Avatar Technologies provides shareholder update.</p>



<p>August 21, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has received a non-binding offer for its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) and its Liquid Avatar Mobile App from a private Swiss based Metaverse and virtual experience organization.&nbsp; Contingent on financing in an amount to be agreed, final agreements and financial terms being agreed, and all necessary approvals, the transaction, should it come to fruition, is expected to provide Liquid Avatar Technologies with cash, primarily for debt reduction, and an expected significant amount of equity in the new parent company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Management and the Board of Directors believe that this opportunity provides long term optimal value for shareholders and is working with all parties to complete due diligence. The teams have undertaken to begin working on definitive agreements. Completion of the transaction will require all necessary corporate, shareholder and any regulatory approvals.&nbsp; Additional information will be provided on this potential transaction upon definitive agreements being executed. During this period, the Company will remain focused on completing this opportunity as it does not have the resources to finalize its outstanding financial statements in order to seek a revocation of the existing cease trade order.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse may continue to pursue its own, non-dilutive financing efforts in the short term.&nbsp; As announced in April 2023, Aftermath Islands received an executed share purchase agreement from a Family Office in the UK and EU but has yet to receive any funding.&nbsp; As a result of these unfulfilled obligations on the part of the Family Office, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited is in the process of terminating that agreement and may seek other financing opportunities.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing marketing and business efforts, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited has achieved almost $3 Million USD in gross retail and commercial sales since the start of the program in November 2021, which have been recorded as Deferred Revenue in accordance with IFRS, with approximately 8,000 purchases made through the Shopify store, and the Company is continuing to execute its business plan to the best of its abilities under the current circumstances, including meeting a number of key technology milestones.&nbsp; Lost Kingdom of T’Sara users have generated, since late October 2022, almost 8 million Resource Pack NFTs for use inside of Aftermath Islands.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands is currently developing an Artificial Intelligence powered creator program, allowing users to perform Karaoke songs through their Avatars.&nbsp; Users can sing into a phone or web cam and the platform will take their facial gestures and head movement and using AI, map that to their Avatar, which can sing any one of over 10,000 licensed Karaoke songs.&nbsp; This program is expected to debut later this year and has already received interest from a number of major platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Company continues to expand its program opportunities with the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and is pursuing additional opportunities outside of Aftermath Islands to integrate its technology for Proof of Humanity into other platforms.</p>



<p>“This has been a difficult time for many micro-cap public companies, including our own.&nbsp; Management and the team members continue to work diligently to create long term value.&nbsp; We are excited by this opportunity to consolidate our programs and believe that this will potentially provide the best solution for shareholders given the current economic environment,” said David Lucatch, CEO Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands’ early-stage experience is currently available, through a mobile, tablet or computer browser, with no downloads, at <a href="https://play.aftermathislands.com">play.aftermathislands.com</a> and it is continuing to add new and exciting experiences to its open world.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, if you had said ‘Individuals should have control over their data’, it might have seemed controversial. Nowadays it’s commonly accepted. But as one door opens, another door closes. We need to be&nbsp;aware.</p><p>What people understand and mean by the word ‘control’ differs, and the consequences of these differences are far-reaching. One interpretation of ‘control’ could unleash a once-in-a-lifetime social and economic breakthrough. But there is another, very common understanding of what it means, and if pursued it could make our lives a lot worse. We need to look beyond glib slogans to understand their real&nbsp;content.</p> Two meanings of ‘control’ <p>Most people, when they think about issues relating to personal data, focus on how the world currently works. Quite understandably. But these workings are the product of a particular history that has resulted in today’s status quo. This history revolved around the organisation-centric database.</p><p>‘Organisation-centric database’ sounds like a bit of a mouthful but actually it’s very simple. Organisations collect and generate data about individuals and use this data to provide services. To do this they need a place to keep this data — in their systems: the organisation-centric database.</p><p>In this context, when people talk about individuals exerting more control over their data, they mean individuals having more control over what organisations can do with their personal data: what data they can collect, what they can use it for, who it is shared with, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>That’s great. But it is also very limited. It doesn’t, for example, actually allow individuals to collect and store their own data in their own databases and to use it for their own purposes. It’s like creating a personal mobility system where people can order taxis to take them places, but where they are not allowed to own their own&nbsp;cars.</p><p>It also creates a rather specific agenda. If people want to control the data that organisations have about them, they need to understand what this data is and what it is being used for. They also need to understand how to exert control via each different organisation’s own systems. For this agenda to work, people need to be ‘educated’ and ‘informed’ (for example, about the meaning and content of long and detailed terms of service and privacy policies). They need to invest the time and effort needed to get informed and to act on the conclusions of their investigations.</p><p>The net effect of this agenda is that it imposes new burdens on individuals, the implication being that if they are too ‘lazy’ to get themselves informed and to act on what they discover, then they deserve everything they get. People, we then get told, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">don’t actually want to manage their&nbsp;data</a>.</p><p>In short, this organisation-centric form of control actually reaffirms the primacy of organisations in their role as the effective rulers of the data&nbsp;economy.</p> The person-centric view of the&nbsp;world <p>Under the person-centric view of the world, individuals are empowered to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, independently of any organisations that may be collecting data about them e.g. in their own personal data store. This personal data store holds their data safely, under the individuals’ complete control, outside of and beyond the systems of the organisations they have data relationships with.</p>Person-centred is a different design creating different outcomes<p>As the figure shows they can use this data however they wish (not just the purposes that the organisation wants to put it to). And they can share this data with whoever they wish (including other organisations wanting to use it to provide them with services).</p><p>Previously, we’ve talked in great detail about the immense economic benefits this approach to personal data creates. You can see what we said about this in our <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">White Paper</a> and in our special blog series on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/economics-of-personal-data/home">The Economics of Personal Data</a>. But for now, let’s just note that this approach creates a completely different action&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>Instead of demanding that individuals get themselves ‘educated’ and ‘informed’ it operates on the basis of safe by default (the data sharing agreements referred to in the illustration). When you share data with an organisation why shouldn’t you ‘just know’, because the necessary safeguards have already been built in to how things work, that the organisation will only collect the data it needs to provide the service in question, that it will only use this data to provide the agreed service, and that it won’t share this data with anybody not involved in delivering this&nbsp;service?</p><p>Requiring people to inspect privacy policies and terms and conditions before doing business with an organisation is akin to expecting them to do their own safety checks on a plane before embarking on it (after which it’s their own fault if anything goes&nbsp;wrong).</p><p>Also, instead of focusing on the mechanisms of how individuals should assert control within each organisation’s different systems, it focuses on providing them with the tools and infrastructure they need for independent control of their data, including a single dashboard by which they can change settings and permissions for every organisation they deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>In other words, the two different interpretations of control lead in entirely different directions. One interpretation reaffirms the primacy of the organisation as the power-holder in data relationships and places new burdens on individuals; the other empowers individuals via the provision of new personal data store infrastructure and makes their lives&nbsp;easier.</p> Two meanings of ‘individual as point of integration of their&nbsp;data’ <p>This chalk and cheese contrast between the two different interpretations of the word ‘control’ has other implications, potentially with even more damaging consequences.</p><p>There is now a growing movement of people and organisations (such as <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData Global</a>) that seek to give individuals more control over their data. One much discussed aspect of this is making individuals the point of integration of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s a great idea. Currently, data about us is dispersed across dozens — probably hundreds — of different organisations, each collecting a different set of details about us: about our money, our health, our activities online, what we buy, and so on. Just imagine what could be done with this data if it was all put into one place, to create a rounded picture of our lives! The potential benefits are enormous. But so are the potential dangers.</p><p>Under the first, organisation-centric interpretation of the word ‘control’, individuals are confined to exercising control over the data that organisations collect about them. The more data the organisation has, the more things it can do with this data, the more value it can add — or so the argument&nbsp;goes.</p><p>But on the other hand, the more data it has about you (that is, the more information about you that has been ‘integrated’ into one organisation’s database) the more intrusive it can become, and the more power it can exercise over&nbsp;you.</p><p>Currently, in Government and other circles, there is much discussion about the potential efficiency and other benefits of ‘more data sharing’ whereby more information about individuals can be ‘integrated’ into different organisations’ databases from multiple different sources.</p><p>These initiatives have an initial veneer of citizen ‘empowerment’ and ‘control’ because individuals have to ‘consent’ to these new agglomerations of data being created. But what they add up to is the further centralisation of data power in a few large organisations’ hands along with the risk of turbocharged invasions of privacy and abuses of data power. Current attempts to create Super MyAccount systems that aggregate data from many sources are an example of this. They are doing the exact opposite of what they pretend to&nbsp;do.</p><p>The alternative interpretation of individuals being the point of integration of their own data is where individuals are able to access all the data that is currently held about them in different organisations’ databases and to place this data in their own personal data store. This includes certified copies of data held by the organisation, copies that are kept up to date or just delivered and updated when&nbsp;changed.</p><p>This data is kept beyond the sight of or control of any organisation that collects data about them; where only the individual can see what the full personal database contains; and where individuals are in complete control of what they use this data for and who they share this data with. This is the approach which we at Mydex are operating and extending, initially the UK: a secure personal data exchange network that is safe, secure, consensual, distributed and resilient.</p><p>As our work on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> shows, this approach to making individuals the point of integration of their own data puts them in charge of, and in control of, the most valuable personal data asset in the world: a complete, rounded picture of the individual’s life — one that is independent of the organisations the individual deals with and that genuinely empowers that individual.</p><p>In doing so, it fundamentally alters the balance of power in the personal data economy, as individuals, rather than organisations, exercise distributed control of the economy’s most powerful data&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Once again, the two different interpretations of the same words couldn’t be more different.</p> Two meanings of ‘portability’ <p>The differences continue. It is now almost universally recognised that the unique characteristics of data — the fact that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when used, and that many different users can therefore use the same bits of data for different uses — means that, to realise its full potential, it has to be shared. Improved data sharing is now a big and growing policy theme across all Governments.</p><p>But here again, the same fundamental differences in meaning and implication arise. Under the organisation-centric assumption — the assumption that data about individuals will always and only be held by organisations — ‘data sharing’ means data sharing between organisations, with data being passed from one organisation to another but never back to the individual. This is how Open Banking currently works, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Such data sharing is supposed to be fine, because it only happens with the individual’s consent, so they are deemed to be ‘in control’. But what this approach actually does is a) disperse individuals’ data even further across even more organisations, making it even more difficult for individuals to exercise real control over this data and b) create the new points of data integration that increase the power of these organisations, as just discussed.</p><p>The second, person-centric interpretation of data portability / sharing takes us in exactly the opposite direction. Here, data sharing means organisations that have collected data about individuals sharesi this data with the individuals that this data relates to. By doing this it puts the individual at the heart of the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This sort of data sharing genuinely empowers individuals, making them the point at which data about them is integrated. But the implications reach much further than this, because in doing so, it transforms the structure of the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Currently, our data economy is organised around a long series of separate parallel data silos, each of them collecting data about the individual, each of them doing their own thing. Genuinely empowering, person-centric data sharing transforms this structure by adding individuals to its workings, making each individual an independent data sharing node within a broader data sharing&nbsp;network.</p><p>Imagine the existing data ecosystem as a redwood forest full of giant trees soaring separately and in parallel into the sky, each of them doing its own separate thing. With citizen-empowering data sharing, individuals are made into a sort of mycelial network within the soil that supports these trees, feeding nutrients and information to each other and with other trees to create a new vibrant, interconnected ecosystem.</p><p>Once again, the two meanings of the same words couldn’t be more different.</p> Two meanings of ‘interoperability’ <p>But we haven’t finished yet because the differences continue. For data sharing / data portability to work, different parties’ data systems (their software, formats, standards etc) need to be able to ‘talk’ to each other. They need to be interoperable.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: In the UK we do dates with the day first, the month second, and the year third. So 02.09.2023 means the second of September 2023. But the Americans do the day and the month the other way round, so that 02.09.2023 means the ninth of February 2023. If there isn’t a way to ‘translate’ from one format to the other chaos will&nbsp;ensue.</p><p>But here’s the thing. Under the organisation-centric interpretation of control, of individual as the point of control of data portability, the more individuals’ data is dispersed across many different organisations the more barriers to interoperability rise.</p><p>In fact, direct organisation-to-organisation data sharing generates a complexity catastrophe as it scales, as each organisation has to find ways to interoperate with the systems, formats and standards of every other organisation. The diagram below explains the simple maths behind this: if every node in a network is going to connect to every other node, each time you add a new node, the number of connections that are needed multiplied exponentially. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">This blog</a> provides chapter and&nbsp;verse.</p>Why organisation-to-organisation data sharing creates a complexity catastrophe<p>This complexity catastrophe is avoided if, aided by their personal data stores, individuals become the hubs by which data about themselves is shared. Now the only entity that organisations have to deal with in terms of data sharing is their own existing customers, via their&nbsp;PDS.</p><p>In this person-centric approach to data sharing, it is not the job of existing data holding controllers to deliver interoperability. It is the job of the personal data store operator to manage the interoperability challenges that arise from different organisations sharing their data with individuals. Far from imposing huge, added risks and costs on organisations, it greatly simplifies their lives while adding immense benefits to the individuals receiving this&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data stores can undertake this interoperability challenge very efficiently because once they have solved the problem of translating one format or software system to another, this solution can be applied — automated — every time such a translation needs to be made. This make-once-use-many times approach to interoperability is order-of-magnitude times more efficient than the immense duplication of effort that is required for direct organisation-to-organisation data&nbsp;sharing.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are old enough, you may remember the early days of social media when, it was commonly claimed, peer-to-peer information sharing would change the world. News would flow instantaneously across borders empowering people with ideas and knowledge and that would spread democracy and bring down hierarchies, tyrannies, the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Then came Cambridge Analytica-style manipulation of information feeds, fake news, hate speech and trolling. The new utopia was gamed out of existence by those who saw an opportunity to turn it into its opposite.</p><p>Today, there is near universal agreement that individuals should have ‘control’ over their personal data and many well-meaning people are working hard to make this happen. That’s great. But it needs to be done in the right way. We need to think through the how and the why, and be wary of unintended consequences. We need to avoid glib but counterproductive solutions.</p><p>Beware of what you wish for is age-old advice. But in this case, this advice is as fresh and relevant as ever. We do not want to perpetuate the mistakes of the past as we solve the future today. To avoid remaking old mistakes, clarity on terminology and meaning is&nbsp;vital.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-what-you-wish-for-e59dd1975f79">Beware what you wish for!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council recently updated their Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for protecting payment card data. The latest version, <a href="https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf">PCI DSS 4.0</a>, introduces more than 60 new or updated requirements, with new directives around passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) among the most consequential.</p> 
 What is PCI DSS 4.0?  
<p>First introduced in 2004, the PCI DSS guidelines apply to any organization that stores, processes or transmits cardholder data. To demonstrate PCI DSS compliance, organizations undergo assessment on all systems that interact with the cardholder environment.</p> 
<p>In March 2022, the Council announced PCI DSS version 4.0, providing guidelines that aim to better secure account holder and payment card data within today’s evolving cyberthreat landscape. The current reigning version, PCI DSS 3.2.1, will be officially deprecated in March 2024, and organizations will be required to implement the PCI DSS 4.0 guidelines in a phased manner over twelve months.</p> 
<p>While version 4.0 contains updates across the board, some of the most significant relate to strong authentication requirements, specifically password usage and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Weak forms of authentication leave organizations and data vulnerable to brute force attacks, credential phishing and multiple other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">password-related attacks</a>. Understanding these new requirements is key for PCI DSS compliance. We look at five critical areas as well as their potential impact for your business.</p> 
 1. PCI DSS 4.0 Password Requirements  
<p>One of the biggest changes in PCI DSS version 4 is the very strict specifications regarding passwords. PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements (sections 8.3.4-8.3.9) include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Passwords must be long and complex: Under PCI DSS 4.0 requirements, passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters&nbsp;  
  Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused: An exception is made if continuous, risk-based authentication is used, where the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access automatically determined accordingly.  
  Login attempts should be limited: According to PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements, after a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users should be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means.  
  
 Potential impact of the PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements  
<p>Longer passwords are more onerous for users and are more likely to be written down or insecurely saved in files on a device. Forced updates also tend to trigger unsafe user behaviors as people often make only minor changes that hackers are likely to guess. Moreover, all these requirements are likely to result in higher help desk calls. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Recent research from Forrester and HYPR</a> shows that the average help desk call costs organizations $42.50/call.</p> 
 2. MFA Required for All Access to the CDE  
<p>Under PCI DSS 3.2.1 guidelines, MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE). Under the new PCI DSS MFA rules (8.4.2), all access to the CDE must be gated by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>. The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers and endpoints.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication is defined as using two independent factors from the categories:</p> 
  
  Something you know, such as a password or passphrase.&nbsp;  
  Something you have, such as a token device or smart card.&nbsp;  
  &nbsp;Something you are, such as a biometric element&nbsp;  
  
<p>In its guidance on authentication factors, Version 4.0 specifically says to look at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/benefits-of-fido-authentication">FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)</a> for the use of&nbsp; tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors. While it stops short of requiring FIDO-based factors, some of its other guidance, as you will see below, points to a clear preference.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>The new regulations make clear that multi-factor authentication must be used every time the CDE is accessed, even if a user already used MFA to authenticate into the network under the remote access requirements (see below). This will add significant friction for workers, with potential consequences for both productivity and employee satisfaction. Moreover, most organizations, even if they already use some form of MFA, do not have the correct technology or systems to address the requirement for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktops</a>, workstations and servers.</p> 
 3. PCI DSS Now Requires MFA for All Remote Access  
<p>Previously, MFA was required for remote access to the cardholder data environment. With this updated PCI DSS MFA guidance, anyone logging in from outside your secured network perimeter, even if they are not actually accessing the CDE, must use multi-factor authentication. This includes all employees, both users and administrators, and all third parties and vendors. This also means that any web-based access must use MFA, even if used by employees on site.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>Effectively this means that all of your workforce that are remote, hybrid or have supporting roles outside the organization must use MFA at all times. It also means that any employee using a web-based application to access your networks and systems must use MFA, even if they are on site. In addition to the cost and IT burden of implementing MFA, cumbersome MFA procedures can negatively impact both employee productivity and satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 4. PCI DSS MFA Configuration Requirements  
<p>The new standard doesn’t just cover who must use MFA and when, it also introduces guidelines on how MFA systems must be configured to prevent misuse. Many traditional MFA solutions are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, push bombing and other attacks that bypass MFA controls. Requirement 8.5 specifies weaknesses and misconfigurations to assess for PCI compliance. These include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Your MFA system must not be susceptible to replay (aka man-in-the-middle) attacks.  
  MFA must not be able to be bypassed unless a specific exception is documented and authorized by management  
  Your MFA solution must use two different and independent factors for authentication  
  Access cannot be granted until all authentication factors are successful  
  
<p>As discussed earlier, the PCI DSS guidance on types of authentication factors makes reference to FIDO-based authentication. FIDO authentication is phishing-resistant, eliminates replay attacks and, depending on the FIDO solution, is inherently multi-factor.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your MFA solution uses SMS, OTPs or other insecure methods, it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 5. Strong Cryptographic Protocols  
<p>While earlier versions of PCI DSS required the use of strong cryptographic protocols to protect transactions and cardholder data, PCI DSS 4.0 extends the cryptographic requirement. With the new rules, any stored sensitive authentication data (SAD) must be encrypted using strong cryptography.&nbsp;</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your authentication system doesn’t properly encrypt and securely store authentication data, then it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 Meet PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance With HYPR  
<p>The new PCI DSS framework now aligns much more closely with the NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, guidance from CISA and the OMB, and other regulatory agencies that urge the adoption of FIDO-based phishing-resistant MFA and a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> approach.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-pci-dss-compliance">HYPR helps organizations comply with PCI DSS</a> MFA requirements as well as multiple other provisions included in the standard. HYPR replaces the traditional password-based approach with secure passwordless authentication that is certified by FIDO and based on passkeys. Core elements of the solution, such as the incorporation of biometric authentication, possession of a trusted device, and cryptographic tokens securely stored on the device TPM or secure enclave, ensure strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication that meets PCI DSS requirements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;At the same time, HYPR greatly improves the user experience, eliminating the need for long, complex passwords and streamlining multi-factor authentication to a single user gesture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there’s never been doubt about the importance of digital security, over the last few years it seems to have garnered a lot more attention – specifically by governments across the globe. That’s no surprise given some of the issues being looked at such as the growth of connected devices and services in the IoT space, for example. But one area that is seeing an increase in calls to action these days is mitigating the threat quantum computers will pose to traditional public key cryptography in use today.</p>
<p>Late last year, we saw an abundance of specific direction coming out of the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/how-government-action-is-providing-a-blueprint-for-post-quantum-preparedness/">United States</a>. This direction came in the form of the NSA releasing the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/the-nsa-releases-a-post-quantum-preparedness-timeline-that-begins-immediately/">CNSA 2.0 Timeline</a>, which outlined the timeline for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The timeline spans several years and acknowledges the need to plan and budget for the transition, but it also states that – at least for software and firmware signing – the transition needs to begin immediately. Further, the White House issued not one, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">but two</a> clear calls to action for government agencies to begin preparing for the quantum threat by designating a lead for collecting cryptographic information systems by December 2022, and then they must have also performed a cryptographic inventory by May 4, 2023.</p>
<p>But attention around the quantum threat and the need to migrate to post-quantum cryptography isn’t limited to the United States. This is a global issue, and as such, has garnered global attention. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 The General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands very recently <a href="https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2023/04/04/the-pqc-migration-handbook">released a handbook</a> that advises all organization to start preparing for the quantum threat now, and it also provides some clear steps to begin on that journey. 
 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) produced a <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/post-quantum-cryptography-current-state-and-quantum-mitigation">report</a> that outlines what organizations can implement now to ensure their data remains secure, including the strategy of choosing a hybrid implementation, which would mix traditional cryptography with quantum-safe cryptography. 
 The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany published its own <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Brochure/quantum-safe-cryptography.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">guide</a> with the intent of outlining the threat, demystifying PQC, and making recommendations on how to prepare. 
 The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) in France has a <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2022/01/anssi-technical_position_papers-post_quantum_cryptography_transition.pdf">position paper</a>. The paper expresses France’s views on the quantum threat – including that the threat should be considered today to address the current threat of “harvest now, decrypt later,” where sensitive data is being collected by bad actors today, with the intent of decrypting it once a quantum computer is capable. 
 
<p>One thing all the above countries and more (such as Canada, the UK, and Australia) have in common is everyone is awaiting the results of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) competition and the subsequent standards. NIST kicked off a post-quantum cryptography competition, announced the first set of winners in the summer of 2022, and is expected to release draft standards any day now. Although a few European countries have been looking at other algorithms, that’s merely to have options on top of what NIST recommends. A recent <a href="https://www.epc.eu/content/PDF/2023/Cybersecurity_DP.pdf">discussion paper</a> out of the European Policy Centre drives home the importance of a coordinated European action plan, but really this needs to be a global coordination to avoid fractured standards. NIST is seen as the gold standard for independent, open, and transparent competitions, so ideally once NIST comes out with its final recommendations, that will result in international standards and adoption.</p>

<p>Creating a strong and trusted organisational identity is fundamental to secure and efficient business. A highly assured organisational identity can help to differentiate an organisation from its competitors by presenting a verified, recognisable touchpoint that builds trust in your interactions. This blog explores the value of a highly assured organisational identity, as discussed by Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, when he joined Michael Becker of Identity Praxis and Randy Warshaw of Provenant at the recent Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF) event in London:</p>
<p></p>
 Organisation Identity builds trust and opens up efficiencies 
<p>In a previous blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/corporate-identities-trustworthy/" title="Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy">Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy</a>, we considered how a lack of trust can impact an organisation, and also the true cost of organisational misrepresentation. There are many examples of the negative impact caused by bad actors faking an organisation identity. For example, the infamous case involving a fake Eli Lilly Twitter account declaring free insulin, which caused a $15b fall in the company’s market cap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Utilising strong organisation identity helps avoid these kinds of misrepresentations.</p>
<p>Embracing organisation identity also has a positive impact on an organisation’s bottom line. This is highlighted in the case of the Finnish Government where Ubisecure provided the Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) solution that connected the Finnish business registry (containing the organisation identities) with verified individual identities. The solution allowed individuals to assert their legitimate representation of their organisation, or delegate digital representation onwards to other organisations or individuals, such as external accountants or payroll providers. Tax filing transactions could then be automated, resulting in 99% cost reductions over the traditional in-person approach. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="See the case study">See the case study</a>.</p>
 <p>Delegation Tree Example</p> 
 The Legal Entity Identifier is the most compelling Organisation Identity 
<p>There are a number of Organisation Identifiers available today (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/comparing-organisation-identifiers/" title="read more about the comparisons">read more about the comparisons</a>). Some are regional, some vertical, some closed to the public… but only one is truly global, standardised and trustworthy to be the one Organisation Identity on which we base all future identity services – and that is the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).</p>
<p>There is considerable value in combining Organisation Identity (via the LEI), verified Individual Identities (via BankID, eIDs and other initiatives), and delegation capabilities (via IAM services). The combination enables businesses to express:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who you are, who you represent and the rights that you have to represent them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The DI (or self-sovereign identity) industry is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">predicted</a> to explode in value from USD 0.65 billion in 2022 to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decentralized-identity-market-worth-102-130000466.html">USD 102.0 billion</a> by 2030, and Forbes recently listed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">50 smart companies</a> investing in blockchain (beyond crypto) to make their businesses operate better, faster or cheaper. Blockchain is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">“anchor of trust”</a> for DI.</p>



<p>The leading DI solution anchored in blockchain is a fully user-controlled <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital identity wallet</a>, in which the user accepts, securely stores, and shares <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">digital identity and other verified documents</a> to prove their identity or credentials with services.</p>



<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_14zTBLJ_Y">short video</a> about the new European digital identity wallet as an example.</p>



<p>Digital wallets and other DI applications can deliver immediate business value from:</p>



 
 new revenue opportunities (e.g. a customer wallet offering) 



 cost saving opportunities (e.g. replacing inefficient processes) 



 solving common business problems (e.g. easing the regulatory compliance burden). 
 



<p>Read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a>.</p>



 DI has the potential to benefit all industries and sectors. Here are 17 industries that can leverage Decentralized identity technology right now: 



<p></p>



  
 1. Banking and finance:  



<p>DI has massive application in this industry, including for customer-controlled onboarding, consent and data management; streamlined AML and KYC processes; secure and tamper-proof authentication, including for cross-border transactions; and fraud prevention. The <a href="https://www.itsme-id.com/en-BE">itsme</a> app in Europe, built by Belgium Mobile ID, a large consortium of Belgium’s leading banks and mobile network operators, is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 2. Healthcare:  



<p>COVID-19 accelerated the already real need for secure and private interoperable e-health. Scope for DI applications includes in secure patient identity management; secure and standardized health information exchange, data privacy and consent management; better clinical trial recruitment and data integrity and transparency; simpler medical credentialing and licensing; and more efficient health insurance processes, including claims processing. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9907408/">US</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/nhs-digital-staff-passport">UK</a>, and other jurisdictions are well ahead this work.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 3. Farming and mining:  



<p>Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. These two industries generate significant greenhouse gas, and must therefore regularly submit greenhouse gas emission reports to government agencies. Cost of compliance to regulation can be significant, especially when dealing with multiple government agencies. DI-based <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are a very promising solution for compliance regulation, and are already used in a number of regulatory environments including <a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance New Zealand</a> and the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">Energy Mines and Digital Trust project</a> in British Columbia.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 4. Government and public administration:  



<p>Governments are one of the pioneers of secure and portable digital identities for identity verification and KYC processes for functions such as issuing official documents, accessing public services, or conducting financial transactions. DI is also applicable for border control and travel processes using digital passports and travel credentials; managing public health initiatives and crises including vaccinations; more efficient financial inclusion and aid distribution; and secure and interoperable data sharing. This <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">article</a> lists many examples of government digital ID at various stages of implementation, including the United Nations (UN) and World Bank&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">ID4D</a>&nbsp;initiative which aims to provide everyone on the planet with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/inspired/legal-identity">legal identity</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 5. Education:  



<p>Another of the most common early use cases for DI is education. DI offers a secure and tamper-proof way to issue and manage digital credentials and certificates and to authenticate identities for online learning in the education sector. Institutions can issue diplomas, degrees, or certificates as <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, which students and alumni can easily share with employers, other educational institutions, or credential verification services. DI also simplifies the hiring process, promotes trust, boosts cross-institutional research, reduces administrative burdens, simplifies consent management, and limits fraud risk. Read this <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2022/4/self-sovereign-identity-user-scenarios-in-the-educational-domain">deep dive</a> on developments and benefits to date.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 6. Travel and hospitality:  



<p>This is a booming use case thanks partly to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re already seeing applications of DI to streamline traveller verification processes, such as airport security checks and immigration procedures as well as hotel check-ins, to bolster security, free up resources and ease congestion. Travelers store data and biometrics as a digital travel credential on a device or in the cloud. The idea is to create a single sign-on experience for travellers for a seamless journey across all different aspects of travel. There are already around <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">1.2 billion ePassports</a> in use worldwide and smart borders are progressing rapidly. And check out the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">Aruba Happy One Pass (Aruba HOP) app</a> which allows an air traveler to create a digital travel credential (DTC) from their passport, and is a collab between Indicio, SITA and Aruba.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 7. Identity and access management (IAM):  



<p>This is a foundational area for DI and you can read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">Innovating Identity and Access Management with Decentralized Identity</a>. DI transforms IAM systems by providing people with their digital IDs and credentials, to improve authentication processes, and simplify user access across different platforms and services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 8. Supply chain and logistics:  



<p>DI can deliver reliable product authentication, verification, transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain; streamline the process of verifying supplier identities and credentials; enable secure data sharing and collaboration; limit counterfeiting; streamline customs and border control processes to reduce paperwork and fraud and speed up customs clearance procedures; aid compliance; and support financing, insurance, and recall processes.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 9. Non-profit and humanitarian organizations:  



<p>DI can help securely identify beneficiaries, streamline aid distribution processes, and enhance transparency and accountability in humanitarian initiatives. The <a href="https://www.evernym.com/identityforgood/">Identity for Good</a> initiative is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 10. IoT and connected devices:  



<p>In a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HL_LFEdge_WhitePaper_021121_3.pdf">whitepaper</a> from Hyperledger Indy, as leader in the DI space, it says that “… by 2025, connected devices will generate more than 73.1 zettabytes of data every year—where each zettabyte is a billion terabytes. How can telecom service providers secure all these devices, manage the integrity of each device, and provide the transparency that consumers and enterprises want about how their data is used?” It proposes using DI to create a trusted platform for a telecom ecosystem that can support IoT devices throughout their entire lifecycle and guarantee a flawless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 11. Notary and legal services:  



<p>DI allows a more secure and efficient method for verifying identities, reducing the risk of identity fraud; streamlines document verification and timestamping based on digital fingerprinting or document hashes; enables use of digital signatures; and facilitates secure data sharing and cross-border services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 12. Social media and online platforms:  



<p>The greatest use case for DI here is significantly better user control and privacy over personal information. With <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, users can authenticate their identity and gain trust in the network, which leads to greater authenticity of user profiles, less misinformation, and better user interactions.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 13. E-commerce and retail:  



<p>This sector can drastically improve customer trust and experience, by allowing seamless account creation across e-commerce platforms. It can also secure payments, reduce fraud, increase transparency of supply chains, and build secure peer-to-peer marketplaces.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 14. Insurance:  



<p>DI can streamline KYC processes; improve accuracy of risk assessment and underwriting; increase the efficiency and transparency of claims processing; give customers greater control over their personal data and consent management; enable use of parametric insurance and smart contracts; and facilitate risk pooling and reinsurance processes.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 15. Energy and utilities:  



<p>DI can enable secure and verifiable identities for energy consumers, facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading, and enhance energy grid management.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 16. Real estate:  



<p>In real estate and property, DI can improve property ownership verification and title management; expedite the tenancy agreement process; and enable smart contracts and escrow services to automate the execution of agreements, improve compliance with predefined conditions before funds or property are released, and limit reliance on intermediaries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 17. Gaming and virtual worlds:  



<p>Blockchain is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-gaming-how-revolutionizing-industry#:~:text=With%20blockchain%2C%20players'%20identities%20are,fair%20system%20for%20all%20players.">revolutionizing gaming</a>, with more secure transactions, identity verification, and in-game economies some of the benefits.</p>
  



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The bottom line for any industry is that DI gives greater privacy, security, transparency, efficiency, and user experience. The game changer is that customers control their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>, which drastically improves their privacy and security, reduces fraud and other risks, and builds brand loyalty and trust.</p>



<p>DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive the interoperability of DI solutions across the internet, and Anonyome Labs is proud to contribute to the standards.</p>

<p>In a world where “Sign in with Google” rules, it feels almost unbelievable that we used to have to remember usernames and passwords for every account or application we touched online. That reality was even more cumbersome for HR and IT administrators, who had to keep a whole company’s worth of usernames, license numbers, passwords, and the like up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of SSO changed all of that. But times have changed again, and beneath the promise of seamless identity and access management lies a complicated reality many startups and small businesses aren’t ready for. In this blog post, I’ll talk you through how SSO has changed over the years to now encompass much more than many businesses need and why it’s time for an alternative.&nbsp;</p>
 SSO historically: a lifesaver 
<p>The value of SSO is undeniable and it was met with open arms: Employers could reduce help desk requests about forgotten passwords, saving everyone time. SSO created a strong access point that reduced vulnerabilities by consolidating login credentials and improving overall security. Password fatigue became a thing of the past, ostensibly boosting productivity.</p>
<p>Various SSO providers, like Okta, used a bookmark-like system to locally save passwords for easier logins. This approach, while user-friendly, had terrible inherent security risks. Over time, as technology evolved, application vendors started configuring SSO instances using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization information between different systems. You can think of SAML as basically an additional layer of authentication on top of SSO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Google Workspace and OAuth came along and changed all of that. OAuth, short for Open Authorization, is a standard for access delegation adopted by companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook — anywhere you can “Sign in with ___.” For example, when you use “Sign in with Google,” you are giving Google permission to handle credentials for you without you needing to enter additional credentials or passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 SSO today: more than you need 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This has made the need for SAML-based SSO nearly obsolete — especially for startups and SMBs, 70% of which operate on Google Workspace to begin with.</p>
<p>So IAM providers have bucketed functionality like provisioning/deprovisioning and lifecycle workflow into the SSO definition. There’s SAML support, but then you also need Life Cycle Management, API Access Management, Workflows, etc. And the more features, the higher the price tag.</p>
<p>The problem is that these protocols are often intertwined, forcing you to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users That’s fine for enterprise-level operations where there are resources to implement and manage all of this (and maybe other reasons for using those standards) but when it comes to startups and SMBs, it’s simply overkill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the issues is that IAM providers currently focus on providing a blanket of capability across everything you could do, instead of focusing on everything you need to do now. And, of course, you have to build it all yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for a new approach to SSO: There has to be an option that sits between either tracking permissions and credentials in a spreadsheet or going all in with an expensive enterprise-level solution.&nbsp;</p>
 SSO tomorrow: a task-centric approach 
<p>YeshID is a new identity and access management tool built specifically for startups and SMBs working in Google Workspace. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, we focus on the real tasks that startups and SMBs face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure.</p>
<p>We believe in starting with the task in mind and tailoring solutions to meet those specific needs while using foundational best practices that pave the way for scalable and secure operations management as you grow.</p>
 
 A single dashboard allows you to monitor access requests and IT licenses, and the management of onboard and offboard tasks across all your apps. 
 Access levels you can configure by department or function make onboarding and offboarding a breeze. 
 Passkeys, based on FIDO standards, offer a secure and streamlined sign-in alternative to passwords. They’re phishing-resistant, simplify account registration, and are compatible across multiple devices, including those in close proximity. 
 Transparent pricing means no hidden costs or surprise upsells.&nbsp; 
 
<p>We provide smart defaults that ensure you don’t have to start from scratch or spend valuable resources on re-engineering the digital identity processes. This not only saves time but also ensures companies adopt best practices early, without having to be experts in digital identity.</p>
 SSO and you: join us 
<p>The SSO landscape isn’t keeping up with the needs of startups and SMBs today. It’s time to move away from complex and costly solutions and embrace simplicity and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this vision of streamlined, low-overhead identity and access management, we invite you to join our Beta. You get early access to YeshID and your experience will help us shape the future of SSO for small businesses. <a href="https://yeshid.com/beta/">Get more info</a>, and join us today.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Businesses today are at a crossroads of limitless prospects and invisible obstacles like fraud and money laundering as they navigate the exciting but treacherous seas of digital innovation and global development. Step into the protective embrace of Know Your Business (KYB), a pivotal rudder for the ship of contemporary business. We invite you to join us in this illuminating investigation of know-your-customer (KYC) checks as we reveal their critical function, regulatory insight, and the promising future of this important field.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
<blockquote><p>Risk Management: Implementing rigorous KYB checks can help businesses identify potential risks and avoid financial crimes, legal issues, and damaged reputations. It’s an essential step, not an option.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Tailoring to Regulatory Landscape: KYB requirements vary across regions and industries. Therefore, businesses must tailor their KYB strategies to unique legal and compliance needs, especially when planning global expansion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Leverage Technology for Efficiency: AI, blockchain, and big data analytics can automate and streamline KYB checks, making them more efficient, accurate, and comprehensive. Businesses should explore these technologies to stay ahead in the competitive market.
</p></blockquote>
 What is Know Your Business? 
<p>Know Your Business (KYB) is a compliance and risk management process that businesses undertake to verify the identity of beneficial owners and assess the risk profile of their business partners. This process includes checks on business registration, licenses, physical address, source of funds, and other vital components. KYB helps businesses mitigate financial and legal risks, comply with international regulations, and foster stronger business relationships.</p>
 Benefits and Outcomes of Rigorous KYB Checks 
<p>Implementing robust KYB checks can lead to numerous benefits:</p>
 
 Risk Mitigation: KYB checks help identify and avoid potential risks related to fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They safeguard the company’s reputation and profits from potential financial losses and legal consequences. 
 Regulatory Compliance and Penalty Avoidance: KYB checks ensure businesses comply with relevant legal requirements, thereby avoiding non-compliance penalties. 
 Strengthened Business Relationships: Thorough KYB checks build transparency in our business relationship relationships, which fosters trust and supports these relationships. 
 Protection of Business Reputation: By avoiding associations with fraudulent or corrupt businesses and financial institutions, companies can protect their reputation, an invaluable asset in today’s competitive business landscape. 
 
 Understanding the Regulatory Landscape for KYB Checks  
<p>Compliance with KYB checks by shell companies and financial institutions isn’t just a strategic business decision but is necessitated by numerous regulations worldwide. Several anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures, such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the European Union’s 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, clearly mandate rigorous KYB checks. Businesses that fail to comply with these legal requirements may face significant consequences, including monetary fines, revocation of business licenses, and even imprisonment of involved officials.</p>
<p>However, the regulatory landscape for KYB needs to be more monolithic. It varies across regions, unregulated industries, and jurisdictions, each with specific rules and nuances. This variability necessitates businesses to understand and effectively tailor their KYB strategies to each region’s unique legal and compliance requirements. This becomes increasingly crucial for multinational corporations and those seeking global expansion.</p>
 The History of Know Your Business Regulation 
<p>The concept of KYB originated from the broader regulatory landscape of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations, which began to gain prominence in the late 20th century.</p>
<p>This came as a response to growing concerns about the misuse of the global financial system for illicit activities. Over time, these regulations evolved, and the need for businesses to ‘know’ their customers and other companies became clear. This resulted in the Know Your Customer (KYC) and, subsequently, the KYB regulations aimed to verify the identity of individuals and businesses involved in financial transactions.</p>
 Detailed Breakdown of KYB Check Components 
<p>A thorough KYB check comprises a detailed investigation into several key components, which form the bedrock of comprehensive customer due diligence:</p>
 
 Business registration or license verification is a fundamental step in a KYB check. It involves validating the legality and legitimacy of business activities of a business entity by examining its business registration status or other licensing documentation. This step helps confirm that you are dealing with a legitimate, legally recognized business and not a fraudulent entity. 
 Physical address verification: Verifying a business’ beneficial owner’s declared physical address adds security. It ensures that the business exists beyond mere paperwork and isn’t a shell company. Thus the bank secrecy acts minimize the risk of fraudulent partnerships. 
 Phone number verification involves validating the official phone numbers registered under a business’ beneficial owner’s name. While it may appear as a straightforward check, it is crucial to affirm the business’ beneficial ownership and the legitimacy of the owner and business relationship. 
 Source of funds investigation: To ensure that the ultimate beneficial owners of a business aren’t involved in any illegal financial activities such as money laundering or financing terrorism, it’s vital to investigate its sources of funds. It provides insights into a company’s financial integrity, beneficial owner’s reputation, business partner, or financial institution. 
 Business risk analysis based on location: Geographical location can significantly impact a business’s risk profile and due diligence further. A company operating in a region known for high corruption levels or financial crime rates may pose a higher risk, and additional due diligence requirements may be required. 
 
 Know Your Business Checks During Onboarding 
<p>During the onboarding business, KYB checks serve as a critical first line of defense against fraudulent associations. After initial business registration and verification, detailed KYB checks are performed. These checks include verifying the onboarding business customers’ physical addresses, official phone numbers, and sources of funds.</p>
<p>The collected information is then cross-referenced for validation. Based on this verified data, a risk assessment is conducted to gauge the potential risk associated with the prospective business partner. The entire business onboarding process becomes a crucial phase where rigorous KYB checks are pivotal.</p>
 The KYB Process: A Technical Walkthrough 
<p>Successfully conducting KYB checks involves following a strategic, step-by-step process:</p>
 
 Initial research and data gathering: This first stage involves the meticulous collection of detailed information about the business. This includes legal name, physical address, contact information, and information about corrupt business owners and key management personnel. 
 Verification of provided business information: The second stage involves validating the collected information. This is typically achieved by cross-referencing the data with reliable sources, such as government databases, financial institutions, or trusted third-party data providers. 
 Risk assessment: Once the data has been verified, models are applied. These models consider various factors, including the business or customer’s identity, location, industry, financial health, and management. The resulting risk profile can guide subsequent decision-making regarding potential partnerships or collaborations. 
 
<p>Ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment: KYB isn’t a one-off process. Businesses must establish procedures for regularly and continuously monitoring and reassessing business compliance with their partners. This ongoing scrutiny ensures timely identification and management of changes in a business relationship’s status or risk profile.</p>
 Automating Your KYB Checks 
<p>Technological advancements have introduced novel approaches to KYB checks, enhancing their efficacy and scope:</p>
 
 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: These technologies can automate data collection, the verification process, and risk assessment, making KYB checks more efficient and accurate. They can also learn from patterns and improve their predictive accuracy over time. 
 Blockchain Technology: Blockchain provides a decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger, offering a trustworthy platform for data validation and electronic identity verification. It aids in enhancing the security and reliability of verification processes. 
 Big Data Analytics: Leveraging big data can help businesses perform more comprehensive KYB checks. It allows for analyzing massive data sets, helping to identify patterns and insights that more straightforward checks might overlook. 
 
 Best Practices and Industry Standards in KYB Checks 
<p>To derive maximum benefits from KYB checks, it’s essential to adhere to industry best practices:</p>
 
 Reliable and vetted resources for data verification: Businesses should ensure that the data they use for KYB checks maintain compliance and is sourced from reliable and vetted resources. 
 Automation and digital tools: Automation can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of KYB checks for business entities. Businesses should leverage digital tools for data collection, verification, and risk assessment. 
 Regular updates and reassessments: Since businesses continually evolve, KYB checks should not be a one-time activity. Regular updates and reassessments are necessary to maintain an accurate understanding of the legal status of business partners. 
 Consulting with legal or regulatory experts: Considering the complexity of foreign transactions, other regulations, and the regulatory landscape, it can be helpful to consult with legal or regulatory experts when designing and implementing KYB checks for cash transactions. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Wrapping up, KYB checks are vital, providing defense against financial misconduct and fostering transparent business relationships. As the world embraces digital transformation and global expansion, KYB checks are becoming central to operations. The horizon for KYB checks looks promising, with technologies like AI, blockchain, and big data analytics paving the way for efficient, insightful screenings.</p>

   Learn about three AM initiatives topping IT project lists 
	<p>Access management is the front door to your organization, network, and applications and services. "Must have" initiatives that rely on access management (AM) are now on nearly every organization's IT priority list. But to get the most from these initiatives, it is essential to have the right AM solution and components in place. (Read how <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-overall-leader-access-management">KuppingerCole</a> rated ForgeRock Access Management in its 2023 Leadership Compass report.)</p>
	
	<p>In this post, we'll cover the three areas where access management is set to transform and grow in influence for users both inside and outside your organization.</p>
	
	
	 1. Passwordless Authentication is Making the Password History 
	
	<p>For years — for generations! — the user-selected password has held sway over the login experience. Alternative solutions have come along, like multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens and biometrics, but they often proved clunky, expensive, and less-than user-friendly. Market acceptance of these purpose-built devices never reached more than 30% of internal users, and consumers were often left with only weak two-factor authentication using passcodes sent via SMS (text messages).</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> — the act of logging in without a password — is based on industry standards, including FIDO2, WebAuthn, and SAML, so you're not staking your career on an unproven protocol. From a high-level perspective, passwordless moves us away from a world where it's necessary to store and protect a huge centralized password database, a magnet for malicious actors. In the passwordless world, an individual generates asymmetric cryptography key pairs and stores the private keys on a mobile device or browser. The attack surface is reduced and user satisfaction skyrockets as people can use familiar devices and the convenience of biometrics to log in to their applications.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Here's where it is essential to get access management right. There are two audiences for passwordless authentication: your consumers and your internal users. For consumers, replicating the experience they have with their mobile devices or browsers is a no-brainer — you can just use FIDO2. Where things get challenging is doing the same thing for your internal users on desktops, workstations, VPNs, mainframes, VDIs…and so on. Your access management solution needs to be able to handle all of it. Approaching your passwordless project with consumer and workforce users in mind will help ensure that you've got it right.</p>
	
	
	 2. Orchestration, Maestro! 
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration">Identity orchestration</a> is the creation of dynamic login journeys for users — those that minimize friction while maintaining high security. In other words, journeys get people where they need to go, quickly and securely. In the past, all users had essentially the same login experience. These login pathways were hard-coded by developers over weeks and months and were rarely changed.</p>
	
	<p>But times have changed and now a single login pathway no longer works for everyone. Users need different enrollment options, anti-fraud checks, identity-proofing for new users, MFA enrollment, and more. Scenarios vary by whether it is an end-user customer logging in or an internal employee. Some large enterprises have hundreds of journeys designed to support their various applications and use cases they run.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>A strong AM solution includes a graphical orchestration engine that has a drag-and-drop interface so the components listed above — the identity-proofing, anti-fraud, MFA, etc. — can be dropped in, moved around, and adjusted as needed.</p>
	
	<p>One user journey can be copied, tweaked, and set up as another journey to support a different set of users. Risk assessment can be made dynamically and in real time as signals from a user's device or location are shared with the orchestration engine, enabling access decisions that allow/block the request or require supplemental authentication. When the threat environment changes, even non-technical, non-IT people, like application owners, can be authorized to make changes to their user journeys, taking the burden off IT.</p>
	
	 3. Decentralized Identity and the Digital Wallet 
	
	<p>While they are two technically separate concepts, decentralized identity and the digital wallet (DI/DW) are inextricably joined in both usage and technology (the mobile phone), where they reside.</p>
	
	<p>The concept of decentralized identity is this: since the beginning of time, if you wanted to gain access to a website or application, you had to provide information about who you are, usually in a cumbersome form-fill, to the identity provider (IdP). The IdP represents the organization (bank, corporation, healthcare entity, government entity) that owns the digital asset you want to access. This identity information usually includes your email, mobile phone number, name, address, password, but can also include myriad other items such as preferences and personalizations. The IdP acts as the central repository for this information, abiding by applicable regional privacy laws — some do this better than others.</p>
	
	<p>With decentralized identity, individual users take back control and can decide how much or how little identity-related information to share from the safety of their mobile phone's secure vault. The digital wallet concept follows the same contours with the user being able to authorize payment directly from their mobile device.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Organizations are looking for ways to accommodate digital users with DI/DW to help them facilitate lightning-fast transactions and reduce abandoned shopping carts that result from burdensome account signups. At first glance, it would appear that DI/DW solutions would have less need for access management than traditional "centralized" identity approaches, but that's not so.</p>
	
	<p>The traditional functions of access (who gets in) and authorization (what they get to do) are every bit in play with DI/DW, and may be more important than ever. They help ensure that enough identity information is received to be able to enact a transaction, that enough know-you-customer (KYC) data is shared, that the user is still logging in with appropriate passwordless MFA, and that authentication is still logged for audit purposes. AM even plays a role in ensuring that user access and authorizations are revoked in a timely manner.</p>

<p>It's been just over either months since OpenAI released ChatGPT, and already the new platform has become a household name. With artificial intelligence (AI) being one of the hottest topics in the world today, everyone from techies to the layperson is taking notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/">Forbes</a>, “Over 75% of consumers are concerned about misinformation from AI.” While this new technology doubtlessly has exciting potential, it also poses new cybersecurity risks. For reasons such as this, the US Senate is getting started on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/tech/senate-ai-plan/index.html">new legislation</a> that specifically regulates the use of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adapting to the challenges posed by AI in identity and access management is crucial. As security professionals, we know that we can’t protect against everything. Long ago, Ping Identity learned that as soon as we detect what bad actors are doing, they find a novel way to circumvent detection methods. Today, we are just beginning to see how advanced machine learning is being used to penetrate established authentication methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there will be challenges ahead, it’s evident that Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR) and Decentralized Identity (DCI) can be used in conjunction with one another to combat security threats in the age of AI.</p>

 What is Fund Ring? <p>Fund Ring is a Web3 funding primitive that seeks to help Filecoin and IPFS-connected open source projects get long-term support for maintenance, security, and feature updates with monthly or annual funding. </p><blockquote>When you join Fund Ring as a supporter or a maintainer, you join a broad community of FLOSS projects. It’s like a good ol’ fashioned web ring for funding projects you rely on.</blockquote><p>Supporters can contribute to Fund Ring projects by selecting <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">"Fund the Ring" in the app</a> and connecting any EVM-compatible wallet that allows users to add the custom FEVM network, such as MetaMask. Whenever a supporter decides to "Fund the Ring," the contributed FIL (less the gas fees) is deposited into the verified project wallet. </p><p>Open source maintainers join the ring by visiting the Fund Ring app, verifying the ownership of their Git repo with a funding proof, and deploying their own contract. We created a Fund Ring widget that the user can embed on their app's page to solicit contributions for their specific project. Only the contract owner, who has also verified that they have commit access to the Git repo, can withdraw the funds.</p><p>As a maintainer, let the ecosystem know what you need on a monthly or annual basis so you can dedicate the time to keep code maintained and secure. Run one-off campaigns to support new features.</p><p>Watch Fund Ring creator and Fission engineer Andy take us through the Fund Ring demo:</p> Why Build Fund Ring? <p>While we love <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Open Collective</a> and are an active fiscal sponsor and contributor on their platform, we wanted to create a solution designed with Web3 audiences in mind. One where a contributor can switch between FIL, ETH, Matic, and more to fund their favorite projects and get their own projects funded as well.</p><p>We wanted to create a self-sustaining and distributed option that empowers developers to get recurring funding on a monthly or annual basis that helps with long-term maintenance.</p><p>As well, much like Open Collective enables projects to send funds to other projects, we see a ring of projects promoting and funding each other. </p> Test the Ring <p><a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">Fund Ring</a> is available on Filecoin Calibration Testnet. As we gather more feedback and onboard various projects, we will transition to Filecoin Mainnet.</p>  As a project owner, register your project, sign and commit your funding proof to Git, and ask supporters to fund with sweet sweet testnet tFIL.  As an ecosystem supporter, get some <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens/">testnet tokens from the faucet</a>, and fund some projects. You can try this by <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/fund/">funding the Fund Ring itself</a>.   Future Plans <p>Some of the upcoming features and ideas include:</p>  Support for native FIL accounts: Use <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap</a>, Brave, or other native Filecoin wallets to fund (🗓 planned)  Filecoin vesting support: Use the built-in vesting features to send FIL over a month or year (💡 idea)  Filecoin multisig: Use the built-in Filecoin multisig (💡 idea)  Split support for dependencies: Show other projects in your funding widget, and allocate sending a percentage of funds to a ring of projects (💡 idea)  <p>There are many other ideas to layer on top of these basic contracts and on-chain events. For example, you could aggregate projects and allocate funds across them, present a UI for stack ranking or voting, or as an individual, create a project where you curate projects in a ring and help gather funds that go to all of them directly! </p><p>Explore the <a href="https://github.com/FundRing/fundring">GitHub repo</a> to get involved with Fund Ring, or drop by the <a href="https://filecoin.io/slack">#shared-fission channel in the Filecoin Slack</a>. We'd love to hear your questions or comments! </p>

<p>As digital transformation continues to change the way we do business and interact with various entities and organizations, cyberattacks continue to intensify and compromise user accounts and identities. Identities are the largest attack vector with weak/compromised credentials and phishing attacks being two of the most successful type of attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations are taking notice, and many have implemented various security controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on, and training employees to identify a phishing attack. Additionally, many run ad-hoc simulated phishing attacks to evaluate employees and retrain them to identify phishing attacks on an ongoing basis. While these trainings have been found to be effective in educating employees on what a phishing attack is, how phishing emails look, and what to look for when trying to evaluate the authenticity of an email, quite often employees are engrossed in their daily tasks and activities and will at some point get tripped up and click on a phishing link, whether simulated or real.</p>
<p>At the same time, threat actors are getting better at disguising phishing attacks, with entire criminal organizations dedicated to building services like phishing-as-a-service for other cyber criminals to use in their targeted phishing campaigns. In addition, AI technologies are also being adopted by bad actors to aid in the development of cyberattack campaigns, with services like <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/wormgpt-new-ai-tool-allows.html">WormGPT</a> (a generative AI tool for bad actors similar to ChatGPT) that allow adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise attacks with relative ease. These malicious AI tools use the latest marketing and branding from your websites and learn from previously successful phishing campaigns to create highly accurate phishing campaigns that can evade even the most trained eye from identifying the phishing email.</p>
<p>How can organizations protect against phishing attacks?</p>
<p>Organizations need to stop relying on employees to identify phishing emails and move to implement security solutions and controls that can prevent phishing attacks from compromising an individual’s identity. They can start by moving to a completely passwordless solution, eliminating one of the largest attack vectors – namely weak or compromised credentials. In addition, not all MFA is the same and offers varying levels of protection against MFA bypass attacks. Moving to phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA along with single sign-on (SSO) capabilities will help prevent phishing campaigns from successfully compromising a user’s account.</p>
<p>What is phishing-resistant passwordless MFA is and how does it prevent phishing and other MFA bypass attacks?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Phishing-resistant MFA</a> involves high assurance authentication with the use of cryptographic keys and digital certificates, as well as requiring the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/should-physical-proximity-be-a-required-mfa-factor/">physical proximity</a> of the user to the device from which they are requesting access to a resource. There are a few passwordless MFA options that offer phishing-resistance, namely FIDO2 keys, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/02/goodbye-passwords-hello-passkeys/">passkeys</a>, and certificate-based authentication with Bluetooth proximity detection.</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is considered the highest assurance of these options. It involves the use of verified digital certificates assigned to a user and devices from which a user authenticates themselves, along with a Bluetooth proximity requirement. This ensures the user is in close physical proximity to the device from which they are accessing a resource and that the device itself is also a trusted device with a known valid digital certificate assigned to it by a certificate authority.</p>
<p>How to protect against common <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-good-enough/">MFA bypass attacks</a> with CBA</p>
<p>SIM Swap Attack – This type of attack involves taking over a user’s mobile number by having it transferred to a SIM card owned by the attacker. However, with CBA, the certificates tied to the user and device reside on the original device owned by the user and protected with biometrics, ensuring that attackers will not be successful in compromising the user’s identity.</p>
<p>MFA Prompt Bombing – In this scenario, an attacker will trigger MFA push authentication notification on a victim’s mobile device in the hopes of a user accepting one of the many prompts and granting access. With CBA, an attacker will not have access to the digital certificate on the user’s mobile device and in addition will not satisfy the physical proximity factor requirement as they initiate such attacks remotely.</p>
<p>Adversary in The Middle (AiTM) – In this type of attack, cyber criminals set up a reverse web proxy with a phishing site in between the victim and the legitimate application, or webpage. With CBA, attackers cannot successfully compromise a user’s identity as they will not have access to the certificate assigned to the user, as well as the certificate issued to the user’s device to make it a trusted device, thereby protecting against an AiTM attack.</p>
<p>Holistic and layered defense with Zero Trust</p>
<p>Given identity is one of the largest attack vectors, protecting against most common identity-led attacks with phishing-resistant authentication is a critical part of a Zero Trust framework, which provides organizations with a comprehensive set of controls to implement a strong proactive defense to protect against and reduce the impact of a breach when one occurs.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s recent introduction of a new system for LinkedIn members marks a significant step towards strengthening workplace verification. By leveraging Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn now offers a credential issuance system that provides members and organizations with greater confidence in the authenticity of their work connections and profile information. This expansion of Microsoft’s digital identity technology to LinkedIn introduces a new feature that empowers businesses to enable their employees to validate their employment details publicly. The implications of this feature extend beyond individual profiles, as it fosters trusted interactions and informed hiring decisions. Verifiable work histories on LinkedIn make it easier for employers to verify candidates’ qualifications and experience, leading to more efficient hiring processes. According to LinkedIn, this feature is currently operational with over 4,000 companies on their platform, and they have further plans to expand its availability to additional companies in the future. Through the utilization of verifiable credentials, LinkedIn members can establish their credibility and authenticate their work affiliations, thereby providing additional assurance to their professional connections.</p><blockquote>In this blog, we will explore the concept of verifiable credentials, their numerous benefits and the transformative impact they can have on the overall LinkedIn ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Image Credits:&nbsp;LinkedIn</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: A Game-Changer for Digital Identity:</p><p>Verifiable credentials represent a groundbreaking development in the realm of digital identification. These tamper-evident digital records contain key information about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, and contact details. Unlike traditional digital records, verifiable credentials offer a unique advantage: they can be trusted by third parties without relying on a central authority for verification. This groundbreaking feature ensures greater privacy and security for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Here is a typical process for creating and verifying a verifiable credential:</p><p>Issuer: The issuance of verifiable credentials is a straightforward process. Any entity, such as a government agency or financial institution, can create a digital record containing relevant information about an individual. The issuer then signs and encrypts this record using their private key, creating a tamper-evident credential that can be verified by&nbsp;others.</p><p>Holder: The holder of the credential, whether an individual or an organization, has full control over its management. This includes deciding who can access it and when it can be shared or&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Verifier: The verifier, on the other hand, can check the digital signature on the credential using the issuer’s publicly available public key. If the digital signature is valid, the verifier can trust the information contained in the credential without relying on a centralized authority, thereby ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering or falsification.</p><p>Revolutionizing Efficiency with Verifiable Credentials:</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> represent a remarkable innovation in the realm of digital identification. By granting individuals more control over their personal data while enhancing security and privacy, verifiable credentials have the potential to revolutionize how we manage digital identity. Verifiable credentials not only enhance security and privacy but also redefine operational efficiency. This transformative technology has the potential to reshape resource-intensive processes, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. The implementation of verifiable credentials empowers businesses to accomplish tasks that would typically take several days in a matter of mere minutes. This streamlined process stands to yield substantial time and monetary savings for these organizations.</p><p>Platforms like LinkedIn benefit greatly from the implementation of Verifiable Credentials. In traditional hiring processes, recruiters invest considerable time in verifying candidates’ claims. Verifiable Credentials streamline this process by granting instant access to verified data, reducing administrative burdens, and expediting decision-making.</p><p>For businesses, the onboarding of new hires becomes simplified through Verifiable Credentials. Swift authentication of qualifications, training achievements, and credentials ensures the presence of necessary skills and endorsements.</p><p>Elevating Security and&nbsp;Trust</p><p>Built on a foundation of robust security and privacy principles, Verifiable Credentials uphold data integrity and prevent tampering and unauthorized access. This cryptographic security layer ensures data reliability, minimizing identity fraud risks and misinformation.</p><p>The decentralization of Verifiable Credentials eliminates the need for a single central authority. This empowers individuals to selectively share their credentials, addressing privacy concerns and fostering unwavering trust in digital interactions.</p><p>Conclusion: LinkedIn’s Stride Towards Trust and Transparency</p><p>The introduction of verifiable credentials on LinkedIn marks a significant stride towards enhancing trust and identity verification in the professional realm. By utilizing Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn members now have the opportunity to validate their employment details, ensuring greater transparency and credibility. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> revolutionize the way we manage digital identity, providing individuals with control over their personal data while maintaining security and privacy. This innovative technology has the potential to transform digital wallets and reshape the entire landscape of verifiable data. As we embrace the digital era, <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> stands ready to support organizations and individuals in leveraging the power of verifiable credentials. Embrace the future of trusted and secure interactions with verifiable credentials.</p><p>For further updates and inquiries, reach out to <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/contact-us">AyanWorks</a> and stay tuned for the latest advancements in this exciting field.

   New capabilities fix security issues with MFA push notifications 

<p>Zero Trust security models call for the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users may access protected IT resources. Many organizations are adopting MFA to add a layer of security for remote workers. Customer-facing organizations are also implementing MFA to mitigate identity-based attacks, such as phishing, and to help quash the rise in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> fraud.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks">Microsoft</a> has stated that using MFA may stop 99% of password-related attacks within an enterprise, so an increasing number of enterprises have begun to require MFA before granting account access. That's the good news. The bad news is that attackers are now trying to undermine the effectiveness of MFA with some success.</p>

 MFA is under attack 

<p>While MFA is a vast improvement over a simple username and password combination, there are ways that MFA can be compromised, including:</p>

<p>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Fraudsters position themselves between organizations (such as financial institutions) and users to intercept, edit, send, and receive communications without being noticed.</p>

<p>SIM-card swapping attacks: A cybercriminal uses social engineering tactics to transfer a user's mobile phone number to a new SIM card owned by the criminal. If such an attack is successful, the victim's apps, including banking apps, can be activated on the impersonator's phone.</p>

<p>Pass-the-cookie attacks: A session or authentication cookie can be stolen and injected into a new web session to trick the browser into thinking the authenticated user is present and does not need to prove their identity.</p>

<p>MFA fatigue attacks (aka MFA spamming or MFA prompt bombing): The MFA fatigue attack relies on people to be distracted, careless, or frustrated by frequent requests to authenticate. As a new form of social engineering, MFA fatigue raises considerable security concerns.</p>

 What is MFA fatigue? 

<p>Sometimes, as a means to an end, people will engage in behavior that they know is borderline unsafe. Who amongst us hasn't disabled a smoke alarm to make the low-battery alert stop its intermittent screeching? MFA fatigue attacks rely on similar human impulses, which ultimately make users vulnerable to schemes such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>.</p>

<p>With MFA prompt bombing, attackers attempt to get access to an account or device by flooding a user's authentication app with push notifications. Some attackers send a few push notifications a day thinking they will fly under the radar, while others bombard the user with continuous messages, but the intended outcome in either approach is the same: to get users to authorize access in order to make the notifications stop, thereby granting access to the attacker.</p>

 Preventing MFA attacks 

<p>Push authentication is one of the most secure, simple, and convenient user authentication methods and a popular MFA choice. To avoid attacks on push notifications, ForgeRock has developed two features: MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching.</p>

 Push notification with additional context 

<p>The push notification with context feature lets you keep your users safe from MFA attacks by sending them additional context. When users are presented with a push notification request, they are provided contextual information about the request, such as where the request came from, information about the device, the user agent, or other signals.</p>

<p>When the push notification is received, the user can review the contextual authentication information, decide whether it is legitimate, and accept it or reject it.</p>

    
MFA push notification with additional context Push notification with number matching 

<p>With number matching in a push request, the user is presented with a number on the login screen and must select that same number in the authenticator app.</p>

<p>For more secure logins in the near term, we advise enabling push notifications with number matching. This method prevents an attacker from gaining access to an account if the user accidentally hits "Approve" on an MFA notice.</p>

<p>This technique also minimizes friction for users. When compared to other MFA techniques, such as entering a six-digit number from a software token or SMS message, matching a two-digit code doesn't significantly add to the login process.</p>

    
MFA push notification with number matching Why enterprises should use these MFA approaches 

<p>If you've implemented MFA using an authenticator app for your workforce users or your customers, you want to be sure it isn't vulnerable to MFA fatigue. With the ForgeRock Authenticator's additional context or number matching, you will no longer have to worry about users who unintentionally approve MFA requests.</p>

<p>For over 45 million Americans, the weight of unyielding student loan debt is a major cause of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-cope-with-stress-of-student-loans/">stress and anxiety</a>, a barrier to homeownership and can be a lifelong impediment to building wealth. Nationwide, the total student debt level stands at a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/student-debt-is-a-main-obstacle-for-millennials-wanting-to-buy-a-house.html">$1.7 trillion</a>. Managing that debt has proven to be complicated and inefficient for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>



<p>Bottom line: Access to consumer-permissioned student loan data presents a unique opportunity. Innovators can step in and create apps and build better services that leverage student loan data through Finicity’s open banking platform, to help consumers with student loan debt.</p>



 Introducing Normalized Student Loan Data 



<p>For fintech innovators, lenders, refinancers, employers and institutions of higher education, working with student loan data has been challenging. Until now, the data hasn’t been normalized. Higher learning institutions have used different naming conventions for data fields, making documentation harder to read, compare or translate. Lenders and servicers have to navigate a forest of screenshots, phone calls with lengthy hold times and unsecure paper documents in their efforts to verify loan information.</p>



<p>These time-consuming manual processes incur labor costs to lenders and servicers. This can cause stress, revenue loss, time loss and negatively impact the lender’s operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finicity has normalized the data across data fields, vocabulary, naming conventions and applications of rules, resulting in a modernized ecosystem for all stakeholders through its open banking platform. This significantly reduces the time to market for your student loan solutions.</p>



 Innovation Platform Using Student Loan Data 



<p>Student loan data doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated. With Mastercard Open Banking (some services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company), an optimized API call can help reduce costs, and is delivered in a formation that doesn’t require additional coding. Our API endpoints can yield the complete loan details, and the full payment details of a student loan account, including up to 24 months of transaction history.</p>







 99% Data Coverage&nbsp; 



 
 Normalized, comprehensive data covering most student loan accounts. It’s delivered through our open banking platform, with connections to student loan accounts that include federal Direct Loans, FFEL &amp; Perkins, and some of the largest private lenders and servicers (e.g. Aidvantage, Navient, Nelnet, Sallie Mae, Discover, Firstmark, Commonbond, LendKey, etc). 
 



 Quality of Data 



 
 Extensive Loan Account Details:&nbsp;&nbsp;API calls to the Finicity open banking platform can yield a primary account, transactions by account, loan payment details, statements, account owner and much more.&nbsp;Data is aggregated at the three largest levels of the student loan hierarchy; student loan, student loan group and student loan account, while also being able to provide customer &amp; institution-level details. 



 Transaction lookback period&nbsp;has been extended to one year in order to accurately capture transaction additions or changes. Up to twenty-four months of transactions can be offered for an extended view of account history. 



 Complementary data insight solutions&nbsp;with analytics of a borrower’s credits, debits and balances to deliver smarter credit decisioning. 



 Reliable Uptime Data Monitoring: Multi-tier data integrity and student loan-specific data monitoring. 
 



 Create Winning Borrower Experiences 



<p>Innovators can quickly develop and scale new and improved financial services with Finicity’s open banking platform. Student loans are the second-largest debt sector in the United States. There is a massive opportunity to develop new apps and services to help individuals with student loan debt. Through partnering with our clients, Finicity’s open banking platform is powering solutions to help over 45 million Americans who carry student loan balances.&nbsp;</p>



 Some of the ways innovators can upgrade the borrower experience, using permissioned student loan data: 



 
 Create&nbsp;frictionless onboarding&nbsp;and account setup for borrowers to apply for loans, set up accounts, manage repayment and distribute funding to students. 



 Better data for better credit decisioning. It’s pretty simple. Student loan borrowers want a better experience. Lenders want the most accurate and real-time data for better credit decisioning. So we’ve combined the best data with smart insights to transform the lending experience. 



 Finicity data powers leading&nbsp;personal finance management&nbsp;(PFM) apps. These tools allow borrowers to view, monitor and manage their debt in near real time by pulling smart, categorized and permissioned loan data into the app. If borrowers can easily understand their financial position and repayment options, they may reduce stress and more effectively manage their debt.&nbsp; 



 Attracting and retaining the best talent in today’s job market is a challenge for any company. Leveraging permissioned student loan data, some employers are taking advantage of the SECURE 2.0 Act, creating benefits like&nbsp;401k accounts that match student loan payments&nbsp;and direct matching of student loan payments back to the student loan. 



 By using the account details endpoint, it’s possible to verify that a student is enrolled in at least half-time coursework by the National Student Loan Data System. Using this data, a rich field of possibility opens up for student-specific benefits.&nbsp;Discounts, rewards and loyalty programs&nbsp;can be built specifically for current students. 



 Even the more administrative aspects of student loans can be modernized by open banking technology. Student borrowers can be offered the ability to easily and securely&nbsp;apply for federal programs&nbsp;like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or an Income-Driven Repayment plan. No&nbsp;wading through W2s, paystubs and long, frustrating calls to student loan servicers.&nbsp;Quick and secure. 
 



 Step Into the Future 



<p>Break out of the spider web of paper documents, screenshots, phone calls and mismatched data. Replace countless lost hours of productivity with optimized API calls that offer the comprehensive, relevant, normalized data to build solutions on.</p>



<p>Innovate with us to create knowledge-based services that empower students, so they can manage, consolidate, refinance and repay their obligations with the level of transparency that they deserve.&nbsp;</p>

  Crypto regulations vary globally: Japan embraces it, China resists, the EU introduces MiCA for uniformity, and the US grapples with overlapping jurisdictions.  Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Bermuda are pioneering progressive crypto approaches, blending innovation with robust oversight.  Despite the global patchwork of regulations, a cohesive international framework remains elusive, though it’s a prominent G20 discussion topic.  <p>Crypto is changing how the world thinks about money. But when we look at the rules for crypto, every country is different.</p><p>While Japan likes crypto and has initiated several initiatives to position itself as a crypto-friendly destination, China has not been so accommodating. And just south of China, India has decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, although the country’s Central Bank is strongly against giving any legal recognition to virtual currencies.</p><p>Europe, on the other hand, has already started implementing provisions from its comprehensive regulatory framework called Markets in Crypto Assets, known as MiCA. In comparison, the world’s largest economy, the United States, is yet to reach a clear consensus over who will control what, as there are frequent overlaps and clashes of jurisdictional capacity between agencies like the CFTC and&nbsp;SEC.</p><p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)</p><p>Here, we delve deeper to understand where the world currently stands regarding regulating crypto. This is crucial because the industry can only thrive if regulatory differences are at their minimum. And only then could we see the seamless exchange of resources and capital — mandatory for a global crypto economy to stand on its own&nbsp;feet.</p> Europe  The EU <p>When it comes to crypto rules in the EU, MICA or Markets in Crypto Assets often take center stage. The public first got a glimpse of this proposal on 24th September 2020. Fast forward to 16th May 2023, and the EU has officially given the go-ahead to these&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The core objective of MiCA is to safeguard investor interests and enhance transparency by setting out a comprehensive framework for issuers and service providers. Specifically, utility token issuers, stablecoins (also termed asset-referenced tokens), trading platforms, and wallet service providers will all fall under MiCA’s oversight.</p><p>Recognizing this, the EU views the adoption of MiCA not merely as an isolated regulation but as a strategic move. It’s their way of progressing toward a cohesive global crypto regulatory standard, a significant improvement over the varied national laws previously in place across member&nbsp;states.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">For more details on the MiCA: MiCA Paving the Way — From Liability to Transparency</a></p> Switzerland <p>The Alpine nation treats cryptocurrencies as assets, fostering tax clarity and pioneering early adoption.</p><p>Zurich introduced Bitcoin ATMs in 2014, and by 2016, Zug was accepting Bitcoin for services. Their forward-thinking approach is further evidenced by Lugano’s ambitious plan to use cryptocurrencies as legal tender and Zug’s facilitation of tax payments in crypto. Switzerland’s stance exemplifies the diverse approaches to crypto regulation in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Asia <p>Unlike Europe’s MiCA, Asia does not have a single continent-wise regulatory structure. However, there are several crypto-friendly countries in Asia, such as Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, with their own set of rules and regulations.</p> Hong Kong <p>The vertical city-state took a more conservative approach, aligning with China’s 2021 ban on crypto services earlier. But that changed recently, as Hong Kong decided to open its doors to crypto exchanges, paving the way for organized crypto retail trading, albeit with a few conditions.</p> Japan <p>The country, often called the “Land of the Rising Sun,” has crafted a detailed crypto framework, with its Financial Services Agency (FSA) collaborating with the JVCEA and JSTOA, ensuring robust oversight for crypto exchanges and token offerings. With the Payment Services Act and stringent anti-money laundering measures in place, Japan’s intent is clear: to foster a transparent and safeguarded crypto environment.</p> South Korea <p>On the Korean peninsula, South Korea’s crypto regulations are defined by the Electronic Financial Transactions Act and the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Information. These laws categorize cryptocurrencies as “electronic assets” and set the rules for their utilization. As South Korea seeks to refine its stance on digital currencies, the National Assembly is actively deliberating on a range of crypto-related regulatory proposals.</p> Singapore <p>Shifting our lens southeast, Singapore stands as a beacon of balanced crypto regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) championed the Payment Services Act (PSA) in January 2020, which enveloped both traditional and crypto exchanges under a unified framework.</p><p>Within the PSA, digital currencies earn the designation of “digital payment tokens,” elevating approved cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether to legal asset status. Coupled with rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures and the imposition of licensing requirements for crypto activities, the city-state’s approach underscores a commitment to both innovation and security in the digital asset&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Overall, Asia’s approach to crypto regulation demonstrates a trend toward a more structured and promising future.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>Navigating to the Middle East, the UAE offers a mosaic of crypto regulations that reflects its unique federal structure. With seven distinct emirates, each potentially wielding its own rules, the central narrative began in 2017 when the UAE emphasized authorized exchanges and anti-money laundering protocols.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, and Dubai, a pivotal emirate, spotlighted its commitment by introducing the Virtual Assets Law. This legislation not only defines the scope of virtual assets but also ensures traders operate transparently, aiming to prevent financial malpractices.</p><p>To anchor this initiative, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) was established, marking Dubai’s ambition to be a global hub for digital assets. Through these measures, the UAE seamlessly interweaves tradition with innovation, creating a balanced crypto landscape.</p> North America  The United&nbsp;States <p>As the most representative economy of the region, the United States boasts a multifaceted and evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) holds jurisdiction over crypto exchanges trading Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for overseeing Initial Coin Offerings or&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p>Supplementing these agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has a primary role in monitoring digital assets, especially concerning Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>Given the multifarious classifications of digital assets, determining the correct regulatory agency can be intricate, sometimes involving multiple bodies. Each state, further adding to the complexity, possesses the autonomy to design its individual regulations on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In line with this dynamic regulatory backdrop, it’s notable that the US Congress is actively considering legislation to further define and shape the crypto landscape.</p> Crypto-focused Bills in the&nbsp;US <p>Two crypto-focused bills have recently been reintroduced. The first, known as the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill, is spearheaded by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. This revised legislation aims to demystify decentralized finance regulations, bolster the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) authority over crypto entities, and specify the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>Within its provisions, the bill underscores definitions for “crypto asset” and “crypto asset exchange,” ensuring these terms are categorized under commodities law, thereby strengthening the CFTC’s jurisdiction. A significant highlight of the bill is the introduction of a de minimus tax exemption, which seeks to alleviate the tax burdens from minute transactions, challenging the current tax mandate that treats all crypto transactions equally, irrespective of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>The second bill reintroduced in the US Congress comes from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall, titled the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023. Should it pass, all crypto stakeholders would be mandated to report transactions that eclipse the USD 10,000 threshold. Initially put forth in December 2022, the bill’s objective is to have US cryptocurrency operations adhere to the same know-your-customer standards as traditional banks, a move aimed at curtailing money laundering.</p><p>With these factors in play, entities in the US must be vigilant and continuously update their operational strategies to stay compliant. It’s also crucial for crypto exchanges to align with AML/CFT regulations, and users should be cognizant of potential tax implications. As federal directives lay out the broader guidelines, understanding the nuances of state-specific regulations becomes paramount.</p> Canada <p>Shifting attention northwards to Canada, the country’s approach to cryptocurrencies differs significantly. Digital assets, primarily treated as securities, are regulated provincially and territorially under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This classification is due to the unique “Crypto Contract” concept, wherein a user’s contractual right to a crypto asset can be placed under securities regulations, even if it isn’t a traditional security.</p><p>Hence, platforms such as cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets need to be registered with the corresponding securities regulator. These businesses must continuously disclose vital information, from third-party dependencies and associated risks to measures against theft or&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Every cryptocurrency offering undergoes an “Investment Contract Test” to determine its classification as a security. Non-compliance can result in punitive actions, from financial penalties to bans on operations.</p><p>However, some gray areas persist in Canada’s crypto regulations. Notably, assets like stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) don’t have a clear regulatory framework, leading authorities to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. Despite these nuances, Canada’s mature approach has garnered praise from crypto entities worldwide, marking it as a notably crypto-friendly nation.</p> Bermuda <p>Bermuda is a leader in the cryptocurrency landscape and is a likely beneficiary of the much-reported US crackdown against crypto firms, with firms like Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/20/crypto-exchange-coinbase-receives-license-to-operate-in-bermuda/">obtaining a license</a> to operate in the country recently.</p><p>With laws like the Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) and the Digital Asset Issuance Act (DAIA), they’ve built a comprehensive regulatory framework treating all forms of digital assets uniformly. But their commitment doesn’t stop there. They’ve also paved the way for banks serving the digital asset sector and have launched innovative projects, like a blockchain-based stimulus&nbsp;token.</p><p>Guided by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the island balances innovation with globally recognized regulatory standards, creating an environment ripe for growth and security.</p> A Regulatory Comparison <p>As far as the comparison of the US with other parts of the globe is concerned, the lack of regulatory clarity in the US is leading crypto traders to take their bets on Asia. This is despite China and India — two of the most populous nations globally — maintaining a cautious stance on&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>In Europe’s case, it is evidently far ahead of the US when it comes to providing regulatory clarity to the crypto landscape. However, as per Albert Isola, the minister for Digital and Financial Services at HM Government of Gibraltar, the effects of MiCA “will not come into play overnight. To create effective frameworks, transitional testing will be required.” What MiCA, introduced to the EU, aims to achieve is enhanced transparency and better protection for retail investors in the short term and significantly improved security and stability in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>According to Isola, many global crypto players are also expressing interest in the EU because it has made sure that regulatory frameworks do not overregulate the space and thwart innovation.</p> What to&nbsp;Expect <p>Crypto regulations will definitely go through a lot of ups and downs, proposals and rejections, and trials and errors in the days to come. Countries that are not particularly encouraging the private crypto industry to thrive might change their opinion after introducing Central Bank Digital Currencies or&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>However, the emergence of a global regulatory framework from all these churnings still seems a distant possibility, for now, despite crypto regulations becoming a key point of discussion in the G20 under India’s presidency.</p><p>___________________________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>Indicio recently had a breakthrough in work to scale the mediator we have been using for issuing and verifying credentials. This new mediator greatly reduces a huge problem decentralized identity faces — accommodating all the people that want to use the technology.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Alexandra N. Walker</p>
<p>A mediator is a critical part of any decentralized interaction between the holders of decentralized identifiers. This technology is the “middle man” that facilitates messages between decentralized entities using mobile devices (which don’t have fixed IP addresses for easy connection). You can almost think of a mediator as a mailbox; it provides an endpoint for parties that cannot otherwise connect with each other to send and receive messages. Importantly, these “messages” can include issuing and verifying credentials.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the amount of messages your mediator can process in a given period of time has a significant impact on performance, limiting how many people can use your services concurrently which, in turn, will limit adoption. People today expect technology to “just work;” if they perceive the interaction to be slow, the likelihood of them trying again is very low. To put this into perspective, <a href="https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/#:~:text=following%20key%20findings%3A-,47%20percent%20of%20consumers%20expect%20a%20web%20page%20to%20load,render%20before%20abandoning%20the%20site.">47 percent of consumers</a> expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40 percent will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site.</p>
<p>This obviously puts some pressure on your development team to make sure everything works quickly, and the mediator represents a key part of the process where people can get stuck. The option to pay for more, or bigger, mediations is always a viable solution, but it can be costly. This is the context for Indicio’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>The first thing we had to know were baseline numbers: using mediation, how many credentials could ACA-Py sustainably issue to new users in a minute? What about existing users? How about verification?</p>
<p>(Non-Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>issue 258 credentials per minute to new connections<br>issue 540 credentials per minute to existing connections<br>verify 282 credentials per minute to existing connection</p>
<p>These numbers represent our baseline numbers in a non-clustered environment; however, taking this architecture into a clustered environment—where we have the same architecture as before, but now everything (user agents and ACA-Py agents) is abstracted away behind load balancers and managed instance groups—we get much better numbers.</p>
<p>(Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>The traditional mediator from before can sustainably</p>
<p>issue 300 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>issue 900 credentials per minute to existing connections, mediator, and<br>verify 600 credentials per minute to existing connections,</p>
<p>using the same mediator (with 2 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM) as before but now with 10 ACA-Py agents (1 vCPU and 4GB of RAM, each).</p>
<p>Using some new techniques and new technologies, such as the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a>, our team was able to greatly improve these numbers.</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator:</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator can</p>
<p>sustainably issue 1,200 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>sustainably issue 1,680 credentials per minute to existing connections, sustainably verify 3,000 credentials per minute to existing connections.</p>
<p>Our team is hugely excited about this progress, given that high-volume verification will drive many seamless processes. For example, with Indicio’s Mediator, airport security will be able to verify 3,000 passengers per minute per mediator, shortening lines while saving airports expense.</p>
<p>While the Indicio Mediator is not quite ready for public use yet, our team wanted to share the news that ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent-Python) is able to scale to meet the growing interest in the technology. Once the Indicio team has fine tuned the codebase, we expect to open source and contribute it to the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Foundation</a> so organizations can build their own solutions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the new mediator or building your own verifiable credential solutions our team is always happy to help. You can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us here.</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In recent years, the question of a state's territorial sovereignty in cyberspace has been a major topic of discussion. The emergence of cyberspace has introduced new spatial dimensions and challenged our understanding of international law. When it comes to cyberspace, the solid and defined notion of territory does not necessarily apply there. Sovereignty has been unbundled in cyberspace, both in practice and in legality.</p>
<p>At its core, the notion of sovereignty in cyberspace encompasses a state's authority and control over the digital activities that take place within its borders. While all states would claim some degree of sovereignty over the internet, countries such as Russia and China have embraced a broader interpretation of cyber sovereignty. Both states define cyber sovereignty in ways that are consistent with their respective political and security objectives.</p>
<p>Technology, geopolitics, and cyber sovereignty </p>
<p>According to the Chinese cyber sovereignty principle, cyber sovereignty is the idea that each country has the right to exercise control over the Internet within its territory and the right to choose its own digital development path. The Chinese Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2016 has further promoted this idea and defined the security obligations that Internet providers and services must follow. As a result, the concept of cyber sovereignty has become China's guiding principle in its domestic digital policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia's interpretation of cyber sovereignty, mirroring that of China, is characterized by the regulation of information and information flows and the ability to regulate, surveil, and influence digital activities occurring within its borders. For example, in 2018, Russia proposed a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly, which some argue legitimizes state surveillance and censorship through its emphasis on sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries.</p>
<p>Although liberal democracies have also intervened in the digital realm to counter the threats of disinformation, terrorism, and cybercriminal activity, their approach tends to balance the protection of citizens' rights and privacy with the need to maintain a secure online environment. Consequently, their interventions in the digital sphere often come with checks and balances and public discourse to ensure that security measures do not impede upon the democratic values they seek to protect.</p>
<p>Semiconductors and national security </p>
<p>In addition to the principle of cyber sovereignty, the concept of supply chain sovereignty has recently gained traction in economic and political circles. Since the spring of 2018, the trade conflict between the United States and China has been in full swing. Dependence on imports and foreign producers is now considered a national security risk in many states. Global supply chains can be more efficient in delivering goods and services at lower costs while fostering international competition at the same time. However, states are wary of gaining economic advantage at the expense of national security.</p>
<p>Some countries have identified and subsidized key technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors; while the former is important in the long term, the latter has more immediate implications in the global supply chain. The semiconductor industry is a vital part of today's information age and a key component of today's global economy. As a result, new restrictions limiting China's access to chipmaking software and equipment continue to be imposed by the United States as part of its national security agenda.</p>
<p>There is more to this story than trade tensions between China and the United States. Many countries are claiming sovereignty over the shared digital technology space. For example, the European Union has been trying to reduce its dependence on the United States for years. Through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has achieved some measure of internet sovereignty via regulation. Nevertheless, the EU is likely to continue to seek greater convergence with the United States and to build digital alliances with like-minded countries.</p>
<p>Addressing challenges through cooperation </p>
<p>While technology continues to develop integrating forces, geopolitics is moving toward greater fragmentation, posing a serious dilemma for business leaders and policymakers. Despite different interpretations of cyber sovereignty or supply chain sovereignty, countries will need to cooperate at the international level and work together to address global challenges.</p>
<p>Data breaches, espionage, sabotage, misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and cyberattacks are just a few examples of the global challenges we face. Governance of cyberspace requires both shared values and trust to work, but this will ultimately depend more on consistent and enforceable legal understandings than on technology. It is therefore clear that cyberspace will continue to play a critical role in international law and geopolitics in the years to come.</p>

 Interested in entering one of the largest and most lucrative gambling markets in the world? You’ll first need a UK gambling license. Here’s everything you need to know about the application process, compliance requirements, UK gambling regulations, and much more. 



 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> (UKGC) operates as the UK’s gambling regulator, and is an independent regulatory body established under the UK Gambling Act of 2005. To operate legally in the UK, all gambling platforms are required to hold a license issued by the UKGC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC is also responsible for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">implementing changes t</a>o national gambling regulations, such as the recent proposals contained in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s gambling white paper</a>. Proposals target various aspects of the gambling industry, such as VIP customers, slot limits, and financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks).</p>



 Understanding UK gambling regulations. 



<p>The UKGC takes failure to comply with licensing requirements and social responsibility codes very seriously. Operators, therefore, must have robust systems and controls in place to prevent money laundering as well as a whole host of other nefarious crimes. They must also safeguard customers, take measures to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, ensure fair play, and encourage responsible gambling to guarantee <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">gambling compliance.</a></p>



<p>There are essentially three main types of operating licenses:&nbsp;</p>



  Remote: This license allows licensees to provide casino games and gambling products to customers through an online site, TV, mobile phone, or any other type of online service.<br>  Non-remote: A non-remote gambling license allows the licensee to facilitate betting activities at betting shops, tracks, and/or courses.<br>  Ancillary: Ancillary licenses are for operators offering email and telephone betting.&nbsp;  



<p>Operators may need one or a combination of these licenses.</p>



<p>Licensing is mandatory, even if an operator’s online gambling platform is located in another region of the world. Essentially, if the services are being offered in the UK, operators must hold a license. (If you are interested in learning about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">the need for an online gaming license</a> in general, click on the underlined copy).</p>



 Eligibility criteria for a UK gambling license. 



<p>The Commission <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/operating-licences">evaluates</a> applicants based on the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>



  The identity of the applicant and people associated with them. For example, if the applicant’s gambling platform is part of a bigger corporation, then the owner of that corporation also needs to be evaluated.<br>  The applicant’s honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness<br>  Financial statements that display the business is financially capable of operating successfully after obtaining a license<br>  The applicant’s expertise, experience, qualifications, history, and those of the people relevant to the application<br>  The applicant’s criminal record and those relevant to the application.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission also looks at the applicants’ policies to ensure that:&nbsp;</p>



  They incorporate and understand the legislation<br>  They follow the established licensing objectives<br>  They hold evidence that their arrangements will adhere to social responsibility requirements  



 Application process for a UK gambling license. 



<p>Applicants apply for an operating license from the UKGC via the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/service/apply-for-an-operating-licence">“Apply for an operating license” service</a>. It takes around 16 weeks for the Commission to process a license application, considering all the required information is submitted at the point of application. Applying for a UKGC license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-much-it-costs#:~:text=It%20costs%20%C2%A3370%20to,withdraw%20from%20the%20application%20process.">costs</a> £370, which must be paid via credit or debit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators are required to provide an extensive array of documents, some of which depend on the type of business applying for the license. For instance, a sole trader may only be required to submit identity documents, whereas a limited company would be required to submit the following:</p>



  Ownership structure diagram<br>  Articles of association<br>  Management structures<br>  Certificate of incorporation<br>  Memorandum of association&nbsp;  



<p>Overseas entities must submit a credit report and, if they have licenses elsewhere, copies of licenses issued by the other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a remote license, an operator must provide the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Documents regarding remote policies and procedures<br>  Operational model map<br>  Gambling software supply method and details<br>  System diagram displaying the end-to-end process&nbsp;  



<p>Some requirements are considered core documentation and are mandatory in all cases. Such requirements include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  General policies and procedures–these must adhere to the standards outlined in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">LCCP (Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice)</a><br>  Rules of play<br>  Customer terms and conditions<br>  Bank statements for the past six months for all accounts<br>  Business plan<br>  Proof of funding<br>  Profit and loss projections for the next three years&nbsp;  



<p>Those responsible for managing the business must also submit a PML (Personal Management Licence) or an Annex A personal declaration form based on the circumstances.</p>



 Key considerations for license applicants. 



<p>Those applying for a license from the UKGC must have a comprehensive business plan for their application to be approved. A sound business plan shows that the operator understands their objectives and the steps required to achieve them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also focus on responsible gambling and protection practices. This includes offering tools like deposit limits, self-exclusion, and helpful resources for customers who may struggle with or be on the verge of developing a gambling addiction. Moreover, the operator’s platform must also be secure, employing technologies such as SSL encryption to secure their customers’ personal and financial information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing robust anti-money laundering and fraud protection strategies, such as KYC and AML solutions, is also essential. Operators can help identify and mitigate gambling fraud and crime by conducting due diligence and transaction monitoring. Keeping updated with industry regulations and best practices is also among the key considerations for license applicants.</p>

 Compliance and reporting obligations. 



<p>All UKGC license holders must adhere to regulatory obligations that must be observed at all times. Such obligations include upholding integrity in all aspects of their operations, maintaining accurate records, reporting crucial information promptly, and ensuring they offer fair, safe, and transparent services to customers while taking active measures to prevent problem gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to comply with such obligations can lead to dire consequences, including heavy fines, license revocation, and strict legal action.</p>



 Licensing fees and taxation. 



<p>For licensing purposes, operators are divided into a total of nine categories according to their GGY (Gross Gambling Yield). For example, a gambling operator with a GGY under £550k will be required to pay an application fee of £4,224 and an annual fee of £4,199. On the other hand, operators with a GGY worth £1 billion must pay an application fee of £91,686 and a yearly fee worth £793,729.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/point-of-consumption-tax-rate-of-15-proposed-for-remote-gambling">Point of Consumption Tax</a> (POCT) introduced in 2014, the Commission requires all licensees to adhere to tax requirements to operate legally. This includes taxes on all profits from gambling activities, regardless of where the operator is based, and abiding by regulations regarding the collection and reporting of taxes. The POCT has profoundly impacted the UK’s gambling industry, urging operators to adapt and comply with the evolving tax requirements to remain compliant.</p>



 License renewal and revocation. 



<p>The procedure for license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-to-licensing-authorities/part-24-renewal">renewal</a> is like applying for an initial application. You need to submit a renewal application within six months before the license expires but no later than two months prior to its expiration. The Commission may refuse to renew a permit on the following grounds:</p>



  If the renewal is inconsistent with the licensing requirements. In this instance, the authority may consult the chief officer of the police. The authority will, therefore, be wary of any concerns regarding the use of the premises during the life of the license.<br>  If an authorized local government officer has been denied access to the premises without a reasonable excuse.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission may also <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/revocation-of-operating-licence-bet-butler-limited">revoke</a> a license holder’s permit under the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>



  The license holder is unable to carry out licensed activities consistent with the licensing requirements.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s financial standing.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s competence.<br>  The Commission believes that one or more license terms have been breached&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission usually informs the license holder if it reaches a decision about their permit. The licensee is allowed to appeal against a decision if:&nbsp;</p>



  They receive a fine or warning.<br>  Their license application has been turned down.<br>  Their license has been revoked or suspended.<br>  There are changes in their license terms  



 What is the UK’s new Customer Interaction Guidance for Remote Gambling Licensees? 



<p>In August, following a year-long consultation period, the UKGC issued a revised version of its Customer Interaction Guidance for Remote Gambling Licensees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remote gambling operators in the UK have until October 31 to implement measures contained in the guidance. The chief aim of the new guidance is to minimize the risk of customers experiencing harms associated with gambling through the implementation of “effective customer interaction systems and processes”. It suggests doing so through the use of a three-step system:&nbsp;</p>



  Identify&nbsp;<br>Through an ongoing process of monitoring, licensees should utilize indicators of harm to flag signs that a customer may be at risk.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Act&nbsp;<br>Review indicators to tailor the action to the type of harm. This may require automated action, or manual intervention. Activities and interactions should be recorded. Ongoing monitoring may be required, alongside further, more intensive intervention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Evaluate&nbsp;<br>Consider actions taken, and whether further intervention is required. These evaluation processes and systems should be baked in from the beginning, and “not an afterthought.”&nbsp;  



<p>The new guidance is incredibly important for any operator that wishes to hold a gambling license in the UK. From October 31, all licensees are required to build processes that can identify risk, take appropriate action, and evaluate the effectiveness of said action. This three-step approach is now considered essential throughout the customer’s relationship with the operator.</p>



 Marketing and advertising guidelines. 



<p>Licensed operators must be wary of the advertising standards and restrictions established by the Commission. Such standards exist to protect minors and the vulnerable from being unfairly targeted by gambling ads and ensure that all advertising is fair and transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding responsible marketing practices, operators must be mindful of the guidelines and undertake advertising in a socially responsible manner, including the stipulations on the use of certain messaging and imagery. This is to say that all licensees’ marketing communications must not <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/open-and-transparent-marketing">mislead</a> customers. Operators must adhere to the UK Advertising <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">codes</a> published by CAP (the Committees of Advertising Practice) and governed by the ASA (Advertising Standards Authority).&nbsp;</p>



 International expansion and cross-border licensing. 



<p>Many operators explore other markets to increase their customer base and diversify their revenue streams. However, various legal stipulations are linked with cross-border licensing, including ones based on licensing, taxation, and regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As previously noted, operators based abroad must provide a credit report. If they carry a license from other jurisdictions, they must provide a copy of the licenses issued by other jurisdictions.</p>
