<p>Nobody likes spending excessive amounts of money. Be it Elon Musk, or your neighbor down the street. Fortunately, banks have stimulated spending money with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-credit-cards-for-credit-scores-of-580-and-below/">credit cards</a> at grocery stores, movie theaters, sports events, etc. over the years, with one very swift move — cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Well, what’s the trick? Where does this money come from? In this article, we will review what cash back is, how it works, use cases, and 4 ways to earn cash&nbsp;back.</p> What is Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Cashback is a way of getting money back when you’re buying something, and it’s a feature that some credit cards have. Instead of paying the full price for things you buy with your credit card, you get a percentage of that cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Credit cards with cash back rewards offer a certain percentage of every qualifying purchase back. For example, if you buy a pair of shoes with your credit card that offers one percent cash back, you’ll receive one percent of the amount you spent on the boots back into your&nbsp;account.</p><p>While not every credit card and bank works with the same percentage, typically it’s between 1–2% on average, with some unique campaigns in which you can earn even a more considerable rate.</p><p>This is not an enormous amount of money, but the bigger your credit card bill, the more significant the saving you can potentially make. If you make $2 per 100 spent, imagine what will happen if you spend $10,000. That’s $200 out of&nbsp;nowhere.</p><p>However, you should pay attention to the condition set by credit card issuers, before you go on a shopping spree. Some of them have limits (for example, up to $5,000 or $6,000 are eligible for earning cash&nbsp;back).</p> How Does Cash Back&nbsp;Work? <p>As the name indicates, cash back is money you receive in some way — be it via cash back rewards, money back into your account, or any other&nbsp;means.</p><p>Cash back credit cards are just one of many rewards credit cards out there, but this type of card is so popular because it can pay out at a high rate. For example, you can earn 5% cash back on your first $1500 in purchases every month. These rewards can also help you avoid paying interest charges or come close to them since they pay out money you would have otherwise spent.</p><p>All you need to do is find out if the grocery stores, gas stations, or other businesses that you regularly shop from are eligible for cash back, as banks don’t redeem cash from every place out&nbsp;there.</p> What About Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Cards? <p>There should be something for the bank, as cash back doesn’t come for free. You know the old&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>Money doesn’t grow on&nbsp;trees.</blockquote><p>That’s also valid here. Each credit card company (like VISA, Mastercard, and Amex) makes its money by applying a transaction fee on card payments (it’s floating, but let’s assume it’s around&nbsp;3%).</p><p>Since these companies are interested in you paying with a card rather than cash, they incentivize banks as mediators to offer you something in return. But banks also have another benefit — to promote their credit&nbsp;cards.</p><p>As we stated in the last point, not every place you shop from is eligible for cash back rewards. There is a criterion that should be met. Let’s see some of the common rules that&nbsp;apply:</p>  Unapproved stores — if you’re shopping from your local cafeteria, you might not receive a cash back, as the store is not recognized as a trusted&nbsp;seller.  Money exchange — if you use your money to exchange for another fiat currency, you won’t receive a cash back, as you are not spending&nbsp;money.  Gambling — gambling or anything associated with betting is among the spending categories that won’t qualify as eligible.   4 Ways to earn cash&nbsp;back  1. Cash back credit&nbsp;cards <p>I have already mentioned credit cards as the main way to receive cash back, but I’ll repeat myself again. If you’re not using cash back cards, you’re literally wasting cash. It’s the most straightforward way to get a percentage of almost everything you purchase. You can usually get 2–3% if you have good credit&nbsp;scores.</p> 2. Rewards&nbsp;sites <p>Another trend is <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">rewards sites</a>. They make things easier. Instead of getting a new credit card issued in your name and thinking of potential issues with interest and overspending, you can use rewards sites such as Monetha, where you receive awards for every purchase you make. You can then spend the cash rewards on gift cards from major shops and services, donate to charity, and even convert to crypto (visit <a href="https://monetha.io/">Monetha</a>&nbsp;now).</p> 3. Coupon&nbsp;websites <p>You can find fantastic promotional codes and offers on sites like Groupon, Livingsocial, and Rakuten. Not only will you receive a great deal on your purchases, but you can also earn money back in the form of discounts or cash back&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4. Post-purchase cash&nbsp;back <p>Post-purchase services provide cash back on purchases. The most common scenario is to get a percentage back after shopping, but you can also receive an extended warranty or join the lottery for free tickets to Paris or a new car. Some of these services are run by the stores you buy&nbsp;from.</p> How to Use Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Once you have generated enough cashback balance, then it is probably time for the sweetest part — to spend it somewhere. But where can you spend&nbsp;it?</p> As a statement credit <p>If you have a mortgage or some credit card debt, you can cover some of it with the cash back. The way it works is simple: it funds your available balance.</p><p>For example, you owe your bank $200 each month for a small housing decoration loan. When you generate $50 in cash back, in your statement credit report you will find the number -$150 instead of -$200, as a small portion, is absorbed by the cash&nbsp;back.</p> As an available balance <p>That’s certainly better than having a debt. Instead of financing your debt, you earn money that goes straight to your bank account, thus increasing your available balance.</p><p>Let’s say you have $1,000 available in your bank and have $100 redeem rewards. Once you receive them, you’ll have $1,100 to&nbsp;spend.</p> As a Gift&nbsp;Card <p>One common way to use your cash back is via a free credit for online shopping on Amazon, eBay, or other places. The gift card is a fixed amount that you can use either once or multiple times until the credit runs&nbsp;out.</p><p>There is one condition, though. The only way to pay the difference is by&nbsp;card.</p> As a&nbsp;Donation <p>It’s always a good idea to donate money to charity, and cash back is a good option to spend some money on good deeds without breaking the bank. In fact, you will pay a grand total of $0 of your own funds, but you will help people in a&nbsp;need.</p> When is a Good Idea to Have a Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Card? <p>Before we talk about the best cash back credit cards on the market, you need to decide for yourself if you’re up for it. Let’s see the ideal situation in which it’s worth having a&nbsp;go:</p>  You have good credit health — if you have an acceptable credit history, you will be able to access more cash back opportunities and grab better deals. This means you’ll have lower interest rates and much better paybacks.  You are disciplined — credit cards are a big gamble in the wrong hands. Failing to meet the deadline means you will pay brutal APRs which will often overshadow any perks of having cash back&nbsp;options.  You have shopping patterns — in order to get the best value out of your cash back provider, you have to shop from the same places to keep collecting points.   What are the Best Cash Back Credit Cards Out&nbsp;There? <p>Which are the hot offers if you would like to open a cash back credit card? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Discover it® Cash&nbsp;Back <p>This is the best option for huge spenders. You can get up to a 5% reward rate which is quarterly rotating spending categories. It comes with an impressive 0% annual fee and no minimum cashback redemption. It requires you to have a Credit Score of at least 700, and has a standard APR starting from&nbsp;12.24%.</p> 2. Capital One® Walmart Rewards®&nbsp;Card <p>There is a sweet 5% cash back bonus for the first 12 months of using the credit card. On top of that, there is a great 2% cash back that you can use for hotel stays and restaurants, which make it a very good option for Walmart shopping and traveling. You can apply with a Credit Score of 650+ points, making more people eligible. However, the APR is extremely high, often reaching up to&nbsp;30%.</p> 3. Chase Freedom&nbsp;Flex <p>Chase Freedom Flex is one of the best options for travelers, as it can rival even travel cards. There’s a generous welcome bonus of $200 and you pay $0 in annual fees. However, the APR is about 16–20% on average, and you should have an outstanding Credit Score of 700+ points to apply for&nbsp;it.</p> 4. Ink Business Unlimited® Credit&nbsp;Card <p>This credit card is one of the most generous, as you earn a $750 bonus cash back as a welcome bonus + 0% APR for the first year. You also don’t have an annual fee but you do have about 17%-20% APR on it. However, one of the main perks is the unlimited 1.5% cash back rewards on all purchases. This is great for businesses, but the Credit Score requirements are also high — 700+&nbsp;points.</p> 5. Amazon Business Prime American Express&nbsp;Card <p>If you’re constantly using Amazon for your online shopping, this card is the right choice. You can receive up to $100 cash back, there’s no annual fee, and you can earn up to 5% back from Amazon’s orders. You can also swap the 5% for 90-day 0% APR financing, which is the main benefit of the card. Bear in mind you should be an Amazon Prime member with a good Credit Score (700+ points), and the penalty APR is&nbsp;huge.</p> 6. U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite™ Mastercard® <p>One of the most generous welcome offers is the one promoted by the U.S. Bank. Up to $500 cash back as a welcome bonus, paired with a 0% annual fee, is a fantastic boost. It also has a promotional 0% APR + 3% cash back on different bonus categories. However, there’s one catch — there is a huge standard APR (it can easily exceed 25%), and there’s a balance transfer fee that can eat up you&nbsp;savings.</p> 7. American Express® Business Gold&nbsp;Card <p>Unlike other cards on the list, the AMEX Business Gold card works with points that you can collect. It is a superb value for money if you’re traveling a lot with up to 20–25% cash back on travel flights. You receive up to 60–70 thousand points and 4 points per dollar for the first $150,000. However, there’s a $295 annual fee which is steep. On top of that, the APR rate is not low, starting from 15% and going well beyond the&nbsp;20s.</p> 8. The Hilton Honors American Express Business&nbsp;Card <p>If you travel to luxurious destinations or prefer quality for your business trip, this is the right credit card. You get an excellent value for the annual fee of $95, and on top of that, you’ll get more than 100,000 points. There are no foreign transaction fees, which is a great added bonus, and it’s a great option if you are a Hilton hotel fan. However, you should bear in mind this card has no real value if you’re not a Hilton user. On top of that, there is a high APR fee of up to&nbsp;25%.</p> What Stores Give You Most Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Of course, when we talk about generous offers from credit card issuers, we need to mention the stores that give the best credit card&nbsp;rewards.</p> 1. Kroger <p>Kroger is quite generous with its offer. You can get up to $120 cash back at the store with Discovery card, and you also have to up to $300 for debit cards. There are some things to consider, though: there is a $0.50 fee for cash back amounts of up to $100 and $1.50 for amounts between $100.01 and&nbsp;$300.</p> 2. Whole&nbsp;Foods <p>Whole Foods is pretty standard in its offering. They include all spending categories but can redeem $100 back which is not a bad&nbsp;amount.</p> 3. Walmart <p>Walmart limits you to $20 up to $100 cash back, and it depends on the bonus category you’ve chosen. However, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> 4. Target <p>Target lets you cash back up to $40 and just like Walmart, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> Final Thoughts <p>If you already have a credit card, you can benefit from a lot of bonus cash via cash back. It’s money that you can use for so many purposes — you can pay less, cover your debts, and even&nbsp;donate.</p><p>But in case you don’t have a credit card yet, you should consider the benefits against the disadvantages. If you’re not disciplined enough and cannot take control of your spending, you might end up in massive debt, as APR on credit cards is much higher than standard loans and mortgages.</p><p>And if you don’t have a credit card and have no intention to get one, we have to say that there are many options to get a lot of cash back. All you need to do is sign up with a rewards site like Monetha, and you can save as you&nbsp;spend!</p><p>If you like this article, check out our blog post about how to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/earn-money-from-your-data/">earn money from your&nbsp;data</a>!</p><p>*Disclaimer: All the information is based on Monetha’s research.

			<p>16th May, Luxembourg – <a href="https://www.dltjewel.com/">Jewel</a>, a Bermuda-based digital asset banking platform that has applied for a combined full-service bank and digital-asset license in Bermuda, seeks to offer a full range of digital asset services to institutional clients including payments, banking, custody and lending. In partnership with digital asset compliance infrastructure provider <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, Jewel will power real time settlement for digital asset institutions via its own bank issued USD stablecoin on the Polygon, the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable and sustainable Web3 infrastructure.</p>
<p>Longer term, Jewel aims to offer a stablecoin-as-a-service solution to other digital asset and financial institutions B2B, allowing those businesses to provide cheaper, easier and near real time payments with stablecoins issued and redeemable directly at the bank level at Jewel.</p>
<p>As digital transformation flourishes across all industries and aspects of finance, banking, and payments, businesses are demanding payment solutions that are fast, inexpensive and programmable. Conventional payment systems are often fragmented and inefficient, creating a challenge for customers who trade and transact globally 24/7/365.</p>
<p>Jewel was an early driver for the use and acceptance of distributed ledger technology and stablecoins within banks tied to bank deposits. Today, Jewel’s bank direct approach is becoming an intelligent and appropriate risk-based approach that US and other regulators are now touting for the structure of stablecoins and their issuance and administration, as reflected in the Biden Administration’s recent Report on Stablecoins from the US President’s Working Group (stating their opinion that stablecoin should be issued by banks and other regulated deposit-taking institutions). This was then further defined under the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. Jewel’s stablecoin, Jewel USD (JUSD) will eliminate the need for reconciliation and enable instant payments and transfers to members of its settlement network, “Jewel Settle”.</p>

		 
	 
    Our proposed banking license will allow us to service global firms from Bermuda as we issue fiat-backed stablecoins, first with USD and then a growing number of other proposed single fiat currency stablecoins globally. Through our partnership with Tokeny, we’re able to ensure compliant stablecoin issuance and management in a scalable and easy-to-integrate manner. As a result, we can devote most of our time and resources to further developing our business opportunities. We are already in discussions with exchanges, bank and non-bank financial institutions, and governments, and there is a considerable amount of interest in our offerings.  Chancellor BarnettJewel Founder and Chairman    
	 
		 
			<p>Jewel has chosen Tokeny, the leader in the tokenization field, as its technology partner to assist them with the issuance, transfer, and management of fiat-backed stablecoins on the Polygon Network. Through Tokeny’s API-based solutions, Jewel can issue ERC-3643 permissioned tokens, ensuring the necessary controls and compliance that are required by regulators.</p>

		 
	 
    We are pleased to provide our partner Jewel with a tailored technology solution, so they can focus on their core businesses without having to worry about technology. Together, we can transform the global payment system and accelerate the growth of the digital asset ecosystem.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny

<p>Brand loyalty measurement is more challenging to measure than you think. Consumers are smart and savvy. They change their habits when they are presented with other options that better meet their needs and&nbsp;desires.</p><p>There is an ultimate cost-benefit analysis happening in the mind of consumers on a constant basis. Each time you recommend, highlight, or show off your brand, however, you are adding value. That value must exceed your competitors for it to be effective and build brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p> What is Brand&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>What is brand loyalty? It’s the tendency for consumers to remain loyal to specific brands. A consumer who exhibits brand loyalty will remain loyal even when alternatives are less expensive or offer more features. When a consumer demonstrates brand loyalty, they develop personal feelings toward the brand and its products that influence their choice of brands in a category. Some reasons why consumers exhibit brand loyalty can&nbsp;include:</p>  An emotional attachment to the brand and its&nbsp;identity  A belief in the company’s mission statement and its products/services  A belief in the company’s quality and reliability  <p>Some businesses use loyalty programs to reward frequent customers for returning (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">loyalty programs best practices here</a>), while others attempt to build customer loyalty through marketing campaigns or social media interactions.</p> Why is Brand Loyalty Important? <p>Brand loyalty can be important for several reasons. For example, it helps to build a positive reputation for a company and its products. If a customer is satisfied with their experience with a brand, they are likely to tell other people about their positive experience. Word of mouth is an extremely powerful tool that can bring in new customers.</p><p>A loyal customer base can also be extremely helpful to any business, because they are more likely to remain loyal to the company’s products even if they encounter other products that may be comparable or better, as long as they have had a positive experience with the brand. This is especially helpful in the case of businesses that sell very specific products or services where it is unlikely that there will be many comparable products on the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Another major advantage of brand loyalty is that it can help companies save money by reducing marketing costs and increasing sales. Loyal customers are more likely to purchase items from the same brand over and over again, so businesses don’t have to keep investing in advertising campaigns to promote their products.</p> What is the Difference Between Brand Loyalty and Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>Brand loyalty and customer loyalty are two terms that are often used interchangeably; however, there is an important difference between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Customer loyalty refers to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/customer-commitment/">customers’ feelings of commitment</a> or dedication to a company, brand, or product. Brand loyalty refers to customers’ feelings of commitment or dedication to a particular product within a company’s line of products.</p><p>This can be confusing because many companies use the term “loyalty” when speaking about both brand loyalty and customer loyalty. To avoid confusion, it is important to recognize the difference between these&nbsp;terms.</p><p>The main differences between brand and customer loyalty&nbsp;are:</p>  Brand loyalty means that customers will buy anything that comes from a particular company/brand, while customer loyalty means that customers will only buy a specific&nbsp;product.  Brand loyalty usually refers to brands in the same industry, while customer loyalty usually refers to related products within the same industry.  Brand loyalty can be measured over time, while customer loyalty can be measured once the sale is&nbsp;made.  Brand loyalty is not as strong as customer loyalty because of potential changes in the company/brand’s image.  <p>Another significant difference between brand and customer loyalty is that brands tend to be valued by consumers for their symbolic meaning in a way that companies themselves can’t control, whereas customer-company relationships are mostly based on subjective evaluations of a company’s products and services.</p><p>For example, Coca-Cola has been <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/coca-cola-christmas-marketing/">associated with Christmas</a> for many years now, and people just associate it with this holiday — that’s what makes it a brand. However, Coca-Cola can’t control these associations in the same way it can determine how its products or services are perceived by customers.</p> How to Measure Brand Loyalty: The 6 Key&nbsp;Metrics <p>Brand loyalty is an important thing to measure because it will tell you how customers feel about your brand. If you have high brand loyalty, that means that you’re gaining customers who will purchase your products again in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>High brand loyalty can also mean that you have a high customer satisfaction level, which is always a good sign for any business.</p><p>To determine brand loyalty, you’ll want to measure the following metrics:</p>  Customer churn rate&nbsp;(CCR)  Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS)  Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV)  Customer Retention Rate&nbsp;(CRR)  Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR)  Purchase Frequency (PF)  <p>Once your target market feels connected with your company, they’ll be more likely to show brand loyalty towards&nbsp;it.</p> 1. Customer Churn Rate&nbsp;(CCR) <p>Customer churn rate (CCR) is a ratio of customer losses to total customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost during a period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. It is often expressed as a percentage value.</p><p>When calculating CCR, only leave-of-absence cancellations should be included in the numerator, and future expected cancellations should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator.</p><p>The resulting value represents an estimation of how many customers will cancel service during a given period, whether because they are not satisfied with the service or because they are leaving the region where the service is provided.</p><p>Counting and excluding cancellations correctly is important for assessing both how well your company retains its existing customers and how much future revenue will be generated by current services.</p> 2. Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS) <p>There are a number of metrics that can be used to measure brand loyalty. The most common is called the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures how willing customers are to recommend your business to other people. NPS is calculated by having your customers rank their likelihood of recommending your business on a scale from 1 to&nbsp;10.</p><p>Customers that answer with a 9 or 10 are considered “promoters” of your brand, and customers that answer with a 6 or lower are considered “detractors.” The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters and provides you with your NPS score. This score can go from -100 (all detractors) to 100 (all promoters). The higher your NPS score, the more loyal customers you&nbsp;have.</p><p>NPS consists of a survey that asks one question: “How likely is it that you would recommend this company/product/service to a friend or colleague?” The answers range from zero (not likely at all) to ten (extremely likely). Customers who answer with a nine or ten are called “Promoters.” Customers who answer with seven or eight are called “Passives.” And finally, customers who answer with six or below are called “Detractors.”</p><p>To calculate NPS, subtract the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. Passives count toward the total number of respondents, but they don’t count toward the score itself. So if 50% of your customers are Promoters, 40% are Passives, and 10% are Detractors, your NPS is&nbsp;40%.</p> 3. Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV) <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess brand loyalty. It predicts your customer’s worth to your company, so it’s a great way to show how much the customer values you and your brand. The higher the CLV, the more loyal the customer is likely to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Once you have an idea of the monetary value of your customers, you can use that data to determine the cost of customer retention.The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) gives you an idea of how much revenue a single customer can bring to your business over their lifetime as a customer. It is basically a measure of the value of each individual customer to your business.</p><p>When calculating CLV, you’ll need to estimate the average amount of time that a customer remains loyal to your company. This is fairly simple: just divide the total number of months you’ve been in business by the number of customers you have lost since&nbsp;then.</p> 4. Customer retention rate&nbsp;(CRR) <p>Customer retention rate (CRR) is a term used by businesses to describe the percentage of customers that return to purchase additional products or services. A company usually measures its CRR as a ratio, showing how many returning customers there are for every 100 new customers that are acquired. The higher this ratio, the more confident management is that the company will be able to make future sales and keep growth&nbsp;steady.</p><p>The purpose of calculating CRR is to figure out how effectively a business is retaining customers: if it can retain more customers than it loses, management knows that it is not going to lose money in the long run. It’s also a way of evaluating how well a business communicates with its existing clientele and what type of loyalty program would be best at encouraging them to stay. One thing important to note here: CRR only measures the number of current customers who purchase again from the business, not those who switch over to another brand or&nbsp;company.</p><p>In most cases, managers will calculate CRR by dividing the total number of returning customers by the total number of new customers acquired in one year. There are other ways to measure this ratio-like dividing the number of returning customers by the number of active accounts-and they will yield very different results.</p> 5. Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Repeat Purchase Rate, also known as Customer Loyalty Index (CLI), is a business metric that measures how much customers come back to buy from a brand again and again. Repeat Purchase Rate is a strong indicator of your customers’ loyalty to your brand. To calculate Repeat Purchase Rate, add up all the sales you had in one period and divide that number by the number of customers who purchased at least once during that&nbsp;period.</p><p>For example, an RPR that is calculated for a month can be thought of as the proportion of customers who made a purchase at some point in that month and then went on to make another purchase during that same&nbsp;month.</p><p>RPR can be divided by industry because customer behavior can vary dramatically between industries. For example, Amazon has an impressive RPR due to their expansive product offerings and low prices. A local hardware store may have a lower RPR because their product offerings are more&nbsp;limited.</p><p>In general, a high RPR indicates that your customers are happy with your products and services, and are therefore likely to make repeat purchases from you. A low RPR may indicate that your customers have had negative experiences with your brand, or that they were not able to find what they were looking for in earlier purchases. This could be due to many factors including poor product quality, unfavorable pricing, or poor shopping experience on your&nbsp;site.</p> 6. Purchase frequency (PF) <p>In order to measure and increase brand loyalty, companies can use <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">purchase frequency</a> (PF). Brand loyalty is a consumer’s inclination to remain committed to one product in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Product loyalty is most often measured by customer purchases of the same brand(s) over an extended period of time. Loyal customers are far more likely to repurchase, more likely to purchase more products, and less likely to switch&nbsp;brands.</p><p>To understand why consumers become loyal, researchers have studied consumer loyalty from all angles: demographic, psychological, and behavioral, among others. Demographic factors include age and income level. Psychological factors include product beliefs and attitudes toward the brand. Behavioral factors include frequency of purchase and product involvement.</p> How to Build Brand Loyalty in 4 Easy&nbsp;Steps <p>Building brand loyalty is a process of identifying, anticipating, and meeting the needs of customers. It is important to know when and how to best reach potential new customers.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to build brand&nbsp;loyalty:</p> 1. Create an exceptional customer experience <p>All companies should strive to create an exceptional customer experience that makes customers feel as though they are getting more value than what they paid for. When a company creates an exceptional experience, customers feel like they have been treated extraordinarily well, which causes them to return and buy&nbsp;again.</p> 2. Reward customers for their&nbsp;loyalty <p>Companies should reward customers for their loyalty in order to encourage repeat purchases and increase sales revenue. If a company does not reward loyal customers, then the loyal customers may stop returning because there is no incentive for them to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p><p>PS: if you’re looking for ways to get customers to buy from you more often, don’t miss our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing</a>.</p> 3. Encourage referrals and word-of-mouth <p>Advertising through social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter where customers can share with friends about how great their experience was with your&nbsp;company.</p> 4. Offer discounts on future purchases <p>If they refer someone new who makes a purchase within 24 hours of being referred by one of these loyal customers who already has an account with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Creating brand loyalty begins with the customer. The customer needs to feel a sense of trust and engagement toward your company, which requires that you build a relationship with them. Building this relationship includes knowing what your customers want, being able to get it to them at the right time, and offering them incentives for doing business with or continuing business with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Keep in mind that when attempting to build brand loyalty, as well as other types of marketing strategies, you should always consider the long-term effects. You want to make sure that you are having a positive impact on your customers’ lives and that they will continue to do business with you over the&nbsp;years.</p> Give Your Brand Loyalty a&nbsp;Boost <p>How do you make sure your customers aren’t just content with your product, but in love with your&nbsp;brand?</p><p>Create an emotional connection between them and your products and vice versa. Learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">the psychology of loyalty</a> and make use of these important insights.</p><p>It’s all about getting to the root of what makes someone feel connected to a company. Find out what makes them tick, why they buy the things they buy, and how to make their experience feel like more than just a transaction, but an experience.</p><p>And don’t forget about surprise and delight tactics. Even if you have a lot of repeat customers and people who are completely loyal to you, keep them on their toes. Make sure there are always new reasons to come back for more from your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Brand loyalty is one of the most important metrics in marketing, and yet it is poorly studied. Most brand loyalty studies focus on repeat purchases. Socially conscious consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that align with their values. Brand alignment is a commonality between the social consumer and the brand that creates additional loyalty beyond repeated purchases.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Commitment is a bold word, and we can all agree on that. And while in some situations, it’s a positive word bringing a lot of vibes-for example, a marriage, in another context, it might have a negative connotation-if you’re into debt, paying it is a commitment. It isn’t necessarily beneficial for&nbsp;you.</p><p>But we will discuss one other type of commitment in this article-customer commitment. In this article, we will see what customer commitment is, review its importance, mention the types, and give you some tips and tricks on how to improve&nbsp;it.</p> What is Customer Commitment? <p>You can find one of the best descriptions of customer commitment in the book <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/explaining-customer-loyalty-to-retail-stores/238383">Explaining Customer Loyalty to Retail Stores: A Moderated Explanation Chain of the Process</a>. According to Arturo Vasquez-Parraga and Miguel&nbsp;Sahagun,</p><blockquote>Customer’s engagement or continuous obligation to buy the same product or use the same&nbsp;company.</blockquote><p>In simpler terms, companies are making their services so influential for customers that the latter willingly (or not) keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> Why is It Important? <p>It’s essential to give your customers a reason to come back after you have converted them for the first time (see more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers and how to convert them here</a>). Offering your customers discounts, loyalty programs, and social share programs are all ways to build lifetime value with them. Innovative e-commerce features such as an app store, in-app payments, rewards, and one-click purchasing keep your clients returning again and again. People want to feel like a part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>Going the extra mile will be rewarding for your business and your customers. Let’s see&nbsp;why.</p> 1. Better relationships with your customers <p>If you invest in the relationship between you and your clients, you will make them more satisfied with your products. Customers value the personal approach and will always highly regard companies that use it in their marketing strategy.</p> 2. More sales over the long&nbsp;term <p>Every company that invests in its customers will get more committed visitors. Instead of looking for products, they will try to find ways to add more items to their cart, even if they don’t have much money left in their banks, because they like you and your business!</p> 3. Growth potential <p>Customer commitment makes company growth possible. Repeat purchasers can help you invest more in adding extra personnel and investing in new customers, as you will have the available funds.</p> 4. Reduced marketing cost <p>Running an e-commerce store is a challenging endeavor, as advertising on Google, Facebook, and all the other platforms out there is not cheap anymore. However, if you have enough committed customers to your brand, you will drive revenue without spending excessive money and reducing your profit. According to Forbes, converting leads into customers is 5 times more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/?sh=39d455325a8e">expensive</a> than investing in your current&nbsp;clients.</p> What are the Types of Customer Commitment? <p>Okay, we already told you about customers’ commitment and why it’s crucial to have more customers coming back to you. But what are the three main types, and how is each one different from the other ones? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Affective Commitment <p>Affective commitment is the emotional attachment to a brand. If a customer’s emotions are wrapped up in a brand, they’ll become more likely to keep coming back. This means that businesses should be sure to create genuine connections with their audience and make consumers feel like they’re part of the&nbsp;family.</p><p>But to generate affective commitment, it’s not enough to achieve high customer satisfaction. There should be more offered on the table, something exclusive. Affective commitment is like creating a “cult” toward a brand and its&nbsp;product.</p><p>Affective commitment is what each company should be fighting for, and it creates brand advocates who are a great asset for future&nbsp;success.</p> Affective Commitment Examples <p>Apple</p><p>Apple is a common example of a brand that drives customer loyalty because of a “cult” around its name. There are plenty of people who choose the company and buy the latest products. Whenever a new iPhone is released, there are massive queues for people who desire to have the latest model, no matter the cost. Typically, Apple’s products are more expensive than the competition, yet they drive more interest than their&nbsp;rivals.</p><p>A lot of customers’ devotion to Apple is explained by the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty</a>, which we have talked about on a previous&nbsp;article.</p><p>Ferrari</p><p>It’s a dream come true for customers who can afford to drive the “Red Horse” badge. And while the cheapest model from their product range (Ferrari Roma) starts with a base price of over $200,000, successful people would love to join the list of people who have access to this masterpiece. Sadly, you can’t go full-throttle in town, but still — it’s better to wait in traffic with a “Red Horse”, rather than in a Fiat,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Nike</p><p>Nike is one of the brands with the most brand advocates among sports fans. Being promoted by some of the most notable sports names — like Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, and Rafael Nadal- attracts clients who wear a jersey of their favorite sports clubs and buy the iconic Air Jordans or Air Max&nbsp;series.</p> 2. Continuance Commitment <p>Continuance commitment occurs when customers are not that highly impressed by the company. They choose to stay because they give it more value than other choices, and they pick it for logical&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>Although continuance commitment is an important factor of loyalty, it doesn’t bring the “buzz” effect. There is a thin line between affective commitment and continuance commitment.</p><p>Affective commitment focuses on customers choosing a service provider because they feel attached to the brand, while continuance commitment happens when customers choose because it is reasonable.</p> Continuance Commitment Examples <p>Microsoft</p><p>Microsoft is a typical example of a company that customers find reliable and trustworthy. Nobody is proud of using Microsoft Office or Windows. However, most users engage with the company because they know what to expect: consistency, predictability, and good value for&nbsp;money.</p><p>Walmart</p><p>While Walmart doesn’t attract such devoted fans as Apple or Tesla, it has become a synonym of great deals. While some people love the company, most customers shop there because they can find various brands and purchase goods at outstanding prices. The company slogan “Save Money. Live better.” perfectly fits the customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>IKEA</p><p>Just like Walmart, people know what to expect when they buy from IKEA. Reasonable prices and a variety of products. But that’s not all. IKEA has built a name for Swedish quality and minimalistic design, often attracting customers. While luxurious furniture fans cannot usually be seen there, IKEA is a go-to place for millions of customers worldwide.</p> 3. Normative Commitment <p>Instead of customers remaining committed to a brand because they enjoy doing business with it, the term normative commitment refers to when a customer remains committed to a brand because they feel they have to keep using the service, despite their&nbsp;will.</p><p>However, normative commitments are the worst of the three types, as customers who experience them are not happy. While we still have customer retention, this is the last stage before customers abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Normative commitment is also found in the relationship between employers and employees where the latter want to leave but have no better options at the&nbsp;moment.</p> Normative Commitment Examples <p>Adobe</p><p>Adobe is known for its excessive charges. You cannot buy any of Adobe’s products. Instead, you should subscribe to a single software or get access to all of them. $52.99 per month on an annual basis is what you should pay for one license. It’s definitely a steep price no one wants to pay, but since it’s an industry-standard software, you can’t really settle with a cheaper alternative, as they are not good&nbsp;enough.</p><p>SAP</p><p>If you ask employees, 90% of them probably do not like working with SAP. It’s a monolith platform, has a very outdated UI, costs a fortune, and is very heavy. But why do most Fortune 500 keep using it? Because it is proven to work with large batches of data, and it’s one of the legacy companies of its kind, so migrating to a competitor might be a disaster for clients; thus, they stay despite the shortcomings.</p><p>T-Mobile</p><p>Mobile service providers are often topping charts of unpleased customers simply because there isn’t much competition. T-Mobile is a leading provider, yet it receives very poor feedback for lack of mobile signal, unstable 5G connection, and poor customer service. However, customers keep using it, as loyal customers can still get better plans. Otherwise, if they change their carrier, they risk losing the perks that were stacked over the&nbsp;years.</p> How to Increase Customer Commitment <p>There are many ways to increase customer commitment, and fortunately, it isn’t hard to achieve better results. Let’s see some of&nbsp;them:</p> 1. Offer discounts <p>One of the most popular ways to create a more committed customer base is to offer occasional discounts. Of course, it’s not a good practice to have discounts 24/7 available on all products. But coming up with different offers makes people maintain their interest in your e-commerce platform and check out the website/app more frequently.</p> 2. Reward frequent purchases <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">Loyalty programs</a> are a superb way to reward repeat purchasers. It is an opportunity for you to connect with your customers personally and build your relationship with them. A rewards program gives your customers a unique feeling of gratitude, regardless of the order value or the amounts of orders they&nbsp;make.</p> 3. Set up subscription services <p>Many subscription-based programs offer incentives to customers that other e-commerce sites don’t. For example, a customer can pay $50 per year and in return receive free shipping and a 10% flat discount on all orders. It is a strong reason for customers to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> 4. Ask for feedback and reply to&nbsp;it <p>Users can feel more involved with your brand if you offer the option to write a review for your product or service. This way, you show them that their opinions matter to your business. But do not forget to respond. It may take no more than 1–2 minutes to come up with a reply, but the effect can be huge. You can thank them for each positive review and provide an apology and explanation for negative&nbsp;reviews.</p> 5. Offer a “Thank you”&nbsp;email <p>A “Thank You” email isn’t much effort to create, and it has become a common practice among companies. All you need to have is email automation software and some original ideas. Your effort ends with no more than a couple of hours of work until you write a good&nbsp;one.</p> 6. Personalize your&nbsp;message <p>Countless advertisements can work against your brand, especially when you oversaturate the market with web banners and newsletter pop-ups. However, by adding personal touches to every campaign and interacting directly with an audience, you can stand out from the competition by giving something that clients&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Focus on delivering a great customer service experience <p>To improve your store’s performance, you need to make yourself available to your customers. Adding customer care agents will significantly improve your performance. Try to add as many channels as possible: email, live chat, phone. Having quick-to-react customer service might make the difference between affective commitment and customers quitting your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Customer commitment is vital for your business, and it can help your brand generate more money by capitalizing on existing customers and converting leads into new clients. But if you fail to offer something any short of the best, your clients can quickly abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Did you like this article?

<p>3.8 billion — that’s the number of memberships US <a href="https://www.claruscommerce.com/blog/17-staggering-customer-loyalty-stats-that-will-change-your-perspective/">customers</a> hold in loyalty programs. There’s no question that loyalty programs are popular with consumers.</p><p>That loyalty programs are a staple of consumer marketing is therefore no surprise. These programs can be a powerful tool for businesses looking to keep their customers happy (learn more about the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty&nbsp;here</a>).</p><p>Let’s explore the basics of loyalty programs and learn loyalty programs best practices that will keep your customers coming back for&nbsp;more.</p> What’s a Loyalty&nbsp;Program? <p>A loyalty program is a marketing strategy used by companies to reward customers for their continued patronage. Programs can be as simple as a punch card that gets the customer a free item after a certain number of visits, or as complex as a points-based system that allows customers to redeem rewards for products or services.</p><p>Loyalty programs are popular because they offer customers an incentive (read more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing here</a>) to keep coming back to brands and businesses of their choice. They also help businesses build customer loyalty, which ultimately manifests itself in increased sales and&nbsp;profits.</p> 12 Loyalty Program Best Practices <p>There are a number of factors that go into creating an effective loyalty program. Here are some best practices that businesses like you can&nbsp;follow:</p> 1. Make it easy to join and&nbsp;use <p>Your loyalty program strategy should make it easy for your customers to join the program and use it. Customers should be able to sign up and start earning rewards points quickly. The program should also be easy to navigate, with a clear rewards chart and easy-to-use redemption process.</p><p>This best practices suggestion encourages your customers to quickly join and engage in a loyalty program. Make it easy to participate as well, allowing transactions from any point of sale system and a hassle-free billing&nbsp;cycle.</p> 2. Evolve and&nbsp;upgrade <p>Loyalty rewards programs should constantly evolve in order to keep up with the latest consumer trends. For example, if you notice that many of your customers are using their loyalty program to collect points for free products, then consider adding a new tier of rewards that allows them to redeem their points for a discount on a future purchase, or freely exchange points for another set of products.</p><p>You could also change the way you reward your long-term customers. If you use a points system for every purchase, why not explore rewarding social media subscriptions, likes and&nbsp;shares?</p><p>This best practices standard rule will help your brand stay in touch with current trends and the changing expectations of your consumers.</p> 3. Explore company partnerships <p>One best practice rule that many businesses are hesitant to try is to open up their loyalty programs to company partnerships. You may worry that doing so will reduce the effectiveness of your program, or that customers will be confused about how the program&nbsp;works.</p><p>However, research shows that a coalition loyalty program strategy can lead to an increase in engagement from customers. This is because customers appreciate being able to earn points from more than one source. Additionally, partnering with other businesses can help introduce your customers to new products and services.</p><p>Consumers appreciate the flexibility a partnership-based loyalty program offers. Making points and rewards transferable attracts more customers and gives you a better understanding of what your target market is&nbsp;buying.</p> 4. Personalize <p>Personalize your loyalty program to stand out from the crowd. This can be as simple as sending customers special offers or birthday messages, or it can be more complex, such as tailoring the program to each customer’s preferences. Your rewards program could be used to suit their shopping&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Personalization is a best practices rule that shows customers that you appreciate their faith in you. It also keeps customers engaged with your brand, and encourages them to continue participating in your loyalty&nbsp;program.</p><p>Some companies structure their loyalty programs into modules, so customers themselves customize the offerings of the rewards program to suit their preferences. It is a customer-driven personalization and could take form in several ways, such as levels of membership, and the option of selecting and using the program through multiple channels, such as mobile apps, online e-commerce sites, and physical&nbsp;stores.</p> 5. Track and reward loyal customers <p>Customer Relationship Management (CRM software) is a great way to keep track of and reward your loyal customers. CRM makes it easy to identify and track your most loyal customers using customer data through their transaction history and behavior. It also allows you to automate the process of rewarding customers for their&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>When a customer is loyal, your CRM could immediately track their purchases and transactions and quickly reward them. Your customers don’t have to go to customer service or call anyone to receive their rewards; your management groups your loyal customers and identifies them for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Using this is not only a best practices rule for your business strategies but also for your brand as a whole. It will make your customers feel appreciated, and such customers are more likely to return and/or recommend your business to&nbsp;others.</p> 6. Offer Excellent Rewards <p>A loyalty program should offer excellent rewards that appeal and interest your current and existing customers. There are a number of different types of rewards that you can offer as part of a loyalty program. Some of the most popular include loyalty points, free and discounted products or services.</p><p>But don’t forget to experiment with different rewards to find out what works best for your loyalty program&nbsp;members.</p><p>So, what makes a good reward? Rewards should be relevant to the customer. If they’re not interested in the reward, they’re not going to redeem it. Review customer demands and searches, and see what you could offer to meet them. The rewards should not be expensive, but they should be valuable and be something that the customer would&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Create Emotional Connection <p>Customers tend to remain loyal to a brand because of an emotional connection to a company or brand. This connection could stem from familiarity or tradition. Smart brands often use this connection as part of their loyalty marketing strategy.</p><p>Customers often prefer brands that show the brand cares for their consumers, the environment and have a deeper understanding of their target audience. If your customers consider you to be empathetic and sharing the same values as them, you’d become an integral part of their purchase decisions.</p> 8. Optimize Your Loyalty&nbsp;Programs <p>Optimizing a customer loyalty program to make it accessible to digital users makes it all the more utilitarian, especially at this time when most people are online using social media and e-commerce sites. Making a loyalty program accessible across several channels increases the chances of a customer buying a product or brand. A seamless omnichannel experience would help you score brownie points with your customer.</p><p>Digital optimization makes it easier for your back office systems to track customer engagement and interaction, making the calculation of CLI, CLV and customer engagement scores easier. You could improve your customer service and listen to incoming customer requests through digital&nbsp;media.</p> 9. Offer Rewards and Incentives Beyond Transactions <p>Most brands focus on rewards when customers do actual purchase transactions, but good customer loyalty programs reward customers for any engagement. Explore what your loyal customer base does on social media and give them additional rewards for reviews, likes, shares or even subscriptions to social media&nbsp;handles.</p><p>Also, if you give program benefits to existing customers when they complete surveys and download your apps, then it would encourage customers to participate in your rewards&nbsp;program.</p> 10. Have a comprehensible reward and incentive structure <p>The incentive and rewards system of your loyalty program should be simple for the customer to understand. They should know what rewards they could receive from&nbsp;you.</p><p>If your customer knows what they will earn and when they will receive the reward, they are more likely to repeat a purchas. A frequent flyer point may seem attractive enough, but sometimes when a customer reaches the frequent flyer miles they’ve been targeting, the airline just blocks them with the unavailability of flights or&nbsp;seats.</p><p>For some companies, the customers affected simply did not understand the requirements of the reward. But for customers it is another example of a useless reward program and will not likely renew their membership.</p> 11. Stay in touch with&nbsp;members <p>Your most valued customers value your proactiveness more, since they are the ones who continue to buy your products for a longer time. They are the ones who need regular updates on discounts, sales and offers, and are more likely to respond and avail of these special&nbsp;offers.</p><p>Additionally, communicating with them gives this exchange an air of exclusivity, and makes the membership to the loyalty program something coveted.</p> 12. Be profitable <p>The goal of a loyalty program is not only to incentivize repeat and most profitable customers, but also to increase your profit. Repeat customers are valuable because they do not require new marketing techniques to improve awareness and engagement. You do not need a new campaign to attract repeat customers, but enhance the existing customer-brand relationships to keep your brand loyalists satisfied.</p><p>Track customer spending and product margins when designing your loyalty programs. Ensure that the loyalty program is profitable for the company but also satisfying for the customer.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">measure your brand loyalty</a> and keep those metrics in check! This might help you to better direct your efforts in marketing and&nbsp;sales.</p> How Can You Measure Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>There are a variety of ways to measure customer loyalty. One way is to survey individual customers and ask them how likely they are to recommend your company to others, and to rate factors such as quality of products/services, price, customer service,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Another way is to analyze customer retention rates and see how many customers are returning or have returned to your business. You can also look at the amount of money customers are spending currently, and compare that to how much they’ve spent in the past. All of these require measurable customer data, and the following are the most common metrics used to measure customer&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 1. Net Promoter&nbsp;Score <p>The net promoter score (NPS) is a way to measure customer experience. You could calculate it using this question: how likely are you to recommend the product to a friend or colleague?</p><p>The NPS uses a scale from 0 to 10 and rates answers into three groups: promoters (9–10), passives (7–8), and detractors (0–6).</p><p>The percentage of detractors subtracted from the percentage of promoters produces your NPS. The higher the NPS, the more your customers are likely to buy and recommend your&nbsp;brand.</p> 2. Repurchase Ratio <p>The number of customers who come back to buy your brand divided by the number of one-time buyers is called the repurchase ratio. Most of a company’s revenue comes from repeat or returning purchasers, though they may be fewer than the total number of their customers.</p><p>The repurchase ratio also depends on the business model. Subscription-based retail models calculate the repurchase ratio by dividing the number of people who continue the subscription by the number of people who cancel after the first contract.</p><p>For retail businesses using a transaction-based model, the number of repeat customers must be calculated first. You can do this by finding the average time between the first and second buys of a repeat customer. The repurchase ratio can then be calculated by dividing the number of repeat customers by the number of non-repeat buyers.</p> 3. Upsell&nbsp;Ratio <p>The upsell ratio is the number of customers who have bought more than one type of product from you compared to the customers who buy only one. The upsell ratio only tracks customers who buy new products, and does not include repeat customers who buy the same&nbsp;thing.</p> 4. Customer Lifetime&nbsp;Value <p>The customer lifetime value (CLV) is the dollar value of a customer’s total purchases over the entire course of their relationship with a company. This metric is used to measure the profitability of a customer, and to help businesses like you determine how much they should spend to acquire new customers.</p><p>There are a few ways to calculate the CLV. The most simple way is to multiply the average purchase amount by the number of purchases made. You can also take into account customer retention rates and calculate how much each customer is worth over time. This gives you a more accurate picture of the value of a customer.</p> 5. Customer Loyalty&nbsp;Index <p>The customer loyalty index (CLI) is a tool that tracks customer loyalty. It uses a set of questions addressing three vital&nbsp;points:</p>  How likely are you to try the brand’s new products?  How likely are you to recommend the brand to your friends and&nbsp;family?  How likely are you to buy from the brand again in the&nbsp;future?  <p>The average for these responses is the CLI of a customer, which they rate from 1 to 6, with 1 for “Definitely Yes” and 6 for “Definitely No”. The customer data and customer insights taken from these surveys help in measuring CLI.</p> 6. Customer Engagement Score <p>Another way to measure customer loyalty is to use the customer engagement score. This is based on individual customers’ activity with your business. You can group your customers using demographics, transactions, and customer behavior. Using these customer segments could help you identify which customers are likely to become repeat purchasers and predict which ones will repurchase or try other new products.</p><p>The customer engagement score is calculated by measuring frequency of use ( <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">click here</a> to learn more about purchase frequency), level of use, actions by customer, time spent on activities, and other performance indicators and metrics that represent engagement success.</p> Give Your Loyal Customers What They&nbsp;Deserve <p>A loyalty program marketing strategy is a great way to reward your best customers for their continued business and retain them for a long time. However, simply having a loyalty program is not&nbsp;enough.</p><p>Loyalty is more than a transaction to your customers; it is a shared value they share with you. Your loyalty program should reflect that&nbsp;too.</p><p>PS: if you’d like to know about your potential customers and how to convert them in the first place, we highly recommend you to read our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers</a>.

<p>Based on recent statistics, 41% of US consumers make an online <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/448659/online-shopping-frequency-usa/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20survey%20published,shopping%20once%20every%20two%20weeks.">purchase</a> once or twice per week. 24% buy something every other week. Your task as a business is to ensure you are among those they buy from and do it&nbsp;often.</p><p>Purchase frequency is one of the core metrics every business should track. It directly affects your profitability and revenue since you are 6X times more likely to <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/">sell</a> to existing customers than new ones. High or average purchase frequency means customer loyalty, while low rates show that people rarely return after the first purchase.</p><p>Find out how to calculate and increase your purchase frequency below. Our tips will help you boost your customer retention metrics.</p> What is Purchase Frequency? <p>The purchase frequency (also PF) is the number of times an average customer places an order within a time period. By measuring PF during the limited time frame you get more accurate results and can compare customer behavior&nbsp;changes.</p><p>The higher the purchase frequency, the more likely your is brand to turn repeat customers into loyal ones. For example, people buy low-cost consumables more often than luxury cars or accessories with a significantly higher average order value. The purchase frequency for these product categories cannot be compared. Hence, you should track average customer purchases within your company or use industry benchmarks for estimates.</p> Why is Purchase Frequency Important? <p>Purchase frequency over a given period is one of the critical indicators for any eCommerce store. But why is it so important? Here are the main reasons for calculating purchase frequency:</p>  Calculating purchase frequency rates allows you to track customer retention. When a customer buys from you repeatedly, you work in the right direction. Without the purchase frequency KPI, you won’t be able to measure&nbsp;this.  It boosts the customer lifetime value. When you increase purchase frequency, the customer lifetime value also grows since an average buyer generates more revenue and stays for a longer time&nbsp;frame.  Repeat purchases are cheaper than customer acquisition. The cost of activating existing customers is much lower than attracting unique customers, which may considerably cut your expenses. <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref">82% of companies agree that customer retention</a> is cheaper than acquisition.  Loyal customers with a large average number of orders are more likely to recommend your brand. People that have completed multiple purchases favor your brand and are ready to invite a friend or join a loyalty&nbsp;program.  Purchase frequency provides reliable data for marketing campaigns. If you are unsure whether your marketing is fruitful, purchase frequency rates help evaluate&nbsp;this.  <p>As you can see, you get more loyal customers, boost sales, and grow revenue when you increase purchase frequency. It’s a must-watch metric for any retailer.</p> How do You Calculate Purchase Frequency? <p>Now, we reach the logical question: How to calculate purchase frequency? All data you need for calculations is in your transactional data. The purchase frequency formula is also pretty easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>You will need to follow these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Learn the number of orders customers placed with your company during the selected time frame (usually 12&nbsp;months).  Learn the number of unique customers your business served during the same time&nbsp;frame.  Use the gathered information in the purchase frequency formula for calculation.  <p>Purchase Frequency = Number of Orders / Number of Unique Customers</p> Example <p>Suppose you run a business that sells clothes and want to check the purchase frequency. Based on the previously collected statistics, you know that your company had 2500 unique customers and 3300 orders for the same&nbsp;period.</p><p>Then, the purchase frequency is 3300/2500 =&nbsp;1.32.</p> Difference Between Purchase Frequency (PF) and Repeat Purchase Rates&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Many people use the terms purchase frequency and repeat purchase rate interchangeably. Yet these metrics have some significant differences, so it’s necessary to differentiate them for the clarity of this&nbsp;article.</p><p>The purchase frequency rate shows how often an average customer buys something from a single merchant within the specified time frame. On the other hand, the repeat purchase rate is a share of customers who have purchased at least a second time. To calculate repeat purchase rate, you need to divide the number of customers who’ve purchased more than once by the total number of customers.</p><p>While purchase frequency allows you to understand how often consumers buy something, the repeat purchase rate focuses on the share of repeat customers. Both these metrics are helpful to evaluate customer retention and&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 8 Ways to Increase Purchase Frequency <p>If you want to have a flourishing business, you should engage new customers and continuously nurture existing ones. Repeat customers generate more revenue than occasional purchasers. Hence, you must put more focus on them if you expect to grow&nbsp;sales.</p><p>This section includes several most effective ways to increase your purchase frequency by building better customer relationships and more relevant&nbsp;offers.</p> 1. Know your customer before planning marketing campaigns <p>Before you take steps to promote or sell something, you need to know who you target. This information will allow you to choose the best ways to encourage customers to repeat purchases. You will also be able to focus on people who are more likely to convert than&nbsp;others.</p><p>Advanced software is an optimum way to collect details about your target audience (including demographics, purchase history, average order value, preferences, favorite communication channels, etc.). Modern CRM systems integrated with email marketing tools, social media, data analytics, and other solutions automatically record priceless information about customers. They process this raw data to generate insights about what people want and whether they are ready to&nbsp;pay.</p><p>Once you have these details, it’s possible to segment your customers based on their characteristics. This way, you will tailor your marketing and increase frequent purchases.</p> 2. Launch personalized email marketing campaigns <p>Email marketing is the cornerstone of a marketing strategy focused on increasing the number of customers who make repeat purchases. Emails are the most convenient and standard way to communicate with customers about their purchases, special offers, or sales. These communications remind people about your brand to encourage customers to buy something again.</p><p>Yet to boost the efficiency of email marketing campaigns, you’d better make them personalized. Using the person’s name in an email subject line can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/email-personalization-techniques-tools-stats-2021-guide-josh-turner/">increase open rates by 26%</a>. When more customers open your message, customer activity grows, increasing purchase frequency.</p><p>Besides the person’s name, you can customize the content and style of emails based on the recipient’s characteristics, previous responses, purchases, and other details. For example, you can send a custom selection of similar products based on the purchase&nbsp;history.</p> 3. Make limited-time special&nbsp;offers <p>Limited-time offers are steroids for any marketing campaign that considerably affect customers’ behavior. When the person hears that the chance to get something at a lower price will disappear after the set time frame, they rush to take action. As a result, the customer buys a product or service they haven’t planned to purchase before as the offer seems too good to miss it. Such customer behavior increases the purchase frequency and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>Yet you should be careful and avoid overusing limited-time offers. Consumers will get used to such a customer experience and stop buying without discount codes or sales. It may be counterproductive for the overall purchase&nbsp;rate.</p> 4. Communicate with existing customers through multiple&nbsp;channels <p><a href="https://www.mackenziecorp.com/23-omnichannel-stats/">Over 50% of modern brands use at least 8 channels</a> to interact with customers. You should be ready to serve consumers through emails, social media, messengers, phone calls, online chats, etc. The ability to stay in touch through top popular communication channels directly affects the quality of customer service and satisfaction rates.</p><p>Imagine users find your new product and are ready to place an order, but you don’t reply to their emails for several days. Guess what? The chances they will leave to a competitor are very&nbsp;high.</p><p>You should avoid such issues and provide continuous support via the main communication channels. To make things clear from the start, indicate what channels consumers should use for help on your&nbsp;website.</p> 5. Implement a loyalty&nbsp;program <p>The best customers are loyal customers. They already love your brand, trust you, and make frequent purchases even without you asking them about this. <a href="https://inmoment.wpengine.com/blog/earning-and-destroying-customer-loyalty-retail-cx-trends-you-need-to-know/">60% of loyal customers</a> say they are ready to purchase from their favorite companies more&nbsp;often.</p><p>That’s why you should think about having a customer loyalty program. Offer buyers points for every purchase, give them discounts or make special offers, or find any other incentive that can inspire people to join your loyalty&nbsp;program.</p><p>Not sure how to implement loyalty programs? <a href="https://www.monetha.io/business/">Join Monetha</a> to get a ready solution for eCommerce loyalty campaigns.</p> 6. Use software to automate manual sales and support&nbsp;tasks <p>Apart from nudging your customers to convert, you must be ready for increased purchase frequency on your side. As the purchase frequency rate grows, the volume of orders you need to process also skyrockets. It may turn out that your sales and support teams are not ready to meet the&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Therefore, to increase the productivity of your sales and support teams, you need automation software. Modern tools can automatically respond to standard emails, implement online website chats, track order fulfillment, update order statuses, and complete many other actions you would otherwise do manually.</p><p>It reduces the load on sales and support departments allowing them to enhance customer service and focus on strategic tasks.</p> 7. Introduce gamification elements <p>When a customer purchases a product, it should be a fun and pleasant experience. Therefore, gamification elements in your sales strategy are a great way to stir buyers’ interest and increase purchase frequency.</p><p>Gamification is the most relevant in loyalty campaigns where users can win points, move from one level to another, or even compete with peers. When people get engaged and want to reach the highest level, they willingly do what you ask them to do. For example, when a buyer needs ten orders to move from the starter level and enjoy additional benefits, they are more likely to place ten orders than without incentives.</p> 8. Fight cart abandonment <p>Abandoned carts are among the most upsetting types of customer behavior for businesses. People browse your website, select products, add them to the cart, and leave at the last moment without paying. Given that the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment">average customer abandonment rate is 69.57%</a>, the impact on the purchase rates and overall revenue is enormous.</p><p>Even though you won’t be able to make all customers complete the order, you can take steps to remarket them. Try sending them a reminder email, offer a discount on the products added to the cart, etc. Remarketing can convince a part of abandoners to come back and restore the purchase frequency.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Have you wondered why you keep buying lattes from your local cafeteria, even though Starbucks charges you $1.50 less than that? Is it because of the smile you receive from the merchants every time you order or the reward proposition of 1 free coffee every ten orders? Or because of the&nbsp;habit?</p><p>In this article, we will review one of the critical components for every successful company-regardless of size, location, and staff number-loyal customers.</p> What is a Loyalty&nbsp;Program? <p>A loyalty program, also known as a reward program, is an initiative by a brand to offer its customers special incentives based on their past purchases. These objectives can vary from brand to brand; one company might want to tempt people with discounts or by <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">giving customers cash back</a>, while another might reward people for completing repeat&nbsp;orders.</p><p>Regardless of the goal, all loyalty programs seek to keep customers interested in the brand by building and strengthening <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">brand loyalty</a> — and keeping them close. An interesting stat from <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/customer-loyalty-statistics/#gref">SmallBizGenius</a> indicates that 72% of adult US citizens are part of at least one loyalty&nbsp;program.</p> Why Are Loyalty Programs Important? <p>Customer loyalty has become a cornerstone topic for businesses, and brands are constantly coming up with new rewards programs to attract more clients. But for both parties-brands and consumers, loyalty points are more than just numbers. And it means so much more! Let’s see some of the crucial benefits of incorporating points programs.</p> 1. Improve the relationship between brands and&nbsp;clients <p>To emotionally engage customers and encourage them to come back, brands must provide more than just the possibility of a free bottle or free glasses-they must create an experience. Giving customers a chance to meet with other dedicated fans of a personality or brand, for example, can inspire a feeling of community and belong among new shoppers.</p> 2. Attract new customers <p>A happy customer is a repeat customer. According to a study conducted by Nielsen, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2015/digital-formats-are-among-the-most-trusted-advertising-sources-despite-slow-growth/">83% of new customers</a> will trust a personal recommendation from friends and family members. That’s a lot more than any other type of marketing. So, the importance of your loyal customers can not only bring you increased value from them-your efforts can actually bring you business from new customers!</p> 3. Repeat customers have better&nbsp;ROI <p>A loyalty strategy in place is well worth it. If you put more effort into keeping your current clients happy, you will have up to a 300% revenue increase. That’s right-300%. According to RJMetrics, you can get three times the business volume. Of course, you need to get real; these numbers are optimistic.</p> 4. Reduced marketing costs <p>As the digital economy grows and evolves, brands need to adapt their strategies accordingly lest they be left in the&nbsp;dust.</p><p>But why splash tons of money acquiring new customers (considering that marketing does not guarantee you a sale) when you can spend five times less to reward customers and keep them loyal to your business? That’s right, a new customer “costs” about 5X more than a current&nbsp;one.</p> 5. Loyal customers are easier to upsell and cross-sell <p>Loyalty programs aren’t just a tool to increase customer retention; they also boost your business profit. Because upselling and cross-selling use AI to predict customer behavior, you can offer your clients better-suited offers that reward them for the bigger purchase.</p><p>Since your loyal consumers are aware of your brand, they can take advantage of a good deal and be happy. You will be astounded by the way how most people embrace&nbsp;deals!</p> 6. Free marketing <p>Instead of spending 1000’s of dollars trying to figure out the market and swearing Facebook and Google about their ever-changing algorithms, you can sit comfortably and watch how word of mouth marketing can benefit your business passively.</p> 7. Access to precious customer&nbsp;data <p>Brands can implement a loyalty program that collects critical data and leverages customer behavior with machine learning to improve the customer journey across the&nbsp;board.</p><p>Clients are more willing to share data with businesses they know which can be your key to success. You can personalize their experience, building an even more solid emotional foundation.</p> The Psychology Behind Loyalty&nbsp;Programs <p>Loyalty programs and all the tools that calculate progress and track results are based on real-world research made by leading psychologists. There are several pivotal principles when it comes to the psychology of&nbsp;loyalty.</p> First impression matters more than anything&nbsp;else <p>The first impression of your ecommerce store proceeds even the first purchase by your customer.</p><p>According to research, 94% of first impressions are design-related, so you should invest in looks just as much as giving your clients different freebies and discounts.</p><p>A good loyalty program lies on the foundation of an attractive proposal that is “dressed” well. The color theory plays a huge role-branded colors can give an additional boost to any loyalty&nbsp;program.</p> Positive reinforcement for forming a&nbsp;habit <p>Positive reinforcement is a reward that gives a positive outcome after completing an action. Giving your customers a positive stimulus makes them more likely to respond to it. The greatest loyalty programs are fueled by positive reinforcement. Rewarding users for their loyalty and interaction with your brand encourages them to keep participating in that behavior.</p><p>While using this technique can make driving permanent, consistent behavior patterns easier, it’s essential to be thoughtful about approaching your rewards system. But if you do, purchasing from your store might become as light as buying goods from the local grocery store -a&nbsp;habit.</p> Applying the “Rule of The&nbsp;Boxes” <p>Typically, if users choose between two products, they pick the cheaper one. If Product A costs $50 but offers 2–3 key functions while Product B costs $100 but offers 10–15 key features, people will choose the cheaper&nbsp;option.</p><p>However, if we add something in between-Product C, which costs $80 but has 8–12 options, people will find it the best deal. That’s the rule of the&nbsp;boxes.</p> The goal gradient&nbsp;effect <p>The goal gradient theory proves that consumers are motivated to make more purchases when closer to achieving their goals. The goal gradient theory focuses on the relationship between effort and the level of motivation that goes into attaining specific&nbsp;goals.</p><p>The goal gradient effect is easily accessible. For example, many cafeterias offer a free coffee for every ten orders, making customers more prone to purchase to get the&nbsp;freebie.</p> The FOMO&nbsp;effect <p>FOMO (in short for “Fear of Missing Out”) is a very popular effect. Research shows that we’re more motivated to avoid losing something than earning it. This is called loss aversion, and recently it’s been applied to loyalty programs.</p><p>Loss aversion explains the difference between a one-time point-based survey and a rewards program; instead of earning points, customers are motivated when they see how many points they can&nbsp;lose.</p><p>In the sports betting industry, it’s a common strategy to offer customers to cash out. If they are betting on 5–6 events, they can cash out (while missing some of the potential profit) but keep some of their profits, or keep playing and lose everything, including their&nbsp;bets.</p> A sense of exclusivity <p>As humans, we’re naturally attracted to the feeling of gaining social status. High-tier rewards give shoppers an excellent reason to keep coming back and incentivize them to spend&nbsp;more.</p><p>People can easily find this exclusivity effect in real life. For example, the famous travel website Booking gives its users an additional discount if they reach a certain level (Genius 1, Genius 2, Genius). They have to book more holidays within a certain period to achieve&nbsp;it.</p> Increased commitment <p>Once customers have invested in your brand, they’re more likely to remain loyal than if they had only entered your&nbsp;store.</p><p>The “sunk cost fallacy” is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when individuals see investment as an increase in their own worth, so any withdrawal from that investment becomes a loss of personal&nbsp;value.</p><p>In other words, the more your customers engage with your ecommerce store, the more likely they are to keep purchasing from&nbsp;you.</p><p>PS: want to learn more about the topic? Then read our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">customer commitment here</a>.</p> Summary <p>Loyalty programs are the backbone of almost any business, but businesses must constantly innovate to avoid becoming complacent and falling behind. Customer perception is crucial-marketers can customize everything from rewards to customer engagement techniques to appeal to audiences’ mindsets.</p><p>Rewards are the most direct way for customers to appreciate your brand-they give people something they want, so long as they continue buying your product or&nbsp;service.</p><p>And as you already saw, understanding and leveraging psychology will not only give you short-term results, but it will help your business succeed in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Did you like this article?

The addition of consumer-permissioned data from an open banking platform allows early-stage FinTechs access to the data they need to mitigate fraud, maximize confidence, and provide more choice in payment transactions to improve user experiences.</p>
<p>“Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data that is critical to enabling all ecosystem players, opening the door for the future of financial experiences, and can help streamline account verification to reduce friction between apps and consumers,” said Andy Sheehan, Executive Vice President, U.S. Open Banking at Mastercard. “Mastercard and Synctera’s partnership enhances the support and collaboration that is critical to FinTech innovators and will allow entrepreneurs and developers the ability to go to market quickly and ultimately deliver more consumer choice.”</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>IIW was established in 2005, and boasts over a hundred sponsors, with hundreds in attendance. As the focus is on “getting things done” the agenda is created live each day by attendees present at the opening of the day, giving you the opportunity to establish what you want to talk about and getting the real time ability to see which topics others will be deliberating that you might want to join in on.</p>
<p>IIW is an un-conference, which means that there are no keynote speakers, presentations, or sales pitches (for the most part). Participants are encouraged to come with topics they would like to discuss with the community in attendance, with the goal of “moving topics, code and projects downfield.”</p>
<p>The Take Aways</p>
<p>Because of the unique style of this conference you are sure to take part in, sit in on, or just overhear a variety of conversations on all kinds of work in the identity space. Here are some of the topics Indicio’s team at IIW found interesting.</p>
<p>Trust registries and Machine Readable Governance: The question, “How do we know which Issuers to trust?” was brought up several times at IIW with “Trust registries” being a common response. But&nbsp; there seemed to be a division over what a trust registry is or should be. One interpretation saw it as a third party fulfilling a top-down, command-and-control, pay-to-play, API-to-call function in determining which credential issuers can be trusted. The other saw it as something collaborative, a resource for governance files that allows those files to be cacheable among agents through machine readable governance. This triggered interest in what machine readable governance was, how it made a trust registry portable,&nbsp; and how it could be implementedThere</p>
<p>DIDComm as a Control Channel: This concept is all about using DIDcomm as a coordinating service, connecting two endpoints that want to communicate and handling everything from authentication to coordinating money transfers or shipping details, while also adding an additional security layer for the end user. While it was a new idea to many, there were a few people that raised their hands and said that they have already implemented something like this and showed some real world examples, increasing excitement around the possibilities and promoting further adoption.</p>
<p>Interoperability: As usual, many people were concerned with how to solve interoperability challenges in the community. The crowd was very keen on the idea of running an Aries Interop-a-thon (based on the hackathon style events Indicio has run for the Cardea Project at Linux Foundation Public Health) The idea that IIW tickets be issued as credentials so the community can personally test its solutions and try to iron out some of the interoperability challenges was proposed, and has a good chance of moving forward.</p>
<p>The really thought provoking discussion was about the current state of identity interoperability vs interoperability in other areas of tech. When compared to browsers, it was said it is tempting to feel like we are in the Netscape era of standardization. When in reality we are likely more in line with the Compuserve-AOL era of standardization and have much further&nbsp; to go.</p>
<p>AnonCreds VS W3C JSON-LD Creds: Our team expected some disagreement about this topic, but both sides seemed to realize that delivery is what matters here, and additional argument isn’t going to help. Multiple sessions were run trying to identify which credential format to use, resulting in 7+ different formats being discussed, with Anoncreds &amp; W3C JSON-LD being the most popular for debate. The ISO mDL 18013-5 credential format was also brought up for use in drivers licenses.</p>
<p>Why should you participate in the next IIW?</p>
<p>No wrap up or bullet point list can capture every conversation. This year was the first in-person conference since the start of the pandemic and every member of our team was excited to go.</p>
<p>While it was cheaper to attend over zoom, the conversational opportunities presented by in-person attendance—the ability to to really dig into the technology, simply don’t occur online. While this could be said for any conference, the unconference style of IIW encourages much greater audience participation. The number of engineers in these discussions drives challenging, exciting, and insightful ideas, so much so in fact, that In the middle of this IIW they decided to do the next one in person, rather than one remote and one in person per year as had been previously planned.</p>
<p>And worse case scenario, you can use the opportunity of bringing your team together for some sweet photo ops like our team did.</p>
<p>Tickets sell out quickly so for more information and to make sure you can join the next event we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW website</a>!</p>

<p>Es zirkulieren falsche Annahmen und Missverständnisse in den Medien über das Potenzial und die Risiken von SSI. In diesem Artikel setzen wir uns mit einigen Missverständnissen auseinander und fassen die wichtigsten Kernthesen über SSI zusammen. So entsteht am Ende ein übersichtliches Bild darüber, was SSI ist, und vor allem: was SSI nicht ist und sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Können SSI Daten gestohlen und ohne mein Wissen verwendet werden? Ermöglicht SSI einen Datenmarkt und weiteren Missbrauch von unseren Daten?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei SSI stehen die selbstbestimmte Nutzung und gleichzeitige Datensicherheit für das Individuums im Mittelpunkt. Gleichzeitig ist Datensparsamkeit wichtig: der User sollte immer nur das erforderliche Minimum der Informationen über sich preisgeben müssen, das für die Nutzung eines Dienstes notwendig ist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man die Daten gibt, nicht aber, was mit ihnen passiert – was keine technische Frage ist, sondern den Trust Frameworks und der Umsetzung von Policies geschuldet. Dies wird über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt, da so Vertrauen in die am Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure hergestellt werden kann. SSI selbst bietet keinen allgemeinen Schutz vor Datenmissbrauch. Dennoch stellt es die Möglichkeit dar, durch das Prinzip der Dezentralität die eigenen Daten sicher und selbstbestimmt zu verwalten. Die Dienste, an welche man persönliche Daten übermittelt, sind letztendlich ebenfalls an die Datenschutzgrundverordnung gebunden. Man kann nicht nur entscheiden, wem man die Daten gibt, sondern auch wie (bspw. als ZKP oder als VP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso bietet SSI mehr privacy als derzeitige Systeme?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weil wir unsere Daten nicht an Hunderte von Plattformen auslagern, sondern zentral bei uns verwalten. So wären im Idealfall beim Hack eines Dienstes keine Tausende von Userprofilen mit sensiblen Daten zu erbeuten, sondern nur wertlose peer to peer connects. Dadurch entstehen mehr Privatsphäre und Eigenverantwortung über die persönlichen Daten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allan steht: Der User kann und soll selbst entscheiden, wem er oder sie persönliche Daten zeigt und wofür. Voraussetzung dafür ist Interoperabilität und Portabilität der Identitäten. Diese Idee ist gewissermaßen der Kern von SSI. Doch die Aussage, dass ich als User die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe, wird oft missverstanden und ist in dieser Form falsch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ist SSI mit Klarnamenpflicht gleich zu setzen und verliere ich meine Anonymität?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welche Daten ein Dienst einfordert liegt beim Dienst und an den gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Ist der Dienstanbieter nicht an eine Klarnamenpflicht gebunden, also nicht verpflichtet einen Klarnamen abzufragen und zu überprüfen so kann er das auch nicht vom Nutzer einfordern (nach Datenschutzgrundverordnung). Tut er dies trotzdem, muss der Benutzer zustimmen und es muss ein konkreter Grund genannt werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso hat SSI nichts mit Blockchain zu tun?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI wird oft mit der Blockchain Technologie gleichgesetzt. Dadurch entsteht der Eindruck, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit Blockchain funktionieren kann. Das ist jedoch nicht der Fall. Wir haben eine umfassende Erklärung hier zusammengefasst: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we released a new version of Holochain Launcher with a lot of new features. I took it for a test run and I have to say… I'm excited. It feels like something my dad could actually use! The new Launcher is much more welcoming to non-technical users. I’m going to unbox it below, but first, the Holochain release notes for this week.</p> Holochain 0.0.139: Keystore version bump, simpler link CRUD <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131, 0.0.132<br>Compatible Lair version: 0.1.3</p><p>This release is another small one, albeit with a couple meaningful changes for devs and users:</p>  The compatible Lair keystore has been bumped to version 0.1.3 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1377">#1377</a>). This brings mostly documentation updates, but also fixes a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/all-agents-busy-please-stand-by/#holochain-00137">bug</a> involving spaces in Lair’s socket/pipe path (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">lair #91</a>) and gets more strict about the version of Lair that it intends to connect to (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/95">lair #95</a>).  The link CRUD functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now take any DHT hash that can be converted to a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/prelude/type.AnyLinkableHash.html">linkable hash</a>, rather than requiring you to convert it yourself. On the flip side, entry, header, and external hashes now have <code>Into&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> implementations to make this all possible. Surprisingly, this isn’t a breaking change, as it all happens in the HDK before getting sent to the host. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1365">#1365</a>)   Unboxing the user-friendly Launcher 0.4.4 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.132, 0.0.136</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>, it’s a user-friendly manager for running hApps. This will eventually be our end-user offering, and one of the primary ways you’ll be able to distribute web-based hApps to your users.</p><p>Version 0.4.4 is a huge jump toward the goal of user-friendliness, in a few ways:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a>, a built-in package manager that lets your users download and install hApps right from within the Launcher!  It supports multiple Holochain versions, which means that you don’t have to worry quite as much about whether your users have the right Launcher installed. It also means they also won’t have to perform any more factory resets and lose their data!  <p>Okay, let’s unbox this thing.</p> 1. First run <p>Here’s something new: When you start up Launcher 0.4.4 for the first time, there’s already a hApp running! It’s the first public preview of the new DevHub hApp. (I’ll talk more about that at the bottom of this Dev Pulse.)</p> 2. hApp Library <p>If you click on the ‘Install new app’ button, instead of getting a file dialog, you see the new App Library! It’s powered by the DevHub DNA, and it lets you download, install, and start a hApp with just a couple of clicks. Currently there’s only one hApp with a public release, called Notebooks, but it’s a fun one.</p> 3. Installing a hApp <p>As you can see, I didn’t have to hunt around for a hApp bundle file on the internet, and I didn’t have to hunt for the downloaded file on my device’s storage. The Launcher just downloaded Notebooks and showed me a simplified installation dialog. The membrane proof fields are hidden; all I have to do is change the hApp’s name if I feel like it.</p> 4. Behold, a newly installed hApp <p>Now I have two hApps, DevHub and Notebooks. They each require a different conductor version, but that’s no problem; you can see that Launcher started up 0.0136 automatically for me. Users probably won’t notice or care about this detail, but what it means for them is that It Just Works.</p> 5. Using Notebooks for the first time <p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a> is a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to HackMD or Google Docs. It’s built using a framework called <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a>, created by Eric Harris-Braun and his son last year. I’d like to say more about Notebooks, but for brevity’s sake I’ll say this: I was surprised by how delightful it was to use. The real-time editing experience is smooth and snappy, just like you’d expect from a cloud app. But I’m comforted by the knowedge that all the stuff I care about is on my machine!</p><blockquote>So, now that you’ve seen the new Launcher, why not <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.4">give it a try</a>? I invite non-developers to try it out too!</blockquote> DevHub public preview <p>So the other big news that got bundled with Launcher 0.4.4 is, of course, the first public preview of the DevHub hApp. It’s not ready for prime time yet (that will likely happen after the Stable Validation milestone) but I’m still excited by the possibilities it hints at.</p><p>So what is DevHub? If you’re a developer, it’s easiest to think of it as a package manager and distributed repository for hApps, built on Holochain. You can distribute releases of your zomes, DNAs, hApps, and web-based UIs for other developers to remix, or for users to download.</p><p>If you’re a user, it’s like an open-source hApp store or library. As we’ve seen, the Launcher can talk to the DevHub DNA natively, giving it the power to search, download, install, and update hApps.</p><p>The DevHub hApp comes with a web-based GUI that attempts to serve both devs and users. In the future, it will split into two GUIs — one specifically tailored to devs, and a user-focused ‘hApp store’ experience.</p><p>This demonstrates that you don’t have to use a hApp’s default UI — you can fork it, create your own, or even build it into a desktop app, as the Launcher’s native support demonstrates. This is what happens when an app’s API is totally accessible to you on your machine. It’s all under your control!</p> Unboxing the DevHub GUI <p>Now let’s take a look at this first iteration of the DevHub GUI. It’s being redesigned at the moment, but this will give you a taste of what the DNA is meant for.</p> 1. Main page <p>When you open up the GUI, you see a listing of hApp packages, sorted by date. You can get info on a package, add your own hApp, or choose instead to look at individual DNAs and zomes if you’re interested in remixing and creating your own hApp.</p> 2. hApp info page <p>Let’s take a look at the Notebooks listing. We can see some information about the hApp — what it’s for, how fresh it is, who wrote it, etc. Below that, you can see all the individual releases of the hApp.</p> 3. Release page <p>Let’s take a look at the 0.0.1 release of Notebooks. It was published on 9 May 2022, and we can see the changelog. To the right we can see the DNAs that comprise it — `syn` and `notebooks` — and download a headless `.happ` package or a full `.webhapp` package.</p><p>That’s all for now — once I learn more about DevHub I’d like to do a more in-depth study of what it can do!</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>To the ShareRing Community,</p>



<p>It’s been a tough few days for many people and we understand that the resulting challenges may be with us for quite some time. Transparency drives the core values of ShareRing, and we aim to maintain a level of consistency in being transparent with you, our community members who have supported us through the highs and lows.</p>



<p>As a company we have always strived to maintain consistent transaction fees, in particular when it is within our control. When external protocols are required in the transaction, it becomes more challenging to do so. The average cost of Ethereum transaction fees have risen exponentially over the last few days, and as a result we are going to temporarily increase the swap out fees from SLP3 to ERC20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swap out fees will be increased from 5000 SHR to 10,000 SHR. This takes effect immediately as of the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Our team closely monitors the market costs and we are always positioned to make the necessary adjustments to reflect the trends.</p>



<p>The ShareRing Community has always been the core of our business, and we endeavour to work through the challenges together, as a whole. Short term challenges prepare us for prospective growth and we look towards the shining light at the end of the tunnel, not just as a community and company, but the industry a whole.</p>



<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jonathon, </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The need for authentication standards 
<p>In the cybersecurity industry, many new technologies–particularly those related to identity management and authentication–are constantly driving change and innovation. Yet one thing remains the same: the use of passwords continues to pose a threat to an organization’s IT security. As long as passwords continue to be used, users and organizations will remain vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately, due to the development of new solutions and authentication standards, replacing passwords as the dominant form of authentication on the Internet now seems to be possible.</p>
<p>Various annual surveys demonstrate that password compromises are associated with 70-80% of data breaches. As a response to the over-reliance on passwords, the non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. With the help of the FIDO Alliance, a set of open, scalable, and interoperable specifications has been developed to replace passwords as a secure authentication method for online services. The alliance has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems.</p>
 <br>FIDO Alliance reveals its latest whitepaper 
<p>Most recently, the FIDO Alliance and the W3C WebAuthn working group published a whitepaper in March 2022 explaining how the introduction of multi-device FIDO credentials will enable FIDO technology to supplant passwords for many consumer use cases. The framework goes further by outlining two proposals for phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms:</p>
 
 Using your phone as a roaming authenticator: Essentially, this involves connecting the user's smartphone (which becomes the FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate via Bluetooth. Since Bluetooth requires physical presence, the use of proximity-based authentication should be resistant to any phishing attacks. As a result, the smartphone becomes a sort of smart card while providing the necessary FIDO requirements to the device from which the user is trying to authenticate. 
 
 
 Multi-device FIDO credentials: To improve user experience, the second proposal encourages FIDO authenticator vendors to adapt their authenticators in the event of lost or stolen devices. As users move from device to device, FIDO credentials should be available on a user’s new device without the need of implementing a password.&nbsp; For example, a smartphone, a desktop, and a USB token could act as a mutually exchangeable FIDO authenticator. 
 
<p>The whitepaper argues that the syncing of FIDO credentials, together with the Bluetooth alternative, allows FIDO authentication to be a secure and convenient solution for existing two-factor deployments. Furthermore, the paper makes it clear that the proposal is not a change in standards, but rather a set of prescriptions for vendors to implement themselves.</p>
<p><br>However, there is one crucial point that the FIDO and WebAuthn proposals seem to ignore. So far, the whitepaper has not specified whether users will feel comfortable with a password successor where the cloud operator has access to secret keys. If users roam enterprise-issued keys via potentially insecure clouds, organizations must understand the risks that come with convenience when syncing is not end-to-end secured.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it comes down to what end users will do and only time will tell if they are willing to trust<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless"> Microsoft</a>,<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/protect-gce-vms-with-managed-fido-security-keys"> Google</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos/">Apple</a> as the ultimate confidants of their organization's credentials.</p>
<p><br>In addition, if the deprovisioning of access within applications is not properly implemented, former employees might gain access to cloud-based applications when leaving an organization and returning their physical FIDO key. By not having proper controls in place, this new level of convenience will increase the risk and reduce the level of control an organization is able to exert.<br>Therefore, KuppingerCole believes that companies and other organizations that are looking to modernize and improve authentication solutions should understand the consequences beforehand. If done right, this solution has the potential to provide a frictionless user experience while improving security at the same time. We expect to see a significant number of FIDO authenticators, vendors, servers, and compatible web apps in industry over the course of the next few years.</p>

<p>Nel numero 57 del magazine <a href="https://www.impresacity.it/">IMPRESACITY</a>&nbsp; uscito lo scorso Aprile 2022, è possibile leggere un’intervista rilasciata da Carmine Auletta – CISO di InfoCert – all’interno dello speciale dedicato alla sanità digitale.</p>



<p>Nel corso di questi ultimi anni una serie&nbsp;di progetti innovativi, come&nbsp;l’invio digitale, certificato e sicuro, delle comunicazioni di inizio quarantena per Covid da parte dei medici di base ai propri assistiti&nbsp;o&nbsp;ancora, la raccolta del consenso informato dematerializzato dell’avvio della campagna vaccinale di inizio 2021 hanno contribuito in maniera forte alla digitalizzazione nel campo sanitario.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’obiettivo è giungere a una digitalizzazione completa di tutte le fasi dell’iter pre-intervento di un paziente per garantire ai cittadini maggiore efficienza e anche migliore qualità di comunicazione con le strutture sanitarie.”</p>Carmine Auletta, CISO di InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>Negli ultimi anni la sanità è stata oggetto di numerosi&nbsp;cambiamenti, dettati prima dalla pandemia e ora dagli investimenti in ambito Pnrr. In questo contesto numerose sono state le soluzioni digitali adottate nel campo sanitario, facendo sì che ad oggi la digitalizzazione della sanità risulti essere uno dei pilastri dei recovery plan di tutta Europa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>InfoCert è da sempre protagonista della digitalizzazione nel mondo Health Care grazie soprattutto a LegalCare e ProxySign, le soluzioni Trust studiate per la digitalizzazione dei processi&nbsp;di lavoro clinici e amministrativi e già adottate da importanti Aziende Sanitarie Italiane.&nbsp;</p>

 Ionic is a framework for building mobile apps with web technologies that look and act like native apps.
Because they’re built with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), you can also deploy your Ionic apps as single-page applications.
Or, even better, as progressive web apps (PWAs) that work offline.

<p>Ionic supports the big three web frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue.
Once you’ve written your app, you can deploy it to a simulator or device with <a href="https://capacitorjs.com/">Capacitor</a>.
Capacitor (pictured as the blue layer) provides the runtime for your app to communicate with the native operating system and vice versa.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>Ionic’s main competitors are native apps built with Swift or Objective-C (for iOS) and Java or Kotlin (for Android).
Ionic also competes with React Native, which uses web technologies and translates them to native components.</p>
 
 
<p>The Ionic blog has a recent post that <a href="https://ionicframework.com/blog/ionic-vs-react-native-performance-comparison/">does a performance comparison between Ionic and React Native</a>.
TL;DR: Both options will give you a high-performance app with a truly native look and feel.</p>

 What the heck is JHipster? 
 
 
<p>This tutorial will show you how to use Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor to build a mobile app that talks to a Spring Boot backend. It won’t take but a few minutes, thanks to JHipster!</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a> is an application generator that creates an Angular frontend and a Spring Boot backend based on the options you choose. It has the ability for you, as a developer, to customize what it generates with blueprints. The blueprints feature has resulted in many additional options for an app: Kotlin, Spring Native, Micronaut, Quarkus, .NET Core, NestJS, and Svelte.</p>
 
 
<p>Below is a diagram of the app you’ll create in this tutorial and its authentication flow.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 ✨ Introducing the JHipster Ionic blueprint! 
 
 
<p>The JHipster project has supported generating an Ionic app using a <code>generator-jhipster-ionic</code> module for the past several years.
As the primary maintainer of this module, I’m proud to announce that it has been re-written as a blueprint, and it’s much easier to understand now.
The previous module relied on the Ionic CLI, the base Angular <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/starters">starter</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/ionic-jhipster-starter">Ionic JHipster starter</a>, and custom code to glue it all together.
Now, the source code is all contained in one project.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/mshima">Marcelo Shima</a> volunteered to do the conversion, and after a couple of months, I’m proud to say the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-ionic">JHipster Ionic blueprint</a> is now available!</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Ionic for <a href="https://twitter.com/jhipster?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JHipster</a> v8 is now available! There's lots to love in this release:<br><br>💙 Now available as a blueprint<br>🧪 Migrated from Protractor to Cypress<br>⭐️ <a href="https://twitter.com/auth0?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Auth0</a> support<br>🅰️ Upgraded to Angular 13 and Ionic 6<br><br>✨ <a href="https://t.co/WQ6ZTsTkPP">https://t.co/WQ6ZTsTkPP</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ionic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ionic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/jhipster?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#jhipster</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/angular?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#angular</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/springboot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#springboot</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1523893356744609792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
<p>Create an <code>ionic-app</code> directory alongside your JHipster app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- backend
- ionic-app</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Navigate into <code>ionic-app</code> using your terminal.
Install Ionic for JHipster and create a new app using <code>jhipster-ionic</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-ionic
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted for the location of your JHipster app, a name for your Ionic app, and then you’ll be off to the races!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also create a JHipster app and an Ionic app simultaneously by using the bundled JHipster.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir bug-tracker &amp;&amp; cd bug-tracker
jhipster-ionic jdl bug-tracker.jh
cd ../ionic4j</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will follow the same convention where the generated backend and frontend apps are side-by-side on your hard drive.</p>
 
 
<p>Then you can run both apps from your Ionic app using easy-to-remember commands.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal window
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 






The JHipster Ionic blueprint currently only supports Angular.
Now that it’s a blueprint, it will be much easier to add support for Vue and React.
If you’re interested in helping out, please let me know!
Okta is a platinum sponsor of the JHipster project and enjoys assigning <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%24%24+bug-bounty+%24%24%22">bug bounties</a> for feature development.



 
 
 
 
 Build a mobile app with Ionic and Angular 
 
 
<p>To see Ionic + JHipster in action, let’s start with a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">Full Stack Java + React app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>.
I updated the app to the latest version of JHipster (v7.8.1) and created an Ionic app with JHipster Ionic, so everything is guaranteed to work.
This Flickr clone allows you to upload photos, tag them, and organize them into albums.
First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example.git \
  jhipster-ionic --depth 1
cd jhipster-ionic/backend</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start the app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker
./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser.
Sign in with <code>admin/admin</code> credentials and rejoice when it all works.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window and enter the <code>jhipster-ionic/ionic-app</code> directory.
Install its dependencies and run <code>npm start</code> to test the Ionic client.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to sign in and add a new photo.</p>
 

  
    
    
  
  
    
    
  

 
<p>Please keep reading to learn how JHipster made all of this possible.
Or, skip ahead to <a>run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 How to integrate Ionic and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>JHipster makes it easy to create a Spring Boot API that Spring Security protects.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint generates an Ionic client that talks to your Spring Boot API and understands its auth mechanism.
I created the <code>jhipster-ionic</code> project using the following steps:</p>
 
 
<p>Install the JHipster Ionic blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster-ionic@8.0.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a parent directory to hold everything:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># take is a shortcut for mdkir &amp;&amp; cd
take jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Clone an existing JHipster Flickr example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git backend --depth 1</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new directory to hold your Ionic project, then run <code>jhipster-ionic</code> in it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take ionic-app
jhipster-ionic</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Provide the path to your backend JHipster app and name your app <code>flickr2</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>That’s it!
The blueprint will generate an Ionic client, complete with screens for editing entities, unit tests, and end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
<p>Pretty slick, don’t you think?!
😎</p>
 
 
 Run your Spring Boot API 
 
<p>You’ll need to start your backend first, so your Ionic app can talk to its API.
First, start Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker containers:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd backend
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # starts Keycloak and PostgreSQL in Docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, update <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> to allow CORS from <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100'
    allowed-methods: '*'
    allowed-headers: '*'
    exposed-headers: 'Authorization,Link,X-Total-Count,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-alert,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-error,X-${jhipster.clientApp.name}-params'
    allow-credentials: true
    max-age: 1800</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start the backend app using <code>./mvnw -Pprod</code>.
You should be able to log in at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> (with <code>admin/admin</code>) and add new photos using Entities &gt; Photos.
Add a few photos so you have some data to work with.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app 
 
<p>Open another terminal and navigate to the <code>ionic-app</code> folder.
Launch your Ionic client using  <code>npm start</code>.
In your default browser, the app will be opened at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in with Keycloak and see all the listed entities in your app.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>In the JHipster app’s tutorial, there’s a section where you’re instructed to remove photo fields that can be calculated.
Specifically, height, width, date taken, and date uploaded.
These values are calculated when the photos are uploaded, so there’s no reason to display them when adding a photo.</p>
 
 
<p>To add this same functionality to your Ionic app, modify <code>src/app/pages/entities/photo/photo-update.html</code> and wrap these fields with <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;div *ngIf="!isNew"&gt;
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label position="floating"&gt;Height&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-input type="number" name="height" formControlName="height"&gt;&lt;/ion-input&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
  ...
  &lt;ion-item&gt;
    &lt;ion-label&gt;Uploaded&lt;/ion-label&gt;
    &lt;ion-datetime displayFormat="MM/DD/YYYY HH:mm" formControlName="uploaded" id="field_uploaded"&gt;&lt;/ion-datetime&gt;
  &lt;/ion-item&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The Ionic CLI will auto-compile and reload the app in your browser when you save this file.
You can prove everything works as expected by stopping your app (with Ctrl+C) and running all the end-to-end tests with Cypress.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on iOS using Capacitor 
 
 
<p>Generate a native iOS project with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic build
npx ionic capacitor add ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add your custom scheme (<code>dev.localhost.ionic</code>) to <code>ios/App/App/Info.plist</code>.
This scheme is configured in <code>src/environments/environment.ts</code>; you can easily change it to something else if you like.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.getcapacitor.capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;dev.localhost.ionic&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings (in <code>backend/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code>) to allow <code>capacitor://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app.
Deploy your Ionic app to iOS Simulator and run it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run ios</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Confirm you can log in and rejoice in your success!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Run your Ionic app on Android 
 
 
<p>Generate an Android project with Capacitor.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx ionic capacitor add android</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Enable clear text traffic and add <code>dev.localhost.ionic</code> as a scheme in <code>android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;activity ... android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"&gt;
  &lt;!-- You'll need to add this intent filter so redirects work --&gt;
  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt;
    &lt;data android:scheme="dev.localhost.ionic" /&gt;
    &lt;!--data android:scheme="com.okta.dev-133337" /--&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;

  &lt;intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" /&gt;
    &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" /&gt;
  &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
&lt;/activity&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the JHipster app’s CORS settings to allow <code>http://localhost</code> as an origin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  ...
  cors:
    allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:8100,capacitor://localhost,http://localhost'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your backend app and run your Ionic app on Android using the Capacitor CLI:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npx cap run android</code> 
 
 
 






If you get an error when running this command, make sure to use Java 11.



 
 
<p>You’ll need to run a couple of commands to allow the emulator to communicate with JHipster and Keycloak.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in and edit entities, just like you can in a browser and on iOS!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Why use OpenID Connect for mobile apps? 
 
 
<p>Storing <a>API keys and secrets in mobile apps is not safe</a>.
OAuth 2.0 solves this problem by not shipping any secrets in mobile apps and instead involving the user in the process of getting an access token into the app.
These access tokens are unique per user, and they’re updated every time the user logs in.
The <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE extension</a> provides a solution for securely doing the OAuth flow on a mobile app even when there is no pre-provisioned secret.</p>
 
 
<p>If you need to access an API from a mobile app, hopefully, it supports OAuth and PKCE!
Thankfully most of the hard work of PKCE is handled by SDKs like <a href="https://appauth.io/">AppAuth</a>, so you don’t have to write all that code yourself.
If you’re working with an API like Okta, then Okta’s SDKs do PKCE automatically, so you don’t have to worry about it.
The JHipster Ionic blueprint uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic-appauth">Ionic AppAuth</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The previous sections showed you how to use Keycloak as your identity provider. If you’re deploying to production, you might not want to manage your users and authentication system. That’s where Okta and Auth0 can help!</p>
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Okta 
 
<p>If you don’t have an Okta developer account, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up for one</a> or run <code>okta register</code> after installing the Okta CLI.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to change your JHipster app to use Okta, the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> makes this as easy as <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>.
This command creates a <code>.okta.env</code> file you can source to override the default Keycloak settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env
./mvnw -Pprod</code> 
 
 
 
<p>With Keycloak, you don’t need a separate OIDC app for Ionic.
With Okta, you do.
See JHipster’s documentation to learn <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-okta">how to create a native app for Ionic on Okta</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>After you’ve changed the client ID in your Ionic app, run it using <code>npm start</code>.
You’ll be prompted to log in using your Okta credentials at <code>http://localhost:8100</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 Switch your identity provider to Auth0 
 
<p>To switch your identity provider to Auth0, you first need an <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Auth0 account</a>.
Then, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file and see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#auth0">JHipster’s Auth0 docs</a> for how to populate it.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-auth0">configure a native app for Ionic on Auth0</a>.
Once you’re finished updating your Ionic app with a new client ID and audience, you should be able to run your backend and new frontend client using the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .auth0.env
npm run backend:start
# open a new terminal
npm start</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To see it in action on your mobile emulators, use the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run build

# iOS
npx cap run ios

# Android
npx cap run android</code>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about Ionic and the new Ionic blueprint for JHipster.
In my opinion, it’s pretty neat that you can rapidly prototype a mobile client for your JHipster.
It’s even better that you can use a leading-edge mobile application framework to do it.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example">@oktadev/okta-jhipster-ionic-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Silicon Salon</a>, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage with physical countermeasures — and CrossBar is interested in bringing that to digital-asset management. The second is Tropic Square, whose tropic01 secure element offers a fully transparent and auditable chip as a basis for better hardware security. They use transparency as a driver for innovation.</p>

<p>Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to bringing together a community of developers and manufacturers to jointly develop specifications that will empower the entire industry, we’ve seized upon our work with these two companies to produce our first salon since the pandemic: a virtual Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and other interested parties can come together to talk about the next generation of semiconductors, which for the first time ever will be specialized for our cryptographic needs.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is scheduled for June 1st, running three hours beginning at 9am PT (noon ET, 6pm CET). Signups for the Salon are now available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Eventbrite</a>, with tickets limited to the first 40 participants.</p>



<p>The first hour of the Salon will feature presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality. Companies CrossBar, Tropic Square, and Proxy and experts Bryan Bishop and Christopher Allen are all scheduled to talk.</p>

<p>The other two hours of the Salon will feature facilitated discussion of topics intended to determine the needs of the hardware-wallet community. Specific topics may include: the importance of MCU and secure enclave integration; the importance of secure and persistent storage; the need for physical countermeasures; the advantages of hardware and software cryptography; the use of open licenses for hardware; and discussions of how new semiconductor designs intended for cryptography can improve security and efficiency. We don’t have all the answers: one of the most important goals of the salon is to find out the needs and thoughts of the community!</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">join us</a> to learn a bit about what’s already going on and to share your ideas, requirements, and expertise!</p>

<p>We are limiting the number of attendees to allow for Q&amp;A from the community, thus we are charging US$25 to hold a space at this unique virtual event. So <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">sign up</a> soon! If you are already a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/sponsors.html">Patron</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">monthly sponsor on Github</a> of Blockchain Commons, please check your email: we will be sending you a free invite code automatically.

  <p>The third iteration of the Web, Web 3, aims to put more control over web content in users’ hands. It promises to be built on blockchain, eliminating all big intermediaries, including centralized governing bodies. The vision for a Web3 world is for people to control their own data and be able to bounce around from social media to email to shopping using a single personalized account, creating a public record on the blockchain of all of that activity. What does this mean from an identity management point of view? We will explore some important questions that should be addressed as the future of the internet unfolds, including the impact that limited oversight in crypto currency will have, including poor authentication; the role of decentralized identities and private key management; and finally, the privacy aspects of having transaction data on the blockchain and what that means for attackers that can potentially compile new identities or further identity theft as we know it today. Whether it is Web3 or beyond, these issues will be critical to build trust on the internet of the future.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-zelazny-identity-management-web-3"></a>

  <p>For the last 30 years  virtually every  company, agency and organization has been forced to accept the risks associated with identity management and control for third parties and  all  the other identities that  are not  directly addressed by today's workforce or customer access management solutions. The universe of  "all other identities"  is enormous, numbering in the billions and  maybe even the trillions of distinct and unique identities. In the absence of solutions and processes to actively manage and control the identities of contractors, service providers, agencies, franchisees and  all  the possible variations of people,  devices  and entities that your organization interacts with, accepting risk but not being able to  mitigate  it has been the normal course of business. It is past time that these risks are acknowledged,  addressed,  and mitigated. Richard Bird explains the current state of third and n-th party identity risk, how to recognize it and what to do about it in this presentation on a new frontier in security and risk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bird-identities-risk"></a>

  <p>Two decades of digital transformation and cloud migration have been slowly eroding the traditional network perimeter and with the past two years of transition to more remote work, the walls have come tumbling down. Privileged credentials from access tools (like VPN and RDP) that have been left on endpoints are a valuable target for attack. SAAS applications and Cloud access further expand the proliferation of potentially exposed identities. Once an attacker establishes initial access it becomes trivial for lateral attack movement to take control over critical systems or the entire network. The network perimeter is obsolete. Identity is the new perimeter. Organizations must discover, mitigate and protect their identity risks.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-halbartschlager-identity-perimeter"></a>

  <p>We are in the mid of one of the most significant revolutions in the cloud and identity ecosystem since the last decade. With the dynamic transformation from Web2.0 to Web3.0, both the cloud as well as the identity ecosystem embrace themselves for a change in the way we perceived security. Blockchain is revolutionizing both the cloud industry as well as the financial sectors. In my talk, I will focus on the transformative impact of blockchain protocols like Filecoin and Storj which are playing a significant role in changing the way we have perceived cloud storage. Decentralized Cloud Storage will be the future for sustainable data storage in Web 3.0, in which we will move from a single service provider to create an ecosystem where anybody could be a cloud storage provider. Highly successful blockchain projects like Filecoin have been able to create such an ecosystem. But we are far away from attending the level of scale needed to reach out to every corner of the globe. Decentralized Cloud Storage poses a different set of security challenges and scalability issues. I will be presenting my research work which focuses on the new advances in tackling future security threats for decentralized cloud storage. Additionally, I will focus on discussing how to overcome scalability issues in the blockchain using the most advanced cryptographical tools knowns as zk-SNARKs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-kundu-decentralized-cloud"></a>

   Gaia-X Federation Services is a European project that promotes innovation through data sharing and represents the next generation of the data infrastructure ecosystem. To see how we bring about an open, transparent, and secure digital ecosystem, we thus share a practical example and working code of the Gaia-X for the Notarization API. 
 
 The aim of this product is to establish digital trust in disclosed data (paper or electronic) for Gaia-X participants to use in the Gaia-X ecosystem. To reach this goal, an issuance module to transform data into digital verifiable credential (VC) is needed. With this component, certification institutions such as government, lawyers, etc. are able to prove the identity and provide data of any organization that desires to be a Gaia-X participant. Thus deliver the desired verified attestation as a digital representation. 
 
 This use case on enterprise identity is an example of a contribution to the meta-platform concept: a platform that enables and fosters participant-controlled value transfer across and among other platforms and participants. An open, interoperable, portable, decentralized identity framework is thus a prime candidate for becoming such a meta-platform and for leveraging this aggregate network effect. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-stoecker-enterprise-identity-eu-gaia-x"></a>

<p>Two of the most prominent initiatives in the digital identity space right now are 1. the digital Permanent Resident Card use case supported by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and 2. the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) with its various pilot projects.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will look at the "Transatlantic SSI Interop" experiment conducted by an EU company (Danube Tech) and a US company (Digital Bazaar) that shows how such different initiatives can connect and interoperate.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-sabadello-transatlantic-ssi-interoperability"></a>

While new forms of ID verification are most prevalent today with Financial Services as a means of performing Know-Your-Customer regulations, there is nascent adoption across other industry verticals. In this session, the speakers will demonstrate an open standard based approach to ID verification based on verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers for remote onboarding across industries. With this new approach users can verify their identity once and use their credentials with any organization. Enterprises can leverage this simpler cost-saving approach to remotely onboard employees, partners and customers compliantly while respecting the end users’ privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-patel-remote-onboarding-verifiable-credentials"></a>

Indeed, before transitioning to a fully decentralized ecosystem, standard enterprise IAM solutions and canonical IGA disciples will need to adapt and integrate verifiable credentials. This talk will explore the hybrid decentralization paradigm, offering pointers and insights into the uncontestable evolutionary needs of enterprises. After all, industry IAM solutions must evolve to include VCs issuing and verification capabilities to fully embrace the trustless trust paradigm while retaining complete control of authorization flows.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-zago-hybrid-identtiy-ssi"></a>

Of course, this raises the question of suitable methodologies and tools. At the same time, the strategic orientation of the company must be included in this security strategy. We have also learned in the recent past that attacks like the “Solarwinds Hack” are becoming more and more sophisticated and that the attackers now focus on the entire value chain. What tools are there, and where should they be used? How can I start tomorrow to prepare myself for the future against the challenges of cyber attacks?

  <p>HTTP is an amazingly powerful protocol, and it's the lifeblood of the internet today. On the surface, it seems to be a simple protocol: send a request to a server and get back a response, and everything's structured in useful ways. HTTPS adds the TLS protocol to secure the connections between endpoints, protecting the messages with encryption and keeping them away from attacker's eyes. But what if you want to be sure the sender is the right sender, and what you see is what they sent? What if you've got a more complex deployment, with proxies and gateways in between your endpoints that mess with the contents of the message? What if you need assurances on the response as well as the request, and to tie them together? People have been trying to sign HTTP messages in various ways for a long time, but only recently has the HTTP Working Group picked up the problem. Come hear about the HTTP Message Signatures work from the draft specification's authors and see how it works, how to apply it, and talk about how it could change how we use the web.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-richer-http-message-signatures"></a>

  <p>SSI and Verifiable Credentials are the latest development in identity management. They offer many benefits over existing federated identity management systems. Unfortunately some proponents of SSI are mandating that companies implement decentralised identifiers (DIDs) and blockchains in order to benefit from SSI. This is not necessary. In fact the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Recommendation makes it clear that DIDs are not needed for verifiable credentials, and vice versa. DIDs and blockchains are something of a ball and chain around the legs of companies that want to benefit from SSI when leveraging their existing web based security infrastructures. This keynote talk will describe how it is possible to build standards compliant high performance, user friendly, SSI systems using the World Wide Web, Transport Layer Security, Jason Web Tokens, Web Authentication and X.509 public key certificates, allowing them to experience all the benefits of SSI without the ball and chain impediments of DIDs and blockchains. - the benefits of SSI over existing identity management systems - the downsides of DIDs and blockchains - the upsides of using existing World Wide Web infrastructure to build your SSI solution</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-chadwick-implementing-ssi"></a>

  <p>David will talk aboout a new technology that allows the person owning a public key to prove that they have memorized a passphrase, from which they could at any time easily compute the private key.<br>One example use is for votexx.org elections, which are conducted remotely without polling places. The ballot-casting in such elections is done by a signature that is publicly verifiable as corresponding to a particular public key posted in advance by the election authority. The voter registration authority would require a proof that the voter knows the corresponding passphrase and hence ensures that the voter has irrevocable access to the private key corresponding to the posted public key. This lets the voter give all of their keys (in an extreme case) to a vote buyer and/or coercer – while the voter is never able to give up knowledge of the passphrase and the ability that it confers to secretly cancel any vote made with the corresponding private key. This is just one example David will feature in his presentation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-chaum-credentials-privacy"></a>

  <p>Mergers and acquisitions amongst large, globally-distributed organizations are notoriously complex, error-prone, and resource consuming. But did you know that merging smaller organizations comes with its own set of unique issues and risks? One year ago, Okta announced its acquisition of Auth0. Since then, the combined forces of their internal business systems teams have been working hard to bring the identity and compliance capabilities of the organizations together. The union of these two companies introduced some novel challenges- even for veteran practitioners with experience in IAM mergers at much larger organizations. In this talk Jon Lehtinen will take you on a guided tour of the Okta/Auth0 identity merger from a practitioner’s perspective, and share the learnings, the challenges, and the recommendations for other practitioners tasked with merging the IAM programs within smaller, high-growth companies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-lehtinen-identity-m-and-a"></a>

Both the opportunities to strengthen digital rights and decentralise identity, along with the very real threats that exploit digital trust. Understanding the weaknesses provides a window into the next wave of identity and security innovation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-dow-omniverse-swot"></a>

New technologies like Privacy-ABC based on ZKP were ready to provide the user with control over how much personal data he wants to disclose, while promising, commercial solutions were neither accepted by the market nor solving the problem of reliability of transactions exhaustively. Today, the new decentralized digital identity model of Self-Sovereign Identity, utilizing verifiable credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, is giving new hope of finding sustainable solutions. This session will map out the main questions around privacy within this context:</p>
 
 What are the privacy pros and cons of a blockchain-based identity management system based on an “European Digital Identity Wallet”? 
 What are key pain points of the emerging "European Autonomous Identity Framework" (ESSIF) compatibility with GDPR? Is there “enough privacy” in eIDAS 2.0? 
 How can one trust that the entity issuing the credentials is in fact the entity that it claims to be?

<p>In traditional banking, to get a loan, make a deposit or speak to a banker, customers have usually traveled to a physical branch.</p>
 
<p>But today, more banking services are available digitally. As a complement to existing online banking services, innovators are building the new and improved financial experiences that consumers are looking for. These innovators may not even have a brick-and-mortar presence, but they add multiple layers of value on top of existing financial services.</p>
 
<p>The digital movement is giving customers more tools and options to build their financial lives in the way they see fit, and Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) is making this possible. Customers can now turn to innovators who offer niche financial services that cater to their unique needs, creating new ways for them to split dinner bills, take out a microloan, invest in crypto, track spending, saving and more.</p>
 
<p>But creating a new fintech company, app or product has not been simple. The traditional path to creating financial services was a long, hard road, from getting a banking license to building a new tech stack. Synctera is one fintech that offers an easier on-ramp to new, innovative financial products through BaaS. BaaS platforms and technology solutions provide the building blocks necessary for a fintech or neobank to quickly start creating innovative financial use cases for the modern consumer.</p>
 
<p>Synctera acts as a fintech banking platform, connecting a fintech builder with a community bank that has the requisite banking license. On the development side, Synctera provides an end-to-end toolkit, offering the critical technology services and providers that help innovators build their ideas. This includes consumer-permissioned data for account verification through Mastercard’s open banking platform, to help bring financial service ideas like quick money movement to life.</p>
 Modularizing banking solutions 
<p>All the things an entrepreneur needs in order to offer a banking service—including the ability to accept deposits, make loans and payments — BaaS service providers like Synctera encapsulate into the application programming interface (API) as modular blocks, so a fintech can tap in and build new solutions. Whether it’s issuing cards, sending ACH payments or more basic financial operations, developers can take these blocks and reassemble them to meet their needs.</p>
 
<p>The key to building with a BaaS provider is having just one API that’s simple to connect to. This reduces architecture and modeling requirements on the fintech development side. These tools allow fintechs to set up new customer accounts without delays from microdeposits, using instant verification, enabling customers to connect their external accounts and transfer funds into new financial services faster.</p>
 
<p>Another advantage of BaaS: Since multiple solutions are offered in the same API, it’s easy to make changes. If a company that’s scaling up tries an account authentication solution that’s slow and not quickly verifying that customer accounts are funded, they can replace it seamlessly with an alternate solution. That means less disruption to operations; money can keep moving.</p>
 Offering a marketplace of options 
<p>BaaS wraps all of its services, including those developed in-house and those from outside developers, into one API marketplace to make it easy for fintechs to launch everything together. Instead of trying to integrate tech from multiple financial services partners, a fintech developer can come to a BaaS provider like Synctera and build more, with less overhead and less plumbing.</p>
 
<p>Working with a BaaS provider allows fintech builders to focus more on the features of the product they’re offering to customers, like offering a virtual storefront to artists, discounted pet insurance to pet owners or easier access to small business capital. The marketplace solution means a fintech could choose a waterfall approach; if one solution fails, the system can be set up to automatically try another one.</p>
 How Mastercard fits in 
<p>Consumer-permissioned financial data can also be piped into BaaS solutions. Mastercard’s open banking platform provides secure connections to consumer-permissioned financial data from 95% of bank deposit accounts in the U.S. This data can power use cases like credit decisioning, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/digital-account-opening-report/">account opening</a> and linking. It creates more choice in <a href="https://www.finicity.com/payment-open-banking-effect/">payments</a> and transaction data for better financial insights.</p>
 
<p>Every fintech product needs financial data, the ability to manage consumer permission and to access those accounts. It’s one thing to have a customer knock on your door. It’s another to help them walk through the door without unnecessary obstacles blocking their way, and to make the first deposit into their new accounts happen quickly and compliantly.</p>
 
<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data to power the tools that Synctera and other BaaS providers and innovators create. By using account verification and transaction data from Mastercard’s open banking platform, all ecosystem players can authenticate users and get them online fast, and in a compliant manner.</p>
 Fraud detection and speed are of utmost importance 
<p>Understandably, the risk, compliance and customer experience balance is delicate–efficiency can’t compromise fraud prevention. By adding open banking data to the BaaS platform, financial service providers can verify and access bank account data with instant account verification, helping to ensure that the person opening a new account actually owns the account they are linking to the new fintech app, before moving money.</p>
 
<p>Speed is another top concern for fintech builders. And since banks are not tech companies, many operate on pre-internet tech. COBOL, a programming language developed in 1959 that underpins many banking systems, can make it difficult to upgrade systems quickly, or to seamlessly connect with today’s technology. This can result in a speed mismatch between banking networks and the world of fintechs, who want to be able to release new products and services in a few weeks. Mastercard helps connect customer accounts quickly and speeds up the customer onboarding process.</p>
 
<p>There’s a lot of new and improved technology being created in the world of financial services, and more options for developers result in more next-gen products that help consumers on their financial journeys.</p>

  Identity Wallet&nbsp;– A user-controlled local data store that safeguards a Sudo’s decentralized identity identifier (DID), cryptographic keys, verifiable credentials, and other artifacts for use with issuers, verifiers, public ledgers, and other third parties. The wallet supports multiple devices, cloud backup and recovery.  



  Mobile Agent&nbsp;– Usually an app that lets users interact with the Identity Wallet, as well as enabling various external activities, such as interacting with any standards-based public ledger, streamlining the login process to accounts and services, providing end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer interaction, assisting users with the request and presentation of verifiable credentials, and more.  



  DI Relay&nbsp;– The DI Relay (i.e., decentralized identity relay)&nbsp;provides mobile agents with an&nbsp;always onconnection point that facilitates user-to-user and user-to-service communications. Without an always on relay, mobile agents wouldn’t be able to communicate reliably with each other.  



  Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;– The Sudo Platform issuer service&nbsp;can create verifiable credentials. The issuer service first registers a credential definition on the blockchain which references an existing schema as well as registers the issuer service’s DID and public key.&nbsp;<br><br>Using their mobile agent, a user can request a verifiable credential from the issuer service. The new credential will be securely transmitted to the user’s mobile agent, which will secure it in the user’s identity wallet.<br><br>Additionally, via their mobile agents, users can present their verifiable credentials to a verifier, including the Sudo Platform’s verifier service. The user will be prompted to approve (or deny) presenting all of the requested verifiable credential claims, just some claims, or may even elect to only provide zero knowledge proof.<br><br>  Encrypted Messaging (end-to-end)&nbsp;– Whether used for user-to-user, user-to-service, or service-to-service communication, messages are encrypted end-to-end using peer-to-peer connections secured using the DIDComm protocol.  



 



<p>Next week, in part 4, we’ll outline the benefits to enterprises from proactively adopting decentralized identity.</p>

 A deep dive into the current state of crypto regulation, the FATF Travel Rule, and how our recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue. <p>On May 4th at 11:00 am EST, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> launched the debut edition of the Unhosted Webinar Series, with 80 attendees joining. It was presented by Shyft Network and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope’s </a>Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory and Compliance Solutions, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">Malcolm&nbsp;Wright</a>.</p><p>The webinar’s theme was the current state of crypto regulation, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">FATF Travel Rule</a>, and how Shyft Network’s recently-launched solution, Veriscope, has solved the unsolvable: the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.</p><p>We’ve also done a short re-cap of the key themes and challenges discussed in the&nbsp;Webinar:</p> FATF Recommendations on Virtual&nbsp;Assets <p>Financial Action Task Force, the global anti money-laundering &amp; terrorism financing watchdog, has made recommendations to prevent the use of virtual assets in illicit activities. Countries are required to adopt these recommendations within a definite period of time, which will then become a guideline for the industry to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>After countries implement FATF recommendations, the global watchdog will make periodic assessments on the implementation of the guidelines. Countries that fail to receive satisfactory scores on various parameters can be penalized by FATF, which can affect their financial standing globally and impact their ability to obtain funding from external sources, such as the World Bank and the&nbsp;IMF.</p> The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The Travel Rule is the most crucial recommendation on virtual assets issued, to date, by FATF. It was adopted in June 2019 when FATF issued draft guidelines. Then, during the first (June 2020) &amp; second (June 2021) assessments, FATF found that countries and industries are still not following its recommendations. Then, in October 2021, FATF issued its final guidelines on virtual assets &amp; Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).</p><blockquote>Under the Travel Rule, both originator and beneficiary VASPs must store and exchange certain personally identifiable information, such as the customer’s name, wallet address, location, national ID number, and DOB. They must also present the information to authorities when requested.</blockquote> Risk of Sanctions <p>Although Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and blockchain analytics are among the must-have tools that VASPs should have to ensure sanctioned parties cannot find a way around sanctions through virtual assets, they aren’t enough to mitigate the sanctions risk.</p><p>To fully comply with the FATF recommendations, it is crucial to know both parties involved in the transaction, which requires the implementation of the Travel Rule. Failing to comply with FATF recommendations can result in sanctions from authorities, which can yield devastating results.</p><p>To mitigate the risks, ensure GeoIP monitoring, proper KYC with name screening, implement blockchain analytics, and Travel Rule. Following these steps enables businesses with a significant amount of business volume outside their jurisdiction to have a solid defense against any potential sanction violation.</p> The Challenges  1. Poor Data&nbsp;Accuracy <p>Receiving incomplete or inaccurate data from the originator or beneficiary VASPs can result in significant challenges, such as increased customer support &amp; compliance costs, failed payments, and poor customer experience.</p><blockquote>Shyft Network’s Veriscope has implemented automated discovery of counterparty VASP through the token’s address to solve this problem. Also, Veriscope has automated exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) of both originator and beneficiary to ensure 100% accuracy.</blockquote> 2. Data&nbsp;Security <p>Storing PII on Travel Rule Service Provider’s (TRSP) infrastructure can result in internal and external hacking attacks, intermediaries meddling in and snooping on the data, and malicious actors exploiting the entire process to obtain counterparty PII by submitting fake transactions. There are also challenges to storing PII without user&nbsp;consent.</p><blockquote>The solution? Veriscope. It offers data security through three measures.</blockquote><blockquote>(i) User consents every time before PII is&nbsp;shared.</blockquote><blockquote>(ii) PII is encrypted and off-chain to prevent malicious actors from accessing the user&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>(iii) The transmission of PII data between VASPs is through peer-to-peer mode only, which means Shyft Network does not handle PII at any point in&nbsp;time.</blockquote> 3. Know Your VASP&nbsp;(KYV) <p>Opting for just any average TRSP comes with a fair share of challenges. First, all data that a VASP relies on is collected by the TRSP; with such TRSPs, there is no option to choose a counterparty VASP. Then, there is the issue of inaccurate VASP discovery, as it may fail to capture granular data at the entity&nbsp;level.</p><blockquote>Veriscope’s design mechanism enables it to solve these complex problems swiftly. It ensures that PII data is sent to the correct VASP entity and that the network participants have undergone due diligence at internationally recognized standards. It is also highly scalable and can easily accommodate the growing needs of both legal and operational teams.</blockquote> 4. Payment Screening <p>The usual approach to obtaining beneficiary data is to collect the information from the originator. There are several issues with this approach. For instance, such data can be incomplete or inaccurate, further complicating screening efforts. It can even lead to higher exposure to sanctions risk.</p><blockquote>Veriscope has implemented a mechanism that mandates obtaining beneficiary data from the beneficiary VASP. Shyft Network’s approach ensures that the data is accurate and complete, resulting in efficient name screening. That’s not all, as it also enables VASPs to request any additional information through the RFFI&nbsp;process.</blockquote> Sunrise Problem: A Major Roadblock in Implementing the Travel Rule&nbsp;(Recap) <p>The most significant problem that VASPs face in implementing Travel Rule is the Sunrise issue. The problem is that countries have adopted or will adopt the Travel Rule into local regulations at different times. Thus, most VASPs located in jurisdictions that have not yet adopted the Travel Rule are unlikely to have a Travel Rule Solution and will issues for those VASPs who do have a Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Recent data suggests there are over 600 cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Depending on their jurisdiction, they may or may not have adopted the Travel Rule yet. That’s where the problem lies, as the countries that have adopted the Travel Rule may mandate compliance both domestically and internationally. So, a compliant VASP must obtain data from the counterparty VASP regardless of their compliance status. If the compliant VASP fails to comply with the rule, they may receive severe penalties.</p><p>Suppose a VASP based in a country that has adopted the FATF Travel Rule (VASP A) sends Requests for Information (RFI) to a VASP operating in a country yet to adopt the Travel Rule (VASP B) on day zero (April 1st, 2022). They may or may not provide the information. After all, they are not legally obligated to do so yet. But VASP B will want to respond after the country they are based in implements the regulations. Meanwhile, without the necessary information, how can VASP A be compliant? This problem is referred to as the sunrise&nbsp;problem.</p><p>So, what’s the solution here? Veriscope. Thanks to Veriscope’s Historic Look Back feature, whenever VASP B’s home country adopts the Travel Rule, they can sign up for the solution and access all the RFIs sent to them even before they were legally required to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Let’s say the VASP B joins six months after day zero (October 1st, 2022). They will see all the RFIs when they join and can respond to all of them. So, VASP A &amp; VASP B finally successfully exchanged the information required under the Travel Rule because of Shyft’s Veriscope.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shyft Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/z65MC5JkrG">Discord</a></p>

 From Start-up to Scale-Up: How Tokeny Prepared for Large-Scale Tokenization 
<p>Our solutions now become more scalable and flexible as we have our own indexer and nodes to interact with relevant data on the blockchain. This improvement eliminates any downtime for our services and enlarges our capacity to handle thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the Product Focus newsletter April &amp; May 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Scalability is one of our top priorities as we are working with large financial institutions with very high volumes anticipated. We regularly run intense scalability tests and a few months ago, we concluded that we should reduce our dependence on some third parties to provide faster and enterprise-grade solutions. This newsletter explains how we became more autonomous and scalable by running our own blockchain Indexer and nodes:</p>
 Blockchain data Indexer 
<p>In order to build the real-time cap table of token holders with fully accurate information, our <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> needs to&nbsp;scan and read the&nbsp;blockchain to index relevant transactions&nbsp;happening to the ERC-3643 tokens and ONCHAINIDs. Technically, it can be very challenging for complex operations, and tools like The Graph, the “Google for blockchains”, enables developers like us to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>However, in our testing, we encountered some upcoming limitations as the use of these third party tools and protocols can be slow and requires some manual procedures. Therefore,&nbsp;we decided to build our own Indexer technology, enabling automated token indexing that can be completed within minutes, without any downtime, for thousands of tokens in parallel.</p>
<p>Also, we realized that many Web3 applications were having trouble interacting with blockchain through third-party services,&nbsp; so we decided to improve this as well:</p>
 Blockchain connector (Remote Procedure Call)&nbsp; 
<p>A RPC is a set of protocols and interfaces that enables a software to&nbsp;interact with the blockchain, to read and write, similar to a website interacting with a server. In blockchain terms, a server is referred to as a node, a synced database of the blockchain. Most applications use Infura to do so; it provides RPCs and AWS-like services for nodes, so developers don’t need to build a RPC or manage their own nodes.</p>
<p>Due to Infura’s popularity, blockchain applications become less decentralized and it could become a single point of failure, such as the time it went down because of a service outage one week ago, causing many dApps, including MetaMask, to not function.</p>
<p>It became obvious to us that we had to run our own nodes and build our own RPC to provide better services for our customers. As a result, we have built a system that we can monitor, scale, and rapidly fix if needed.&nbsp;We even enabled switchable RPCs to keep the T-REX Platforms always available by monitoring the state of nodes to connect with functional nodes including our own nodes and third party nodes (e.g. Infura, Alchemy, …).</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>We are proud of our tech team, especially our DevOps Engineer Cyrille, Lead Core Developer José and Senior Full Stack Developer Mihalis, for their hard work to complete these improvements. We will continue pushing the limit to provide the most advanced, flexible and secure solutions for you.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: You might have heard of eIDAS before, especially if you are in the payment industry. But now in the recent years, the European Commission is working on a new version, eIDAS 2.0. We’re going to talk about that and especially from the perspective of Finland. We have a special guest who has been working in Finland. And our special guest today is Bo Harald.</p>
<p>He started his career in banking in the 1970s by promoting and building electronic banking, payments, and e-business services. He developed Nordea’s Electronic Banking and payments operation for 30 years, after which he started working with TietoEvry as the Head of Executive Advisors.</p>
<p>He has also served as the Chairman of the EU Expert Group on Electronic Invoicing, the Chairman of Mobey, Mobile Financial Services Forum, and has held and holds directorships in various companies and associations. He has been named as one of the most influential technologists of the 20th century by Institutional Investor, and has been awarded for advancing the Information Society by the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications.</p>
<p>Bo currently works as an independent advisor at Findy.fi, a Senior Advisor at the Finnish Council of Regulatory Impact Analysis, a Founder and Steering Committee member at MyData.org, and with the publicly funded, Real Time Economy programme.</p>
<p>Hello, Bo.</p>
<p>Bo Harald: Hello, and thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure, Bo. Thanks for joining us. And definitely, I want to hear all these very interesting things about eIDAS 2.0. So let’s start, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. We’d like to hear from your very extensive and varied background in banking and technology. Please tell us a bit more about your career journey – how everything until today working in the Finnish eIDAS 2.0 workgroups.</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, it’s a long ladder, and I want to call it a ladder. It started back in the late ’70s, when we developed the first versions of home banking, the PC banking in the very early 1980s for private customers at Union Bank of Finland, and nowadays Nordea. And also for SMEs long before internet. And the first step was obviously with payments, invoice payments, typically, bill payments. And then we moved on to put all banking services actually into e-banking before internet already. And so that was the first phase.</p>
<p>The second phase was about interconnecting bank customers, not only with payments, but also with e-identification, e-signatures, e-invoice and e-salary, for example. This was a very important step when you look at the benefits for society at large, you get the economy of trust the economic reuse, the economic repetition, the economy of scale, and all that.</p>
<p>And from here, when internet then came in the mid ’90s, we had already half a million people on e-banking in Finland. And we were the biggest bank in e-banking in the world, in absolute terms for many, many years, all the way to Nordea.</p>
<p>So from here, we established then the public-private real time economic programme, focusing very much on e-invoicing, accounting automation, real time income register for the tax authorities. And that’s what I tried to also promote when I was the Chairman for the EU Commission Expert Group.</p>
<p>The next phase, if I condense this ladder, was the MyData principles that started to grow out in 2016, putting the citizen in control of all of his or her data, naturally supported by the legal promise from GDPR in Europe. But we could see at that early stage that there was no practical way of getting this data to travel from the enterprises that had the legal obligation to send it and that’s where we started to look for a new solution in 2017 and ’18.</p>
<p>And there we could see that Self-Sovereign Identity and Trust over IP was the solution to go forward with. And we established this public-private Findy cooperative as the solution. And it was a real eye-opener and this is soon coming to eIDAS to see that we were able to solve the pressing need for being able to trade and issue non listed, unlisted shares.</p>
<p>And there you have this pretty tricky situation that you need to serve private shareholders, organisational shareholders, the issuer, the state, the trade registry, the banks, for payments, for trading, for settlement, for delivery, for keeping up the registers. But when you issued all of these parties, with the same generic wallets or fact wallets, we prefer to call them fact wallets – identity wallets is the other name for it. Then it was astonishingly easy to interconnect these parties – four coders, four months, and it worked like a dream.</p>
<p>So that’s when I got the eyes open for the eIDAS architecture needs. That’s the ladder. And actually, the ladder is important to understand that you should have all the ranks or the steps on it, you know, enabled to rise to the higher platforms in between. That was the path, my path.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, very, of course, been long, long journey and super interesting all the type of projects you have been involved. And now, you are working very heavily on eIDAS, especially this new version 2.0. If you can tell us about that but also tell us for the ones who are not so familiar, what is eIDAS? And then tell us the difference between the current eIDAS 1.0 and the new one, eIDAS 2.0.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0 are two entirely different things. eIDAS 1.0 failed. It was focusing on cross-border identification services with pretty stiff requirements. And there were two things missing that led to the failure – supply and demand. There is such a limited need for identifying citizens, organisations, cross-border. And in the Nordic countries, we already have extremely well-functioning identification services in place, mainly run by the banks in Finland, also teleoperators are involved, I think that may be the only country in the world where teleoperators are doing this as well. It’s good with competition.</p>
<p>But when you talk about eIDAS 2.0, it’s not a question of identification, it’s a question of identity. And that’s a totally different thing. You could say that the identity is built from credentials from all sorts of sources in the private sector, in the public sector, statements about your knowledge, your skills, your vaccinations, where you live. We’re disclosing as little as possible, thousands of different statements that build a person’s identity all the way to – you might call it a “digital twin”.</p>
<p>And, here, obviously, eIDAS 2.0 is promising that every European will get a wallet issued by qualified issuers, possibly also by the states, if needed. And these wallets are then the ones where you will get these credentials, statements, the verified data about you when you need it.</p>
<p>So that’s a big difference between eIDAS 1.0 and eIDAS 2.0. And obviously eIDAS 2.0 is an absolutely enormous opportunity for the economy at large on the one hand, and for building a real single digital market on the other hand.</p>
<p>Oscar: As you have mentioned wallets, earlier you mentioned fact wallets or identity wallets, does it already exist? Just to understand that concept better, could you describe how it would be in practice? Is there anything like that today so we can have an idea?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah. There are already wallets out there, pretty many, many versions of them actually. Obviously, Europe is working on trying to establish what kind of standards such a wallet should have, be it then an application in your mobile phone, which seems to be very much in focus now, mainly serving citizens, also, perhaps smaller enterprises.</p>
<p>But obviously, these kinds of applications or wallets, ID wallets or rather fact wallets, are also needed by larger organisations. And then the mobile application is not the solution, but an application, a computer or in the cloud. But obviously, all these wallets, be they then in a mobile or in a computer or in the cloud, should be interoperable by design. That’s the whole idea here.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, understanding now the, what is this new concept of eIDAS 2.0 based on identities that you say in wallets, tell us more about the opportunities that this new framework is going to provide for the future across Europe.</p>
<p>Bo: Yes, I’m very happy to see that the commission work is really embracing Self-Sovereign Identity, which is obviously the standard, and I can’t see any alternative to that. And in many, many countries already Trust Over IP stacks are the starting point like they are here in Finland, and have been already for five years.</p>
<p>And here, what will happen is that the data rights holder, you as a citizen, or you as working for a company, you are in the driver’s seat. You can go to a data source, public or private, and say, that now I have a life event of this sort, looking for a job, establishing a company, somebody has died in the near family, which is the most stressful life event, and thousands of other life events, and now I need the data from all of these, all relevant sources. And I have a wallet, and the wallet is helping me to find those sources. And then I get the data to my wallet. And then I go to a service provider of my choice, I have this data and you are specialising in this particular life event. If I need financing, it may be a bank. And could you please take care of the need.</p>
<p>And the beauty of this is these three parties, the data rights holder with the wallet, the source and the service provider do not need to be technically integrated, do not need to be technically integrated. Because in this infrastructure, the technical connection is handled in the infrastructure, which is very cheap to build, of course, it needs rulebooks. And that’s the whole beauty of it.</p>
<p>Obviously, this infrastructure, we call it the data highway here in Finland is used both by the public sector and the private sector. That’s a no brainer, like a road is open to everyone to use. And it should obviously be a non-profit organisation that handles this. That’s why we have established this in the cooperatives to do that. So that’s how it works. And it’s not that difficult to understand, actually.</p>
<p>The benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity are absolutely enormous to reducing risk and friction in the economy at large. It’s of course, improving automation. It’s protecting privacy like nothing we have seen before. It’s preventing crime and grey economy. And this book that I mentioned to you, Self-Sovereign Identity by Drummond Reed, is quoting sources saying that the cost of cybercrime is something in the region of $6 trillion. So that’s a kind of a big picture. McKinsey for its part estimates the benefits of the trust infrastructure to be 3% to 6% of GDP, depending on the maturity of a country.</p>
<p>So this is an absolutely massive step forward. Some people say that this is more important than Internet, I agree. And some people say that the fact wallet is at least as important as the internet browser was when internet started. So you can see that this is something that every state, every government should actually do everything they can, and obviously, European Union to happen as fast as possible. We have no time to lose in this world. But they cannot do it on their own. And they are– the clever governments understand that they have to do this hand-in-hand with the Self-Sovereign Identity experts and the enterprises that are working in that field, and that’s the way it works in Finland.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely the way you say it sounds like there are definitely plenty of benefits. And yeah, we hope to see these benefits in the near future definitely.</p>
<p>Bo: Oh, I mean, it’s a kind of a responsibility of any government that are looking for reducing crime and improving privacy and above all, naturally, getting the productivity in place and the benefits of data according to the MyData principles. And this is the really only practical way I can see that they could implement the MyData principles, protecting people’s data. I’ve seen during 40 years of digital work, I’ve seen a lot of important things, but this is the biggest by far.</p>
<p>And if you want to go into the wallets, which will get a lot of so-called credentials or statements, verify data, the e-receipt is something of the highest volume. And even the lines in the e-receipts, if you look at the number of lines in e-receipts and e-invoices in Finland, and both of them will in a couple of years’ time be the only kind accepted legally. In accounting, there are some 20 billion of them every year and these can– each line can be verified on its own. So it will be by far the biggest volume of credentials sitting delivered from the seller’s wallet to the buyer’s wallet, be the buyer or seller private or an organisation.</p>
<p>And the reuse of this e-receipt is a fantastic opportunity. We all know what travel expense means for all of us. We know how difficult it is to get financing in enterprises, and you have an invoice there, verified by the buyer, it’s so much easier for insurance companies. In Finland only there is a calculation saying that about 100 million can be saved when e-receipts are actually available. And obviously the insurance fraud is a big issue in any country. That’s just one example. But there are any number of them that– what is the– when you get a verified data statement, a credential that can be used in so many different places.</p>
<p>Oscar: So the e-receipts is also part of eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, it’s not directly but I mean, when you have eIDAS 2.0 in the right way. And I’m a little bit worried, I have to admit, about the Commission’s, let’s say, level of understanding of the importance of this 3% to 6% of GDP. They are focusing, in my opinion, too much on the private wallets and not enough on the enterprise wallets, to get the real benefit. If you focus only on private wallets, and for example, then government-issued credentials, then you get to a point 0% or 0.1% perhaps of the benefits. But when you have a full picture then you can get 90% of the enormous, enormous benefits.</p>
<p>That’s why I wrote this <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/22017/open-letter-to-the-eu-commission">open letter</a>, which can be found in my LinkedIn account. Also, if somebody’s interested to the Commission, but we should understand how big this step can be if it’s done correctly, and not only looking at some sort of additional identification tool and only government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’re going to add this, I read your open letter to EU Commission. So yeah, we’re going to add it also to the show notes of this episode so people can read it, definitely. How can we centre the users’ needs while at the same time balancing organisational priorities in any new solution?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, this is a very good question and an important question, and I don’t have all of the answers here. But I have some basic answers based on my experience from banking, and so forth. I think that the, the mission and the– must always be the passion in any organisation that wants to be successful is to think hard about what the customers need tomorrow. And it’s a familiar phrase is that you should never ask the customer what he needs, because he doesn’t know, you should know before he does.</p>
<p>And in this particular time now, I think it’s time to start all the service design from the customer’s life events. Both data is needed for this live event and where does it sit? How can the data be verified and available in real time? The value of data arriving one second faster is quite different from the one that comes later. And it’s then in this particular setting, natural for many, many organisations to issue these wallets, be they in a mobile phone or in a computer. And also then include the National ID, invite the government to make the root idea, the electronic ID card into these wallets, so that it can be used for opening bank accounts and whatnot, where this is always needed according to the law, at least in the Nordics, but also other credentials from the public sector.</p>
<p>Then you can produce fantastic value for the customers, be they private customers or for SMEs who are going to take and actually charge. So that you [indiscernible] and the costs are not big, that is the fantastic feature here with open source technology and open data and open standards. So, I see that the solution will be that the role of public and private sector organisations will be, and is already, in GDPR supply data, but it should be verified data. The value of verified data is a thousand times more than just generic data. Also for machine learning and artificial intelligence, to supply that data to citizens and SME fact wallets and these are generic tools, generic tools, standardised interfaces all over the place.</p>
<p>The data rights holder as I said before here, then herself decides which service provider is best suited to use the data, to solve the need. And then in an ideal world, the public sector would not need to act as a service provider at all. They can let the enterprises do that on their own, and that will save a lot of taxpayers’ money. But of course, we have to see to it that there are no walled gardens built, that data is flowing freely, that you can always change your service provider without any lock ins, and that the competition is serving us all.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be that difficult because the whole Self-Sovereign Identity is built on open standards and no wall gardens and no technology and no– it’s a kind of religion in that so that’s why I feel so comfortable in promoting it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now with your experience working in Finland in banking and several other projects until now, how can Europe – and even if we see it globally with initiatives like GAIN, the Global Assure Identity Network – how these can learn from the experiences in Finland and in the Nordics in general?</p>
<p>Bo: Yeah, I have to admit that I have failed miserably in one aspect. This e-identification services that GAIN is now looking at was started back in I think ’93 in Finland. And we have then taken it from here to the other Nordic countries so that the banks are actually the suppliers to the identification services. And I have been preaching this in conferences all over the world all the time, since then, and I have written any number of blogs, in the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">Finextra blog posts</a>, you can you can find it on frequently. That banks should be doing this and not only by their own will but should actually be forced into this kind of service by the government. Because they are so suited, because they are trusted, trusted institutions and the economic trust is immensely important and they are legislated into it because of the anti-money laundering legislation and all that.</p>
<p>And now GAIN is looking at it and unfortunately, it is very late. And now with the wallets, you don’t need it in the same time as– in the same way as you would have done it if you had started 20 years ago, 25 years ago as we did. But I didn’t get in my way, there has been so many different crises in banking that has taken away the attention. A little bit the same has happened also in electronic invoicing, banks woke up a little bit late. I can only look myself in the mirror.</p>
<p>But the lessons learned in Finland was that the economy of reuse and the economy of trust, using bank ID for identifying in all kinds of services was really, really important. It became a generic tool, both in your private role and in your work roles. And now, when you have this in overflow of everything – I mean, the attention span is– if it is eight seconds, still, it’s good. I mean, the goldfish has nine seconds. And everything else is overflowing except time and the value of something that you know already and trust is growing exponentially.</p>
<p>But now, I jump from there to the wallets, a generic wallet that you can use at home and at work supported by a generic public-private joint infrastructure is, of course, even more valuable, many times more valuable than the e-identification services provided by the banks. And this is something that not only the banking sector should be providing but many other sectors as well and everyone should naturally use it. So we have to live with the times and realise that people don’t have time to learn anything new if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>Oscar: Now, seeing the evolution because eIDAS 2.0 as I understand is still being cooked, let’s say, so it’s not completely finished. So how, let’s say smaller EU countries, and even individuals, who are really concerned about this or how is it going to be the standard and the standard coming can have more power to influence the commission decisions that is going to affect so many residents?</p>
<p>Bo: And this is a very critical question, an important question. And to get anything done now, the first thing to say is that even if you have the best public servants in the world, they are not Self-Sovereign Identity experts. Even if the European Commission has said that the Self-Sovereign Identity is at the core of eIDAS, they haven’t yet understood– had time to understood the full picture perhaps.</p>
<p>The remedy is that EU and any country, sit down with the public sector and say that OK, you government, you have realised that you can have 3% to 6% GDP benefits out of this Trust Infrastructure. And you do understand that your lawyers and economists and whatnot, they are not experts in building this radically new infrastructure. You have to do it together, in this public-private team, formulate the narrative. And some basic use cases like the receipts, or whatnot, so that the citizens will actually start asking for it, demanding it from their own government. That’s what you need.</p>
<p>And from Brussels, because we do understand that the Europe is the biggest economy in the world and if it becomes one single market, the benefit for everyone will be absolutely massive. And this is real – this trust infrastructure is a bigger step than Internet. And the fact wallet is the new browser. So we have to get people to understand how big this is.</p>
<p>And then the countries, once you have done it in your home country, then you join forces with others, like we now do with Sweden, Norway, and Germany, Holland, and so forth, and influence Brussels so that it is not overregulated, which will make it too expensive for small players, and actually just help large organisations to protect their positions. They have money enough to do this, even if it’s very regulated. So it’s important to see to it that the competition from the smaller guys is possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: So yeah, it’s important to, as you say, join forces, right, with the countries that have already– countries and organisations that are already active in… yeah, quite knowledgeable and active today.</p>
<p>Bo: Exactly. And that’s what they are doing now. Very happy to see that our neighbour Sweden has been quite keen to work together with the other countries also.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when is it expected to be ready, eIDAS 2.0?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, we’ve had a very tight timetable when it was launched. And we were of course quite happy about that last summer, it was announced and this was exactly what we had been hoping for, and even more. So that was good. But then it has now taken a lot of time and gone into overregulation aspects, which we fear and not enough understanding for the need for organisational wallets and of course or for wallets for things and bets and whatnot to get the full benefit.</p>
<p>So I’m, let’s say, prepared to wait half a year more if these aspects get into the drawings so that you can get the benefits out of it. The economic benefits and privacy benefits and single market benefits. So we must work hard to avoid, let’s say, minimal mobile application for citizens only. I don’t know how long it will take but probably not much will be seen how in way of use cases this year, next year should be a breakthrough year.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. In 2023, we’ll see some of the fruits at least will be available for people to use and as you say organisations as well, all together.</p>
<p>Bo: Absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla Excellent. Final question for you, Bo. For all business leaders listening to us now what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, this is of course a very challenging question. But if I choose from a long list of experiences from the past in electronic banking, electronic invoicing, e-identification services and all and how they come together and form the ladder. And when this ladder was– when they started to raise this ladder, we were happy enough to have hundreds and hundreds of bank branches that could do the selling on a personal basis to the individuals. Now, we are not really that many bank branches left anymore so it’s a new, it’s a new game, you have to do it without much personal selling.</p>
<p>So my simple line would be to say that, for God’s sake, do not serve your customer, to have a life event, with the fact wallets for all needed verified data into the wallet, and you have to do it closely together with the public sector. And they should also help with the financing because so much of the benefits will be for the society at large and only a small part for the enterprises and such. But this is the joint effort, the biggest one I’ve seen ever.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, thank you very much, Bo, for this very interesting conversation and shedding light about eIDAS 2.0 and everything that is, yeah, behind that. I definitely learned a lot from this conversation. I’m sure our audience had fun and also super interesting. If someone would like to hear more about you, or get in touch with you, or follow you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Bo: Well, I have such an unusual name so it’s easy to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-harald-4768b51/">find me on LinkedIn</a> and please feel free to contact me. I have <a href="https://www.finextra.com/latest-blogs?memberid=43145">written blogs for at least 10 years on Finextra</a>. So there, most of the material that I have myself produced can be found there in a fairly condensed form, not too long texts. So please feel free to use as much as you like.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. Again, thanks a lot, Bo, for this conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Bo: Thank you very much.</p>

				 Internet Identity Workshop IIWXXXIV <p>The 34th Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, California was a major success. Our Trinsic team, sporting our Trinsic-blue Vans, gathered with hundreds of other buzzing minds to discuss the disruptive technologies and principles that are shaping the internet movements around us. The conference covered a wide array of topics with over 80 sessions held in the span of a few days. While we can’t begin to do a comprehensive overview of all of IIW, below are some key insights our team gained from this latest IIW.</p> &nbsp;  Building in Under 30 Minutes <p>IIW is the perfect staging ground for testing out ideas and experimenting with emerging technology. Keeping in tradition with other IIW conferences, our Trinsic team talked with new innovators this spring about building an SSI proof of concept in under 30 minutes. This year’s group taught us the following in regards to building and testing SSI proof of concepts:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  You truly can build a proof of concept in under an hour. The feasibility of building and testing a concept is not only thrilling but it also means we can make advancements in digital identity quicker. If testing is easier, more ideas can be brought to light which enables us to sift through and make headway in building better identity products for everyone. If you’re someone with an idea but have been hesitant about where to begin building and testing, <a href="https://trinsic.notion.site/Build-an-SSI-Proof-of-Concept-dae9d6e565eb4770be41b61d55e090cb">this is an excellent place to begin working within minutes</a>.  We build better products when we openly collaborate with each other. If you’re looking to build a new ecosystem, seek feedback from community members who have been through the process or are building a product that could complement yours. At the end of the day, we’ll only be successful if all our identity products are interoperable. Yet that won’t ever happen if we aren’t talking with one another and following the same standards. <a href="https://slackcommunity.com/">Trinsic’s developer slack community</a> is a great place to start meeting and speaking with fellow builders.  The best SSI proof of concepts are built by teams with great chemistry. We’ve worked with a lot of companies, and those that are the most successful are successful because of their team. Having the right resources in terms of talent often outweighs the importance of other capital resources. This spring’s IIW conference showcased a growing community of talented companies, with a rapidly growing need to hire. It seems we’re all hiring, which means we can each expect to put a lot more effort into attracting top talent.   &nbsp;  The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>Verifiable credentials and adoption were among the hottest topics of IIW. The unique value of a verifiable credential is the fact that it is an interoperable standard–that is, one credential can be accepted and verified across multiple institutions. However, the value of a standard is less obvious before being widely adopted. Thus, we find ourselves with a chicken-and-egg problem: how do we get people to use verifiable credentials while the main value is the fact that other people are using the standard? The key is to focus on solving business problems today for a single ecosystem. That’s why Trinsic created Trinsic Ecosystems, a product focused on enabling adoption among issuers and verifiers. If you’re building an SSI ecosystem, reach out for a demo.</p> &nbsp;  Decentralized Identity Has Great People <p>IIW once more established that this industry has some of the best people.

  <p>Portable, verifiable and, most importantly, reusable representations of personal data can enable high-touch, high-trust and low-cost engagement between customers and networks of complementary service providers. The EU is already adjusting to the opportunities of Self-Sovereign Identity, but the private sector needs to demonstrate more high-value use cases in order to force beneficiary regulations and an enabling environment for the technology. The tools and techniques of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), including the no-code capabilities provided by ProofSpace, can be used to create trust networks within an organization’s existing technical infrastructure in order, for example, to verify that a credential shared by a customer was issued by a trusted partner. A valuable use case for this is re-usable Know Your Customer verification. Other high-value use cases for SSI trust networks include: networks of affiliated hospitality services referring and on-boarding customers; networks of educational institutions verifying academic credentials; networks of employers verifying employment histories; and web 3.0 and DAO communities verifying member reputation and voting rights for management and governance purposes. A brilliant case study for this is ProofSpace’s work with the pro-democracy opposition of Belarus, where Self-Sovereign Identity enables a decentralized and secure “virtual country”, offering private and public services to unite, serve and empower the pro-democracy community.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-mason-identity-ecosystems"></a>

  <p>During this best practice session we will present you with hands-on experience from one of our financial services industry customers.</p>
<p>The company used a handcrafted xml signature mechanism to authenticate their business partners when initiating machine-to-machine communication to exchange data between data centers. When the customer decided to migrate to REST APIs in a cloud native setup, the existing mechanism was no longer fit for purpose. Together, we designed a solution to keep the benefits of certificate based authentication while establishing an interaction model conforming to the OpenID Connect standard. We implemented the mechanism based on the open source software Keycloak, successfully passed an external penetration test and have to this point authenticated hundres of thousands of sessions. After our session, attendees will</p>
 
 be familiar with standard conforming approaches to use OpenID Connect with certificates for authentication 
 be able to assess which parts of their authentication flow will benefit from using certificates 
 know relevant open source technologies and technical approaches to use in their own implementations 
 understand common pitfalls and relevant considerations when implementing the standards in a real-world, cloud based scenario

The technology that has no limits in its application across sectors is equally welcome in centralised and decentralised worlds. Meet, self-sovereign identity (SSI).<br> <br> How do you quantify the impact of a paradigm which will completely transform how we interact with identity and more broadly, authentic or trusted data? Our estimates say its market size is $550b / $0.55Tr. <br> <br> We’ll give a brief rundown of SSI applications across Finance, NFT, Banking, Crypto and many more.</p>

  <p>Most OAuth deployments today use bearer tokens – tokens that can be used by anyone in possession of a copy of them, with no way to distinguish between legitimate uses of them and those that stole them and used them for nefarious purposes. The solution to this is proof-of-possession tokens, where the legitimate client supplies cryptographic material to the issuer that is bound to the token, enabling it to cryptographically prove that the token belongs to it – something attackers cannot do because they don’t possess the proof-of-possession cryptographic material.<br> <br> The OAuth DPoP (Demonstration of Proof of Possession) specification defines a simple-to-implement means of applying proof of possession to OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens. We will describe real attacks occurring every day against bearer tokens and how they are mitigated by DPoP, providing defense in depth and making real deployed systems substantially more secure with minimal implementation and complexity costs.<br> <br> These attacks and mitigations are particularly relevant to high-value enterprise deployments, such as in the financial, manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and government sectors.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-jones-oauth-dpop"></a>

  <p>Identity Fabrics as a concept has established itself as a common paradigm for defining and implementing the identity services needed by organizations to provide seamless, yet secure and controlled access of everyone and everything to every type of service, regardless whether its legacy or shiny &amp; bright SaaS, and regardless of where it runs. Identity Fabrics support the shift-left in IAM thinking from only managing applications to providing a consistent set of identity services for the developers of digital services. Identity Fabrics deliver the integration and control plane required for a modern IAM.</p>
<p>In this panel, the panelists will discuss where Identity Fabrics stand today, how they are implemented in practice, and what to consider for prioritizing services, for picking the right technologies, and for operations, as well as for building an Identity API layer and integrating back to the legacy.</p>
<p>They also will look at whether and where specific variants are needed, such as Consumer Identity Fabrics looking at the CIAM and CDP (Customer Data Platform) use cases.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-identity-fabrics"></a>

  <p>This session is a continuation of the opening keynote by Martin Kuppinger on the future Composable Enterprise. Together we take a look at what powers the composable enterprise and which concepts and technologies can contribute to building a composable enterprise.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole proposes an engine that powers composable enterprises, made up of composable services, identities, and data. Since this journey towards becoming composable is intensely individual based on business goals and requirements, there countless ways of cultivating this modular trifecta. Therefore, this session identifies some of the building blocks that organizations use to cultivate interchangeability and agility to achieve their continually shifting business goals. These building blocks are modular themselves, allowing organizations to exercise different aspects to power composability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bailey-composable-enterprise"></a>

  <p>Zero-trust security relies heavily on the ability for independently owned and operated services to dynamically adjust users’ account and access parameters. These adjustments are based on related changes at other network services, such as identity providers, device management services or others. A set of standards from the OpenID Foundation enable independent services to provide and obtain such dynamic information in order to better protect organizations that rely on zero-trust network access. These standards are being used today in some of the largest cloud-based services from Microsoft and Google to dynamically adjust users’ account and access properties.</p>
<p>This talk gets into the details of the Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework, which is the foundational standard for secure webhooks.

  <p>As digital business pushes organizations towards an accelerated multi-cloud adoption, CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlements Management) emerges as a strong enabler for securing access and entitlements across an increasingly distributed cloud environment. Traditional PAM and IGA tools aren't natively designed to manage cloud infrastructure entitlements and therefore can't be easily re-purposed to discover and remediate excessive cloud permissions across multiple IaaS and PaaS platforms. The confusion arising from un-identically structured CSPs and misaligned cloud terminology is further aggravated by the quest of IAM, PAM and Cloud Security providers to enter CIEM space and capture market share.</p>
<p>In this session, we will focus on how the CIEM market has been evolving over the last few years to manage the critical cloud security gaps left unaddressed by CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) and CWP (Cloud Workload Protection) tools, and how CIEM complements these tools to offer a wholistic cloud security advantage. We will also discuss how CIEM addresses some of the most critical security tenets of your organization's cloud adoption program and future planning.</p>
<p>As for the key takeaways of this session, you will be able to understand and articulate:</p>
 
 When and where does CIEM fit in your overall cloud security and access governance strategy? 
 What are the critical capabilities of CIEM to help evaluate the right CIEM product for your multi-cloud environment? 
 What are industry best practices for implementing and operationalizing CIEM for your cloud security and achieving faster ROI?

  <p>The internet was designed without a trusted identity layer to connect physical entities to the digital world. This layer is now emerging in the form of decentralized digital identity systems (aka self-sovereign identity or “SSI”) based on digital wallets and digital credentials.&nbsp;What industry insiders have demanded for long is becoming reality. This is bringing challenges to the forefront including resistance of the identity establishment and major questions about interoperability between emerging and existing identity systems.<br><br>The Trust over IP Foundation was founded by a pan-industry group of leading organizations with a mission to provide a robust, common standard and complete architecture for internet-scale digital trust. In this session, leaders in digital identity from the ToIP Steering Committee will outline the impact this missing layer has had on digitization of trusted interactions, why technology alone won’t solve this and how the ToIP stack is designed to tackle both technology and human governance to bring open and interoperable standards at each layer of the trust architecture. This interactive panel will be moderated by ToIP’s Director of Strategic Engagement and will explore the views of its member organizations for a lively and engaging debate on how we finally establish trust in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-stack"></a>

  <p>The world of modern urban mobility is full of - unused - opportunities. To get to their destination, people can use public transportation, take a cab or rent an e-scooter. But many options also means many providers. Anyone who uses more than one of the aforementioned forms of transportation to get from A to B will inevitably be confronted with a fragmentation of their journey. This is anything but smooth and user-friendly. A simple example makes this particularly clear: If Erika Mustermann has to go to London for a business meeting, she first takes the suburban train to the airport, then gets on a plane, and then has a cab take her to the hotel. That's three different booking processes with three different mobility providers. Decentralized technologies, on the other hand, enable a new kind of efficiency and effectiveness in the back-end networking of different providers. But how can such a seamless customer journey be implemented so that both mobility service providers and customers benefit equally? Sophia Rödiger, CEO of bloXmove, is happy to tackle this challenge in a talk on IT Trans. In doing so, she explores the question of how, for example, the individual players in local public transport can cooperate with each other while remaining independent and what role blockchain technology plays in this. She also explains how providers can save resources through the decentralized concept while gaining more customers. In addition, she puts a special focus on how the cooperation between the public and private sectors can be changed by the approach in the long term.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-roediger-decentralized-tech-collaboration"></a>

  <p>The presentation to be made by Stéphane Mouy (SGM Consulting - France) and Michael Adams (Quali-Sign - UK) will focus on the forthcoming eIDAS 2.0 digital identity wallets (DIWs) and the payment use case. DIWs will allow users to share high LoA identity and status credentials to various relying parties, including financial institutions, as well as meet applicable strong customer authentication requirements for payments.<br>The payment use case is of critical importance to eIDAS 2.0 digital identity wallets and promises to be transformational for EU payment service providers as it offers a level-playing field for payment means, whether account-to-account or card based. DIWs are also likely to play a key role for the deployment of CBDCs supporting offline interactions with embedded AML/CFT verifications.<br>The presentation will draw on the work of the eWallet Network presented in the Developing a digital identity solution for use by the financial sector based around eIDAS trust services report published by the EU commission in October 2021 and authored by Stéphane Mouy. It will include a live presentation of an eIDAS 2.0/ISO 23220-1 digital identity wallet offering online/offline connectivity that can be used in a variety of contexts, including for payment authorisation purposes.<br>The session should be of interest to anyone interested in eIDAS 2.0 developments for digital identities as well as its regulatory implications for the financial sector but also to digital payment experts. A specific focus will be made on the offline connectivity requirement for DIWs that has clear technology implications.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-mouy-adams-payment-authorizing"></a>

<p>Drone operations are estimated to bring €10bn/yr to the EU economy by 2035. A critical e-Government issue is the ability to fly drones in regulated airspace around airports. Unauthorised drone operations in the flightpath of passenger aircraft can endanger lives and cause huge financial loss for airport operators. Heathrow Airport has invested &gt;£10M in security systems to track and destroy unauthorised drones. Digitising the entire drone flight approvals process will involve many steps, but the major one we are addressing is verifying pilot training credentials. SSI could radically improve this currently cumbersome and low-trust process. In an Innovate-UK grant funded project (Fly2Plan), we developed an SSI PoC for a drone pilot training company to issue training certificates as verifiable credentials to drone pilots, which can be verified by Heathrow Airport. In this talk we present our learnings and future work.</p>

  <p>The “zero trust” approach to cybersecurity has been gaining momentum in recent years, as&nbsp;both corporations&nbsp;and&nbsp;government agencies&nbsp;have struggled with how to&nbsp;enhance security given&nbsp;the de-emphasis on the network perimeter. For the most part, the zero trust movement has remained rooted in network principals. However, in the last two years, much of the world was forced to interact exclusively online, creating a sense of urgency around zero trust security and the “never trust, always verify” philosophy behind it reached a new level of importance.</p>
<p>In this panel, you’ll hear from security leaders who have approached and implemented zero trust with an identity-first philosophy, considering it a transformative way of reducing friction for users, while addressing the increasingly challenging risk environment. They believe a&nbsp;true&nbsp;zero trust environment&nbsp;requires&nbsp;a strong identity and access management framework.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-zero-trust"></a>

  <p>Continued advances in authentication technology have made the "identity" part of "identity and access management" more manageable over the years. Access management on the other hand, is still very much a "wild-west" landscape. As enterprises move to a zero-trust network access model, access management is the only way in which attackers can be prevented from gaining unwarranted access to enterprise data. Attackers can include both malicious insiders and those using compromised identities. Numerous organizations have suffered significant financial damage as a result of such unwarranted access from legitimately identified users.</p>
<p>Authorization rules in an enterprise can apply to many types of assets: files on a network drive, cloud resources such as virtual machines and storage buckets and enterprise applications and actions within them. Managing authorization across all these assets is complex in and of itself. Most enterprises also use third-party “Software as a Service '' platforms that maintain their own permissions, further complicating enterprises’ efforts to effectively manage authorization.</p>
<p>This talk identifies common causes of "privilege sprawl" in enterprises, and discusses management techniques that can result in "least privilege" permissions to personnel while ensuring no business disruption</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-tulshibagwale-enterprise-authorization"></a>

She recommends having a clear reason for saying no, being able to communicate that reason, and standing behind your decision. Davis ends with how to decline while avoiding burning bridges and saying no without regrets. She emphasizes thinking of the benefits of saying no: more time to focus on another project, more time with your family or doing something for yourself, reminding us that these are great reasons to say no and are favourable to our lives.<p></p>

<p>I wanted to share this video because it meshes well with a blog that Darrell wrote in 2018, “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/say-no-with-grace/">Say No With Grace</a>.” Darrell gives a lot of great examples for start up’s on when to say no and the best ways to approach this most awkward encounter. Tessa dives a little deeper with a clear action plan to master the art of saying no that you can apply anywhere in your life. If you feel overwhelmed with requests or are always taking on too much, this video is for you. Check it out!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Although there are some differences, in many ways the business IT and cybersecurity requirements of government are very similar to those of private sector organizations, and therefore public sector initiatives can often offer insights on tackling common challenges.</p>
<p>Public and private organizations both have to ensure the services are agile and innovative to remain cost effective and provide good user experiences, both have to ensure privacy for users of their services, both have to manage user access based on identity, and both have to face similar cyber security threats against business IT and operational technology (OT).</p>
<p>In tackling the associated challenges, public sector organizations often take the lead, providing good refence material for private sector organizations on best practices to adopt, and indeed what to avoid from lessons learned by public sector organizations.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that public sector organizations often lead the way is the fact that they tend to be early adopters of new and emerging technologies such as distributed deception platforms, fraud intelligence platforms, consumer identity and access management platforms, and machine monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Governments also tend to be leaders in the areas of digital identity, digital transformation, and cybersecurity, which is reflected in KuppingerCole Analysts research and events. Although this happening at different paces in European countries, with some countries lagging others, we are seeing that change. We expect to see more initiatives in the public sector, with those countries that have previously lagged picking up the pace.</p>
<p>Private sector organizations should therefore pay attention to what their public sector counterparts are doing to solve the challenges that they have in common. These public sector initiatives can be valuable in indicating future trends and best practice, and therefore should always be on the radar of private sector organizations to learn as much as they can. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we understand the importance of ­­­­­­­­keeping up with technology trends, and because we are committed to helping your business succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>This includes live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference</a> taking place this week in Berlin and online.</p>
<p>The agenda features a host of sessions looking at technology initiatives by governments around the world, including today’s keynote presentations entitled:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5116">Future Government: Transforming Public Services to Be More Agile and Innovative</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5042">Journey to the North: Canadian Perspectives and Progress on Digital Identity</a> 
 
<p>Tomorrow’s sessions focusing on government technology initiatives include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5004/1">From A to B - How Decentralized Technologies Are Changing Collaboration Between the Public and Private Sector</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5005/3">A Learning Agenda for Federal Identity</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5016/1">Denmark's 2022 brand new eID solution</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5015/2">Cardea: verifiable credentials for health information go open source</a> 
 
<p>The focus on public sector IT projects continues on Thursday, with presentations entitled:<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5055"></a></p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5055">Digital Identity in Travel (and Beyond), a Public- Private Affair</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5074/1">Kubernetes and Crossplane at Deutsche Bahn</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5085/3">Quo Vadis, SSI? – Self-sovereign Identity on route to production</a> 
 
<p>Also on Thursday, there are perspectives on digital identity from around the world:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5083/1">The future of Digital ID in South Africa</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5083/3">Progress and lessons on the establishment of Digital Identity in UK</a> 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5083/2">Shaping the future of India by verified credentials for labour workforce</a> 
 
 Tech Investment 
<p>As mentioned above, public sector organizations tend to be among early adopters of technologies. Learn more about the technology market segments that public sector organizations are investing by looking at these Leadership Compass reports on:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80340/distributed-deception-platforms-ddps">Distributed Deception Platforms (DDPs)</a>

Therefore, have a look this Advisory Note on US <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81109/federal-regulations-on-cybersecurity">Federal Regulations on Cybersecurity</a>, which &nbsp;compares Executive Order 14028, the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive, and IT Security Act (IT-SIG) 2.0 to demonstrate the relationship between these national regulations and future developments in cybersecurity.</p>
 Leadership Brief 
<p>The Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN) proposes an identity network that would allow any global organization to utilize verified identity attributes. This work both calls for and lays the groundwork for global interoperability, and this Leadership Brief entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN Explained</a> is designed to help you understand what GAIN is, what use cases it serves, and who may be interested.&nbsp;</p>
 Audio/video  
<p>Cybersecurity is another important area where public sector organizations are showing leadership. Listen to this Analyst Chat for a discussion on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/new_cybersecurity_drivers">The Need For New Drivers to Improve Cybersecurity</a> and the potential role of governments.</p>
<p>Staying with cybersecurity, have a look at this presentation from EIC 2021 entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-alling-national-danish-cybersecurity-council">How Denmark is Building the Cyberprotection Bridge Between the Private and Public Sectors: The National Danish Cybersecurity Council</a>.</p>
<p>To explore explore governmental reform and understand stakeholder expectations behind the rollout of digital identity projects in the post-COVID era, have a look at this Frontier Talk on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/frontier-talk-podcast-8-reinventing-government">Reinventing Government with Technology</a> with Sebastian Manhart, Technical Advisor on Digital Identity for the German Chancellery.</p>
<p>For further discussion on this topic with Sebastian Manhart to find out how some governments are implementing user-centric, decentralised, self-sovereign digital identity with the goal of providing a holistic identity solution citizens can use everywhere and across borders, have a look at this presentation from a past KC Live event entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enterprise-blockchain-day-2021-10-13-manhart">Decentralized Identity and Governments - Can It Work?</a></p>

 Blogs 
<p>As mentioned above, government implementations can also serve to highlight potential pitfalls, as illustrated by this blog post in response to the German Federal Government’s announcement of its Blockchain Strategy entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/blockchain-its-not-about-technology-it-is-about-use-cases">Blockchain: It’s not About Technology, It Is About Use Cases</a>.</p>
 Webinars 
<p>Governments world-wide are increasingly worried about the social unrest that could result from a cybersecurity compromise of critical infrastructure. This has highlighted the fact that the underlying operational technology (OT) is often inadequately protected. For a discussion about the cyber threats to OT, the need to address the issue of industrial cybersecurity, the benefits of OT security, and how to approach compliance with legislation aimed at controlling critical infrastructure, have a look at this webinar entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2022/04/machine-monitoring">The Machine Monitoring Mandate</a>.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is increasingly affecting all types of organisations including Governments. In order to encourage citizens to adopt digital services, the least expensive channel for governments, it is necessary to support modern connection methodologies and provide user-focussed services. To find out more about the challenges facing government, and the opportunity digital transformation affords, have a look at this webinar on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital_transformation_in_government">Digital Transformation in Government</a>.</p>
<p>Password-based authentication is no longer fit for purpose. Passwords are costly and difficult to manage, they result in poor user experiences, and they are easily compromised. This has been widely recognized for some time, but going passwordless is also challenging and continues to be elusive for many organizations, although some governments are already on board. To find out more, have a look at this webinar entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/07/passwordless-implementation"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/07/passwordless-implementation">The Path to Going Passwordless.</a></p>
 Whitepapers 
<p>Organizations are facing a brave new world in which governments are taking a proactive role in constraining cybersecurity risks. Companies with operational infrastructure that is deemed ‘critical’ to social stability can expect legislation to ensure they are adequately protecting their OT infrastructure, and monitoring and responding to cyber-threats and compromise events.

<p>Moving to the cloud sets new challenges for managing access to critical IT environments for small and medium-size businesses (SMBs). SMBs may work within the defense or government sector in which case the data protection requirements are likely to be far more stringent than a small engineering firm.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Richard Hill</a></p><p>Industry 4.0 is the fourth revolution in manufacturing. I won't bore you with the details of the prior iteration or versions and how we got where we are today, only that Industry 4.0 promises to take the interconnectedness of devices and machines to a new level. Smart or intelligent computing and autonomous systems using analytics and AI/ML techniques supported by big data are integral parts of the industry 4.0 paradigm. Industry 4.0, in short, is a significant change and will impact a manufacturing organization's digital transformation.<br><br>A Bow Wave of Devices and Machines<br>Since the start of Industry 4.0, there has been a bow wave in the number and types of device types to account for. Beyond the basic desktop, laptop, and tablets, other device types making their appearance are industrial mobile devices, mixed reality (VR) headsets/smart glasses (e.g., Oculus, HoloLens), industrial internet of things (IIoT), smart cameras, beacons, and the list goes on. And sure, there was some robotics back in the industry 3.0 timeframe, such as stationary Articulated Robotic Arms. Today, there is a broader range of robotic types in manufacturing like Autonomous Mobile Robots and Inventory Robots, Automated Guided Carts and Forklifts, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, etc.<br><br>IIoT, Data and AI<br>Since the inception of the Internet of Things (IoT), the use of IoT devices has steadily grown. IoT devices at their core collect data via sensors and perform actions using actuators. IoT sensors and actuators can be applied to many different business sectors, which account for the wide range of IoT use cases. A more recent trend is the convergence of OT and IT networks, systems, and sharing of data that Industrial IoT devices collect, allowing both businesses and operations to utilize and benefit from information sharing. With the wealth of data becoming available, AI/ML and predictive analytics can provide insights that can be of value. Also, because of the sheer amount of data generated, the trend is clearly moving towards edge computing in closer proximity to a manufacturing facility that utilizes AI/ML processing, as well as other services.<br><br>Communication is Key<br>With the number of machines and devices throughout today's industry 4.0 manufacturing environment, and the need for orchestration and automation, communication to and from machines and devices is key. The networks used in these environments include the ethernet, mesh networks, wireless, and, more recently, public and private 5G networks. The introduction of Wi-Fi 6 and 5G networks is driven by the need for faster / lower latency communications to/from machines and devices and data throughput. The communication protocols have also increased to include ZigBee, LoRa, NB-IoT, Z-Wave, Sigfox, LTE, and Bluetooth Smart, as some examples.<br><br>So, Where Does IAM Fit In?<br>I’ve talked a bit about what has changed, but what hasn’t changed or remains the same? Within the Industry 4.0 environment, each machine and device on the network still needs to be identified, and each connection across the systems-of-systems still needs to be authenticated. Access to digital resources continues to require authorization and controlled by digital policies. This is where Identity and Access<br><br>Management (IAM) fits in. An extension of IAM that can help with the management of devices is a Unified Endpoint Management solution which can track, perform device health assessments, and patch devices on an ongoing basis. An IoT Device Management platform can manage the lifecycle of IoT devices, as well as the monitoring, protecting, and visualization of IoT device status and health and the control of its data. Other cyber security solutions can also be added, but at the core, IAM will continue to be needed in the industry 4.0 digital transformation.<br><br>European Identity and Cloud (EIC) Conference<br>Because we understand the importance of protecting critical assets, and because we are committed to helping your organization succeed, KuppingerCole has a great deal of content available in a variety of formats, including live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference taking place in Berlin and online in May.<br><br>The agenda includes keynote presentations and panel discussions on Assessing the Business Impact of Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine, Reinventing Government with Technology, Future Government: Transforming Public Services to Be More Agile and Innovative, Zero Trust Best Practices, and The Changing Cyber Threat Landscape, as well as other cyber security-related presentations including:</p>

				  The completion of the Indy DID Method by Indicio paves the way toward a network of networks. Verifiable credentials issued on multiple networks can now be verified by any agent that supports did:indy, affirming Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries as the most advanced framework for interoperable, decentralized identity  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Network interoperability has taken a major leap forward with the release of the Indy DID Method for Hyperledger Indy-based networks. With this new upgrade, completed by Indicio, verifiable credentials issued on a specific Hyperledger Indy network can now be resolved by any agent supporting the did:indy method regardless of which Hyperledger Indy network the verifying agent might use to anchor its issuing DIDs, schemas, or credential definitions. The Indy DID Method paves the way for Hyperledger Indy credentials to scale globally by allowing Indy networks to seamlessly interoperate and create a “network-of-networks” effect.</p>
<p>The Indy DID Method was also needed to bring Hyperledger Indy—the most popular open-source codebase for creating robust distributed ledger networks for identity—into sync with the more recent World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Specification</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">Indy DID Method</a> originally began as a community development effort within <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>. Earlier this year, the government of British Columbia, Canada, announced a “Code with Us” challenge, to push the effort to completion. The challenge was won by Indicio and, thanks to the hard work of our talented engineers, the Indy DID Method is now available to the entire Indy community.</p>
<p>It’s hard to understate why this is a really important step forward for decentralized identity adoption. It means adding the potential of scale to every deployment, which is something we and all our customers want. With interest in verifiable credential technology increasing every day, the timing could not be better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also important to recognize that this is the kind of the rapid innovation that can be achieved in open source technology when a nonprofit-led community, a government, and an enterprise collaborate. We are enormously grateful to the government of British Columbia for sponsoring this “Code with Us” challenge.&nbsp; We also applaud it: This is a model for open source infrastructural innovation that governments everywhere should learn from and follow.</p>
<p>The next step is for networks and agent frameworks to incorporate did:indy&nbsp; into production software stacks. This community adoption will increase the viability of the Indy and Aries project stack and position it to be the globally dominant way to issue and share verifiable credentials in a multi-ledger world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Indicio team would like to thank BC Gov for funding this work and Dominic Wörner, another contributor to the Code With Us challenge, for his work on Indy VDR.</p>

  <p>Privacy is one of the most challenging aspects to protect in identity solutions.</p>
<p>The entities that stand to gain the most from surveilling users can use convenience as a bargaining chip. Users understand and appreciate convenience, but they often don't appreciate the costs of loss of privacy, as the consequences often play out well after the violation occurred.</p>
<p>Identity practitioners often take the need to preserve privacy for granted, and in so doing fail to help users and solution designers understand the concrete impact privacy violations can have on the lives of users. This session will arm you with the concrete scenarios you need to instill in customers and colleagues a new awareness of the real costs privacy violations can have.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bertocci-privacy-cost"></a>

<p>But wait – less than a third of businesses that we at KuppingerCole have asked recently, say that they have processes, staff, structures, skills, and cybersecurity implemented in a way that they feel adequately prepared for what analysts may soon call the age of the composable enterprise. In this CISO panel session, we will try to look into the future of Cybersecurity, without losing sight of today´s threats and ways to continue building cyber resilience in a time of so many unknowns.

  <p>As the pace of digitalization gathers momentum, organizations are witnessing a dramatic increase in the number of digital identities. These identities interact with systems and applications relentlessly to perform day-to-day IT tasks. Nevertheless, maintaining the privacy of this data is a daunting task. Enterprise data is hosted in multi-tenant cloud, managed service providers and distributed data center environments. How an organization can maintain data privacy in this evolving IT access control use-cases depends on the level of preparedness to protect and monitor those digital identities. An identity and access management solution provides adequate safeguards to enforce IT practices necessary to maintain data privacy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-bhandari-digital-identity-privacy"></a>

  <p>The future of the enterprise is changing. In the Digital Age, much is different than it has been in the past. The focus must be on agility in business models and delivery, innovation, and reliability in delivering to the customers. This requires a shift in focus, in all areas, including IT. IT must focus on enabling the business to deliver digital services that stand out from the competition, with leading-edge customer experience. IT must be able to adapt to change in competition as well as in technology, and to support the continuous innovation of businesses in the digital age. It must focus on what makes a business different from others. Thus, IT must focus way more on innovation than on just delivering standard IT services from the shelf. However, IT must ensure that this is safe, secure, reliable, available – the new IT as well as the old IT. Cybersecurity and Identity today are at the forefront of the digital business, with Identity as an enabler and Cybersecurity as the foundation for secure delivery.</p>
<p>With the demand on agility and innovation in IT, and the focus on distinguishing from others instead of reinventing baseline IT that is available of the shelf, the themes of “decentralization” and decentralized technologies (as in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies), and of “composable” (as in orchestration, APIs, business processes, etc.) move to the focus. This keynote will look at how to utilize identity, security, and decentralized technologies for the composable enterprise and for differentiation from competition in the digital business. Done right, technology enables enterprises to stay ahead of the competition, without failing in security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-kuppinger-identity-security-decentralized"></a>

 Sign-in with Solana — Use Your Solana Account for Web2 &amp;&nbsp;Web3  Users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Solana accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.  The Importance of Building a Self-Custodial Future <p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes ”Not your keys, not your crypto’’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of privacy and centralization.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that self-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it happen. Do check our recent <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">announcement about the Auth Network</a> for our roadmap towards&nbsp;this.</p> Sign-in With Solana — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity <p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals.</p> What does Sign-in With Solana&nbsp;Solve? <p>For the User: Sign-in with Solana allows any Web2 application to authenticate users with their Web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign-in with Solana endeavors to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p><p>For the Developer: Do <a href="https://www.docs.web3auth.io">check our documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Solana flow and how to navigate the authentication logic. You can find a clear end-to-end flow in our docs <a href="http://siws.web3auth.io">here</a>. Moreover, Web3Auth offers a dedicated suite of authentication tools for all Solana Developers. This includes support for OAuth and native biometric login using our <a href="https://www.docs.web3auth.io">plug and play SDK</a> and also the state of the art <a href="https://docs.tor.us/solana-wallet/what-is-wallet">Torus Solana Wallet</a> which has a range of exclusive features.</p> Coming Soon… <p>We are pleased to see how rapidly the entire Web3 ecosystem is developing with the launch of new protocols and dApps every day. We will continue to lead the way in servicing authentication needs for the ecosystem whilst upholding the self-custodial principles of blockchain technology.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-solana-use-your-solana-account-for-web2-web3-d94def27485b">Sign-in with Solana — Use Your Solana Account for Web2 &amp; Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p><p>The era we are living in has transformed the Internet and IT from being a convenience for people and organizations into a cyber liability. In an IT infrastructure, almost any system is now an integrated system that has internet connectivity. With assets, devices, resources, hardware, and software, being changed, patched, or updated continuously, it is critical to have an approach that continuously collects and classifies the inventory, discovers the risks, and monitors the organization’s IT infrastructure.<br><br>Classifying, protecting, and identifying digital assets have always been a key to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Attack Surface Management (ASM) is designed to automate these security measurements at a level of functional breadth and depth in coverage of systems that traditional solutions such as firewalls, SIEM solutions, or endpoint protection system have not been able to deliver before. ASM’s continuous and proactive approach to identifying and managing the attack surface allows organizations to be more confident about having comprehensive visibility into what an attacker could target, about knowing where known vulnerabilities still need to be fixed, and about being better protected from new vulnerabilities. The increase in remote work as well as the continuing adoption of cloud services have expanded organizations’ attack surfaces. ASM, as a group of solutions, aims to identify the attack surface and thus for managing and mitigating risks, and help organizations increase their cyber-attack resilience.<br><br>KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that ASM will become a widely deployed capability in the next decade. This is supported by recent evolutions in the market, such as the acquisition of <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/company/press-release/mgc">Mandiant</a> by Google for around $5.4bn. ASM specialists like Axonius, Censys, Cyberpion, and CyCognito recently announced new funding at a significant level, up to $200m. We expect to see large enterprises prioritizing ASM tools in their cybersecurity investment plans as well as further mergers and acquisitions in the ASM market.</p>
<p></p>
 Recommendations to reduce Attack Surface 
<p>ASM is an emerging solution for cybersecurity leaders who are looking to complement their existing monitoring and testing tools. It is also an opportunity for cybersecurity leaders to take proactive measures in response to increasing cyber threats and unidentified vulnerabilities.<br><br>Believe in Zero Trust: Zero Trust is a security paradigm based on the principle of “Don’t trust. Verify!”. According to Zero Trust concept, no device, user, workload, or system should be trusted by default. For further information, check out our Comprehensive Guide to Zero Trust Implementation insight.<br><br>Determine an ASM Strategy: Decide on which security leader will serve as the ASM manager. Inform all the stakeholders and make sure of participation of departments/functions pertaining to the attack surface within your organization.<br><br>Define Your Requirements: Understand your specific requirements for today’s and future use cases and prioritize them.<br><br>Analyze the Market for Potential Vendors: Understand the ASM market, and which vendors could serve your requirements.<br><br>Choose a Vendor: Request ASM related information and, if possible, a PoC to see their implementation capabilities from vendors. Define your use cases and compare results from each vendor. Select the one that matches the most with your use cases and answers your needs.<br><br>Stay Informed with KuppingerCole: Check out our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">library</a> to discover up-to-date reports and articles in today’s cybersecurity landscape.

			<p>9th May, Luxembourg — The Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp (<a href="http://kmska.be/">KMSKA</a>) is the first European museum to tokenize a masterpiece to democratize art investment. In partnership with <a href="https://www.rubey.be/">Rubey</a> and <a href="http://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, KMSKA has leveraged the legal, marketing and technological expertise of both teams to launch its compliant ERC-3643 based security token offering on the Polygon blockchain, allowing fractional ownership of James Ensor (1860 – 1949)’s painting Carnaval de Binche, with investments starting at €150.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Traditionally, for investors, the art industry has been dominated by wealthy individuals with access to or the ability to purchase museum-quality art pieces. For museums, private investors have been the primary source of capital sought to help expand their collections. KMSKA aims to revolutionize the status quo by making masterpieces available to the masses.</p>
<p>By working with Rubey to tokenize the masterpiece on the blockchain, KMSKA lowers the investment barrier to entry, enabling everyone to become a “co-owner” of the masterpiece, while bringing together art lovers to become a new source of capital. The money raised in the Art Security Token Offering allows Carnaval de Binche to be purchased and ensures that the museum receives the piece on long-term loan. This means everyone finally gets to admire Ensor’s Carnaval de Binche – a painting that has spent years in private collections.</p>

		 
	 
   KMSKA will be more than a place that displays art. We are fully committed to engaging our visitors and token holders in our collection and operation. It is very special that anyone can become a ``co-owner`` of Carnaval de Binche by James Ensor. KMSKA already had the largest Ensor collection in the world. The addition of Carnaval de Binche puts our museum on the international map as an Ensor centre of excellence even more.  Luk LemmensKMSKA President       I am absolutely convinced that this is not a hype phenomenon, but the start of a revolution. Technologically, these Security Tokens are the ultimate innovation in the blockchain environment. However, the social element is just as important. Investing in Art Security Tokens is a true impact investment.  Peter HinssenRubey partner and Tech Entrepreneur    
	 
		 
			<p>KMSKA’s Art Security Tokens, unlike Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), are backed by debt instruments, which legally fall under securities regulation and must comply with the law throughout their life cycle. To ensure compliance, the Rubey platform has chosen to integrate Tokeny’s tokenization APIs for issuing and managing security tokens due to its unique onchain compliance approach through permissioned ERC-3643 tokens and digital identity system ONCHAINID. As a result, token transfers can only occur if eligibility conditions are met, moreover, ownership of tokens is guaranteed by holders’ ONCHAINIDs (e.g. token holders can recover their tokens if they lose their wallets).</p>

		 
	 
   There is confusion in the market about NFT and security tokens, and we are pleased to see that KMSKA, an innovative traditional museum, fully understands the differences between these two types of digital assets. We share the same vision as our partners KMSKA and Rubey that security tokens will have a real impact on the art industry by allowing smaller investors to invest and engage in artworks that already have existing value. We are excited to provide a compliance infrastructure and user-friendly interfaces for them to reach these audiences. A new chapter in art investment has begun, and this is just the beginning, we can't wait to see what happens next.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>The project uses <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> network, the Ethereum-scaling solution, to achieve cost-effective operations while preparing for cheap, fast and compliant peer-to-peer transfers post-issuance for all investors – both initial private investors and investors in public sales. The team plans to provide a secondary market solution Billboard on the Rubey platform starting in 2023 to improve the liquidity of the assets.</p>
<p>The project is now live. Go to <a href="http://rubey.be/">rubey.be</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Rubey is a collaboration between 3 parties:</p>
 
 Untitled Workers Club, an advertising agency with a wide range of clients in the art world and finance. These clients noticed that many of their museum-loving customers did not have the financial capacity to buy important works of art to expand their collections, so they came up with the basic concept of tokenising works of art and they asked Untitled Workers Club to handle dealings with art, museums and communication. <a href="http://www.untitledworkersclub.be">More information.</a>

  <p>Over the past decade, and even more swiftly since the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital transformation of the workplace has primarily been <a href="https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/report/global-commentary-report-2020-apps-at-the-ready.pdf">driven by applications</a>. Apps have become an integral part of everyday life for many organizations.</p>

<p>Modern applications are complex. Their functionality frequently relies on APIs and third-party integrations, leading to an increased attack surface and more security vulnerabilities. A data breach or an attacker exploiting a security weakness can permanently damage your business. It’s crucial that you understand and secure your application’s infrastructure.</p>

<p>There are a number of actions you can take to keep attackers away. Following are some tips and best practices for a more secure application.</p>

 Understanding application security 

<p>Application security, or AppSec, as it’s commonly known, takes place throughout the development lifecycle. It’s the process of creating applications that are secure from both internal and external threats. Internal threats can range from simple human error to malicious acts. External threats, which include data breaches, malware, and phishing attacks, can be constant and costly. It’s estimated that distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks alone <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html">will grow to 15.4 million by 2023</a>.</p>

<p>As attackers target applications ever more aggressively, keeping them secure plays a vital role in a holistic cybersecurity strategy. Application security is necessary to avoid financial and legal repercussions, protect your organization’s reputation, and build trust with your customers and partners.</p>

 Application security concepts 

<p>There are a few concepts you should understand before you develop an application security strategy. Learning these will help you avoid common pitfalls or ineffective techniques that could compromise the security of your application.</p>

 OWASP Top 10 

<p>The <a href="https://owasp.org/">Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</a> online community studies and reports on web application security. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top 10</a> report lists the most critical security vulnerabilities an application can face.</p>

<p>The list—based on survey data from cybersecurity professionals—is determined by the frequency and likelihood of a vulnerability, how easy it is to detect, and the impact it can have on your organization.</p>

<p>OWASP’s report can help you assess areas of your application that present higher potential risk. It provides example attack scenarios to show how various vulnerabilities work, as well as guidelines for avoiding these attacks.</p>

<p>Below are the top ten security vulnerabilities as noted in the latest <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP report</a> from 2021:</p>

 
   Broken access control 
   Cryptographic failures 
   Injection 
   Insecure design 
   Security misconfiguration 
   Vulnerable and outdated components 
   Identification and authentication failures 
   Software and data integrity failures 
   Security logging and monitoring failures 
   Server-side request forgery 
 

 Authentication basics 

<p>Authentication is a necessary feature of modern applications because it prevents unauthorized users from accessing and misusing sensitive information.</p>

<p>When you start developing an application, you might be tempted to build your own authentication system to save costs or maintain full control. However, creating an effective authentication system is a challenging job with <a href="https://auth0.com/learn/build-or-buy-20-identity-management-questions/">many factors to consider</a>. If done poorly, it can cause severe consequences.</p>

<p>Instead, there are authentication solutions available to help you enhance the security of your application. Platforms like <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> or <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> provide you with powerful identity services tailored to your needs.</p>

<p>These services offer a high level of expertise and keep updating their technology to stay ahead of new cyberattack forms. Using third-party  software can help you avoid pitfalls and save money in the long run. When you rely on a platform, you can focus on building and running your applications.</p>

<p>For more about the advantages of a pre-built identity solution, check this <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-pre-built-identity-solution/thankyou/">whitepaper on the advantages of a pre-built identity solution</a>.</p>

 External user management 

<p>A user management system is an  <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/01/user-management/">essential part of application security</a>. It allows you to collect, store, and manage user data for a smoother user registration process, enhanced authentication, and better password management. You can also use it to control who can access particular aspects of your infrastructure, including networks, devices, and applications.</p>

<p>As with authentication, you might want to build your own user management system. However, these are complex systems to create that generally require dedicated teams, especially for enterprise-level applications. You could run into issues such as failing to sanitize user input or being stuck with a frustrating registration process.</p>

<p>With an external user management system, you’ll get a robust, out-of-the-box solution that adjusts to your needs while handling tricky tasks like scaling or regulatory compliance. This can also help you reduce overall user management costs since you won’t need to pay in-house developers to do the work.</p>

 Up-to-date programs are a best practice 

<p>To achieve the highest level of security, you should ensure that your applications and their <a href="https://developerexperience.io/practices/updating-the-dependencies">dependencies</a> are always up to date. Updates contain <a href="https://www.hypr.com/patch/">patches</a> to fix security vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit.</p>

<p>Update the antivirus programs on your devices and your firewalls. You can also use <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-asset-management-software-5090064">asset management software</a> to detect outdated programs.</p>

 Secure communication protocols 

<p>Be sure your site or application uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</a>. It adds a security layer to traditional HTTP by encrypting the data exchanged between computers and servers over the internet. For example, if your user fills out a form with personal information, even if the data is stolen, it won’t have any value to the attacker because it cannot easily be decoded.</p>

<p>HTTPS is <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/">so important</a> that it’s become the de facto industry standard. All major web browsers discourage users from visiting non-HTTPS websites, and search engines penalize those websites in search results.</p>

<p>HTTPS protects data with the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/deploy360/tls/basics/">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> protocol, which uses a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/">public-key encryption system</a> to ensure that applications communicate and exchange data safely.</p>

<p>Learn more about how to get started with HTTPS <a href="https://httpsiseasy.com/">in this series</a>.</p>

 Security testing tools 

<p>Use security testing to detect vulnerabilities in your application. Testing can help you protect your applications from data breaches and avoid performance issues. You can also determine your application’s level of security stability and avoid future problems.</p>

<p>Testing can be a time-consuming ongoing process, but there are solutions to help you test efficiently. Two popular testing tools are vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/vulnerability-assessment-vulnerability-analysis">Vulnerability assessment</a> or scanner tools review your application to see if it’s vulnerable to security attacks. They identify, analyze, and help you solve security risks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/penetration-testing/">Penetration testing</a> (or pen testing)  is a white-hat hacking technique you can use to detect security flaws. You imitate the steps a cyber attacker would take in order to identify and fix vulnerabilities before real attackers can discover them.</p>

 Certifications in app security 

<p>You might be inspired to learn even more about application security. If that’s the case, consider pursuing <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3631530/8-top-cloud-security-certifications.html">certification</a>, so you can develop expertise in cloud security. This in-demand skill set will benefit you as well as your company or organization.</p>

 Use your knowledge 

<p>Application security needs to be a top priority for developers. Modern applications often run on multiple networks and connect to the cloud, increasing the number of potentially problematic access points for attackers.</p>

<p>Many organizations are familiar with security best practices but may not understand the concepts behind them. Using this knowledge, you can implement the solutions described above to achieve great results.</p>

<p>This presentation was made at the Cybersecurity &amp; Identity Summit (CIS2022) held from April 26 to 27, 2022.&nbsp; Mathieu Glaude presented ‘Are we really committed to protecting the rights of people and democratic societies?’</p>
<p></p>
<p>CIS2022 is an essential event for the technology industry, providing leading-edge insight on cyber risk prevention and Digital Identity management. Join us for Learning, Networking, and B2B Opportunities.&nbsp; The event is organized by In-Sec-M, a Canadian non-profit organization that brings together companies, learning and research institutions, and government actors to take concerted action to increase the cohesion and competitiveness of the Canadian cybersecurity industry, nationally and internationally. <a href="https://insecm.ca/en/">Learn more about In-Sec-M</a>.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>About the presentation</p>
<p>Is protecting both the rights of individuals and societies really a priority? Do we actually want to deliver on this promise?</p>
<p>To achieve it, both individuals and societies must be capable of expressing their choice without being manipulated. And if we don’t want to be manipulated, then our environments must be secure to allow us to express ourselves freely.</p>
<p>The way the digital world is architected today inherently places all of my data out of my control. When I live in the digital world, I’m dependent on someone else holding and securing data about myself. I really don’t have an alternative. This means that cybersecurity is about securing my world which is not under my control. The concept of hacking is exponentially grave because information about myself exists outside of my control.</p>
<p>Have we been able to deliver on the promise of cybersecurity? Will we ever be able to protect the rights of individuals and societies under the existing model? I’d say it’s not possible.</p>

 Summary   Using Anonymous Credentials, you can prove you own a credential without disclosing the information held within the credential.  But anonymity allows bad actors to hide, and regulators and law enforcement need a way to identify them if need be.  Traceability is an opt-in feature for the holder of a credential. When accessing a service, the verifier can request that the holder encrypts a specific attribute (like an ID number) so that a regulator can access it if need be. The verifier will not be able to decrypt the attribute. Only the regulator will.  <p>To understand traceable credentials, we first need to acknowledge <a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">anonymous credentials</a>. </p><p>Anonymous credentials are a way of proving you own a credential without disclosing the information held within the credential.</p><p>For context, an issuer can create a credential with 3 claims (attributes); an individual's name, DOB and Social Security Number. A holder can prove to the verifier, using zero-knowledge proof, that they own this credential without revealing any of the attributes. To be specific, the holder can prove the attributes exist and have been signed by the issuer, without disclosing the attributes themselves or the signature. </p><p>Anonymous credentials offer great privacy but sometimes, privacy can sometimes be crippling for regulators or law enforcement. Bad actors can hide behind anonymity for example and this becomes troubling for regulators and law enforcement. </p> Unraveling the Anonymous Credentials <p>Traceable credentials are a way of instilling that layer of privacy but allow the relevant authorities to ‘unwind’ that layer of privacy and identify those bad actors. We do this through verifiable encryption.</p><p>Verifiable encryption allows the holder to encrypt any attribute(s) of the credential specifically for the tracing authorities and regulators. When proving the possession of the anonymous credential, the holder also presents encryption of the relevant attributes. The verifier cannot decrypt the attribute but can verify that the holder did encrypt the requested attributes for the regulator and only the regulator will be able to decrypt it. Thus the verifier does not learn the attributes but can trust the credentials are legitimate and that regulators will be able to access them if need be.</p><blockquote>Traceability is an opt-in feature for the holder; the verifier cannot force the holder to provide verifiable encryption for a regulator to potentially decrypt. At most the verifier can deny the holder access to its services.</blockquote><p>Continuing with the above example, a holder will present a service provider (acting as a verifier) with the proof of possession of an anonymous credential containing 3 attributes. The holder will encrypt one attribute which is the SSN so that a regulator can decrypt it. </p><p>The verifier will be able to see if the holder has encrypted the attribute correctly for the regulator to decrypt, and can trust the anonymous credentials are legitimate. The verifier can authenticate that the holder has a valid SSN without knowing the number itself, or their name and DOB. </p><p>The holder is assured that the verifier cannot ‘unwind’ the anonymous credential and their data remains anonymous. Only the regulator can decrypt the credential.</p><p>What’s beneficial is that an issuer does not need to issue special kinds of credentials for it to be traceable, nor will the issuer know if and when the credential was used in a traceable scenario. The only requirement of the issuer to allow anonymous credentials and traceability is that the credential should contain some attributes that can be uniquely tied to the holder. Thus the anonymous credentials issued can be traced using our new feature of Traceable Credentials.</p><p>The verifiable encryption protocol is implemented in Rust <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/saver">here</a> and you can find the corresponding Typescript (using the WASM bindings to the Rust code) code <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/">here</a>. The docs <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/#verifiable-encryption-using-saver">here</a> explain how to use it with anonymous credentials. You can also find the usage in the SDK <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/saver-and-bound-check.test.js">here</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>Organizations are going through a digital journey to exploit the digital systems to create new services, get closer to their customers and to improve efficiency. This process has been accelerated by the COVID pandemic where survival depended upon being able to change. This has led to a fragmented IT environment using multiple cloud services as well as on premises and edge. The challenge is now how to manage the complexity this has created.<br><br>There are now many solutions on the market with acronyms like CSPM, CNAPP, CIEM, CWPP. What are these solutions, and do they really help?<br><br>Digital Transformation has exploited cloud services because of the flexibility they provide. When organizations depended upon physical IT resources, as well as having a high capital cost, it could take months to get hold of equipment and then it would quickly become obsolete. Virtual IT resources through cloud services provide a flexible solution. DevOps can use these to meet business needs in a way that is agile and flexible to feedback. You only pay for what you use and if the project is successful, you can easily upscale to meet demand.</p>
<p>However, this has led to real and tangible challenges. According to the <a href="https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-PR">Cloud Migration Stats - 2022 Flexera State of the Cloud Report</a> the top challenges from today’s multi-cloud hybrid IT are:<br><br>· Security with 85% of organizations reporting this is an inhibitor<br>· Risk and Compliance – with 76% of organizations reporting this as a challenge<br>· Managing Cloud Cost – with 81% reporting this as a challenge<br><br>And worse than that this survey shows that year on year these challenges are growing not decreasing.<br><br>These are challenges of governance. Business-critical applications now depend upon multiple services from multiple providers. Service levels must be set by business needs - but mapping multiple SLAs across clouds is difficult. Furthermore, each cloud service provides <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80933/securing-your-iaas-cloud">their own different management capabilities and security tools</a>. This imposes an extra management burden for each cloud service. It also leads to ad hoc governance of today’s multi-cloud hybrid IT.<br><br>Not only that but the virtual resources are ephemeral – created just as they are needed and destroyed as soon as they are not. However, the risks are not transient, and a cyber threat needs only microseconds to create damage.<br><br>Organizations need the tools and capabilities to monitor and manage this complex multi cloud IT environment in a consistent way. These include<br><br>· An inventory of service components (physical, virtual and software)<br>· Protection for data – classification, encryption, and backup<br>· Vulnerability Management<br>· Network security controls<br>· Identity governance<br>· Management as well as monitoring<br><br>The major cloud services all provide tools to secure and manage their own environment. These are mostly different to the ones used by organizations for their on-premises IT. Organizations mostly don’t have enough people with skills in all the tools for all the environments and so are turning to managed cloud services.</p>
<p>In addition to differences between clouds there are also differences between environments. Managing IaaS starts with managing virtual machines, networks, and storage. Then DevOps is mainly based on microservices and containers, and this adds another layer to be managed and secured. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80746/iaas-tenant-security-controls">This introduces more management tools</a>. Some vendors suggest that the solution customers should adopt is to reengineer everything as microservices. This is hardly practical.<br><br>At the same time new tools have emerged which vendors claim will solve these problems by providing a single pane of glass. These are primarily focussed on cloud with <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/cloud-security-posture-management-tools">Cloud Security Posture Management</a> is being promoted as an answer to the hybrid cloud governance challenge. However, it only provides parts of the solution. Other tools include:<br><br>· CASB – covers SaaS providing an inventory of services and controls over access.<br>· SASE – convergence of SWG, VPN and DNS providing secure access and has absorbed CASB.<br>· CIEM – focus on infrastructure elements providing visibility and control.<br>· CWPP – CNAPP – protection container-based DevOps.<br><br>Business driven IT is no longer about managing static services in a single environment. It must support the challenges of the new dynamic and volatile services, workloads and resources that are delivered through DevOps and exploit multi-cloud and software defined resources.</p>
<p>Dynamic IT needs<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/access-entitlements-multi-cloud-hybrid"> Dynamic Security Management </a>that covers more than just infrastructure and that enforces just in time security and access controls such as least privilege with just in time monitoring, detection, and remediation.<br><br>KuppingerCole call this Dynamic Resource Entitlement and Access Management. This is based on policies rather than static controls; it automates enforcement based on these policies and hence enables governance of dynamic IT.<br><br>For more information on this check out EIC sessions</p>

<p>Yes, it’s been a while since last Dev Pulse. Right now, the sense I get is that everyone in the ecosystem is heads-down and focused on building. The Holochain core team is reviewing the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">initial draft</a> of the Stable Validation milestone, testing the new DHT syncing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1313">algorithm</a>, and integrating an interim <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tx3">networking layer</a> that uses simple TLS-encrypted TCP connections, either direct or through a relay server. Meanwhile, the Holo hosting team is testing and bugfixing Elemental Chat and the hosting infrastructure in preparation for the Longitudinal hApp Testing <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">milestone</a>. The Launcher is getting ready for a new release with a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">very special hApp</a> for developers. And finally, many developers in the ecosystem are busy working on getting their products to a mature state.</p> Three latest releases: maintenance work <p>These releases are mostly about maintenance on build dependencies, automated tests, and continuous integration / release scripts.</p> Holochain 0.0.136 <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130</p> Holochain 0.0.137 <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131</p><p>This release brings documentation edits, as well as an update to the Lair keystore that fixes an issue with spaces in paths (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1349">#1349</a>). (Note: another such <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/issues/90">issue</a> was found yesterday; the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">fix</a> will be in the next Lair release.) <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.137/CHANGELOG.md">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.138 <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131</p><p>Note: the HDK didn’t get a version number bump in this release.</p> AKASHA Conversations: Intentional culture design for moderating <p>The AKASHA Foundation is a think tank dedicated to investigating and supporting what humane social media might look like. This year they’ve started a series of conversations exploring various topics, and in May they invited Neighbourhoods’ Emaline Friedman to share about what it takes to build a community culture that supports its own health. Emaline avoids buzzwords and speaks in pragmatic terms; it’s worth a listen if you’re designing any app with a social/community element! (I reckon that’s pretty much any app nowadays.)</p> Wednesday Workshop: Keyword index <p>This has been the first Wednesday Workshop in a while. It was an effort to address the immediate need of <a href="https://github.com/artbrock/clutter">Clutter</a>, a microblogging hApp: every good microblog, Clutter included, needs searchable hashtags! So this session worked on building a generic keyword indexing module with type-ahead search.</p><p>This module is, of course, something that almost every hApp needs (in the words of one workshop participant, “lots of things” he’s working on could use it).</p><p>The usage is simple: first, you think up a bunch of keyword types for your hApp (for example, `hashtag` or `cashtag` or `category`). Then, when you want to make a DHT entry discoverable, you give the entry’s hash, the keyword type, and a bunch of keywords to the `index_hash_by_keywords` function. And when you want to search, you pass the keyword type and as many keyword prefix characters as you like to the `search_by_keyword_prefix` function, which gives you back a bunch of DHT hashes along with the full matched keyword.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the indexes are built on `Paths` sharded by the keyword type and the first letter of the keyword. This makes it faster to search, and avoids DHT hotspots. If you think your hApp’s DHT is going to have a lot of keywords, you may want to fork the module to shard by the first two, three, or more characters.</p><p>You can find the initial source code in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/keyword-index">holochain-open-dev/keyword-index</a> GitHub repo, and watch the video here:</p> Demo video: Scaffold a hApp in 10 minutes <p>As you may know, Holochain <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-112-new-releases-everywhere/#fosdem-2022-recap">co-hosted</a> the Web3 <a href="https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/web3_infrastructure/">track</a> once again at this year’s FOSDEM open-source conference. A number of people presented on Holochain, but one of the videos I never shared — until today. My colleague just shared this video with me, called Scaffold a hApp in 10 minutes. In it, Guillem Cordoba, an active community member, educator, and hApp developer, demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">Holochain scaffolding GUI</a> to build a basic CRUD app with a generic UI.</p><p>The video is on FOSDEM’s own video hosting platform; you can watch it by clicking on the still image below.</p><a href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2022/D.web3/holochain_scaffolding.webm"></a><p>Cover photo courtesy of The U.S. National Archives via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=15523362">Wikimedia</a></p>

 In today’s data-driven world, enterprises are seeking: 



<p></p>



  Ways to meet the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">demands of their users</a>&nbsp;for safer and more private interactions with their services and the digital world around them.  New methods for simplifying their government regulation compliance efforts for their handling of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>.&nbsp;  



<p><br>As we’ve been discussing in this article series in recent weeks, the Sudo Platform lets enterprise developers integrate digital identities into their applications and build a deeper level of trust with their users by providing them with various digital identity-based capabilities. The platform offers extensive privacy capabilities, from communications to secure browsing to payments, all centered around digital identities. Indeed, the Sudo Platform delivers enterprises the solution they’re looking for through a range of identity, privacy, and cyber safety offerings.</p>



The Sudo Platform.



<p>The diagram above shows the Sudo Platform. At the foundation is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. An enterprise can integrate these hosted services with its own systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations. The hosted services are also integrated into various third-party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains and more. The hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s enterprise customers, completely separating them from other enterprise customers’ data and services, and providing the ability to customize that environment for the enterprise.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services are a set of SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub that allow enterprises to quickly develop applications using the Sudo Platform services. All SDKs and sample app source code are open source so enterprise developers can quickly become productive using the Sudo Platform services.Some enterprises require a faster route to market or may lack the internal expertise to create and deploy applications to end users. For those companies, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This allows us to provide a rapid white-label offering that is very attractive to enterprises who want the fastest time to market.</p>



Sudo Platform capabilities.



 The diagram above shows the current capabilities of the Sudo Platform. The digital identity underpins these capabilities, and they can be grouped like this: 



<p></p>



  Open Communication&nbsp;– Allows a user to interact with any third-party service or user they don’t know. Users can provision phone numbers and email addresses and use SMS/MMS, voice calling and email for communication.  Secure Communication&nbsp;– Delivers end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice calling, video and email. Used when both users in the communication have the same app.  Safe Browsing&nbsp;– A compartmentalized browser experience with ad/tracker blocker and site reputation. Supplemented with VPN capabilities.  Cyber Safety&nbsp;– Safe payments, password management, secure id verification and dark web monitoring.  



<p><br>Next week, in part 3, we’ll explore how we’re enhancing Sudo digital identities with decentralized identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Venerdì 6 maggio 2022 presso la Residenza d’Epoca Villa Miani, a partire dalle ore 18:00 si terrà l’evento organizzato da A.I.O.P Lazio, al quale InfoCert sarà presente come Main Sponsor.</p>



<p>Il Convegno dal titolo “Nuove frontiere in sanità. Finita la pandemia, l’inizio della gestione del PNRR”, sarà strutturato come tavola rotonda, alla quale parteciperanno numerose personalità di spicco provenienti sia dal mondo della Pubblica Amministrazione che della Sanità.</p>



<p>L’evento inizierà con il saluto del Sindaco di Roma Capitale Roberto Gualtieri, seguito poi dal Presidente di HIMSS (Health Information and Management Systems Society) e Advisor dell’organizzazione mondiale della sanità sui temi di sanità digitale Harold (Hal) Wolf; a seguito di ciò avrà inizio la tavola rotonda moderata da Roberta Serdoz, caporedattrice del TgR Lazio.</p>



<p>Prenderanno parte alla round table il Presidente della Regione Calabria Roberto Occhiuto, l’Assessore alla Salute e integrazione Socio-Sanitaria Alessio D’Amato, l’Assessore alle Politiche per la Salute della Regione Emilia Romagna e Coordinatore della Commissione Salute Conferenza delle Regioni Raffaele Donini, il Rettore dell’Università UniCamillus Gianni Profita e il Direttore Generale di AGE.NA.S. Domenico Mantoan. Nell’occasione verrà presentata una ricerca curata da Fidelia Cascini, docente presso l’Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore di Roma. Interverrà alla Cena di Gala il Presidente della Giunta regionale Lazio Nicola Zingaretti.</p>



<p>L’A.I.O.P., è una importante associazione italiana che rappresenta IRCSS e case di cura private, accreditate e non, presenti in tutto il territorio italiano, con l’obiettivo di sviluppare la qualificazione delle strutture associate e di sostenerne la collocazione e l’attività nell’ambito dell’organizzazione sanitaria nazionale.</p>



 Le soluzioni Digital Trust di InfoCert per il mondo Healthcare 



<p>InfoCert contribuisce da anni alla trasformazione digitale del mondo Healthcare realizzando la digitalizzazione dei processi amministrativi e clinici tramite l’uso di firme digitali. Per InfoCert un progetto d’innovazione coinvolge la transazione digitale nel suo complesso. Ecco perché siamo in grado di creare una catena del trust nel pieno rispetto della normativa vigente.</p>



<p>L‘emergenza sanitaria ha prodotto un’enorme spinta verso l’efficientamento della Sanità italiana. InfoCert ha operato al fianco delle strutture Healthcare mediante, ad esempio, la raccolta del Consenso Sanitario per la campagna Vaccinale COVID19 di ASL Roma 1 e la notifica digitale della Comunicazione di Quarantena, sviluppando inoltre nuovi innovativi processi come la raccolta del video consenso informato.</p>

<p>Businesses and organizations use physical credentials like employee badges, driver’s licenses, passports, social security cards, and more to identify people.</p><p>These physical documents act as proof that authenticates who we are and our authority to do what we do — we’re old enough to go to a nightclub; be identified during international travel; apply for a new job after earning a degree.</p><p>However, with increasing digitization, people are required to interact with thousands of businesses online. </p><p>Providing proof of identity in a digital setting involves a slow and difficult verification process and increases the risk associated with data breaches and fraudulent credentials.</p> What Is the Problem? <p>The current system of recreating documents electronically involves creating a digital version of the credential (like a PDF or an XML document).</p><p>The process is pretty simple and can be implemented quite easily — at least in principle.</p><p>But verifying the origin and authenticity of documents presented in these formats is complex. You have to confirm that:</p>  The Issuer Organization effectively issued that credential and has the authority to do so.  The person submitting the credential is its rightful owner.  The credential is valid and not expired or revoked.  <p><br>In many cases, this involves manually contacting the issuing organization.<br><br>To make things worse, it has become very easy to fake or photoshop certificates and documents.</p><p>Over <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">half of all people claiming a new PhD</a> in the United States have a fake degree.</p><p>Also, these methods force organizations to store vast amounts of personal data from their users. And leave users without control over who has access to their personal information, where their documents are stored, and how they are being used.</p><p>This is where verifiable credentials come into the picture, along with data protection systems that help individuals create and share their identities reliably.</p> What Exactly Are Verifiable Credentials, and How Do They Help? <p>In simple terms, verifiable credentials are a digital version of paper-based credentials that people can present to third parties who need them for verification. However, unlike physical credentials or pdfs, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof and instantly verifiable.</p><p>Organizations can issue their degrees, IDs, licenses, etc., as verifiable digital credentials. </p><p>Just like physical documents, people have the ability to store their verifiable credentials within a digital wallet. </p><p>A digital wallet is a digital version of a traditional or physical wallet that people can carry around as a mobile application on their phone, computer, or even a cloud-based server.</p><p>Using verifiable credentials and digital wallets is a safe and convenient alternative to other identity management solutions in the market today. </p><p>The primary reason why verifiable credentials are becoming increasingly popular among people and businesses all over the world is that it checks a lot of boxes when it comes to user requirements and addresses several issues associated with the current identity management system. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials create immediate trust between parties. </p><p>Using Verifiable Credentials, an organization can immediately ascertain if a document is authentic and who issued it. And do so in seconds without contacting the issuer!</p><p>In addition to being inherently digital (something that has become more of a prerequisite today), verifiable credentials are a big step towards supporting data protection.</p><p>Here’s the thing. </p><p>When you share a physical credential or a pdf, you may be disclosing a lot more personal information than is strictly necessary. </p><p>Verifiable credentials enable people to verify their identity and only divulge information that is relevant to the context. </p><p>Physical credentials don’t offer this kind of flexibility.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s easy to forge paper-based credentials.</p> Why Is a Centralized Identity Management System Problematic? <p>Let’s explore this topic with an example — the recent COVID19 vaccination certificate. </p><p>Verifying a paper-based or pdf-based vaccination certificate in a fast-paced environment like at a cricket match or during flight travel is often time-consuming and prone to errors.</p><p>In a digital ecosystem, these vaccination certificates are stored in a centralized database, making them quicker and more convenient when they have to be verified in such scenarios. </p><p>However, a centralized database that stores personal information about millions of people is a <a href="https://cisomag.eccouncil.org/hackers-attack-database-of-indias-covid-19-patients-and-potential-suspects/">goldmine for hackers</a>.</p><p>Leveraging verifiable credentials and blockchain-based decentralized identity management allows people to store and manage their own data. </p><p>They reserve the right to decide how, when, and with whom they want to share their data. </p><p>To address these challenges, the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/travel-pass/">IATA Travel Pass Initiative</a> adopted Verifiable Credentials</p> How Do Verifiable Credentials Work? <p>To understand how verifiable credentials work, you need to know about the key entities involved in the verifiable credentials ecosystem — issuer, holder, and verifier. </p><p>As the name suggests, the issuer is an entity that has the authority to issue verifiable credentials. This could be your college university issuing you a diploma after you finish the course, governmental organizations issuing you a national ID, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>The holder is someone who owns the credential. They store and share the verifiable credential from their digital wallet. </p><p>Lastly, the verifier is the one who validates or authenticates the credential. This could be a hiring company you’ve shared your diploma with. </p><p>But how is the identity verified?</p><p>The issuer issues the verifiable credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key that only the issuer can use. </p><p>When the verifier receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity through a blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.</p><p>One thing to note is that the blockchain doesn’t actually store the users' verifiable credentials. It only stores information that the verifier would need to validate the authenticity of the credential — like the issuer's public cryptographic key that matches the one that signed the credential. </p><p>Using this information, the verifier will determine:</p>  If the issuer has the authority to issue that credential.  If the verifiable credential is still valid (not revoked or expired).  If the credential has been tampered with.   <p>This system is trustless. The verifier no longer has to contact the issuer to confirm the validity of the credential. And the best part is that everything happens in a matter of seconds!</p><p>Let’s understand this entire process with a simple example.</p><p>When you get your driver’s license, the DMV (the issuer) will share their public decentralized identifier (DID) — a globally unique identifier that only the DMV can use — on the blockchain along with a schema that shows what type of information is included in the verifiable credential. </p><p>In this case, the schema outline would look like — name, DL number, DOB, address, etc.</p><p>You will be able to store your driver’s license within your digital wallet and control precisely what you want the verifiers to see. </p><p>If you’re pulled over by a police officer who asks for your driver’s license, you can simply show them the digital signature of the DMV that verifies that you have the authority to drive.</p><p>You don’t have to share additional information like your name or address, a freedom you can’t enjoy with physical credentials. </p><p>Should your license expire, the DMV can either revoke the credential or include an expiration date in the verifiable credential, which will be visible to the policeman since it’s relevant to your right to drive (and that’s exactly what the policeman needs to verify).</p> Reasons to Use Verifiable Credentials.<br>  Verifiable Credentials are Interoperable Across Different Systems. <p>Interoperability is one of the most significant benefits of using verifiable credentials. Businesses can interop verifiable credentials across several different systems. </p><p>You have your vaccination certificate, date of birth proof, and passport as verifiable credentials in your digital wallet. Now, if the airport authority asks you for your credentials, you can collect these digital credentials, create a verifiable presentation with attributes from all of them, and share it.</p><p>The reason for interoperability is because Verifiable Credentials are an open standard by the W3C (the same organization that defined the URL as an open standard). Any system based on the same standard will be able to verify these credentials.</p> Privacy. <p>Lack of privacy is one of the major challenges with the current digital identity management systems. It’s not just hackers you have to worry about; even big tech corporations can monitor your activities online.</p><p>However, this isn’t an issue when you use Verifiable Credentials. The data is encrypted and is only entirely accessible to the holder because of the public-private key encryption system. </p><p>Furthermore, Verifiable Credentials use Selective Disclosure and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. Using the first one, a user can decide only to share parts of a credential. With the second one, users can prove something about themselves without disclosing the data that supports the proof.</p> Meets compliance requirements. <p>Governments worldwide have started to realize the importance of digital security and privacy. Many have been encouraging the use of decentralized identity technologies.</p><p>One major example is the <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/germany-and-spain-and-join-forces-on-the-development-of-a-cross-border-decentralised-digital-identity-ecosystem-1947302">decentralized digital identity ecosystem by Germany and Spain</a>.</p><p>As governments progress in this direction, it’s obvious that they need a system to meet these compliance requirements. </p><p>Verifiable Credentials perfectly fit the bill.</p> Standardization. <p>Verifiable Credentials have a standard that all issuers and verifiers adhere to, called the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard. </p><p>Let’s take an example. </p><p>You have your passport. All countries have agreed to a standard format to their passports.</p><p>It doesn’t matter who issues it; this credential is read and accepted internationally.</p><p>Furthermore, standardization also simplifies building applications and automations to support the credentials.</p> Easy to implement and use. <p>It’s easy for businesses to issue verifiable credentials without writing a single line of code by <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">leveraging platforms like Dock Certs</a>. </p><p>As for the end-user, it has never been easier to access and share their credentials. A friendly UX masks the complications that go on behind the curtain and makes it effortless for them to securely share their credentials with entities all over the world.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Verifiable credentials have a considerable potential to be an integral part of our future and are already being adopted by Govs, Universities, Healthcare, etc. </p><p>People don’t have to depend on centralized and federated identity systems like Facebook and Google that pose such a massive threat to their privacy. </p><p>Instead, they now have the ability to own and control their digital identity with Verifiable Credentials making it a much more secure experience. </p><p>When Verifiable Credentials are paired with tech like blockchain-based decentralized identity, its momentum has been explosive.</p><p>You can <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">sign up to Dock Certs today</a> and leverage the benefits of verifiable credentials and decentralized identities for your business.</p>

<p>Viel wurde geschrieben und berichtet über Self-Sovereign Identity. Kurz SSI, handelt es sich dabei um einen Ansatz, Individuen die Kontrolle über ihre digitalen Identitäten zurückzugeben. Doch so übersichtlich diese Erklärung auch klingen mag, eine Vielzahl von Methoden und Ansätzen im Netz kann auch zu Unübersichtlichkeiten und gar Falschaussagen führen. In diesem Artikel beleuchten wir Themen und einzelne Aussagen im Detail, die in der letzten Zeit in den Medien diskutiert wurden. Dabei untersuchen wir genauer, ob Self-sovereign Identity in bestimmten Fällen Risiken für Datenmissbrauch erhöhen oder reduzieren kann. Wir schließen mit der Kernthese, dass der Missbrauch von persönlichen Daten leider ganz unabhängig von der genutzten digitalen Identität möglich ist – und wie man sich dennoch durch SSI davor schützen kann.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Datenmissbrauch&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom steht hinter besseren Lösungen für digitale Identität.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Wichtigste zuerst: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) allein erhöht nicht das Risiko, dass Daten missbraucht werden. Aufgrund der Architektur eröffnet es Möglichkeiten, die Datensicherheit und Privacy zu erhöhen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das größte Risiko liegt darin, dass die Daten der User an einen Onlinedienst weitergegeben werden und diese dann dort gespeichert werden. Heute kennen wir das alle nur zu gut als Nutzerprofil oder Account. Ab dem Moment, in dem ich meine Daten eingegeben habe, muss ich darauf vertrauen, dass der Dienst seine Datenbank gut schützt und meine Daten sicher vor Angriffen durch Hacker und Identitätsdiebe schützt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Erfahrung zeigt uns leider, dass am Ende oft vor allem die Hacker Erfolg haben und täglich tausende Profile und Accounts in die Hände von Datendieben fallen. Dies kann für die Betroffene ein absoluter Albtraum werden und motiviert uns bei Jolocom, an besseren Lösungen für digitale Identität zu arbeiten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir haben also zwei Möglichkeiten, entweder wir geben den Diensten keine Daten mehr oder wir zwingen sie dazu die Daten besser abzusichern. Am besten wäre es aber natürlich beides zu schaffen, sowohl weniger Daten zu übertragen, und gleichzeitig eine bessere Sicherung der Daten zu schaffen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Login – Kontinuierliches Onboarding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Um weniger Daten bei den Diensten zu speichern und trotzdem deren Angebot voll und ganz nutzen zu können gibt es im SSI Bereich eine großartige Möglichkeit, die dafür sorgt, dass ich meine Daten voll und ganz im Griff habe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Das Konzept nennt sich kontinuierliches Onboarding und bedeutet, dass bei jedem Login die Profildaten neu übertragen werden (im Fall von Car Sharing also z.B. meinen relevanten Führerscheindaten, meine IBAN und Rechnungsadresse). Sobald sich der Benutzer abmeldet (und das Auto wieder abgestellt habe) kann der Dienst dessen Daten löschen und behält für sich nur einen individuellen Code, mit dem er den Nutzer oder die Nutzerin beim nächsten Besuch wiedererkennt. Zugegebenermaßen ist man davon abhängig, dass der Dienst dies Daten wirklich löscht, dafür gibt es aber viele Anreize, denn das Risiko eines Hacking Angriffs mit sdchweren Folgen sinkt enorm. Und nicht zu vergessen, wenn sich bei meinem User etwas ändert (z.B. die Telefonnummer) bekomme ich es durch das Continuous Onboaridng in dem Moment mit in dem er das nächste Mal meinen Service nutzt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mit SSI können Daten mit einem Klick geteilt werden, ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heute wäre der oben beschriebene Prozess des kontinuierlichen Onboarding praktisch unmöglich, da die Daten bei jedem Besuch von Hand eintragen werden müssten oder sogar noch per Video der Führerschein oder Ausweis bestätigt werden müsste. Undenkbar aufwändig und für beide Seiten unattraktiv. Mit SSI können Daten mit einem Klick geteilt werden, ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand. Der Dienst spart durch dieses reduzierte Risiko zudem viel Geld, was noch ein weiterer Grund ist, mit SSI zu arbeiten.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Ganz ohne Regulierung wird es nicht gehen&nbsp;</p>



<p>So gut wir mit SSI dazu beitragen können, dass Dienste keine Daten mehr über uns speichern müssen, ist es keine Garantie, dass sie das nicht tun. Um sicher zu gehen, dass sie nicht mehr Daten als notwendig von uns abfragen, hilft nur Regulierung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Denn in der Situation in der wir als einzelner User mit den Diensten verhandeln, sitzen wir oft am kürzeren Hebel. Wir wollen den Dienst nutzen und der einzige Weg führt über die Akzeptanz ihrer Bedingungen, ob gerechtfertigt oder nicht. In einer digitalen Welt, in der wir auf viele Dienste praktisch nicht verzichten können, gleicht das einer Erpressung. So sind wir dem Datenmissbrauch oft ausgeliefert und müssen mit ansehen, wie wir entweder aus der Gesellschaft ausgeschlossen werden oder unsere Daten für eine Teilhabe am digitalen Leben in die Waagschale geworfen werden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom positioniert sich ausdrücklich gegen Datenhandel und Tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zum Glück gibt es in Europa schon eine sehr vielversprechende Gesetzeslage. Denn die DSGVO (Datenschutzgrundverordnung) setzt klare Grenzen, was ohne gewichtigen Grund von den Usern verlangt werden darf. Zuletzt wurde der Digital Markets Act verabschiedet, der die Rechte gegenüber Diensten nochmals gestärkt hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Es stimmt zwar, dass SSI aus einem liberalen Denken kommt, das heißt aber nicht, dass unsere europäische Version SSI komplett unreguliert sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Muss nur auf die Regulierung gewartet werden?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ganz konkret umsetzen lässt sich eine solche Regulierung für SSI aber auch schon bevor der Gesetzgeber handelt, indem sich die an einem SSI Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure gemeinsame Regeln geben und Mittel festlegen, um sie durchzusetzen. Das ganze nennt sich Trust Framework. In einem SSI Ökosystem kann so beschränkt werden, welche Daten beim User abgefragt werden dürfen und von wem. Der Verifier muss dann klar begründen, was mit diesen Daten geschieht, und ist an das Trust Framework gebunden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Auch wir bei Jolocom arbeiten an diesen Trust Frameworks im Rahmen der Schaufensterprojekte des BMWK und begleiten in Brüssel die Entwicklung von eIDAS 2.0, einer neuen Regulierung, in der ähnliche Fragen aufgegriffen werden. Tatsächlich kann man eIDAS als eine Art europäisches Trust Framework verstehen. Schon heute fällt der elektronische Personalausweis darunter. In Zukunft dann sehr wahrscheinlich auch Self-sovereign Identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Böse gesprochen könnte man sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man seine Daten auf welchem Wege gibt, nicht aber was mit ihnen passiert. Das ist allerdings schon sehr, sehr viel im Vergleich zum Status Quo. Was mit den Daten passiert, ist dann nochmal eine neue Frage und keine technische. Da geht es dann um den Trust Frameworks und die Umsetzung von Policies. Das Ganze muss letztendlich über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt werden. Es stimmt zwar, dass SSI aus einem liberalen Denken kommt, das heißt aber nicht, dass unsere europäische Version SSI komplett unreguliert sein soll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mittelfristig ist jedenfalls davon auszugehen, dass sich nur solche Wallets am Markt behaupten können, die auch in einem Trust Framework zugelassen/zertifiziert sind und entsprechend nur mit solchen Issuern und Verifiern sprechen, die ebenfalls entsprechend zugelassen sind. Das SSI System ist nicht für schlecht gesicherte Datenbanken verantwortlich.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bedeutet Self-sovereign Identity, dass ich alles selbst entscheiden kann?&nbsp; (-&gt; evt auch für den Q&amp;A Artikel geeignet)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Idee, dass ich als User bei SSI die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe wird oft missverstanden. Bei SSI geht es im Kern darum, dass meine Digitalen Identität in meiner Kontrolle liegt, ich also entscheiden kann wem ich meine Daten wann zeige und wofür. Dieser wichtige Grundsatz ist schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allen von 2016 enthalten. Zwar kann ich mit SSI auch Identitätsdaten über mich selbst anlegen und z.B. behaupten Astronaut zu sein. Spätestens in dem Moment, indem ich mit dieser Identität dann eine Raumfähre besteigen will, würde ich aber auffliegen. In der Realität ist es nämlich so, dass wir unsere Identität vor allem aus dem zusammenstellen, was andere über uns sagen. So ist unser Personalausweis nur deswegen so geschätzt, weil er vom Staat ausgestellt wurde und damit eine hoheitliche Autorität meine Identität bestätigt. Ähnlich ist es bei einem Studierendenausweis, der nur dann glaubwürdig ist, wenn er von der Universität ausgestellt wurde.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

By implementing more complex passwords, organizations end up wasting time, money, and resources on password resets while reducing workforce productivity. Secure application login is important, however the initial authentication point for most of the workforce is the laptop, desktop or workstation itself. HYPR provides a simple yet secure login with its passwordless and phishing-resistant MFA solution, which identifies the user at the desktop and makes the front door as secure as possible. As a result, your desktop MFA can be used to seamlessly and safely log into your device, enabling access to applications in real time.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Machine Learning, Edge, and Decentralization to Drive Your Investment Decisions<br>Challenges to the business operating environment are mounting – a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/charting-the-path-to-the-next-normal/risk-abounds-how-ready-are-companies">survey of over 200 executives</a> conducted in 2021 revealed the resilience dimensions most important to their strategy and operations. Digital and technological resilience is rising to the top, just behind financial resilience and operational resilience as being most important to the business across a variety of sectors. Unfortunately, it is not just a matter of threats and vulnerabilities to enterprise systems – although these are many and in constant flux. The competitive and customer demands for flexible digital services contribute to the shifting corporate attention to achieving digital and technological resilience, and the innovation it requires to maintain it. <br><br>There are many paths forward when taking action to stay ahead in this digital and technological innovation race. Some find it helpful to orient their action around concepts like the Composable Enterprise, Privacy-by-Design, Zero Trust, and so on. Whatever your organization chooses to orient its future strategy and direction with, it must be accompanied by action – in other words, the direction your organization chooses to innovate in will have an influence on its investment decisions. <br><br>This post is not a guide, but a place to find inspiration. The technologies and concepts you find here may not directly fit your organization’s targets, but it may trigger the right conversation with your team on how to stay ahead of the curve in your industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine Learning <br>Machine Learning should be thought of as a concept rather than by use case – there are simply too many methods and inputs that could be utilized – classification tasks, regression tasks, focusing on images, words, speech, video, and so on. Therefore, take inspiration from the challenges that organizations are facing – the multiplying volume of data being generated and collected by organizations, the massive amounts of sensitive data that are spread across multiple clouds, the many points of interaction between employees and systems, employees and customers, and customers and systems. &nbsp;<br><br>Cybersecurity will be an important area that is influenced by machine learning. Read this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity">Leadership Brief</a> for an analysis on the scope and challenges of machine learning in cybersecurity, or the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5032">CISO Panel on Securing the Composable Enterprise</a> in May at the EIC. <br><br>Data management and governance is a foundational element of machine learning, but also serves many other purposes in the organization. Data governance supports privacy programs, secures sensitive information and intellectual property during collaboration, and of course is the motor behind preparing and maintaining datasets of corporate data for business intelligence and machine learning projects. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80772/ai-service-clouds">AI Service Clouds</a> can play a role in facilitating good data governance and management throughout the development lifecycle, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80529/next-generation-business-intelligence-platforms">next-generation BI platforms</a> often contain elements of machine learning to deliver recommendations, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5097/1">this session at the EIC</a> considers how to secure the hyper-connected, data-driven world <br><br>Edge <br>The edge expands the horizon of opportunities. This can be device-driven, linked tightly with machine learning that delivers insights from streamed data from and at the edge, or emerge as a defining aspect of cybersecurity architectures. <br><br>IoT usage creates a need for, perhaps even a dependency on edge computing.&nbsp; For more ideas on how to manage this changing reality, check out the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/897">IoT and Hyperconnected Enterprise track at the EIC</a>. Moving servers and services to the edge corresponds with the rise of hybrid cloud infrastructure, as described in the context of<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80773/hybrid-cloud-backup-and-disaster-recovery"> hybrid cloud backup and disaster relief. </a><br><br>The secure access service edge (SASE) stands for a concept that integrates a range of cloud-native security services including cloud access security brokers (CASB), firewall as a service (FWaaS), secure web gateways (SWG), and zero-trust network access (ZTNA), with wide-area network (WAN) capabilities for delivering both directly to any edge computing location. SASE is an enabling concept, that can invite more usage of edge devices and locations while maintaining a secure environment. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an81203/implementing-sase">This Advisory Note</a> gives more context to implementing SASE in the organization. <br><br>Decentralized <br>Relax. Decentralized doesn’t always mean blockchain. The work that is being done on enterprise use of the blockchain is just the initial steps in building interoperability between distributed, independent services while still maintaining security and trust. It is a foundational concept in composable enterprises, the topic of the EIC’s opening keynote. Concepts like the<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5031"> Global Assured Identity Network</a> work on a decentralized concept – supporting assured identity providers utilizing the blockchain, but more importantly supporting many different methods of providing an assured identity for cross-border trust. <br><br>This collection of ideas just barely scratches the surface of innovative technologies being used in the enterprise. Whether your organization’s investment strategy focuses on digitalization, boosting cybersecurity, streamlining processes, or getting involved in industry networks, consider what’s happening on the cutting edge. Join us at the<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022"> EIC in Berlin</a> this May for thought leadership on identity, cloud, and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to deploy a JHipster-based reactive microservice to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You’ll use Azure’s Cosmos DB as a persistent store for one of the services. For security, you’ll use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. You’ll also securely encrypt all secrets in the project configuration files using Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code>. This tutorial focuses on deploying an already generated project to Azure AKS. It does not go into great detail about generating the project. To see how the project was generated using JHipster, take a look at <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

<p>The project has a few different pieces:</p>

 
   JHipster Registry: a Eureka server for service discovery and a Spring Cloud Config server for centralized configuration management 
   Gateway: public Spring Cloud Gateway application using Vue 
   Store: Spring Boot microservice using Azure’s Cosmo DB API for MongoDB 
   Blog: Spring Boot microservice using a Neo4J database 
 

<p></p>

<p>This tutorial has a lot of different technologies in it. I’ve tried to make it as simple and as explicit as possible, but it’s probably helpful to have some basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes before you start.</p>

<p>If you’re already familiar with all the tech in this tutorial, you can skip ahead to the prerequisites section. If not, I’m going to explain them a little before we move on.</p>

 JHipster microservices architecture overview 

<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> is a development platform that streamlines the generation, development, and deployment of both monolithic and microservice applications. It supports a dizzying array of frontend (Angular, React, and Vue) and backend (Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, Node.js, and .NET) technologies. It’s designed to be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, and can easily deploy to all the major cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Heroku, Cloud Foundry, Google Cloud Platform, and OpenShift.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The project in this tutorial uses Spring Boot with Java resource servers and a Vue frontend. It was built with the JHipster generator that quickly scaffolds a new application based on either an interactive shell or a DSL file. You can read more about generating microservices with JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-microservices/">in their docs</a>. One of the slick features of the JHipster generator is that you can generate data entities along with applications.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> that is generated with the microservice includes two important functions: a Eureka server and a Spring Cloud Config server. The Eureka server allows the microservices to dynamically find each other without having to use hard-coded URIs. This means that the microservice can scale and services can be replaced without causing problems. It’s a bit like a phonebook or a DNS service for the microservice. The <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/">Spring Cloud Config</a> server allows project configuration to be centralized and distributed to all of the different services. In this tutorial you’ll use this feature to configure all of the services for Okta OAuth in one place.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/">JHipster API Gateway</a> is the public face of your microservice. All public traffic comes through this service, which also includes the Vue frontend. The gateway is one of three application types that can be created by the JHipster generator DSL. The other two are monolith and microservice. A monolith is a non-microservice application with a single service.</p>

<p>The store service and blog service are both examples of the microservice application type. This means that each service is a Spring Boot resources server with some type of SQL or NoSQL backend.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The generator creates four applications. They are designed to be built and run as docker containers, which makes it easy for them to be packaged in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> pods. Kubernetes is a container orchestrator specifically designed for managing microservice networks. It’s something like Docker Compose but designed for microservices with a lot of great features like service discovery, load balancing, automatic rollouts and restarts, resource management, and storage mounting.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>This tutorial has a lot of pieces. Install the required software below and sign up for an Azure Cloud account. You’ll need a free Okta account, but you can use the Okta CLI to sign up for it later in the tutorial.</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a>: you’ll need to have both Docker Engine and Docker Compose installed (If you install the Docker desktop, this will automatically install both. On Linux, if you install Docker Engine individually, you will have to also <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">install Docker Compose</a>) separately. 
   <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>: you’ll need a Docker Hub to host the docker images so that Azure can pull them. 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>: this tutorial requires Java 11. If you need to manage multiple Java versions, SDKMAN! is a good solution. Check out <a href="https://sdkman.io/installit">their docs to install it</a>. 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: you’ll use Okta to add security to the microservice network. You can register for a free account from the CLI. 
   <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Azure Cloud account</a>: they offer a free-tier account with a $200 credit to start. 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a>: you’ll use the Azure CLI to manage the Kubernetes cluster. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a>: CLI to manage Kubernetes clusters. 
 

<p>If you have never had an Azure account before, you can create a new one that will allow free-tier access and has $200 credit allocated to it. This is more than enough to finish this tutorial. However, the credit does expire after 30 days. If you do not have credit left or your credit has expired, this tutorial should only cost a few dollars if you stop and start the AKS cluster when you are not working on it. You can keep an eye on your costs using the cost explorer in the Azure portal and set alerts if you are concerned about it. Upgrading to pay-as-you-go may also alleviate some resource throttling issues around testing the AKS clusters.</p>

 Spring Boot microservices for Azure and Cosmos DB 

<p>This project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials: <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> and <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. In these tutorials, he builds a reactive Java microservice architecture and shows how to deploy it to Google Cloud (GCP). I have modified the project to work with Azure and Cosmos DB.</p>

<p>You will first run the project using Docker Compose. Once you have this working, you will run the project as a Kubernetes cluster on Azure. My modifications were relatively minor and involved removing the unnecessary MongoDB instances (from both the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and from the Kubernetes descriptors) as well as updating environment values to point the <code>store</code> service to the Cosmos DB instance instead of a MongoDB instance.</p>

<p>Listed briefly, the changes I made from Matt Raible’s posts to make this work with Azure and Cosmos DB are as follows. You can skip this list (and the next section) and go right to cloning the Git repository if you want, but since this documents how to update a JHipster-generated project to use Cosmos DB, I thought it was worth including.</p>

<p>In the <code>docker-compose/docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>

 
   removed the MongoDB service 
   updated the <code>store</code> service property <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> to point to the Cosmos DB instance via a <code>.env</code> file 
   removed the Keycloak service and the environment variables that configured auth to use Keycloak from the remaining services (not strictly necessary but cleaned things up) 
 

<p>In the <code>k8s/store-k8s</code> directory:</p>

 
   removed the <code>store-mongodb.yml</code> file (This creates the MongoDB Kubernetes service that our project does not need.) 
   in <code>store-deployment.yml</code>:
     
       removed the <code>initContainers</code> (The init container waits for the MongoDB instance, which is removed.) 
       updated <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env value of the <code>store-app</code> container to the Cosmos DB URI (This points the store to the Cosmos DB instance.) 
       properly secured the Cosmos DB connection string using Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> 
     
   
 

 Setting the store app’s initial status for Eureka 

<p>Creating this tutorial, I ran into a problem with the store app getting stuck as <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. When I inspected the logs, I found that the service started as <code>UP</code>, quickly went to <code>DOWN</code>, and then <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. Later, it would go back to <code>UP</code> but the Eureka server never registered this change.</p>

<p>There’s an open issue documenting this problem on <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/issues/3941">Spring Cloud Netflix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/issues/1398">Netflix Eureka</a>.</p>

<p>A temporary fix taken from the issue on GitHub is to override the health reporting implementation so that it returns <code>DOWN</code> instead of <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code> while the program is still starting. This blocks it from ever reporting <code>OUT_OF_SERVICE</code>. You can see the fix in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-azure-kubernetes-cosmosdb-example/blob/main/store/src/main/java/com/okta/developer/store/EurekaFix.java"><code>EurekaFix.java</code></a> file in the store app.</p>

 Clone the microservices project from GitHub 

<p>Clone the modified JHipster reactive microservice project from GitHub and checkout the <code>start</code> tag.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-azure-kubernetes-cosmosdb-example.git \
  azure-k8s-cosmosdb
cd azure-k8s-cosmosdb
git fetch --all --tags
git checkout tags/start -b working
</code>   

 Create the Azure Cosmos DB with API for MongoDB 

<p>You need to create an Azure Cosmos DB instance. You can either use the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a> or the CLI to create a new Cosmos DB instance. Make sure you create a one that is Azure Cosmos DB API for MongoDB (Cosmos DB supports various database types). If you use the portal, it’s pretty self-explanatory but don’t forget to enable the free tier and enable a public network.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions for using the CLI.</p>

<p>Log into the Azure CLI using a Bash shell. This will redirect you to a browser to log into the Azure portal.</p>

   <code>az login
</code>   

<p>This should show you the subscriptions for your account.</p>

</code>   

<p>Set the subscription in the shell. Your subscription is probably <code>Azure subscription 1</code>, as that is the default. Make sure you use the subscription that was created when you registered for a free account (or whatever subscription you want if you already have an account).</p>

   <code>az account set --subscription &lt;you-subscription-name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open a Bash shell. Create a resource group with the following command.</p>

   <code>az group create --name australia-east --location australiaeast
</code>   

<p>Create the Cosmos DB account in the resource group. Substitute your Azure subscription name in the command below (it’s probably <code>Azure subscription 1</code>, which is what mine defaulted to).</p>

   <code>az cosmosdb create --name jhipster-cosmosdb --resource-group australia-east \
  --kind MongoDB --subscription &lt;you-subscription-name&gt; --enable-free-tier true \
  --enable-public-network true
</code>   

<p>Once that command returns (it may take a few minutes), it should list a lot of JSON showing properties of the created Cosmos DB account.</p>

<p>If you get an error that says:</p>

   <code>(BadRequest) DNS record for cosmosdb under zone Document is already taken.
</code>   

<p>Then you need to change the <code>--name</code> parameter to something else. Since this is used to generate the public URI for the database it needs to be unique across Azure. Try adding your name or a few random numbers.</p>

<p>I’m using the Australia East location because that was the location that had free tier AKS nodes available when I wrote this tutorial. You can use any resource group you want as long as it allows you to create the AKS cluster later in the tutorial. Even if you can’t use the free tier or the free credits, if you stop and start the AKS cluster between working on the tutorial, the cost should be very small (mine was less than a few dollars). The application should still work if the Cosmos DB database is in a different resource group and region since the database URI is configured to be publicly accessible.</p>

<p>List the connection string for the Cosmos DB API for MongoDB endpoint using the following command. If you changed the database name above, you will need to update it in the command below.</p>

   <code>az cosmosdb keys list --type connection-strings --name jhipster-cosmosdb \
  --resource-group australia-east
</code>   

<p>This will list four connection strings. You need to save (copy and paste somewhere) the first, the primary connection string. (Ellipses have been used for brevity below.)</p>

   <code>{
  "connectionStrings": [
    {
      "connectionString": "mongodb://jhipster-cosmosdb:XBq5KZ81V8hM63KjCOezi1arq...",
      "description": "Primary MongoDB Connection String"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
</code>   

<p>Edit the <code>.env</code> file in the <code>docker-compose</code> subdirectory. Add the following variables to it, substituting your connection string for the placeholder. Make sure the connection string is enclosed in quotes. This value is referenced by the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file and passed to the <code>store</code> service, pointing it to the Cosmos DB MongoDB database.</p>

<p>The <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> will be used as the key for encrypting sensitive values stored in the Spring Cloud Config and used by the JHipster registry. You can put whatever value you want in there. A UUID works well, but any string value will work. The longer, the better.</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/.env</code></p>

 <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGO_URI=&lt;your-connection-string&gt;
ENCRYPT_KEY=&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code> 

 Configure identity with Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Take note of the name because you will need to find the app in the Okta Admin Console and update the redirect URIs a little later. The <code>okta apps</code> command creates a config file named <code>.okta.env</code>. It will look something like the following. It helpfully lists the values you will need in the next step.</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="2989u928u383..."
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="09328uu098u4..."
</code>   

<p>Both the Docker Compose project and the Kubernetes project use Spring Cloud Config to centralize configuration. The JHipster registry service makes these config values available to all of the other services in the cluster.</p>

<p>Open <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> and add the following to the end, filling in the <code>issuer-uri</code>, <code>client-id</code>, and <code>client-secret</code> taken from the <code>.okta.env</code> file. This is the Spring Cloud Config file for the Docker Compose project.</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code></p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

 Build the Docker images and run the app with Docker Compose 

<p>You’re all set to run the app locally using Docker and Docker Compose. You need to build the docker image for each of the projects: <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> (you don’t have to build the <code>registry</code> because it uses an image).</p>

<p>In the three different app directories, run the following Gradle command.</p>

   <code>./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild
</code>   

<p>The default Docker resource settings may not be enough to run this project. You may need to bump them. These settings worked for me.</p>
 
   CPUs: 8 
   Memory: 25 GB 
   Swap: 2 GB 
   Disk image size: 120 GB 
 

<p>Navigate to the <code>docker-compose</code> directory and run the app. You can use the <code>-d</code> param to run it as a daemon but for the moment I like seeing the logs. You’re just running this in Docker Compose as a warm-up for the Azure deployment anyway.</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Give that a minute or two to finish running all the services.</p>

<p>Open the gateway service at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Go to Account and Sign in. You should be directed to the Okta sign-in form.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be able to authenticate with your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure all parts of the application are working. First, test the store (which is using the Cosmos DB Mongo database) by going to Entities and Product. Make sure you can add a new product and see it in the list of products. Next, create a blog (Entities and Blog).</p>

<p>If that works, you can take a look at the Administration menu. There’s a lot of helpful info there.</p>

<p>You can also check the JHipster Registry at <code>http://localhost:8761</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Encrypt the client secret 

<p>Leaving secrets in plain text in repositories is a security risk. There are two values in this app that are sensitive: the Cosmos DB connection string that includes the username and password and the Okta OIDC app client secret. You were able to avoid exposing the database credentials by using a <code>.env</code> file. However, the Okta client secret is exposed as plain text in the Spring Cloud Config file (<code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code>). This can be encrypted using the JHipster registry.</p>

<p>Open the registry (<code>http://localhost:8761</code>) and click on Configuration and Encryption.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Paste your client secret in the text box. Click Encrypt.</p>

<p>This, incidentally, is why you needed the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> property in the <code>.env</code> file.  That’s the key that JHipster registry uses to encrypt these values (so keep it secret!).</p>

<p>You can now copy the encrypted value and paste it back into the <code>application.yml</code> file. Make sure you include the <code>{cipher}</code> part. It should look similar to below. Don’t forget the quotes!</p>

<p><code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code></p>

   <code>...
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: 0oa6ycm987987uy98
            client-secret: "{cipher}88acb434dd088acb434dd088acb434dd0..."
</code>   

<p>Stop the app if you have not already using <code>control-c</code>. Restart it.</p>

   <code>docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Make sure you can still sign into the gateway at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>You may be wondering (like I did initially), why can’t I just put the client secret in the <code>.env</code> file? This doesn’t work because the <code>.env</code> file is processed by Spring Cloud Config and JHipster registry after the container is composed, not by Docker Compose during the container creation, which is when the <code>.env</code> file is processed.</p>

<p>You’re done with the Docker Compose implementation. To clean up, you can run the following command. This will stop and remove the containers, networks, volumes, and images created by <code>docker-compose up</code>.</p>

   <code>docker-compose down --remove-orphans
</code>   

 Create the Azure Kubernetes cluster 

<p>The app works locally. Now it’s time to deploy it to an Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS). The first step is to create an AKS cluster.</p>

<p>It’s super easy to use the CLI to create a cluster. I’ll show you the command below. However, there’s a wrinkle. The free tier cannot create a cluster in many of the regions because of resource quotas. At least, this was the case when I was working on this tutorial. Nor is there an easy way to quickly see what regions will allow you to create a free-tier cluster. This is why I used Australia East as the region–it allowed me to create a free cluster.</p>

<p>If the command below does not work, I suggest going to the Azure portal and creating a Kubernetes cluster there. Select Create a service and Kubernetes Service. You’ll have to select different regions and see what sizes are available (under Node size and Change size) until you find a region that will allow you to create something in the free tier. But hopefully the command will work and you won’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>The size I’m using for this tutorial is <code>Standard B4ms</code> with two nodes. I found that I needed two nodes for the cluster to start properly.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create the AKS cluster.</p>

   <code>az aks create --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo \
  --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys --node-vm-size standard_b4ms
</code>   

<p>This will probably take a few minutes.</p>

<p>As a side note, you can stop the cluster at any point. This will pause billing on the cluster.</p>

   <code>az aks stop --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo 
</code>   

<p>And you can start it again.</p>

   <code>az aks start --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo 
</code>   

<p>You can stop and start the cluster from the Azure portal as well.</p>

<p>The next step is to get the credentials for the cluster and merge them into <code>.kube/config</code> so that <code>kubectl</code> can use them. Use the following command.</p>

   <code>az aks get-credentials --resource-group australia-east --name jhipster-demo
</code>   

<p>You should see output that ends like the following.</p>

   <code>Merged "jhipster-demo" as current context in /home/andrewcarterhughes/.kube/config
</code>   

<p>You should be able to use <code>kubectl</code> to get the node on Azure.</p>

   <code>kubectl get nodes
</code>   

   <code>NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-21657131-vmss000000   Ready    agent   105s   v1.22.6
aks-nodepool1-21657131-vmss000001   Ready    agent   108s   v1.22.6
</code>   

<p>You can also list a lot of information about the cluster in JSON format using:</p>

   <code>az aks list --resource-group australia-east
</code>   

 Configure Kubernetes for Okta and Cosmos DB 

<p>The Kubernetes files in the <code>k8s</code> directory were created with the JHipster Kubernetes sub-generator (<a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">see the docs for info</a>). To see how the original project was generated, take a look at <a>Matt Raible’s JHipster and Kubernetes tutorial</a>. As outlined above, these files were modified to work with Azure Cosmos DB instead of MongoDB in a Kubernetes pod (which is what the sub-generator assumes).</p>

<p>Configure Spring OAuth in the Kubernetes pod by updating <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>. You can use the same values you used above in the Docker Compose section, in <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure you use the encrypted client secret enclosed in quotes with the <code>{cipher}</code> prefix. You’re going to copy both the encryption key and the encrypted client secret from the Docker Compose configuration to avoid having to re-encrypt the client secret with a new key.</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: "{cipher}&lt;encrypted-client-secret&gt;"
</code>   

<p>To configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication, you have to modify <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile. This has already been done for you in the example app in the project Git repository.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>Also in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, update the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> value to use the same encryption key you used above in the Docker Compose section in the <code>.env</code> file.</p>

   <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: &lt;your-encryption-key&gt;
</code>   

<p>To configure the <code>store</code> service to use the Cosmo database, you need to put your connection string in <code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code>.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
  value: "&lt;your-connection-string&gt;"
</code>   

<p>Both the encryption key and the database connection string are sensitive values that need to be encrypted. You’ll see how to do that just a little later in this tutorial.</p>

 Build Docker images and push to Docker Hub 

<p>Previously you built the docker images, but you left them in the local repository. Now you need to upload them to Docker Hub so that Azure AKS can find them. If you haven’t already <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">signed up for a Docker Hub account</a>, please do so now.</p>

<p>In each of the three directories (<code>blog</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>gateway</code>), run the following command. Save your Docker Hub username in a Bash variable as shown below and you can copy and paste the commands and run them in each service directory.</p>

   <code>DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME=&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;
# in blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/blog
# in store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/store
# in gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/gateway
</code>   

<p>To briefly explain what’s happening here, take a look at the blog service’s Kubernetes descriptor file. It defines a container named <code>blog-app</code> that uses the docker image <code>andrewcarterhughes/blog</code>, which is my Docker Hub username and the blog image.</p>

<p><code>k8s/blog-k8s/blog-deployment.yml</code></p>

   <code>containers:
  - name: blog-app
    image: andrewcarterhughes/blog
</code>   

<p>Thus in the <code>k8s</code> directory, each service (store, blog, gateway, and registry) defines a container and a docker image to be run in that container, along with a whole lot of configuration (which is really a lot of what JHipster is bootstrapping for you). The registry does not have a project folder because it uses a stock image that can be pulled directly from the JHipster Docker repository.</p>

<p>To use the images you just created with Kubernetes, do a find and replace in the <code>k8s</code> directory. Replace all instances of <code>andrewcarterhughes</code> with your Docker Hub username (<code>&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>One nice feature of Kubernetes is the ability to define <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/">init containers</a>. These are containers that run before the main container and can be used to create or wait for necessary resources like databases. I noticed while I was debugging things in this app that a lot of the errors happened in the init containers. It’s helpful to know this because if you try and inspect the main container log nothing will be there because the container hasn’t even started yet. You have to check the log for the init container that failed. The Kubernetes management tools that I mention below really come in handy for this.</p>

 Deploy your microservices to Azure AKS 

<p>You can manage a Kubernetes service purely with <code>kubectl</code>. However, there are some pretty helpful tools for monitoring and logging. Both <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">k9s</a> and <a href="https://k8slens.dev/">Kubernetes Lens</a> are great. I recommend installing one or both of these and using them to inspect and monitor your Kubernetes services. They are especially helpful when things go wrong (not that things ever go wrong, I wouldn’t know anything about that, I just heard about it from friends, I swear). Kubernetes Lens is a full-on desktop app that describes itself as a Kubernetes IDE. In comparison, k9s is a lighter-weight, text-based tool.</p>

<p>Open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>k8s</code> subdirectory of the project.</p>

<p>Deploy your microservice architecture to Azure with:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>If you open this file, you’ll see that it creates the namespace and applies the project files. If you do this manually, it’s important that the namespace is created first and that the registry is run before the other services.</p>

   <code>...
suffix=k8s
kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
kubectl apply -f registry-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f blog-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f gateway-${suffix}/
kubectl apply -f store-${suffix}/
...
</code>   

<p>You can check on your pods with the following command. If you’re on the free tier, this may take a few minutes. Using the pay-as-you-go plan, everything was up and running almost immediately for me.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

   <code>NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blog-6896f6dd58-mbjkn                 1/1     Running   0          3m51s
blog-neo4j-0                          1/1     Running   0          3m48s
gateway-7f6d57765f-2fhfb              1/1     Running   0          3m46s
gateway-postgresql-647476b4d5-jdp5c   1/1     Running   0          3m44s
jhipster-registry-0                   1/1     Running   0          3m52s
store-7889695569-k4wkv                1/1     Running   0          3m41s
</code>   

<p>Here’s an example of what this looks like with Kubernetes Lens (the containers were still booting).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Another useful command is <code>describe</code>. I won’t replicate the output here, but if you want more detailed information for debugging, you can also run the following.</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>To tail logs, you can use the name of the pod.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo
</code>   

<p>Although, like I said, k9s and Lens are really the way to go for more detailed inspection.</p>

<p>Here’s a screenshot from k9s. You can dig down into the different pods to get more detailed information and inspect logs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>. You will be redirected to the Okta login screen, after which you will be taken to the registry.</p>

<p>Make sure everything is green. If you have an error, check the logs for the pod that caused the error. You can restart a specific deployment by deleting it and re-applying it. For example, to restart the store, you can use the commands below from the <code>k8s</code> directory.</p>

   <code>kubectl delete -f store-k8s/
kubectl apply -f store-k8s/
</code>   

<p>Once all is good, <code>control-c</code> to stop forwarding the registry. Expose the gateway and open it.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>Authenticate with Okta. Make sure you can add blogs, posts, tags, and products. Because the store service uses the same Cosmos DB instance that you were using with Docker Compose locally, any test products you created earlier will still be there.</p>

<p>In preparation for the next step, delete everything you just deployed to AKS in the <code>demo</code> namespace.</p>

   <code>kubectl delete all --all -n demo
</code>   

<p>The first <code>all</code> refers to all resource types. The second <code>--all</code> refers to every object in the resource types (as opposed to specifying an object name or ID). Thus by specifying the namespace you are deleting every object of every resource type in that namespace.</p>

<p>This is one of the benefits of using a namespace. You can do a delete like this. If you do this from the default namespace, you’ll risk deleting things you didn’t mean to delete or pods added by Kubernetes and Azure for infrastructure administration.</p>

<p>You can also just delete the entire namespace. It will be recreated if you use the Bash script to apply the deployments. This deletes absolutely everything from the namespace but is a little slower. If you do this, you need to make sure that you recreate the namespace later (I’ll remind you).</p>

   <code>kubectl delete namespace demo
</code>   

 Encrypt the sensitive configuration parameters 

<p>There are two really important config values that need to be encrypted: (1) the Cosmos DB connection string (which contains the database credentials) and (2) the OIDC client secret. Because these two values are processed differently, you’re going to use two slightly different methods for encrypting them.</p>

<p>There are three different layers of encryption happening here. I found this a little confusing so I’m going to explain it briefy.</p>

 
   JHipster registry encryption for Spring Cloud Config values (values in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>) 
   Kubernetes “encryption” (obfuscation, really) that moves secrets found in Kubernetes deployment files to base64-encoded secrets files 
   <code>kubeseal</code> which hardens Kubernetes secrets to properly encrypted values 
 

<p>The first above is only for Spring Cloud Config values. The latter two are used to encrypt values in the Kubernetes descriptor files (the other <code>yml</code> files in the <code>k8s</code> directory).</p>

<p>When you use JHipster registry encryption, you have to define an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> value that is used by JHipster to encrypt the secrets. However, because this value is stored in <code>yml</code> files that are going to be committed to a repository, this value must be properly encrypted to ensure the security of the Spring Cloud Config values.</p>

<p>The Cosmos DB connection string (the <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env var) is a Kubernetes deployment value, same as the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>, not a Spring Cloud Config value.</p>

<p>Thus, to harden the OIDC client secret, you must (1) define an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to enable JHipster registry encryption, (2) use JHipster registry to encrypt the client ID and place the encrypted value in the <code>application-configmap.yml</code>, and (3) use Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> to properly encrypt the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>.</p>

<p>Securing the Cosmos DB connection string is the same as the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code>: use Kubernetes secrets and <code>kubeseal</code> to properly encrypt it.</p>

<p>Matt Raible did a great job of explaining secrets management in Kubernetes in his post, <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. He also linked to a lot of great resources. I’m not going to go into much more detail explaining it here. Check his post out for more info.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is install <code>kubeseal</code> into the AKS cluster. You can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">the <code>kubeseal</code> GitHub page</a> for more info.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.17.5/controller.yaml
</code>   

<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>

   <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml
</code>   

<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line, or learn more about <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/#base64-encode-the-client-id-and-client-secret">base64 encoding/decoding</a> in our documentation.</p>

   <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode
</code>   

<p>Put the raw value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.17.5">the release notes</a>.</p>

   <code>brew install kubeseal
</code>   

<p>Encrypt <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> and <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> (the Cosmos DB connect string). Run the following command to do this, replacing the two values with your encryption key and your connection string.</p>

   <code>kubectl create secret generic project-secrets \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='&lt;your-encryption-key&gt;' \
  --from-literal=SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI='&lt;your-connection-string&gt;' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>If you deleted the namespace earlier, you need to create it again (it won’t hurt to run this if you didn’t delete the namespace).</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f namespace.yml
</code>   

<p>Now, use <code>kubeseal</code> to convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>

   <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml
</code>   

<p>Remove the original secrets file and deploy your sealed secrets.</p>

   <code>rm secrets.yml
kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret project-secrets
</code>   

<p>You need to update the <code>yml</code> files to refer to the encrypted values. Add the following env variable to the <code>jhister-registry</code> container in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> (if an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> already exists, replace it).</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: ENCRYPT_KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: ENCRYPT_KEY
</code>   

<p>In <code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code>, change the <code>SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI</code> env variable to use the sealed secret.</p>

   <code>env:
  ...
  - name: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: project-secrets
        key: SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI
</code>   

<p>Deploy the cluster.</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Give the cluster a bit to start. Check it with one of the tools I mentioned or the following:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n demo
</code>   

<p>Once everything is ready, port forward the registry to check the services.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Make sure you can log in and that all the services are green. You should either be automatically logged in and redirected back to the home page or directed to log in with the Okta login screen.</p>

<p>This is the happy dance.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Forward the gateway and test the app.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Log in. Make sure everything works. Kick the tires. Start a blog. Create some products. Influence some people. Restore democracy. Take over the world. Whatever you want.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with everything, you can delete the resource group. This will also delete all the resources in the resource group, including the Cosmos database and the AKS cluster. If you have multiple subscriptions, you may need to add a <code>--subscription</code> param.</p>

   <code>az group delete --name australia-east
</code>   

<p>Wait for this to finish. Once it is done, it’s probably a good idea to log into the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a> and make sure that the AKS cluster, the Cosmos DB instance, and the resource group have been deleted.</p>

 Azure AKS, Kubernetes, and Spring Boot microservices deployed! 

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/juliendubois">Julien Dubois</a> for help getting this tutorial finished!</p>

<p>In this project you saw how to deploy a JHipster microservice to Azure AKS. You saw how you can use a managed Cosmos DB instance in place of a MongoDB pod in Kubernetes. You saw how to deploy the app first with Docker Compose and then later with <code>kubectl</code> and the Azure CLI. Finally, you properly encrypted all of the sensitive configuration values using a combination of JHipster registry encryption, Kubernetes secrets, and <code>kubeseal</code>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the top, this project is based on two of Matt Raible’s tutorials:</p>

 
   <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> 
   <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> 
 

<p>Deepu Sasidharan wrote a tutorial, <a href="https://deepu.tech/deploying-jhipster-microservices-on-azure-kubernetes-service-aks/">Deploying JHipster Microservices on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a>, that was also a big help.</p>

				 <p>I’ve been reminded via my Facebook feed just how heavily influenced we are by our data. Facebook is exceptionally good at showing me what it thinks I want to see. I’m not going to lie, they get it right probably 70% of the time, but I don’t think that’s always a good thing; it brings a lot of negativity to my feed due to the nature of my online activity. Lately, it’s the conspiracy theories surrounding the <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">implementation of digital ID</a> here in my home province of Ontario. Recently, a <a href="https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/governments-must-fight-misinformation-on-digital-id-say-provincial-experts/479608">petition submitted</a> to the Ontario legislature calling for the ban of digital ID garnered 21,000 signatures. I find this so bizarre because digital ID is already here. I’m left wondering if any of those 21,000 folks use Google or Apple pay?&nbsp;</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				 
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>I decided it would be an excellent time to address some of the misinformation head-on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The claims regarding digital ID are:&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 The government will have access to our personal information without our consent and centralize every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social data and assign them an identification under this system. 
  Digital ID will expose your demons, no matter how small, everywhere you go, and abuse by governmental authority in terms of surveillance and compelled behaviour, using access to basic resources as a tool of coercion.&nbsp; 
  Lead to Identity theft. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 1&nbsp; 
<p>The government will have access to our personal information without our consent and centralize every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social data and assign them an identification under this system.</p>
<p>This is not true. The government will only be able to access our information if we provide it to them directly, for example, if we use our digital ID to access government services. Every citizen’s personal, financial, business, medical and social information is already centralized. Your Driver’s License and Passport are not your property, and your unique identifier is your social insurance number. The government issues those credentials, and they remain their property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations like Google and Facebook hold your information in a centralized manner and make money off of it. We allow them to claim our data as their asset and make money off of it. When we decentralize, we take back ownership of our credentials and identity. We will be able to choose what we share and with whom, and we will have the ability to monetize our identity, just like Facebook and Google currently do.</p>
<p>Canadians in the private sector, not the government, were instrumental in the early days of SSI development. At this point, the Canadian government has no choice but to jump in and build our governance framework and align us with other countries leading to protect their citizens’ rights. For example, they are working with the European Union Framework, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 2 
<p>Digital ID will expose your demons, no matter how small, everywhere you go. You name it; the ID will show it. Opens up abuse of governmental authority in terms of surveillance and compelled behaviour, using access to basic resources as a tool of coercion.</p>
<p>Again, this is not true. Digital ID will only expose your demons if you share them…</p>
<p>We are being abused by organizations like Google and Facebook, <a href="https://www.toronto.com/news/how-do-tech-giants-like-google-and-facebook-get-and-use-your-personal-data/article_73b7cfe5-4360-5123-8769-471460c9dc85.html">monetizing our identities</a>. Instagram, TikTok etc. it’s all there for everyone to see. When you pay with your phone’s wallet app, data is stored and collected on your spending habits. Police officers can look up your info with your driver’s license, and Google tracks your internet and location history, regardless of your settings. The list goes on and on. With a self-sovereign identity, you can control your data and what information you share with appropriate entities. SSI allows for seamless authentication and reduces the need for repeated submission of individual verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>The government will only be able to track our movements and activities if we provide them with this information ourselves, for example, by using our digital ID to access transportation services. Your verifiable credentials will not “talk” to each other. Only someone with the appropriate verifiable credential of their own can access your data (credentials) unless you choose to share your credentials with someone else.</p>
<p>So yes, your digital ID (wallet) can undoubtedly hold all of these credentials, but that’s all they are: individual verifiable credentials. They don’t “talk” to each other per se, and only someone with the authority credential, like a police officer, can see your driving infractions or criminal record.</p>
<p>If you are behind on child support, the Family Responsibility Office can get Canada Revenue Agency to garnish your tax account or the Ministry of Transportation to suspend your driver’s license. You’re already “punished” for lousy behaviour that likely won’t change. What will stay the same is only the person with the proper credentials can access your data. So while your “bad” behaviours will ultimately merge with your digital identity, a prospective employer or bank employee would not have the proper credentials to access those specific credentials within your digital wallet. SSI is our best defence against the possibility of a surveillance state as the credentials are shared without the Issuer knowing – and they can’t know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Identity Conspiracies: Myth 3 
<p>Digital ID will lead to identity theft.</p>
<p>Once again, this is a baseless claim that has no basis in reality. Digital ID will make identity theft far more complex as it provides a more secure and confidential identification method. The very nature of <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/156591609?dnt=1&amp;html5=1&amp;title=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=0">Blockchain technology</a> makes them immune to cyber-crimes since all the copies stored across the network would need to be attacked simultaneously for the attack to be successful. This system will be much more secure than traditional authentication methods, such as username and password. Your personal information will be encrypted and only accessible to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Taking Back Your Rights 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many ways that adopting a self-sovereign identity can reduce costs, cut out waste and provide better security and control. Here are a few simple ways it could help you out:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
 If you’re a small business, you can use the verifiable credentials to get validated and listed on directories like Google Maps or Yelp. People find your business more quickly, and it can also help you rank higher in search results. 
 If you’re looking for a job, you can use the verifiable credential to prove your identity and qualifications to potential employers. You make the hiring process easier and faster since the employer can verify your information without contacting third parties. 
 If you want to apply for a loan, you can share your credit history with the lender. They will be able to verify that the information is correct without having access to anything more personal information than they require. 
 If you’re a student, you can use verifiable credentials to prove that you’ve completed your education or training, helping you make it easier to get into college or find a job in your field. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Self-sovereign identity is vital because it gives individuals control over their data; it is essential in an era where data breaches are becoming more common. Adopting a self-sovereign identity will allow users to take ownership and ensure that their data is safe and secure.</p>
<p>The only ones who will benefit from your digital ID are the Issuer (who gave you the credential), holder (you) and verifier (who you’re sharing it with). As the holder, you’ll have an opportunity to control, and perhaps even monetize your data with the verifier, say Facebook. You can choose to share as much or as little information as you want with the verifier, and you can also revoke access to your credentials at any time.</p>
<p>It’s hard to say what the future of SSI holds, but it’s important to remember that digital ID is all about taking back your rights, not surrendering them. It is about authentication, authorization and privacy. The trust economy of SSI is based on these foundations. As more and more people understand the value of SSI, its use will continue to grow. It’s imperative that people from diverse backgrounds and women, in particular, get involved.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a project that can help ensure the future of digital ID, consider supporting the development of SSI. You can help by joining groups like Women in Identity, spreading the word about this critical technology and advocating for its adoption.

<p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary. We recently posted a Sign-In with Ethereum-specific April recap that can be found here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-digest-april/">  Sign-In with Ethereum Digest - April  Sign-In with Ethereum offers a new self-custodial option for users who wish to assume more control and responsibility over their own digital identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using a Web3 wallet.</p>  Cryptoscript: added support for JSON templated REST queries as script input, including documentation, test methods, and verbose errors (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/cryptoscript/pull/2">cryptoscript#2</a>)  The capability subsystem is implemented, providing a registry of delegations, invocations, and revocations (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/99">kepler#99</a>).  Simplified Kepler SDK PR merged (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/35">kepler-sdk#35</a>), and added an example dapp to show how to use it (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/37">kepler-sdk#37</a>).  Simplified Kepler HTTP API to a single endpoint for invocation (of any action) and a single endpoint for delegation (of any action) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler-sdk/pull/38">kepler-sdk#38</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/107">kepler#107</a>).  Remote backend storage is now supported using S3 and DynamoDB (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/96">kepler#96</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/106">kepler#106</a>).  Prometheus metrics were added (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/110">kepler#110</a>), and work is underway to implement tracing and further metrics.  Work is underway to unify authentication in Kepler by supporting a single capability representation and adding translation functionality to the SDK.  <p>SpruceID</p><p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> DIDKit   Added StatusList2021 implementation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/278">ssi#278</a>).  Auto-generate PRs to update bundled context files (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/421">ssi#421</a>).  Add zCap context files; update other context files (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/419">ssi#419</a>).  Allow RSA key lengths greater than 2048 with JsonWebSignature2020 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/423">ssi#423</a>).  Improve did:onion configuration (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/pull/292">didkit#292</a>).   <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Through SpruceID and Kepler, Spruce provides an ecosystem of open source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

				  Maturity and universality are now the goals  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:ken@indicio.tech">Ken Ebert</a></p>
<p>Since the launch of Indicio two years ago, we have focused on identifying and filling in the gaps in decentralized identity technology that limited its functionality. Launching an open-source <a href="https://indicio.tech/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">mobile agent</a> and developing <a href="https://indicio.tech/trust-registry-or-machine-readable-governance/">machine-readable governance</a> were critical to delivering real-world solutions. As we saw how these solutions worked to solve problems, we came to understand how these components worked in concert to deliver what we now call a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. A Trusted Digital Ecosystem is our shorthand for the simultaneous impact of decentralized identity technology on authentication, communication, governance, privacy, and security.</p>
<p>A Trusted Digital Ecosystem can be simple—indeed, as we advise our customers, it’s always better to start by solving the simplest use case first, see how the technology works, and then expand. Therefore, having a core set of interoperable components is essential. They can be arranged to manage increasingly complex interactions in any kind of informational ecosystem, and to facilitate interaction across ecosystems.</p>
<p>Technology stack: From basic to universal<br>Our <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5">new</a><a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/accesswire/technology-business-4dbf651613d76693bc479321f7b041f5"> funding</a> will be used to refine the open-source, decentralized-identity technology stack. We have the basic technology for a functional ecosystem, now we improve that functionality by adding all the features, user interfaces, and management tools that make it easier to deploy, use, and monitor. We will add new <a href="https://indicio.tech/careers/">engineering team</a> members to help design, implement, and test this new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These engineering efforts will synergize with Indicio’s future technology roadmap which will focus on expanding the adoption of Trusted Digital Ecosystems in the marketplace. Our goal is for Trusted Digital Ecosystems to serve as complete solutions in many vertical markets and to be as easy to deploy as they are easy to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing our open-source community support<br>The new funding will also enable us to continue and extend our work with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-british-columbia-code-with-us-challenge-to-upgrade-hyperledger-indy/">open-source community</a> by providing leadership to working groups, code maintenance and review, and our own direct code contributions. We see open source as the key to both expanding decentralized identity and to continued innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, and following on our successful training workshops for the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-leads-hyperledger-foundation-community-training/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, we believe that ongoing education is critical. We have created the most comprehensive, hands-on training available in decentralized identity, whether in the basics or in the more technical aspects of the stack, and we will continue to refine these offerings—as well as develop new courses focused on how to implement complete solutions.</p>
<p>Indicio has also pioneered <a href="https://indicio.tech/cardeas-second-interop-a-thon/">“interop-a-thon”</a> events, where companies and organizations come together to test their products and solutions for interoperability. With two interop-a-thons under our belt (hosted through the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project </a>at Linux Foundation Public Health), we are more certain than ever of their importance to finding glitches, spurring adoption of standardized protocols, and fostering confidence in the technology.</p>
<p>Interop-a-thons also provide a chance to see the future potential of verifiable credential systems that are <a href="https://indicio.tech/when-it-comes-to-decentralized-identity-sell-solutions-not-rules/">interoperable</a>, where, for example, a credential issued by a government can be used in a wide variety of contexts and thereby gain in value to issuers, users, and verifiers alike. It’s one thing to claim this as a possibility; it’s another to see it happen.</p>
<p>We will devote more resources in the coming year to interop-a-thons because they are one of the clearest ways of visualizing the value of decentralized identity as a network of networks—and the clearest way to accelerate this happening.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>The Log4j vulnerability, was first detected in December 2021. Log4j is an open-source Java library that is widely used by developers to monitor apps and captures logs. Cybersecurity experts classified it as a <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">critical severity</a> due to its vulnerability to remote code execution (RCE) attacks, local code execution (LCE) attacks, and information leakage. Millions of attack attempts exploiting this vulnerability were <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/12/13/the-numbers-behind-a-cyber-pandemic-detailed-dive/">reported</a>. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">Microsoft</a> identified a group of attackers from China that used this weakness as a back door to inflict organizations with Nightsky ransomware. Due to being open-source and easy to use, Log4j is used in a wide range of software, and some organizations were initially unaware of its presence within their software infrastructure. This vulnerability usually comes in via third party software. Organizations commonly don’t monitor the libraries and external components (such as Log4j) used by third party software and thus were uncertain about the extent of cyber risk exposure for their organizations.<br><br>Patch releases<br>In the past 4 months, Apache has released a series of patches to counter this issue. Upgrading to the latest patch 2.17 is the straightforward measure to protect against this software vulnerability. Users without the latest patches are still exposed to getting attacked by cyber criminals. However, even after patching, an organization could have already been compromised by this attack. The good news is that, with Log4j being a logging library, there is a good chance of the attacker having left traces behind in the log. There are other measures that could be taken, such as restricting outgoing internet traffic, but this is rarely a viable and surely not a long-term solution.<br><br>Additional measures<br>Aside of installing patches, an important step is to monitor the activities of your software. Log4j is used only to log activity and events. There should be no further activities such as the Log4j process trying to access other systems. Monitoring changes in behavior of the software using the Log4j library is an option for identifying malicious behavior. For instance, Amazon Web Services (AWS) released patches to track and patch the vulnerable applications. These patches were found vulnerable to be manipulated by existing malicious containers on the system to elevate their privileges and take over the host or execute code remotely. This further emphasizes the need for monitoring after installing patches.<br><br>Additionally, Log4j scanners can be implemented to identify systems that are still vulnerable by the Log4j threat. However, it must not be the only solution, as some of these scanners have <a href="https://www.msspalert.com/cybersecurity-news/log4j-vulnerability-scanners-and-detection-tools-list-for-mssps-and-threat-hunters/">reported</a> false positive results.<br><br>Conclusion<br>If there are systems which are unpatched, this threat will continue to exist. The solution is to patch and stay alert, but to also have a solid cyber security and cyber resilience plan in place which can identify and stop attacks ideally even before these occur.<br><br>European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference 2022<br>For a deeper dive into cybersecurity topics and to help your organizations to develop more resilient cybersecurity and identity management architectures, KuppingerCole offers content in a variety of formats, including live events such as the 2022 KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud (EIC) conference</a> taking place in Berlin and online in May.<br> The agenda for the conference includes keynote presentations on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5036">dynamic authorization on zero trust architecture, promoting cyber resilience through identity and zero trust</a> and many panel discussions and presentations from experts on latest cyber security, identity management and digital transformation topics.<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/blog/prepare-prevent-and-protect">Related research Blog Post: Prepare, Prevent and Protect</a><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80801/responding-to-critical-software-vulnerabilities">Leadership Brief: Responding to Critical Software Vulnerabilities </a><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80802/prepare-and-protect-against-software-vulnerabilities">Leadership Brief: Prepare and Protect against Software Vulnerabilities </a></p>

			  Radka Tocikova is Human Resource Manager at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Radka, I’m from Slovakia where I studied International Relations at the Economic University of Bratislava. After my Erasmus studies in Paris, I lived abroad in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Monaco where I am now. At Tokeny I do what I love and I’m aware it’s a big chance. Taking care of people, challenging&nbsp;them, finding ways to push some of them out of their comfort zone, listening to them, trying to improve the collaboration &amp; the use of the collective intelligence (to name a few of my responsibilities). Interviewing new candidates and assessing who would be the best fit is another very challenging part of the job and a huge responsibility. A CV and a 30 min chat is never enough to really appreciate someone’s potential. I met some amazing talents and I would like to thank everyone who applied.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I knew the project from its very beginning, I was a close follower and a fan. However, I must admit that when I spoke with Luc, our CEO, about help with administration, partnership agreements and recruitments, I thought it was for a few months. It’s been almost 4 years now, I fell in love with the team, I have great colleagues, my work matters, our project is so innovative and disruptive, and we still have so much to achieve and build together. I am delighted with all these challenges ahead of us.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>We learn, we try, we fail, we argue, we discuss, we laugh, we adapt, we do, we celebrate, and then repeat. I really enjoy working in such an international environment. The remote and the hybrid are here to stay, something we’ve embraced since the very beginning. Being flexible and being able to adapt to the needs of our team members is also a plus. What’s really common about Tokeny is that everyone is friendly and open-minded. And you can say what you have to say. We’ve weathered the storms, the sea isn’t always flat, but everyone on board knows we’re heading in the right direction and I hope we continue to have fun on our way!</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I am passionate about life itself, its purpose, its meaning, even its futility. I love Contemporary Art because it not only reflects but also questions life. I’m an epicurean, with a slight preference for fusion cuisine with umami in it. I’ve traveled a lot, which has helped me understand myself better. And books..I like to read books. Music, cultural events, exhibitions, theater, innovation technologies, blockchain potential, AI, neuroscience, personal development are all topics that trigger my interest. My passion peaks especially when I have a mix of the above, like immersive art or a VR team building escape room.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Hakuna Matata! And never stop dreaming…</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>War, global warming, poverty, abuse, discrimination, disease. There are too many injustices in this world I would like to change, not easy to pick one of them. If I could, I would erase the suffering of children.</p>
<p>For me, changing the world means changing myself at first. Therefore, that is my main objective, and at the same time that is what I can do. Being the best possible version of myself and having a positive impact around me. (Ok, ok, work in progress ;-))</p>
